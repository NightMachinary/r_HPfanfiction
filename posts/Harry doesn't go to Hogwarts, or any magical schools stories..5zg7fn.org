So...I'm on a strange kick.

I'm looking for stories where Harry doesn't get a magical education.

*** It's great story and I loved it. But a point of criticism: I feel it kinda goes into tad unrealistic OP Harry who seems to learn magic way too fast and too much.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** linkffn(10937871) This isn't a complete isolationist Harry that you may be looking for, but Harry doesn't receive any formal magical education. Fair warning though, there is a heavy amount of magic involved in this story.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

**** I don't recall much romance at all, fairly certain it takes a best friends/research partners sort of angle.
