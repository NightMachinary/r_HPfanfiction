I probably blame HPMOR, but virtually in all HP fanfiction goblins are really strict, pragmatic and completely immune to regular human politeness (greetings, introductions, shaking hands).

Is it canonical or just fanon (and all it's all HPMoR fault, as always)?


** The books show that goblins (those who work as Gringotts employees, that is) are actually quite polite towards their customers when they don't try to steal inside their banks or when goblin-made artefacts aren't on the table.

** Canon doesn't really go into details about the goblins, here's pretty much everything we know about them:

- While visiting Gringott (as a client), all the Goblins Harry met were perfectly polite, though in a "customer service" manner. We don't know if Goblins act the same between them or if they "put a show" for their Wizard customers.
- Griphook, the only Goblin Harry met outside of Gringott is bitter and distrustful toward wizards. But we don't know if he always felt like this or if this is a new sentiment after his treatment at Malfoy Manor (though the discussion he had with Dean Thomas, Ted Tonk and another wizard seem to indicate he always felt some kind of disdain).
- We also don't know if Griphook sentiment is only his, or if it is shared by the Goblin race as a whole. But the impressive number of Goblin rebellions in Magical History seem to indicate that, at least until recently, he was far from alone.
- In Goblin Culture, at item belongs to his maker who only "lease" it to his customers. Because of this, "Goblin made heilooms" are a touchy subject for them, and they feel like wizard are stealing for them when they don't bring an item back after the death of his bearer.
- Even after working with Gringott for years, and being pretty "close" to some Goblin, Bill Weasley is not sure if he could even call them friend. So we can deduce that, no matter how close a wizard and a goblin will be, they will be come kind of distant because of their races and their shared history.

So yes, "Goblin culture" (outside of Goblin made items ownership) is a pure fanon concept. It became a fanfiction trope because people saw this in a story, liked it and decided to use it in their own story. It's not impossible that HPMoR created this trope, but the "culprit" may also be an older fic that we don't know about.

** I think that they are not I'll mannered but there is bitterness in them, especially towards humans. For, firstly they are firstly a warrior race. The wizards and witches forced them to settle down and act in contrast to their true nature.

Secondly, from their view point the Humans are half breeds or half bloods. I mean humans can be both magical as well as non magical. However, a goblin is always non magical.

Thirdly, they are a proud race. However, the way they are treated is something to despise. An average pureblood wizard always treats a goblin as inferior. (Yes, even an average wizard, like a shop owner in diagon alley. However, it isn't that obvious because this superiority is mainly due to common stereotypes and prejudices)

Fourtly, there have been numerous goblin wars. I mean, look at Binns. He taught them Goblin wars for 5 years!! Remember that all he does is drone on about the topic and doesn't care for the students. So the amount of topics he must cover, if anybody cares, is massively more than a normal teacher. And one can believe that these wars were due to goblins who revolted as wizards already had them in their control.

Fifth, they were not allowed magic. They can of course perform magic, but they are not allowed wands. Remember how difficult it is to do wand less magic, and even if goblin magic is different, it would still be impossible for a goblin to do everyday things using it. For example, look at Dumbledore. Although he can use wand less magic, he still prefers using a wand to it. (PS., wand less magic is seriously underhyped in Fanfiction)

However, with all these above points, we must remember that goblins aren't angels with crooked teeth. They are sneaky and are always looking for a way to gain something. If Wizards were to follow someone unfamiliar to the wizarding world, like Hermione, then that ofcourse would be disastrous because Hermione would do her best to make every race feel equal, which would seriously instabilize Wizarding Britain.

** They are perfectly polite to everyone unless you try to steal from their vaults, which tbh I would be angry too if someone tried to steal from my bank. I believe Griphook became angry at humans due to his treatment in Malfoy manor.

Edit: also those "goblins are nice to Harry(Hadrian) just because he was nice to them" fics are complete bull shit
