In the story death gives the wand, the stone and the cloak. Death expected to get these items back when the three brothers died. Unfortunately the wand was stolen, the stone hidden and the cloak passed on. Generations later death still doesn't have his shit back. The wand keeps giving it's allegiance to a new master before the old one dies. The stone has been lost and those damn Potters keep passing the cloak down from father to son. Death decides to have the last laugh. When James and Lily decide to have a child death merges a small part of himself with the child's soul making him a demigod of death. The deathly hallows will be drawn to this demigod and death will get his shit back. Then that bitch fate has to go and stick her nose in with a damn prophecy.


** I was just talking about the Hollows in another thread...

I like the interpretation that the Cloak makes you Unkillable on purpose. You can't be killed, no matter what, until you pass it on to a legitimate heir. You can't trick Death, it must be an heir Death would accept as legitimate. However, soon after you pass it on, you die; Death catches up to you in no time flat.

This would mean, that to become the ‘Master of Death', you must be a Peverell by blood. Specifically a direct descendant of that oh-so-clever youngest brother. You must also have been allowed to be the Master of the Cloak at the time of it being given to you by an ancestor of yours. It can skip a generation or a hundred, that's fine, but you Must be allowed it by Death. And should you manage to bring together all the hollows, you'll get to keep that Unkillablity forever. Unfortunately for you, when Death says “forever”, Death means that the Heat-Death of the Universe is too soon for you to die.

This means, all that fighting over the Hollows is just human stupidity. None of them can Ever master them all. This also means, that, if you get perfect memory out of the deal, life will eventually become meaningless. Even if they can visit, how many loved ones are you prepared to lose? A hundred? A thousand? A million? A billion? All that and more, and you'll remember them all...

X---x---x----

How would you like Wandless Magic, a Phoenix Animagus Form, and Perpetual Unkillability. How about if I throw in magic that defends you automatically, the ability to call back souls of the dead and control the dead, and perfect memory/shapeshifting/speak any language? All you need is to be a Peverell/Potter, find a fancy Stone, and steal a knotty Wand. Oh, did I mention that there's no take-backs? Once you're the MoD, Death will never let you go.

There will either be no MoD, or one that Death chose. It is a Curse, not a prize. No wonder Ignotus refused to pass it on until he'd spent 60 years trying to get rid of it, and the Potters spent close to 800 more trying everything they could think of. But it was all for nought, and Death has finally gotten what he wanted. A human he can play with, forever.

  Cordelia is the Master of Death and has been for quite some time. The only problem is that she doesn't particularly enjoy being an Eldritch Abomination. What's a girl to do when you have no interest in the role forced upon you? Run like hell perhaps. And hope to Merlin and God and all else that's holy that maybe, just maybe, one day you might get lucky...and find a way out.

** I love the swearing in this post. It just makes it hysterical to me, and yes, I know, I'm very immature to be entertained by swearing. But come on! When do you hear the sentence, "then that *female dog* fate has to go and stick her nose in with a dang prophecy"
