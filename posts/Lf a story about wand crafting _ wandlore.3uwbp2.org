Are there any fics out there where when Voldemort goes after the elder wand / deathly hallows, Harry then goes after some other kind of wand or objects that are like the equal and opposite of the hallows. Or maybe something where Harry learns about wand crafting and then has to go on some kind of quest to get the right materials to create a wand equal to the elder wand. If there are none like this out there, if anyone is interested you can take these ideas to write one.


** I am not currently writing a fanfiction on this, OP, but I am currently compiling an online encyclopedia on my blog about different wand wood/wand core combinations on my Tumblr blog.

As far as wand materials go, each combination has its own strengths and weaknesses. However, rowan wood is noted on Pottermore to be a "foil" (equalizer) to elder wood, and those with wands made of rowan and elder tend to be "attracted" to one another. I also wrote a short fiction piece on this, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/384q7s/the_new_and_improved_tales_of_beedle_the_bard/]["Rowan and Elder"]], explaining the origins of why this is.

I am writing an Elder wand analysis for a Ravenclaw at the moment, INTJ on the MBTI scale (the same MBTI type as Lord Voldemort). That will be added to the tag below shortly.

Harry makes his own wand (and many other magical foci) in Deal with a Devil, but the story doesn't revolve around wandlore so it might not be quite what you're looking for.

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash

** linkffn(The Arithmancer) has Hermione reverse-engineering wands, though that's a side project.

linkffn(The Wand Maker by darkrose0510) has intuitive understanding of wands be a rare inborn talent, and, IIRC, it deals with the wizarding society affected by Gregorovich's and Ollivander's deaths.

  Michelle is a bit of an oddball with a habit of being late, a hobby of collecting random things, and a gift for finding customers just the right book at the bookstore she works at. Then, after messing about with a rose cutting and a pretty feather, she receives a visit that changes her life, and the world. Set in the present time, a one-shot that both follows and ignores the books.

** Not exactly what you were looking for, but it is focused on wand craft. It's not very long either.
