:END:
Ok this is an odd one but I remembered it the other day and I'd love to read it again but cant remember the name.

Harry is in a harem relationship with many women as well as Moaning Myrtle and Helena Ravenclaw... but they have somehow become pregnant and wear these necklaces that fool their bodies into thinking they're alive to carry the babies to term.

Is this ringing any bells for anyone?

** ...I'll echo the others: what the /fuck/?

Though, morbid curiosity has set in: the, ah, unique? idea of a knocked-up Grey Lady is interesting because it's something I've not seen before in fanfic.

I mean, when I first read the title, I thought, "oh, a pregnant woman died or was murdered and she's hanging around as a ghost, still carrying".

Nope, straight up ghost shagging.

******* In that universe wizards and witches bond on a magical level and harry bonds a ton of witches because Dumbledore wanted to make them all mindless slaves or similar, but Sirius gets some help to save harry from doing that.

Harry ends up bonded to hundreds of witches.its pretty crazy

It's a three story series but it gets a bit crazy in the 2nd and 3rd story. It's by Rotaryfile I think.
