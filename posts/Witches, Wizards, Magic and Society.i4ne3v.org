  Please note that is a Hit wizard: “A Hit Wizard or Hit Witch was a member of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad that were trained to deal with highly dangerous combat situations, such as high-risk arrests, riot controls and presumably, hostage situations. As such they were the Wizarding Britain's equivalent of specialist firearms officers.” Source: Harry Potter.fandom.com

This is the perfect example of why you have to be very careful with HP Wiki (beyond their incredibly wide definition of canon, which includes e.g. movie props). The only thing in the books we know about Hit Wizards is that Fudge thinks they would have been used to apprehend Sirius once he was cornered. An HP wiki contributor has decided to insert their interpretation of that statement and speculation into the wiki as if it were fact.

From a Doylist perspective, I think it's clear that Hit Wizards are the same as Aurors and JKR just changed her mind about what they would be called.

From the Watsonian POV, you can still go with that - a specific job may have many different names IRL - but personally I prefer to keep them separate.

So I have Aurors as the elite of the elite, specialists in combat/tracking/infiltration/concealment; they work alone and there's only a dozen of them in the whole country.

Then I have Hit Wizards as the closest thing the Ministry has to an army: much less skilled, but capable of brute force especially when acting in groups.

If an Auror catches up to you, you're faced with a duel of high-level magic. If Hit Wizards catch up with you, you're going to be faced with a barrage of blasting curses: simple magic, but powerfully executed and in volume.

So if Harry were a Hit-Wizard, I see him training in just three pieces of magic: the Blasting Curse, the Shield Charm, and Apparition. By focusing on just 3 pieces of magic, Hit Wizards can get /really/ good at them. The rest of the training would focus teamwork/tactics.

(To be clear, however, I still think Hit Wizards would just run smack into a wall if they e.g. tried to take down Voldemort, who can probably just shield all their spells then kill them all with a single wave of his wand).

As for Unspeakables, I think it's absolutely clear in canon that they are researchers of the mysteries of magic.

*** I mostly agree with you, though I think Hit Wizards would specialise in stunning charms, rather than blasting curses. It just seems more in line with the ministry to have a stun before you kill policy, the ministry wizards in Ootp even tried stunning Hagrid despite him being known by then to be a half-giant and McGonagall complaining was quickly met by four stunning charms to the chest, which according to Pomfrey is potentially lethal.

**** I agree. The blasting spells we see in canon don't seem that efficacious anyway.

The most successful one hit five people with no shield charms point-blank and only killed one person and disarmed a few.

*** Ok thanks Well I do know that the stuff about the unspeakable is not exactly cannon but I don't care. About the Auror well I am not sure. But why would Rob and Harry then be Auror if they haven't finished school. I mean there probably died many of them at the Hogwarts battle and stuff but why let people who didn't even attend there last year of school be the elite of the elite then. Yes they lived to tell the tale. But I still they did not have a year of school and did not take the final test.

**** Because the Auror Office really lacked manpower after the war, they couldn't really do the usual process of just hiring somebody every couple of years.

****** I am not sure, there aren't that many great magical schools and Hogwarts alone takes a long to produce a single wizard talented enough to be an auror, the ones in other countries probably rather join their own ministry.

Taking People like Harry or Ron who are very good at defensive magic, known, trusted and liked seems like it would be preferable.

******* But then why does the Ministry has the Department of international cooperation if you don't use it for this situation. And I guess the French ministry would help because it benefits them too if the enemy's are caught in England and not in France if they are trying to flee.

******** Powerful wizards are a scarce recourse, you're going quite a bit above cooperation if you just lend out a large number of them.

** I would prefer a Harry Potter Unspeakable that actually researches magic. It would be very interesting to see the different types of research, we saw very little of that from canon.

** I abhor the idea of unspeakables having a special forces division. Imagine a biochemical researcher in body armor with a rifle in real life.

Aurors are the elites.

Guns are useless.

*** That would be kind of hilarious, though.

"I work in a lab!" /fires gun/ "I have a fucking Ph.D!" /Fires again/ "Just because Gordon Freeman did it, doesn't mean I can!"

** I've always thought of aurors being the best of the best, the elite, as one auror should give Voldemort an issue and maybe 3 or 4 could take him. Hitwizards are more of the standard law enforcement, it would be them who show up to disturbances and such. And aurors who take the place of field operatives unspeakables in many fics, actively hunting dark wizards and creatures. Also I always imagined them working alone rather in squads.
