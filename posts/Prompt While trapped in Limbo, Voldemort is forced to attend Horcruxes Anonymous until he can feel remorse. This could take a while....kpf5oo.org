No one in the Afterlife administrative staff holds out much hope though. After all, that Herpo guy is still there, alongside hundreds of others.


** Is it one "slice" of him for every horcrux? So 16yr old and 50something him would have to hear each other attend meetings together. Along with his five or six other "slices".

*** Yes. It would be hilarious. Each one considering themself the "best" part of Voldemort. The Diary thinks he's the best because he's the largest slice, the Diadem considering himself the wisest, etc. Each part having absorbed a bit of the nature of their host object.

And in the background is just the little scarcrux baby, which everyone pretends not to see. Which is rather depressing now that I think about it...

**** Yep, Herpo the Foul was an ancient Greek dark wizard who bred the first basilisk and created the very first horcrux.

** I can just imagine all of the “slices” sitting around a grand meeting table of some sorts arguing profusely.

Let's see...

Diary would be the angsty teen with both mummy and daddy issues and an ongoing identity crisis.

Ring would also have family issues. He'd be the sorrowful one due to the Resurrection Stone's influence.

Locket would be the flirtatious one who'd later backstab and break you.

Cup would be the laid back, always hungry one.

Diadem would be the witty, dry, sarcastic schemer who would often claim superiority over the others.

Nagini would be the obedient one with unfortunate yet severe Separation Anxiety.

Scar would be the voice of reason. Taking on the form of Harry James Potter himself, he'd constantly have the “I told you so” look plastered on his face.

And Voldy-Central? THE Tom Marvolo Riddle? ...Well...He'd be a confused mess.
