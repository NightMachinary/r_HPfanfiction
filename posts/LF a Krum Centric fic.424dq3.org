I was wondering if there were any good (and long) fics focusing on the life of Viktor Krum. I'm looking for something relatively long. It can have a pairing or not, doesn't really matter too much to me, although I do enjoy a story which is a well written adventure that happens to include romance. Any and all help is appreciated :)


** Well. I don't know any stories with Krum as the protagonist, but [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317112][Over the Edge]] has some of what you're looking for.

/Viktor Krum, celebrated athlete turned drug-addled has-been, and Rose Weasley, a woman too young to know better than to get involved with him. When their paths cross, something awakens within them. Something powerful enough to drive them both over the edge./

Viktor Krum/Rose Weasley. If you can't get the mother, you nail the daughter instead.

** I've been looking for well-written Krumione with a plot for a long time. All for naught, alas. :(
