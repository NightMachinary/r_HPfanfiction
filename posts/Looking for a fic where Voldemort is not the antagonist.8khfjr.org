** So, you want a fic where the antagonist is named Draco Malfoy but acts in no way like the canon Draco Malfoy?

**** Do you mean "OP", that is to say "Over-Powered"?

"OC" means "Original Character."

** Traits that would make draco a good dark lord:

-Understands people. This boy has a goddamned gift at getting under people's skin. He knows exactly what to say to the trio and other gryffindors to get the strongest reaction. If he ever actually wanted to, and was willing to control his negative reactions to potential allies that he doesn't necessarily like, he would bevery successful in building a power base. He would know what to offer people to reel them in, and what to threaten them with to keep them. A successful dark lord draco would not overuse the cruciatus curse like voldemort. He'd become a master of bolstering loyalty, making his minions feel like they are are valued and needed, but would never be mistaken for someone they could cross, under any circumstance. You can see a smidgen of this when he first meets harry. He at first attempts to make an ally of harry, but projects what he would value in an ally (power, status) and tries to offer harry that by showing how they are superior to Ron and the Wesley's, the blood traitors. By the time draco has matured enough to understand what makes harry tick, he has lost interest in making an ally out of him and instead decides to use his knowledge to undermine harry. He lets his negative feelings towards the weasleys overpower his attempt to ally harry.

-appreciates traditions and the way things are done, would not needlessly change things just for the hell of it, would take actions that are tried and true and most likely to work.

-since draco defines his personal success by public achievements (status, respect, fear, approval, number of followers), and not by his personal achievements, would have plenty of motivation to not trash his followers with utter disregard for their lives or sanity, as that would give him a bad image. Unlike voldie, who only uses followers to further his personal goals, leading to disloyalty of one's who's goals are not the same (Snape, lucius, narcissa, draco, Regulus) dark lord Draco's followers are in essence his goals. Voldemort to wanted to kill all muggle and muggleborns and halfbloods. If he could accomplish that without his followers he would. Dark lord draco would want to be respected for being above those with impure blood. If he kills off his followers willy nilly, there is no one to give him that respect.

Ways draco would make a bad dark lord:

-He is remarkably short sighted for a slytherin. He's awful at playing the long game. Short term goals are more important than long term goals.

-He's terrible at defining himself as an individual. He sees himself as just an extension of his status as a pureblood. Take that away and he's nothing. He relies on others approval to determine his value. If someone of a lesser status bested him fair and square, he would either go into total denial and use any excuse to justify how losing to a mud blood doesn't affect his higher status, and ergo, his higher worth, or have a complete breakdown of world view, and turn into voldemort, cursing his followers left and right at the slightest sign of disrespect, and channeling all of his power into forcefully destroying all those who claim to be equal to him.

-his inability to set aside open prejudice to convince someone to ally with him.

**** Yep. Voldemort was terrified of death, and had a Neverending hatred of muggles. All the follower and world domination shit was just to get to the killing all muggles part, and the horcruxes were because he was scared of dying.

Draco never expresses any fear of dying aside from your average human's fear of it, so he would never have any desire to make a bunch of horcruxes. Draco's fear would be something like obscurity, or unimportance. I think dark lord Draco's goal is to be seen as supreme to all others, by all others. His desperate back up plan wouldn't be for horcruxes, it would be for something like the mind stone, to give him the ability to force others into servitude. And therein would lie his downfall. Draco would be so obsessed with getting his due respect, that when he started to lose power for whatever reason he would grow more and more desperate for something to force others to give him respect, missing the point that respect can only been freely given and not forced. He would be so desperate that he would forget the silver tongue that got him his power in the first place. Dark lord Draco's boggart would be him standing in a crowded room, with everyone either ignoring and walking through him or alternatively him lying in a pit, with a crowd of onlookers point and laughing and jeering.
