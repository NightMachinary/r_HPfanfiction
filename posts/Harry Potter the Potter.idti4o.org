Looking for fics where Harry... is a potter. Like makes pots and cups and plates and what not. Bonus points if it's one of those Lord Hadrian fics where he finds a whole vault with secret spells related to pottery making.


** There is The Potter Family Grimoire, where said grimoire starts with a potter's spell.

  Magic is more than just waving a stick and saying fancy words. Magic is about life and art. Magic is about the people one chooses to interact with. An artistic Harry Potter decides to live up to his last name and begins to craft some wonderful pottery and ceramic creations. At age 11, he discovers that not only is his work magical but so is he!

** It's not a major part of the story, but linkffn(The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic by Itsme66) has Harry, as well as prior Potters, being a potter.

I've read a one-shot in which Harry talks with Voldemort in a mindscape, forming things out of clay that are actually memories, but I can't come up with a title or link for that one.

  AU post 5th year. A bunny that wouldn't let go. Harry is set up in a marriage contract, but things don't go as planned. Rated for language and blatant - if non-desciptive - sexuality.
