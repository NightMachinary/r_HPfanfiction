Hey y'all!

Recommend me the best Minerva McGonagall fics for the wiki. She has to be the main character or at least a main character. Romances are allowed.

Make sure to link using [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] (see the sidebar), and write a line or two about the fic. Please list and pairings and whether the fic is abandoned as well.

Thanks!


** Here's an example:

linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday... by Twisted Biscuit) is a short slice-of-life of McGonagall during Dolores Umbridge's rein. There are quite a few grammatical and spelling errors, but it's funny.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** Linkffn(Hypocrisy by Sachita) is a fic that's very close to my heart. Minerva is paired with Tom Riddle, but most of the story is about their friendship more so than their relationship. Here's a brief excerpt of a review I posted on the story describing why I love Minerva'a character so much here:

"And then we get to Minerva. I've always liked her in the books because I saw her as a tough, but fair professor who despite her sometimes cold exterior, can actually be quite warm. And again, you've created a backstory for her that is absolutely marvelous and in character. Her family life, her social skills, her relationship with Dumbledore, and of course her love for Tom. Like Tom, you give her so many intricate layers and make her love so believable. She is a strong, independent girl that gets drawn to this boy for his intellect and his ability to push her and make her think and treat her as an equal in a time where few men would treat women as such. And she grows so attached to him that it excites her and scares her at the same time. And he does truly scare her. But she ignores it all again and again, defends him to others and to herself. And of course she does. Because she is in love! And love is not always beautiful. Sometimes it is destructive and wrong, but we can't always see that right away. And poor, poor Minerva chooses not to see it. She makes up excuses for him again and again and convinces herself that she can be the one who changes him, the one he trusts. Because despite everything, he isn't all bad. He can be funny and caring and even on a rare occasion romantic. He treats her with so much respect, loves her for her mind. It's almost worth all the twistedness just for the good times. And the true magic of your writing is that you make us as readers feel the same exact way. One second we hate Tom and want to shake Minerva, and the next we love Tom. He's just too bloody charming! I think you create that dichotomy perfectly."

So yeah, the review went on even more from there and obviously I'm a little obsessed. The story is still in progress, but not abandoned according to the author. She updated a few months ago after about 3 years, I think. Still very much worth the read though.

  Back in 1942, the trio of McGonagall, Pomfrey and Hooch first walked the corridors together, forging friendships that would last for all their lives. Faced with misfired curses, dragon pox, Quidditch-related mayhem and Slytherin's monster, they'll need all of Minerva's quick intelligence, Poppy's incredible knowledge, and Rolanda's reckless daring to get them through in one piece.

** Not sure if this counts, but the Potterotica Podcast featured a story written for them by a first-time author, named Maisie Bee. I don't believe she submitted it to any of the fanfic sites. The romantic one-shot features McGonagall and Garrick Ollivander on a cold winter's night in his wand shop. Highly recommend!

** linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/687710]])

A non-DH or Pottermore compliant fic about Minerva's earlier years (Hogwarts age through her first year of teaching). Excellent worldbuilding and characters. It is McGonagall/Dumbledore but the rest of the story was so nicely done I still enjoyed it.

Also, it's on fanfiction dot net, but the AO3 version was longer.

**** Probably about half of the fic was focused on subplots and other characters, for example the deputy headmistress, and Minerva's entire family was really nicely fleshed out. And there's a description of part of the war as well. I'd say although the main storyline was about Minerva and Albus getting together, there were still a lot of really wonderful platonic moments about them being good friends to each other as well. It became /much/ more romance-oriented after they actually got together, but that's not for a long time.

*** If you don't mind answering, how different is this Dumbledore from canon Dumbledore? I know this was written before DH, which is an issue because like 75% of Albus's characterisation comes from there, and I can't really imagine Albus without his origin story.

How morally ambiguous is Dumbledore in this? Is he mysterious and inscrutable and generally larger than life, or down to earth? What kind of relationship does he have with McG (I find it difficult to imagine Albus having an open healthy relationship with /anyone/, let alone someone as subservient to him as Minerva, but perhaps this being pre-DH might make it more plausible.)

**** I would say he's pretty similar only to how he was presented in the earlier books, but he's not the morally ambiguous person you find out about in DH. He definitely keeps his secrets about his backstory - which is both pretty similar and pretty different from how it is in canon - and he is secretive in general. I wouldn't call him larger than life because he and Minerva are close.

I would more or less say their relationship is healthy but it has its issues. I agree, I couldn't see a post DH Albus having healthy relationships, so it was hard for me to totally buy into, but that's how it was presented.

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality Ita about where Petunia marries a bio chemist and also got along with Lily so she was actually nice to Harry. Harry was then brought up in a world of science and was a child prodigy. When the Hogwarts letter comes then he actually uses the scientific method to test if magic is real. This means that McGonagall comes instead of Hagrid to introduce him to the wizarding world.
