It's a Tom/Harry, I reay enjoyed reading it. Though there is a TW for self harm but that's for more of the first half of the book.

** Luna's Hubby has parseltongue (or a reptile version) as a language you can temporarily speak if you cast the right charm. The first task is at the end of chapter 17. Nothing special about the dragon, though.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.
