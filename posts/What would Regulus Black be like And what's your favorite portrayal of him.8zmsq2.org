In fanfiction, he's often depicted as a quiet, soft-spoken boy with unusual intelligence. He's always with a book and depicted as the surprisingly selfless Slytherin with a very dry sense of humor. His strength lies in his quietness. However, I was wondering if that is strictly canon? I'm afraid to portray him a other way and it ending up being OOC.


** Regulus Black never appears directly in canon and his character isn't commented enough on by others (Slughorn or Sirius, for example) to really say what he was like. The main frame of reference I find is the eloquence in his note from the fake locket, and this comment by Sirius (unsourced, it rings a bell but I'm not sure if it's movie or book that's being quoted):

#+begin_quote
  "I hated the lot of them: my parents with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal... my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them... that's him. He was younger than me, and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded."
#+end_quote

The fact he seems to be the opposite of Sirius, supported by his description in HBP (in Slughorn's picture) as /smaller, slighter and less handsome/, indicates that his character would follow the quieter trend. However, in the end there's not enough information on Regulus to provide a clear answer. In short, go wild.

** I have read (and even written) many portrayals of Regulus throughout the years, almost right from the point of when Order came out. While I've always seen him as bright, reserved, dry-humoured and prone to self-sacrifice, almost all of my cues for him I see him have come from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Etonberrys][tonberrys]] and associated works. This is due to the extraordinary amount of meta and thought she puts into the character, taking cues from the house, Kreacher's descriptions, family traits and what little canon gives us.

That said, breaking down the canon, you have:

- He was born to an upper class family, one of only two males to still bear the name. The name is obviously important, given the tapestry. It's likely he spoke not dissimilarly to Draco, but while Draco is quite up front of his mockery and malice, Regulus seems to do things more subtly. Hence that subtle, dark humour, I'd imagine.

- He was smaller and slighter and at least by Harry's eye, less handsome than Sirius. However, he still looked enough like him that Harry instantly picked him out. He even notes later on how much alike they look.

- He was Slytherin's seeker, so likely was a big Quidditch fan. This is interesting because a lot of things make him a bit prissy and that would almost be out of place in a game like Quidditch, so marrying those aspects of his personality is important.

- He would have been approximately fourteen when Sirius run away, perhaps fifteen. He was (roughly) sixteen by the time he was a Death Eater, which lasted a year or so before Kreacher was given the task. Harry says he was very young at the time in DH, so possibly fifteen. Maths is not JKR's strong suit, or mine.

- His father died the same year he died.

- He had a better relationship with his parents than Sirius, as he was considered a 'much better son'. The reasons were likely linked to his conformity to the ideals.

- Sirius doesn't seem to have the same vitriol for him that he reserves for Bellatrix, who he's instantly upset at being reminded of being related to. He considers him a bit of an idiot, but that's about the worst of it. He also doesn't seem to think much of his abilities as a Death Eater, given he says he doesn't think he was likely never important enough to be killed by Voldemort directly. He he got in, didn't like what he was asked to do and tried to get out and that this was how he died.

- We also see a shade of this in HBP when Remus says that Regulus only lasted a few days after his 'desertion', which means he probably said or did something that made people believe he wanted out and this is the story that got back to Sirius when he looked after his disappearance.

- The appearance of his bedroom is the opposite to Sirius. Sirius clearly wanted to wear his differences front and centre, and Regulus desperately didn't want to be seen as different at all if we're going by decor. Not surprising, if the price of difference is being cast out from your own family.

- He keeps newspaper clippings of Voldemort above his bed, though what these clippings indicate aren't clear. Hermione says it's showing he's a fan, but it could also be gathering information on him as we know he had a chunk of time between realising Kreacher had been sent to his death and Regulus taking the same steps. It's open to interpretation.

- The giant crest is not. Family is a huge thing for him, by the looks of having it so up front and centre in his own bedroom.

- In his desk, Ron finds old quills and textbooks. Not much by itself, but it's there.

- It's also worth noting he seems at least a little practical, as there's also a charm on the door despite the sign.

- We can gather some of his personality from the fact that he put up the notice on his bedroom door (neatly written by hand), his manner of speech in the note (not too dissimilar than what Sirius has shades of in PoA but he seems to lose it as canon goes on) and what other people say about him. Of course, that's subjective but we have a couple of ideas to work with.

- Slughorn (a man who prizes people of skill and import) seems to remember him fondly enough. He noted Sirius' intelligence, and remarks on getting Regulus but wishing he'd had the set.

- Kreacher is a better source of information. Kreacher describes him as: “Master Regulus had proper pride; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns . . . and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve . . ." which does imply a few things about his personality, but like Slughorn, can be an unreliable narrator.

- He also notes that: "Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do . . . and then to c-come home.” This indicates he was at least civil with Kreacher (Hermione says kind), and that even at this point, there's reverence for Voldemort.

- Then when Kreacher returned, he's described as very worried. He tells Kreacher to stay in the house, stay hidden and comes back one night later. He's described then as "strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind" and asks to be taken to the cave. What happened between that and before is never explained, nor is the time frame.

- He arranges for Kreacher to survive, and destroy the locket. Not himself. This is where I think the idea that he has a selfless side comes in. He also doesn't make him drink the potion, the same one that Dumbledore struggled with, and instead takes it himself. This is considered to be brave, as even Harry assumes Regulus would force Kreacher to drink it.

- He forbids Kreacher to tell the family what happened. Hermione suggests it's because he believed they'd be safer if they never knew. Again, indicating a protective instinct, and a devotion to the family.

- The fact that he left a note, so if Voldemort ever came looking for his soul he would know who took it, also speaks of an excellent amount of pettiness and a bit of mockery as well. This would fit in with the haughtiness, though the actual text is not a threat but a hope that when he meets his match, he'll do so as a mortal man and nothing more.

As far as I know, this is the only canon references to his character. JKR has, outside of this, compared him to Draco and there is an [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/unsung-heroes-of-harry-potter-stories-regulus-black][Unsung Heroes]] section about him on Pottermore which has likely also been complicit in the interpretation of the canon. Ultimately, he is a character we don't know a lot about and have to extrapolate a lot from little information. That leaves a fair bit of wiggle room for interpretation without the worry of being OOC, as long as you keep to the canon mentions.

I also apologise for the sheer size of this, but once I start on about the Blacks, I'm hard to shut up.

**** Honestly, I think I'd be here all week if I tried to do a breakdown for all of them, there is a reason I have insanely long fics and meta about them but I'm glad you enjoyed it! I try to go into the why of the characters based on the canon and it's always nice when it works. They're a big mess, but they're a fascinating big mess. I don't have any of my main meta's public, sadly, but you can take a look at [[http://preciousreyofsunshine.tumblr.com/tagged/hp-meta][tonberrys]] here. They're worth a read if you're interested in the mechanics and psychology.

** That's funny because I always picture him as being kind of like Sirius, fun-loving and lively, but just knowing how to cleverly comply face to face. Like i imagine him getting into all sorts of trouble and then managing to convincingly frame someone else for it. But this is all my personal headcanon, we really don't know.

** Just like Draco, but less outspoken and more follower than leader as a child. Better manners, maybe. His betrayal of Voldemort was done in secret, and he needed a ton of dark knowledge just to know what the dark lord was doing. So, smart, way into the dark arts, proud but reserved, bigoted, careful, proactive but cunning, and moral (standing up for what he believes in even to the point of death).

** I'm /really/ enjoying 'Blackpool', which is one chapter away from being complete (the author says she's going to post the final chapter in a week or two). This author has written a lot about the Black family, and her writing is IMO a very accurate, detail-rich portrayal of what an abusive, British aristocratic wizarding family would be like. She usually focuses on Sirius, but it's clear she has a very good, fleshed-out idea of what each of the Blacks are like, and ‘Blackpool' is the first time she writes a story from Regulus' point of view and it's /so/ good.

In her stories, both Sirius and Regulus are affected by their fucked-up upbringing, but in different ways. Sirius tends to have more emotional reactions and leans toward defiance (but it's also easier to be defiant if you have friends who can take you in). Regulus is soft-spoken, but with a really great dry sense of humor. You could describe him as /softer/ than Sirius, in a way, but it's more complicated than that. He's bright, and questioning. He sort of takes Sirius' estrangement from the family to mean that he has to step up and take his place as heir, and subsequently as Death Eater.

It's so good.

  When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

He's the type of guy who would dress in black band shirts and skinny jeans with cuts on his arms if he were a muggle in our time.

I see him as having a mixture between Lupin's brooding self-hatred and Snape's acerbic, standoffish nature, paranoid and a little delusional too.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.
