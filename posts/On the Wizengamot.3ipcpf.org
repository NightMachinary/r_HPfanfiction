Mentioned it before but I'm working on a story, which will involve politics, just a general question. Where to begin when it comes to British politics and how this wizengamot would work? Also any links on how British politics works, a lot of this stuff is confusing for an American.


** I think that greatly depends on which tradition you want the Wizengamot to come out of. Before we even start: Rowling's Ministry was one hell of a political nightmare if I've ever seen one. The Minister in canon seems to be near dictatorial power. He isn't just chief of the executive, but also seems to be highest judge as well as on the forefront of the Legislative. In other words, all powers, executive, judiciary, legislative, combine themselves in him. For all intents and purposes, the Minister is an elected Dictator. Not even his status as "Minister" of Britain seems to mean much. We know that Fudge doesn't even report regularly to the Prime Minister, but merely when shit hits the fan and for introductions.

But you're asking about the Legislative and judicial branch of the Ministry, the Wizengamot. The three most used ways of building the wizengamot in fanfiction seem to be: Aristocratic, Plutocratic and Democratic. I personally like the notion that its an Elder Council, coming from druidic as well as romanic influences. The way in which its both making and executing law reminds of old Tribe-Councils where Clan-/ Tribe-/ Family-Elders voted on rules and punishment. Something that would also explain why its completely accepted that Sirius Black is thrown into prison without a trial. An Elder vote is traditionally nothing a mere citizen has the right to criticize.

The nature of the laws made, however, reminds of greek and romanic forums. Most of the law is downright draconic. Its well known that sending someone to Azkaban is basically a death-sentence for his or her sanity. The law is therefore not rehabilitating, but only and brutally vengeful. One could argue that its even worse than "An Eye for an Eye".

It also seems to me that the way the Wizengamot is built is either aristocratic/oligarchic or inheritary. We don't really know much about who sits in it, but all of them are pureblooded and reasonably wealthy. One could assume that its A) a forum made of nobility or B) a forum made of wealth and influence or c) a forum made of "the Best of society" (Whatever that society thinks that means).

Then, of course, you could merge the Ministry and the Wizengamot with the British Government. But given the isolated nature of the wizarding world, I don't see how this could be done without going heavily AU. Anyway, here are some links that explain the basics of the british political system. For all else, theres wikipedia.

More like two eyes for an eye. But at least tuition is covered in magical Britain!

But hey, the government pays for tuition at Hogwarts

** The key to understanding the British political system is that it hates fixed, explicit and systematic rules. The British constitution exists, but it is uncodified, and has developed over centuries not by design but through innumerable crises and compromises.

There are some explicit rules (Acts of Parliament with constitutional significance, such as the Bill of Rights 1689), but the vast bulk of British constitutional practice is a matter of convention. A convention is an accepted practice that political players consider binding, but which is not actually legally enforceable. They're binding... until they're not.

If you want the Ministry of Magic to feel British, I think it's a good idea to try to mirror this structure, to have the rules of the system be eclectic and ad hoc and each one has a history behind it.

For example, it may surprise you to know that officially there is no such thing as the "Prime Minister". It is a position that has never been created by any law or constitutional document. Nowhere are the powers of the position defined. The position simply evolved as one Cabinet Minister grew dominant over the others (naturally, this was the Minister who controlled the money) and the Crown interfered less and less in the daily management of the nation. So the Prime Minister (position by convention) is also the First Lord of the Treasury (official position) and the head of the Civil Service (official position). It's easy to see how controlling the money and the bureaucracy gave this Minister great power. The rise of party politics completed the Prime Minister's ascension, as with strong party discipline, control of the executive and legislature rested in one person.

This is the kind of natural evolution I would love to see in Ministry of Magic politics - instead of everything being run by official rules, political reality, historical practice and convention rule the day. It's also this constitutional practice which means that British politics does not have anywhere near the kind of clear separation of powers as you see in the US. I think it would be unnatural to give the Ministry any kind of clear separation of executive, legislative and judicial power. If Muggle Britain has weak separation of powers then magical Britain should be even more fuzzy, given that it is quite a small community.

** Something one must keep in mind when considering politics and the like in Harry Potter - from our perspective, Magical Britain isn't a country. It's an ancient town, with feuds and friendships going back generations. Barring the newcomers (Muggleborns) the upper crust all knows each other, and policies are as likely to be decided over a friendly cup of tea between the old families, with favors being called in to prevent this law or implement this exception, rather than being taken care of in a bureaucratic manner.

** I'm under the impression that the Wizengamot has no hereditary seats- the Wizarding World respects age and wisdom, and the members are no doubt offered to add their voice when they've distinguished themselves in society through published opinions and innovations.

They have a Minister more to handle day-to-day administration and enforcement of their policies. They wouldn't assume anything about the children of great minds, as they bring on members for having their own opinions, not to parrot the ones from their parents. Also, since they probably keep the position for as long as they're willing to attend to it, many of them will be much older than the average wizard or witch on the street.

However, this still can result in corruption as the only ones being recognized for their merit are the ones that the existing Wizengamot would listen to and agree with. Thus a Patronage system could easily be the truth of the arrangement, even if the design is intended to be merit-based.

** The Wizengamot seems rather similar to the House of Lords in its composition.

** I tend to think of it as being similar to the English House of Lords pre-1999. The reason I say the original pre-1997 House of Lords is because in 1997 reforms were brought in to change how it worked and started a chain of later reforms which made new chambers (such as the Supreme Court which was established as late as 2005-2009), the original House of Lords was entirely hereditary seats of landed lords. (There used to be over 1300 of them and since the reforms there's just under 900; of those only 92 are still hereditary). In other words; a lot of seats.

I'm thinking there'd be at least 100+ for the Wizengamot. Most of them would be hereditary seats, absolutely none of them would be elected ones. The ones that aren't hereditary belong to high ranking law officials, like the head of the DMLE and the like and also to some high ranking Ministerial personell. Also, just because there are a lot of seats it doesn't mean they'll all be filled. Make it a point that there are a lot of empty seats of either members who's lines have died out, the next eligible member is not of age or that the member in question declines to attend that session. However I think that the functionality of the Wizengamot mirrors that of the English House of Commons.

Basic conversion of English politics to the Magical system of governance is this:

*Speaker = Chief Warlock:*

They're like the chairman, their job is to open the floor to anyone who wants to raise a topic. They enforce the rules of the chamber and try to maintain order. They're elected by the chamber, usually because of respect or experience within the chamber, as such they'll probably be a veteran of the whole scene. They must remain neutral and impartial throughout each debate and effectively renounce whatever beliefs they previously held whilst serving office. They don't take part in the debates and only vote in order to break a tie.

*Peers of the House of lords and legislative/judiciary body = Wizengamot members:*

They meet every once in a while to preside over potential new laws that the Minister of the time want to pass, or members of the chamber want enacted. The politics of this are the same as any other political body. They act as a legislative, to the Ministry's executive and are called upon to ratify any laws and to hold the executive/Minister to account. They also have another function as the judiciary regarding criminal trials. They are all unelected (except the Minister) and serve for life (except for the law officials and Ministerial personell).

As for the choosing of the Minister. I don't believe he's elected in the traditional sense. I think it's more a case of if there's an aspiring politician within or without the Ministry who wants to become the head of the government, then their name is put forward to the Wizengamot and they're appointed to the office if they have enough support. There's no common vote or real democracy.

** Just because I don't see it mentioned here it's worth noting that the name wizengamot is obviously derived from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witenagemot][Witenagemot]] "meeting of wise men" councils of Anglo-Saxon nobles that met to advise the king around the 7th-11th century. We know from canon that the wizengamot predates the MoM, and can infer that it might be rooted in an Anglo-Saxon tradition of wizardry rather than whatever Norman traditions may have come over with William the conqueror in 1066.

All of this can play into what Taure said about the nature of British politics, and gives you lots of room to invent stuff. For example, as far as I can recall there's no explicit canon proof that Lucius Malfoy sits on the Wizengamot, despite his deep involvement in politics. He isn't at Harry's 1995 hearing, that we see. Maybe as a family that came over with the Normans he isn't entitled to an hereditary seat? Is that why he seeks influence through the Minister?

** Very good points by UndeadBBQ.

I usually pick a Wizengamot - heriditary, elected, with or without appointed members (by the Minister, or by getting an order of merlin, f.e.) - according to what I want for a story. Generally though I consider it entirely separate from the British Government, in fact if not always by law. I also tend to keep the Wizengamot as the legislative, and supreme court, leaving the Ministry under the Minster for Magic, as the executive and judicative.

Give the small numbers of wizards, I also tend to see the Wizengamot as both traditional, and very person-oriented. They don't have parties as much as people following a few leaders, for various and often self-serving reasons.

And I usually assume that they are so corrpt and old-fashioned, that lots of laws can get passed with unforeseen consequences because no one noticed that a rider to the law about broom length meant Hogwarts just got a new safety inspector.

I also assume that there's so many different and confusing laws and custom, that there's lots of leeway for the Wizengamot or the Ministry to rule one way or the other - which means it's easy to pay the right people off, even if the Minister himself is not involved.

** I tend to think of them as having about fifty members, 5-10 of which are elected. The elected members have one vote, while the number of hereditary votes is fixed; thus some people have more than one vote. The Wizengamot vote on legislation and act as judges. The Minister controls the agenda, while the Chief Warlock controls parliamentary procedure.

In other words, the Chief Warlock and Minister together can prevent legislation from being introduced. It requires little effort from the Minister, but the Chief Warlock has to be blunt and obvious about it or else at least moderately adept -- able to predict what people will want to do and control the conversation so that no one can introduce a bill that's not on the agenda.
