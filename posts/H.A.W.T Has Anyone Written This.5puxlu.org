** Harry is a natural Legilimens. His perception of the world is similar to [[http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/9/90/Queenie_Goldstein_promo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160930101353][Queenie Goldsteins]] way of seeing things. He sees in the hearts of people, finds beauty in the ugly and ugly in the beauty. With this ability he both masters social impossibilities and creates chaos in every circle of people he enters.

** My plot bunny about a 'Muggleborn Dark Lord':

After the War, the pureblood establishment maintained a firm grip on power in Wizarding Britain. Although Muggleborns were released from Azkaban, they now faced legal discriminations. Furthermore, the pureblood establishment was trying to shift blames to 'being misled by that Half-Blood impostor Riddle'. The Wizengamot was tightening restrictions against 'dark creatures' further, even those injured by werewolves or born to them fell under discriminations. As a gesture, the establishment abandoned the Malfoys and heavily bribed the elder Weasleys, leading a split within the family. Harry and Hermione were thoroughly disappointed by all those developments and wanted to leave magical Britain all together. Ron and Ginny hesitated at first, but Arthur's vote for the 'Dark Creature Law' shattered their last piece of hope. In the end, Luna (who lost her father in Azkaban), Lavender (who was now classified as 'dark creature'), Dean, George, Angelina, Lee, Justin, and Andromeda joined them. They decided to call themselves "The Dirty Dozen".

In September 1998, they made their moves. Harry managed to use his fame to pressure the Goblins to transfer all his assets to the Muggle world. Justin managed to 'persuade' his father to give him significant amount of family assets. They further obtained alternate identities in the Muggle world. At Hermione's insistence, they headed to the Silicon Valley, now in the middle of late 90's Tech Mania, and quickly found out how easy it was to make big money there. They created the harmless sounding Otter Investments, with memory charms, legilimency, veritaserum, and imperius curse being its key competitive advantages. They mostly stayed away from controlling key government and military figures as these people were generally protected or under surveillance by their respective Ministries of Magic. However, the slow-moving wizarding world was no longer capable of keeping track of the rapidly changing tech industry, and it was exactly here where the big money of the future would be made.

The primary business of Otter Investments was to identify promising young Muggle entrepreneurs and 'persuade' them to give them equity stakes and stock options at no cost. They would then assist their new 'partners' in gaining lucrative deals, obtaining sensitive information, and receiving favorable court/government rulings.

When the tech boom reached its manic phase in early 2000, essentially worthless startups would be valued in billions of dollars at IPOs. They made their first millions during that time, which greatly wetted their appetitive and boosted their ambitions. They were able to significantly scale up their operations. Google's IPO in year 2004 turned them into billionaires first time. Helen Farmer (aka Hermione Granger) became a rising star in the hedge fund/venture capital industry.

Meanwhile in magical Britain, things were getting worse. Ruling elites and old families strengthened their hold on power and reinforced the social castes. Muggleborns were now completely excluded from lucrative jobs, and many left. Otter Investments, however, was able to exploit this situation and recruit more loyal wizards and witches.

During the 2008/2009 global financial crisis, they were able to take advantage of the collapse in asset prices and the subsequent QE (quantitative easing). They gained their first foothold in major financial institutions, which opened up a side route into the political circle. But as a side effect, MACUSA was tipped off, finally became suspicious of their operations, and began to investigate.

To counter this threat, the company decided to form its own private army. Fortunately, the wars in Middle East and the chaos in magical Britain offered significant influx of reliable new recruits, both Muggle and Magical. Many former Muggle military bases, often sold at bargain prices by their governments, would offer excellent hideouts and training grounds.

After 2012, MACUSA was becoming a major threat. Otter Investments, now a global hybrid Muggle/Magical Corporation with hundred thousands of employees/followers and hundreds of billion dollars in assets, saw various Ministries of Magic as the key threat to its goal of global domination. It began implementing plans that would use Muggles as a proxy to destroy magical governments and old magical establishments, while using the company as a refuge for surviving Magicals. With magical competitions gone, Otter Investments believed it would be a very advantageous position to dominate both worlds.

One key milestone was achieved in 2016 when a certain weak-minded billionaire US presidential candidate was brought under control. Significant voter manipulations resulted in his victory that surprised both pundits and the MACUSA. Once in office, the new POTUS worked immediately on plans destroying the magical establishment.

How would pureblood families like the Malfoy's or even the Weasley's who seem to rely on magic for almost all basic things like cooking, travel, chores, etc. react and adapt to having to do everything the muggle way. What happens to Hogwarts and all the staff since classes are no longer possible. What would Voldemort and his death eaters do when no longer being able to do magic.

*** Since Voldemort was basically a magical construct at that time, his body would crumple, his horcruxes would dissipate, and he would simply die.

The Burrow would implode on itself and kill/injure anyone inside, but its effect wouldn't be nearly as specular as Malfoy Manor's implosion. Similarly across the world, all expansion charms and magically supported structures would collapse on themselves and kill most people inside.

Items stored inside magically enlarged bags and trunks would simply be destroyed. All conjured objects would disappear, and all transfigured objects would revert to its original state.

All wards, including Fidelius Charms, would break and reveal their contents to the world. Muggles were baffled by the destructions and devastations suddenly revealed to them. National emergencies would be declared, military would be mobilized, and there would be stories for many years to come.

- harry potter becomes a teacher - in the muggle world that is. He proceeds to tell one bullshit story to his students after another, yet somehow always manage to back them up with proof (obviously by cheating with magic). Maybe told froom the perspective of his students?
- the dursleys find harry on their doorstep and assume that this is some extreme form of ding-dong-ditching, and proceed to tell everyone about it. The story becomes viral in the muggle world, and dumbledore has to wxplain everyone why he thought that it'd be funny to prank some muggles by leaving the saviour of the magical world on their doorstep.
- A typical over-the-top 'evil manipulative dumbledore' story, only that harry simply dies half-way through the story, and now dumbledore has to scramble and somehow make all of his longterm plans work without harry
- Harry travels back in time, but since an alternative version of him still exists, he has to take up a cover identity. He decides to take over the identity of fudge, and makes a hobby out of carefully wording all the laws he gets bribed for to pass in such a way, that they end up having the opposite effect of what the intended consequences were.
- umbridge and harry somehow accidentally swap bodies
- harry's lightning bolt scar also looks a lot like the sigrune - as a result he basically gets adopted by a bunch of neonazis, who proceed to protect him from dudley and co, which obviously has some weird consequences for his personality development

Magic, as described in the HP world, seems to allow direct access to fundamental physical forces through a person's will power. If combined with Muggle technologies, would make even interstellar space colonization magnitudes easier. For example:

- Apparition, Port Key, and Floo Travel are basically short distance worm holes through space time. Port Keys could potentially be used to build space stations easily and quickly; Apparitions allow easy transport of astronauts to and from Low Planetary Orbits; Floo Travel connects two points of heat sources, so one fanfic introduces the concept of 'Floo Jump' (as opposed to Hyperspace Jump) to allow interstellar travel using another star as target heat source.

- Broomsticks and Flying Carpets are basically gravity manipulation devices, which could be used to generate Earth-like gravity in various environs, crucial for the health of human beings.

- Conjuration, duplication (Gemino curse) of materials are examples of creating matters temporarily from quantum foam(?), thus using far less energy as required by the Energy Matter Equivalence (E=MC^{2).} This kind of magic would render material scarcity on new colonies a non issue.

- Space extension charm create pocket dimensions in our current universe. It's dreadfully useful, and you can use your imagination to think about all the possibilities.

Merope Gaunt is part of an offshoot branch of the House of Hufflepuff that, over the last millennium, has forgotten that they were part of Hufflepuff and somehow firmly rooted themselves in the idea of being of the Slytherin line. This is because Hufflepuff was, incidentally, also a Parselmouth as a honey badger, and this was somehow passed on. The official line doesn't correct them, because they've long since died out.

Tom Riddle still gets sorted into Slytherin due to his upbringing, but when he finds the chamber and meets the basilisk, he begins to ask interesting questions -- questions like "why does the basilisk not respect me?", "the basilisk is looking at me, should I be worried?", "why am I immune to basilisk venom?", and "why is the basilisk cowering away from me?"

***** Definitely not. Voldemort and Harry could be equal in terms of potential power, it's just that in canon, we don't have that much grasp on either of them. Sure, Harry managed to cast the Patronus Charm, which in itself is said to show a Wizard's power. But outside of casting their signature spells of Disarming and Killing, we rarely see Voldemort or Harry use anything else in combat.

"Traditional Duelling" is definitely not what Dumbledore would train Harry to do in the case of him becoming Harry's mentor. I think it was the fic "Gods Amongst Men" or something like that, that made the distinction between Duelling and Combat. Combat is using every means necessary to destroy your opponent. I would imagine the first battle in the graveyard as being a cocky-full-of-himself Harry attempting to duel Voldemort. Then getting utterly destroyed by Voldemort's sheer magical power (imagine torrents of flame, the very ground forming to lava etc...), and only being able to get away with a wandless summoner brought about by a huge wave of fear and anger that Harry was beaten so badly by the man who killed his father.

Dumbledore isn't a 'try' guy. If he thought that Harry didn't have the potential to beat Voldemort, he wouldn't waste his time training him. That's what I think happened in canon. At first, Dumbledore wanted to see if Harry had any talent, maybe they could circumvent the need for miracles should Voldemort come for Harry again? But sadly, Harry had no talent with magic whatsoever, and instead spent time around people. So Dumbledore tells him that the key to winning is love, blue-pilling Harry into believing that no matter what he did, he would win. That's why in the end, Harry never asked for training. So that's why I said "a more realistic Harry", aka: Talented, Powerful MC. Due to the fact that he is the son of two magic prodigies, it's only natural that he would be naturally powerful and magically talented, along with being away from magic the entirety of his life, he would develop a great curiosity for spells and such. Also, let's not forget that one of the only Muggle-Born/Pureblood Children we've seen is Tonks, saying he has special abilities isn't far fetched. Given time, Harry could definitely beat Voldemort. Not with any ease, and he would likely lose a lot of people along the way, but he would do so.

You might want to read "The Accidental Animagus", linkffn(9863146). Good guys were significantly stronger than in canon, but Voldemort and his minions also stepped their games, so Year 4 still played out pretty much the same.

Harry was ambushed by a much larger audience in the Graveyard and was hit by a Killing Curse from Voldemort, removing his scar horcrux.

**** I always thought that the reasoning for Dumbledore not being able to compete with Voldemort himself is because he lacks raw magical power so that's where Harry comes into play, and while Harry would definitely add oomph, he would still have a lot of trouble handling Voldemort in a duel. The basilisk could still very well happen, as it was mostly out of Harry's control, same for the Dementors and the Tri-Wizard tournament. Although I highly doubt Harry would continue with his quidditch dream, he would likely opt for Duelling in junior divisions with Dumbledore as his sponsor. And the conflict with the Dementors would only come into play much later when Sirius is in Hogwarts and Dumbledore voices his suspicion that he isn't responsible for Voldemort's finding of the Potters. So we get a quicker version of the "Patronus learning session" that we got with Remus. But after the fifth year, I agree, things will start getting crazy since we make Harry competent while learning secret magic, we have to make Voldemort ten times as competent with more secret magic to boot so there would be extreme and large-scale world building going on as the Death Eaters slowly take over Magical Britain. Like I said, it's tough.

** I have two ideas that I plan to eventually do snippets of, but I'll post them here for now...

--------------

Number 1: Harry dies. Met by Osiris (what? Do you think that after dealing with Death Eaters he'd want a Grim Reaper with a skull mask and black robes too?) in the underworld, he's informed of the true nature of Horcruxes; they don't merely allow their possessor to defy death, but to defy fate itself, manipulating fortune and granting their wielder power enough to subvert logic and destiny. Therefore, Voldemort is unbeatable with sheer power, wisdom, or luck, he can only be destroyed through exploiting the dark lord's own flaws.

With that in mind, Osiris offers to send Harry back to try again (typical Peggy Sue, you know); though he can't keep his knowledge of the Horcruxes or advanced magic (after all, divine intervention would only let Voldemort get stronger too), he can give Harry a small present, like an idea or minor talent or just a few memories, just enough to maybe, let Harry win this time...

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:
This'd be a subversion of the usual trend of 'Time travelling Harry comes back with knowledge of Horcruxes and super magic and his Gringotts vaults and uses them to whoop butt' by having the Horcruxes be different, a mechanism by which Voldemort literally gets stronger to defeat anything that stands in his way right up to and including gods.

--------------

Number 2: The real reason that house-elves are slaves comes out; while doing research into their origins, Hermione (who else?) learns that the elves willingly gave themselves into slavery and poverty in order to save wizarding humans at a time when lack of resources, plague and violence was threatening to wipe them all out.

However, the price was that when wizards and witches were safely in the black again, that their elves would be freed and wizardkind would help them in turn to become prosperous (a brand new island isn't out of the question); however, the witches and wizards haven't been keeping this agreement and have kept elvenkind as slaves long past their contracted date.

So...what happens when the house-elves learn of this? Why it was proper for them to be slaves, but is the opposite of proper now? The answer is of course 'whatever makes the best story'.

*** Alternative Number 2: The house elves are bound imps, minor demons that once were the foot soldiers of an invading demonic army. Wizards back then found a way to break their masters' hold over them by forcing their own bonds onto the creatures and enslaving them. That allowed them ultimately to repel the invasion.

Whenever a house elf is freed, when the wizards' bond on them is broken, they return to the command of their old masters. Not much of a problem while the numbers of free elves are low. The seals on the walls between the dimensions are strong enough and the hellish rulers have their own concerns, they don't watch Earth like hawks, waiting for the slightest weakness to once again try for an incursion. But recently Hermione's work has started to pay dividends and the numbers of free elves have been rising. Rising enough that their combined prayers call out loud enough across the dimensions to be received by perceptive ears.

So, yeah, let the imps call their master. If Hagrid doesn't tame the monsters, they can serve as target practise for DADA, or the DoM will gather them for further study.

Unless of course you subscribe to the view that present wizards are a pale shadow of their ancestors, and not only forget about the house elves' origins, but also didn't manage to make any progress in magic.

** Stolen Magic:

Hermione has her magic stolen by Draco Malfoy. He enacts a ritual to steal her magic and put it in a jar, hoping to later figure a way to add it to his own. It's the jar-device that makes this work, which is why it only is used on Hermione (though Draco has asked the crackpot who created it to make another...)

Why Hermione and not Harry? The irony is greater for Hermione, and moreover, her assistance isn't typically wand-work. On the flip side, Harry may be protected by Destiny. Better still- this is done over the summer, where Potter is inaccessible but Granger is an easy target. Should happen post 3rd-year, after she punches him. Couldn't happen after 4th, as she was more aware of being a potential victim after Skeeter's intrusion.

Hermione is Obliviated afterwards, such that she feels ill for the last few weeks of holiday and ends up skipping the Quidditch World Cup, but can't find the reason.

On the train, Draco confronts her, suggesting that she had no place there. She attempts a hex and gets nothing. Harry and Ron defend her, but Ron is somewhat spooked to see Hermione as a muggle; it takes very little for him to reject her for it. Ginny and the twins aren't much better, though they feel sorry for her.

She goes straight to McGonagall and is sent to Madame Pomfrey. This is where Draco is pointed out as the potential cause; he is summoned and gloats that he 'can just tell- a muggle smells wrong, and Granger has gotten more rank since last year.'

Snape is cruel and difficult, despite Albus' exhortations for him to investigate the matter. Snape does turn around and grill Draco about the procedure, learning how and why it was done. What makes him sit back and think is the potential impact to the magical world's dynamic, should the ritual become widely known. It was developed by a crackpot healer/alchemist that visited one of the Malfoy's parties- Draco overheard the conversation and agreed to fund his research from his own Trust. The Healer was looking into ways to kill off magical viruses by removing the 'food' upon which the illness fed. The magic is meant to be restored to the patient after the illness passes, but Draco saw no reason to fulfill that part of the ritual.

Snape launches his own research into how the stored magic can be used. It puts him in a multi-level quandary; the purebloods could shore up their squibs with stolen magic, but would be enacting what they accuse the mudbloods of doing in the first place. Such a published work could assure his status as an Alchemist, and could potentially even the playing field against Riddle. In fact, if HE could take Potter's magic and use the power of Harry's fate to put down the Dark Lord, Snape would earn a place of acclaim greater than even Albus Dumbledore...

Over time, Hermione's situation becomes widely known. The press twists it in various ways and Harry stands by Hermione throughout it, even after he is shanghai'd into the Tournament.

Sirius offers his condolences but doesn't act too interested in helping Hermione so much as aiding Harry in the Tournament. Hermione is put under indirect care of the school; she is barred from attending spell-related classes, which limits her to Muggle Studies, Care, History, Ancient Runes, Arithmancy and Astronomy. Eventually Hagrid has to suggest that she stay out of Care if she can't heal and resist minor damage like a magical can.

The nature of magic, however, is that a witch is not a container, but an aperture. The 'curse' redirected her attunement, like forcing her voice to come out of a distant microphone instead of her mouth. The jar is a Protean mana sink which infrequently spurts out wild magic, depending on Hermione's attempt to draw upon the flow. Draco keeps it in his dorm room, using the untraceable excess magic to cast forbidden spells and commit other minor crimes- the jar-device that the crackpot sold to him acts like a self-powered wand- it collects magic like a capacitor.

She still is magical, but her access is blocked and shunted elsewhere. She can still see ghosts and is unaffected by the muggle-repelling charm (though she can 'feel' it instructing her to leave). What she is also, ironically, is invisible to the magic-sensitive. Many wards and charms fail to react to her (as they are also shunted into the jar). The portraits and ghosts ignore her- only Peeves can still see and hear her, though he fakes not doing so at first. (She can be seen by magical creatures that have actual eyes, but the Dementors and she are mutually invisible, nor can a Boggart affect her).

I had more for this but I think I've lost the fire to truly commit to it.

/Harry Potter: Animal Whisperer/

#+begin_quote
  Ever since Harry was young, he always had a way with animals. Every animal he's met (even Ripper and Mrs Figg's cats!) before Hogwarts has always liked him and he's gotten along well with them. He also has a few special talents: He can understand and communicate with any animal, can enable animals to speak in human tongue and on occasion, can take on the abilities of an animal (such as the grace of a cat and the ability to swing from trees like monkeys). How will his animal based powers affect his time at Hogwarts and his battles against Voldemort and his forces?

But he does get to inherit the Potter fortune, and ultimately that's the power Voldemort knows not. Pure unadulterated money. He uses it to fund the discovery of weapons/magical objects from across the globe or to pay someone to create them. A good way to subvert the stupid "inheritance" shit, while also playing with concept. It would also be just fun to see somethign close to a "Magical Batman"

I think it'd be a good look at the difference between two sisters, how they react to each other's deaths, the hand they get in life, and the way they treat each others orphaned children.

It'd take some fiddling, either of the prophecy, or with Dudley's age. Maybe Severus leads him to Petunia instead of Lily, maybe Petunia and Vernon baby-sit/house-sit for Lily and James, and Voldemort doesn't realise there are two boys, with Harry being in the bath maybe, or in another room. It would also require Voldemort to have done less research, and be unfamiliar with Lily, and Petunia to look somewhat more like her. Maybe strawberry blonde hair instead of the pure blonde.

** The Goblins are descended from the Fae, and are partially bound by the Old Laws. They are allowed to lie, but any contracts they make, they cannot break. This is why Wizarding World uses them as bankers, because they cannot break their word. However, each time a wizard breaks a contract, such as keeping a goblins object past it's return point, everyone directly involved in breaking the contract is put into a debt enforced by magic. The treaties prevent goblins from calling in these debts, unless they have a Goblin Rebellion which voids the Treaty. At which point, a lot of the richer families(those with goblin-made jewelry) lose huge sums of money, and in some cases turn into indentured servants.

This plot bunny is only really good for goblin centric fics, or those featuring a goblin rebellion, but it does explain a lot of the plot holes we always see with goblins, like why does nobody trust them, but they still have a monopoly on Britain's magical economy.

Wizards, of course, thinking they control all aspects of magical life, have a fit and try to stop them before non-magics discover magic.

They could, perhaps, be Avari, who did decide to stay in Middle-Earth until the end of time.

I would really, really, like background stories for ghosts, especially Binns. What sucked all the joy out of life for him? Why was he the way he was? Why was teaching so important to him he couldn't retire after dying? Why was he so focused on Goblins?

** Voldemort's body dies before they destroy the last Horcrux, leaving him a wraith until he can be destroyed in a body again, but makes it as difficult as possible by body hopping from person to person all over the globe with Harry&Co chasing his trail of destruction.

Also, despite me having put a lot of work into figuring out the timeline of this, I'll post a story idea I've been working on here. AU Canon where Dumbledore dies in the fight with Grindlewald but takes the dark lord down with him. Someone in the present day (where Harry and co are like 40 having already dealt with Voldemort) goes back in time to try and kill Dumbledore before he gets to Grindlewald, thereby changing the course of history. Harry has to go back in time to stop him, ending up smack in the middle of ww2. He requests help from the King of the day, (with the aid of Elizabeth/William depending on if you think the queen would have kicked it by then) becomes the leader of a special operations group in the British army and ends up chasing a younger Dumbledore through France and Germany after the Normandy invasion. Over the next year or so he and his unit of soldiers work their way into Nazi Germany and eventually witness the duel between Dumbledore and Grindlewald. Only for the original time traveler to kill Dumbledore mid duel forcing Harry and his unit to kill the time traveler and Grindlewald at which point Harry realizes that he's only fulfilling a timeline that had already existed. Where he was always meant to come back in time to deal with Grindlewald and Dumbledore never actually got the chance to avenge his sister. When he goes back forwards in time to his own timeline he let's everyone else believe that Dumbledore is the Hero everyone thinks he is, because really, how much more publicity does Harry actually need?

In case you couldn' t tell from the title, this is a HP + Series of Unfortunate Events crossover. The overall plot of this story is Harry Potter meeting the Baudelaire Orphans, and bonding with them, becoming their guardian at some point in time, and having a slightly less sad story for the Baudelaire Orphans.

Needing another 30 years of life out of Albus, at the least, he de-ages him to his seventies, and sends him off to Tamriel, where dragons are returning, and the people need a hero.

These two are rough drafts, so excuse any poor writing or grammar mistakes in them, I just haven' t had the time to flesh these out completely. These poor plot bunnies need a home. I have others, but they' re not HP related, so I won' t post them here.
