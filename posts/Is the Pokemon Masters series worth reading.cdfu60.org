I remember starting it but another story I really enjoyed got updated so I never continued it... What I want to know is if Harry actually gets really strong in the books. I really can't imagine myself reading a Harry Potter/Pokemon fic in which Harry is a really weak trainer. I'm looking for some badass Harry. For example, does he do well in the tournament in the fourth book?


** Which series are you talking about? The one by M. Chaos?

**** IIRC it's very, very Stations of Canon. Like almost painfully follows the books with pokemon sort of thrown in along the way a bit.

***** I think that was why I never continued it as well. I remember reading Harry Potter canon only that he talks to his charmander(?) ever so often.

** Yes. In the tournament he used some clever tricks to beat the task. One that I remembered is he used empoleon to create an ice slide to climb down a cliff or something. I don't remember his score or how he fares with the other champion, but he's not struggling too badly like he is on the first and second task in GoF.

There's also the classic Animagus!Harry. His form is>! Noctowl and he bonds with Hedwig. !<

Other than badass!Harry, it's a pretty good fanfiction. Harry's friend got a training before the fifth year. The 'good guy' is taking an active role, the power progression makes sense, the romance isn't that bad either. There's also an interesting concept about a special bond between Pokemon and trainer that will be explored more on the next book; speaking, pokemagus, some elemental connection, the dream connection, and something else I can't remember.

**** Sorry, I think I recommend the wrong series lol.

I thought you meant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9305868/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Master-s-Ball][Harry Potter and the Master's Ball]], I didn't realise there's another series with the same name.

  Harry Potter and the Master's Ball,

This is one of the most unimaginably insulting fanfictions to read as an Irish person. OP is clearly an American who has a very, very odd view of the Troubles and is translating it horrifically. One of the main characters is the leader of Pokemon-IRA and his brother is his bff. They are wonderful, perfect people who don't even drink. The IRL equivalent is Gerry Adams and his brother. They drink. They also burn people alive and his brother raped his daughter and Gerry Adams covered it up for years. I cannot even begin to explain how awful it is that they come into it in such a meaningful way.

Also as a side note; that isn't even the most annoying thing. Luna is a Veela and apparently this means she can reference real world pop culture (think cringey Sherlock references). Like twice a paragraph.

It sucks because the first 3ish books are absolutely brilliant and mesh the worlds so well.

****** Alright, I'm Northern Irish and don't really want to read a book about the Pokemon-IRA lol. Thanks for the heads-up.

******* Yeah it's a shame because it's by far the best polemon/potter story I've read and you can get to about halfway through 4th year before it goes completely off the rails with the poke-Ra. Then it's just so bad I actually had to message the author to ask wtf he was doing (read it as it went up live and it was painful reading the updates).
