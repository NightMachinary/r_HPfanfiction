Hello,

I am currently working on a mostly original characters and content fan fiction and it is my first in the HP world. Though I write mostly for my own satisfaction, I wish to avoid making great errors in publishing online. With thousands of fictions lasting only a few hundred words or series not being continued, what are the word lengths and publication formats for series that the community prefers?

Thanks!


** A story needs to be along as it takes it to tell the story it wants to tell

Of course if you can write 600K words of engaging well written plot with significant character development, everyone will love you.

but if you are just writing 600K words of filler just because some arbitrary number someone told you on reddit everyone will hate your story

** I prefer everything from 150k upwards. I like to read a fanfiction that keep me occupied for a few days and I find this to be especially important when reading OC heavy stories. OCs need time to be introduced properly. Take that time.

** Complete.

Sadly, this is one of the rarer formats found, which is perhaps why it is so often valued.

** When I'm looking for something to read, I look for things that are 80k words minimum, but I'll pass over those in favor of 100k+ quickly.

That said, as long as something is complete and engaging, I'll give it a try. I generally don't read things that are in progress, no matter how promising it seems. And I dislike reading things that add in useless fluff to engorge the word count- better to be good with a low count than questionable with a high count!

** If it's good, 3 million words +

I mean it, I'll read anything that's good forever

I don't care if it's complete. I'd much rather an incomplete 600k word story than a complete 40k one.

** It's rare that I even bother looking at stories less than 100k.

** For me it depends in whether it is a new story I'm following or a complete story. For complete stories, anything over 5k per chapter is good but too many words per chapter can also indicate that the author has too much filler or doesn't know how to properly section the story. For new stories, if they're still writing it, I'd prefer between 5k and 10k weekly. Too far below that sweet spot can indicate the same lack of compelling plot as if it were complete, but too high above that can indicate the author is rushing through. If it's longer between chapters, a maximum length of 20k is better because the author could have just released two 10k chapters..

As far as total wordcount, however long it takes you to tell the story, but I'd prefer it to be concise without summarizing and detailed without repetition or filler. Depending on what you're trying to write, that could be anywhere from 10k to 500k. Stories over 500k tend to have too many plot elements and that can confuse the author into making story breaking mistakes. One shots below 10k tend not to have any plot at all.

All of those numbers are affected by the quality of the summary and first chapter.

*** This kind of detailed breakdown is exactly the kind of advice I seek. I really aim to gauge what works and what does not as this field is very unfamiliar to me at present. The plot does involve a considerable number of OCs so avoiding plot breaking mistakes or tangential diversions is essential.

** Personally I prefer quality to quantity. I would rather read a very well written 3k word chapter than a poorly written, in plot, spelling, & grammar chapter of 10k words.
