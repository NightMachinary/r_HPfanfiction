:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
it was a really good dimension travel fic and i think it was on ao3 but i just can't find it!

basically it starts in the new dimension where sirius and severus (friends here) find the golden trio unconscious. then dumbledore and the order from the new dimension try to interrogate the three, and i think they agree to help get rid of the voldemort in this dimension because the trio are closer to defeating him in their dimension then here.

they also have to go get neville and luna who are being kept at malfoy manor(?) i think, and basically the five are a lot crueler (they killed bella trip together) and so the adults from the new dimension are shocked.

eventually the kids help the new dimension defeat the horcuxes and then they have to go back to their dimension and defeat voldemort

i'm not any good at explaining stories but if someone could help me find this if possible that'd be so helpful

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
