I know that immaturity is one of Snape's defining character traits, but I would like to read something in which he overcomes it. 10 years of peace is a lot of time to grow up, question your choices, question your beliefs, stop blindly hating yourself, maybe even get into therapy and maybe even fall in love. I would love to read something where Snape does exactly that. Maybe a new nice colleague is the catalyst, maybe he just decides that it is time, maybe he experiences something that inspires him to give change a try.

I know people who thought of themselves as full blown neo nazis in their youths and have now (over a decade later) been hosting refugee families for free for almost 3 years. People can change, especially if they're young.

Please no student/teacher relationships or anything else between teenagers and adults. I am open to just about anything else.

edit: dammit. it is 10 years. not 11.

Great story, but I do not think it fits the criteria, since he does not really have to let go of his guilt, since he never fucks up as badly as in canon. (I am not talking about calling Lily "mudblood", which is imho in that situation more than forgiveable. I am talking about joining the Death Eaters and actually working for a homicidal psychopath)

** Linkffn(The Best Revenge) kind of fits your request, although it doesn't start until the summer of 1991, right before Harry gets his letter. Snape is bitter but his curiosity gets the better of him and seeing Harry in his “home” completely changes his perspective of the situation.

*** No, I am not looking for canon compliant fics. It's ridiculous to hate a child because of what their father did, as well as ridiculous to despise an entire "house" of Hogwarts. Like "any other Gryffindor" would not be enough, part of growing up is realizing that putting people into groups like that does not change anything about what they actually are and is a highly problematic concept that will only ever cause rivalry and hatred anyway.

***** It surely would, yes. But I think, if he would for example go into therapy or find a deep friendship, that would dig way deeper than "get over what James Potter did". I think a change like this only works if the person scratches more than the surface and tries to understand why everything happened like it did in the first place. Snape is not the type for behavioural therapy imo, the analytic approach would help him a lot more.

This might not be what you are looking for exactly, as it focuses on Snape who survived after the war and Hermione (now an adult, a decade after graduating) finds him. Instead of Snape healing pre-Harry, he finds healing after the final battle. It is very well written and focuses on Hermione x Snape but there is a good build up to it. One of my faves :)

*** Came here to suggest this. I would /never/ normally ship Hermione/Snape (or any teacher-student pair really) but this one is so good I can look past it. I actually prefer Chasing the Sun by loten but that one does have Hermione still in Hogwarts. Nothing romantic happens until she's of age though. I think Chasing the Sun does a better job of examining Snape's flaws and maturing him as a character.
