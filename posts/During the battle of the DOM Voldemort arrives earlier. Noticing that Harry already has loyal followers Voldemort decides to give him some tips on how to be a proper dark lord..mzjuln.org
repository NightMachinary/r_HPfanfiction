** "First, don't be afraid to punish them when they start doing things that displeases you."

"I can't start throwing the cruciatus at anyone that look at me wrong!"

"You can't start throwing the cruciatus at anyone that look at you wrong /yet/."

"Did you just /wink/ at me?"

*** "Ah wait here a moment Harry."

With that Voldemort popped out of the department and returned with a stack of books and two different cards

"Here you go, I've rented out a copy your minions and you, The evil overlords list of dos and donts, the law of evilness and the diabolical scheming planing book from the evil dark lords library"

"The what?!"

Voldemort ignored him "I also got you a library card for said library and your temporary villain license. Here you go remember to turn the books in late, Hormeas Mora doesn't really grasp time anyway and has probably already read the books so he won't care."

"Who?!" The books were shoved into Harry's arms and Voldemort brought two fingers up to his mouth and let out a shrill whistle

"Alright death eaters we are impeding Lord Potter's diabolical plans, that goes against the Dark Lord code!"

A random death eater looked at the dark lord "umm but..."

He was then executed for his ignorance "Well the departments all yours Harry, remember to read up on those books, the proper dark lord licensing test is on the first, show up fashionably late, you just need to flash the provisional license and say Voldemort is your sponsor and you should be good to go." With that Voldemort disappeared with his followers leaving Harry and his "followers" confused and a bit disgruntled, well except Hermione who was eyeing Harry's new books like a dog eyes a steak.

** Over the decades many people asked Albus Dumbledore why the Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump would sideline his political influence to focus on teaching- to which the old man would smile with a quirk of his whiskers and answer that he enjoyed nothing more than to have a hand in shaping the brightest minds of the next generation.

Everyone thought that Tom Riddle wanted to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts because he loved the Dark Arts, and when he took the name Voldemort they thought he wanted nothing more than the power and influence of a Dark Lord. What they never considered was that these two men had more in common than power and blood status.
