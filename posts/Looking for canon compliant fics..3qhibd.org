** - /The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks/ linkffn(6243892) does a very good job recreating the feel of the early books.

- /Weasley Girl/ linkffn(8202739) and sequel do an amazing job of preserving the whimsical feel of those books as well.

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

** I don't read many canon compliant fics (not counting time travel... which is kind of a separate category), but I've got a few very excellent short ones favorited.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10060208/1/So-Why-a-Train]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2398164/1/My-Slytherins]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5715586/1/Proving-Them-Wrong]]) (well, this one isn't short) I really, really love this take on Percy.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories]]) DH and epilogue compliant. Not compliant with all interviews and such.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673824/1/End-Of-the-Line]]) kind of a canon compliant Discworld cross-over. It can hit you in the feels.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
