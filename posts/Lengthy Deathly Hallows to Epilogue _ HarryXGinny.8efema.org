Specific long piece. I only remember key parts such as Harry having an emotional breakdown a few days after the battle and spends time in the hospital wing, missing the memorial. Another would be Harry cleaning up Grimmauld Place and being attacked by Fiendfyre, which covers his entire body.

Can anyone help?


** Try asking on [[/r/HarryandGinny]], or check the megathread there.

** I'm not sure if it's this one (the Firendfyre bit doesn't ring a bell) but everything else matches. The First Day by Little Bird
