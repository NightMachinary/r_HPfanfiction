If dumbledore actually negotiated with the dursleys over them taking in Hary, would there be any realistic motivations for them to treat Hary right other than fear of magic?


** Money. "I'll give you a stipend if you provide a good home to the boy."

Revenge. "Maybe if we're nice to him, he'll renounce the magicals like Lily should've."

Random changes of heart. "Maybe locking the freak in the cupboard won't make him more normal, after all!"

That's about it really, to my mind.

** If we go by their canon characters, I doubt Dumbledore could have made anything to make them treat Harry right. Dumbledore chose to place Harry at Privet Drive for several reasons, but the main one was that, as long as they "welcomed" Harry (no matter how badly), it was the safest place of Earth for him.

Because the Dursley's acceptance was vitale for the blood protection, any coercive methods was out of question: Dumbledore could not use threats ("/Take Harry and treat him right, or else . . ./") or magical compulsion (Imperio, Compusing charm or any potion able to manipulate the mind of someone. And that's without talking about the obvious legal/ethical problems brought by these options.

Reasoning with the Dursleys may work, especially if Dumbledore says something along the lines of : "/Because of your relation with Lily, Dark Wizards may attack you to avenge their Master, but you will be protected as long as you take Hary/". But it's something that Dumbledore already did with the letter he left with Harry (which is why Petunia refused to throw him out in OotP), and we all saw how it went.

Paying them would also not work because, as if we could see throughout the serie, the Dursleys are far from desitute, and the reason why they don't take care of Harry is not because they can't afford to, but because they just don't care.\\
Sure, as long as you pay them, they would probably buy Harry new clothes rather than giving him Dudley cast off, and they may even let him stay in a true bedroom, but they would never "love" him. They still wouldn't care about his school reports, the drawing he brings from school would still end up in the trash while Dudley's are put on the fridge, and they would never stop Dudley from doing what he want. And by accepting to pay them, Dumbledore even take the risk of letting them grow greedy and ask more and more outrageous prices.

Nothing could have "truly" change Harry childhood, because his guardians are just not good people from the start.

** Reputation. If Harry's perceived trouble making ("incurably criminal") was widely considered the result of poor parenting, rather than poor breeding. Or if their treatment of him became public - keeping a second child in the cupboard of a four bedroom house is decidedly ABnormal. Then they would have strong motivation to treat him more normally.

** There is still an option, which I like, that more respectful asking of Dursleys to take care of their son than leaving a baby on the steps overnight (i.e., virtually doing absolutely anything) could get better results. After all, the most normal behaviour for any normal middle-class family is to take care of orphaned members of the family. Preparing them for accidental magic (it will happen, don't worry, it shouldn't be dangerous, nevertheless if you need help, there is the contact here), explaining that suppressing magic by force can lead to unwelcome results (Obscurial), offering consultation and help, yes, financial support as well, could lead to better behaviour of Dursleys.

** You can take a look at [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12999698/8][this fic]]. Or should I say abandoned first chapter?

#+begin_quote
  The idea behind this story is to flip all the Bad!Dumbledore tropes on their heads. In this story, Dumbledore knows about the horcruxes and genuinely believes from the beginning that Harry needs to die to defeat Voldemort, but he actually acts rationally about it. As Snape points out in this chapter, the appropriate thing to do is to treat Harry like a child with a terminal illness, and that is what he does. Dumbledore ensures Harry is well cared for and does everything he can to extend his life. He tries to hunt down the other horcruxes as soon as possible, but he also seeks to delay Voldemort's return as long as possible.

** How about magic itself, rather than the fear of it? Use a compulsion spell or potion on the Dursleys. Put a muggle-repelling charm on Harry's room so he always has a place where they can't go without suddenly remembering something else they need to do. Mess with their minds so they can't see him as anything but normal, maybe by erasing their negative memories of magic and "abnormality" in general, or by putting a spell on Harry to make him always appear normal. Or Harry himself, after fourth year at least, could just set up a magical tent in his room and stock his magical kitchen with food he buys himself. It really is silly that he never uses potions or even his invisibility cloak during the summers. We know the Ministry can't detect enchanted objects; the only reason they knew about the flying car was because muggles saw it.
