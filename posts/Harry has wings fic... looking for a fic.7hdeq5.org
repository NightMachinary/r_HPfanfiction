Looking for a fic where harry is a creature with wings but the creature trait is the more abuse suffered the darker the wings (Harry has really dark wings) I have been looking everywhere!!! Pretty sure the story is during the 5th book. Thanks!!


** I think linkffn(Hell Eyes) may be what you're looking for?

If not, I recommend it anyways.

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

** Maybe linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) ? He has them after about the third chapter if I recall correctly. Ended up with some interesting worldbuilding in this one.

** It kind of reminds me of the Shattered story from Janara's My Short Story Haven. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7289021/10/]]

That story is unfinished and abandoned, though,
