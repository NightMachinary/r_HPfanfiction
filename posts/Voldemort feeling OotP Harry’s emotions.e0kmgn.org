While poor Harry was being tortured to see in the mind of his enemy, Voldy himself was having in own bit of trouble. Voldy has not been himself lately, he seems to have developed a connection to Harry's emotions. This connection seems to have changed the Dark Lord for the worst.

Wormtail:

Voldy: “I'm sick of everybody leaving me out of things!”

Wormtail: ...

Voldy: /snaps out of trance/ “woh, Wormtail you failed me! You failed me Wormtail you made me into an emotional little boy!”

Wormtail: Master no, I did everything you sa-

Voldy: “Arvada Kedvra”

Voldy: snaps back into trance* “Answer me! You can't ignore me forever Wormtail!”
