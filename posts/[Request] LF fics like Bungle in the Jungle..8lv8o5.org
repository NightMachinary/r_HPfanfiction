Hey there. I find myself in the mood for that kind of story.\\
Actually, there are 2 different requests here (although if you got something that fits both please don't refrain from posting).

1. Any story where Harry leaves Hogwarts for a dangerous and epic adventure, but is set to come back afterwards. Bashing acceptable. Most people here must have read Bungle in the Jungle, so I think you can see what I'm talking about.\\
2. Any story writen with the second person limited point of view. No Reader painring, however.

Would some of you guys know of something like that?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Magic of Life) It has a few issues, mostly with grammar and editing, but its quite interesting, and it fits the first option, but IDK if it fits the second, considering I didn't understand what you meant by that.

*** Thanks for the rec, I didn't know this one. Gonna check this ASAP.\\
As for the second point, I'll answer with a few exemples:\\
First person: "I woke up this morning, grabed a shower and a coffee, then headed to work."\\
Third person: "Harry woke up in the morning, grabed a shower and a coffee, then headed to work."\\
And finally what I'm looking for, second person: "you wake up. It's the morning. You grab a shower and a coffee, then head to work."

**** I think I've never read a fic or a story, for that matter, with a second person then.

Feels kinda weird, I really preffer 3rd person.

Thanks for the explanation.

***** It works really well when it's well done. It's extremely good for immersion.\\
You'll usually end up with something that looks like a discussion between the narrator and the reader. You want to use suggestions rather than descriptions when talking about the internal state and dialogue of the main character ('you' in the story) so the reader can fill up the blanks and see himself as the MC.\\
Not the most usual, and probably not the easiest way to write a stroy, but I really enjoyed the few I could get my hands on. A good exemple of that would be Italo Calvino's 'If on a winter's night a traveler' which is partly writen like this.\\
It does require some getting used to.

*** I've just read the first few chapters and it is super rough. Does it get better or is it the same as every fic thats ever had a shopping sequence?

**** Tbh, I don't remember a shopping sequence, except the one where Bill gets Harry his basic stuff for the expedition. It stays a bit rough, with a few issues with the flow and grammar, but the story itself is interesting enough, for me at least, to make up for the loss. Also, IIRC this fic doesn't have that much cliched tropes, with Lords and Wandless Godlike power, and Evil manipulator Dumbledore and whatnot. Not even Weasley Bash. Its also one of the few fics where I found Ron to be understandable and relatable in his jealousy and envy of Harry, which is explained somewhat in-depth by Ron himself.

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
