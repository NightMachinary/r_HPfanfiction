While it hasn't aged well, A black comedy Having Ginny get murdered by Voldemort because she mixed up fear of the name and fear of the wizard, and all that love nonsense was pretty funny.

Seventh Horcrux and Potter ever after are full of them.

What would you say is the funniest approach to a tired plot device in Fanfiction?

****** Linkffn(A Black Comedy)

It get a lot of hate on this sub. But honestly I think most of the hate comes from how often it gets rec'd and held up as the paragon of funny/semi-crack fics. It's definitely a hell of a fun read, but I'd liken it to the new 21 and 22 Jump Street movies. Silly and immature with a few really clever moments

Is that only a recent thing? I remember a time when A Black Comedy was recommended about as often as 7th Horocrux. Certainly one can argue that it hasn't aged well, but when was that inflection point?

******** There may have been some criticism further back, but the first time I saw people heavily panning the fic was about 10 months ago in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a1vbb8/which_objectively_amazing_fanfics_do_you/?depth=15][this thread]]. The caveats of "this fic is funny, but..." or "it hasn't aged well" seemingly only became common after Draquia [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bfx8ar/fic_review_a_black_comedy_by_nonjon_the_au_in/?depth=15][posted a critique]] five months ago.

** I'm not quite sure it counts, but I know that "Harry but raised by X" stories were really popular for a while and they all seemed to take themselves really seriously while still bordering on self-parody.

So when I was reading a random story that appeared to take itself deadly seriously up until the reveal that Harry was raised by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson I just burst out laughing and didn't stop until the story was finished.

**** I think what really made me lose my shit with that one is that the story went out of its way to appear somewhat /plausible/ while still having the dumbest premise in the world. Like it ran on whimsy, but it was closer to say a British sketch where characters behave absurdly but still adhering to some human beheaviour than to say Thirty Hs just nonstop crack.

Something about the fact that Harry defeating Voldemort with a wrestling move would /technically/ work with canon since this was book 1 era where Quirrelmort would die to his touch just makes it even funnier to me. Everything about that story makes me laugh.

** I like how linkffn(What's her name in hufflepuff) addresses the martial arts knowledge trope:

#+begin_quote
  Funny thing is I actually already know martial arts.

  I've been practicing in and out of various dojos since I was 14. I had six years of karate, four years of aikdo, and a year of jujitsu. And as the years went by, and I accumulated more and more knowledge; I finally realized one undeniable truth.

  I kind of suck at it.
#+end_quote

The next paragraph is great as well:

#+begin_quote
  Although, if Bellatrix Lestrange ever tries to hold me down and write mudblood on my arm, that crazy bitch is going to be very very surprised. That's a pretty rare example though of being attacked by someone with similar height/weight (assuming Bellatrix isn't built like a tank and Rowling forgot to mention it). Hell, maybe I could teach Hermione a few tricks? Although, I don't know how 'Hey you wanna wrestle?' wont' sound insane and weird.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes.

But once you get to the end of the first year, it gets a lot better (Susan learns sign language, so you get dialogue, the fun begins). It's an OP Harry power trip, but ot avoids a lot of the pitfalls usually associated with them.
