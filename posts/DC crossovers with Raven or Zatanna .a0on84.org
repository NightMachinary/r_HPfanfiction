They don't necessarily have to be paired with Harry (though that would be good). They just have to be central characters to the story.


** The few DC crossovers I've read have Harry severely weakened or for some inexplicable reason his magic's not enough against Zatanna. Like, saying long backwards phrases gotta take more time than silent casting, but somehow Harry gets beat up by her.

*** Sounds like that dumb fucking Smallville crossover where the author explains DC wizards - in a crossover where they share the same world - are better than HP wizards in the story because DC's homo magi are born with magic.

As opposed to HP, where- oh wait...

  ...doesn't necessarily STAY there. When two groups travel to Sin City in an attempt to recover from recent events, no one could have predicted the consequences. Bloody Brandy's Vegas Vacation challenge, fem!Harry/Raven, femslash, NOT Tonks/Lupin

** I remember one of Zatanna being astounded over a Young Justice member knowing about the wizarding world; it would be better to go see if the old yj_anon_meme is still around because there were archives that did contain it.

There is this one that is related though:

  HP/YJ. "Dick." "Yes?" "Why are you here?" Under normal circumstances, Wally would be thrilled to have his best friend over for the weekend. However, his family was over. All 9 Redheads, and 2 friends. He was never gonna survive the weekend. R&R
