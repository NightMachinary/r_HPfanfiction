Looking for a fanfiction where Harry doesn't care about drama, Dumbledore, Voldemort, etc. But not edgy.

Harry can still be evil and dark though, as long as it ain't cringy, preferably no pairings.

Kinda gave up on searching for them because all I kept on finding were extremely edgy ones and ones where Harry was acting like a kid trying to impress an older classmate by replying "no" when the teacher calls out if everyone was having a good day

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
