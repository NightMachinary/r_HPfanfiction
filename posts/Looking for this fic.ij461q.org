  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

*** That fic came up with two ways to stop the transformation, and three ways to handle the second one. I haven't read enough of the sequel to see which one they went with.
