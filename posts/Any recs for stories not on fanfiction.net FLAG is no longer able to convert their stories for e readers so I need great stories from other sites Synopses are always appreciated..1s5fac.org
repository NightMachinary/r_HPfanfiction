** [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/][Fanfiction Downloader]] handles ffnet well. Quite a few other sites too.

Archive of Our Own is my primary source of fics outside of ffnet (for general HP fics).

Since fanfiction is so varied, when asking for recommendations it would be helpful if you provided details on your current tastes - genres, pairings, sexual orientation of main relationships...

*** Agree with all this I loved flag but using A03 as a place to read fic, they have a button to just download in any format forgoing the need for a third party bit.

**** Ao3 seems mostly slash, which is not my cup of tea.

** Fanfiction.net has certainly done us readers a disservice by this action. My other main FF site has been [[http://www.fanficauthors.net/nsns/][Fanfictionauthors]] but they generally offer their own choice of download formats.

** harrypotterfanfiction.com still works with FLAG, and also offers Kindle downloads through the site. If you like NC-17 stuff, there's nothing like that on the site, but there are lots of amazing, well-written stories of all lengths, genres, pairings, etc.

*** While I found the site usable for finding content, from an author's perspective it is like shoving bamboo under your fingernails to get any fics uploaded. Also, most of the new stories are ultra-dry, canon re-roofing gen fics or "extra scene from the movies" style romances.

I just gave up trying to use it after the third different procedural problem had a chapter once again rejected for upload, a process which must be done on a per-chapter basis by one of their human staff and can takes weeks. They seem to have the attitude that they are doing you a favor by hosting your fic, not the other way around, which is the actual situation as you are the person making content from which they make ad money.

I have a problem with their attitude, if that isn't clear.

Maybe one-shot authors can handle that, but it was too frustrating for me so I just kept using FFN and AO3 instead. The monstrous bureaucratic process might discourage some casual writers who don't enjoy that sort of thing, and I don't personally like the sorts of authors who seem to thrive in the environment, but maybe someone put something interesting up a while back and it is just buried in the bland muck.

**** Hey, to each their own. If you want to play in somebody else's sandbox, you have to follow their rules. Just my own opinion, but I don't mind wading through a few cookie cutter teen-angst-premarital-pregnancy-true-love-forever fics to avoid seeing the brain-scarring Snape-Harry slash fics on FF.net. As far as posting stories, I've posted 11 in the two years I've been part of the site, including a 41-chapter novel. If you take the time to read and understand the rules, it's not really so bad.

***** That's the thing. I couldn't have cared less about "playing in their sandbox." I just wanted to get the fic out there on multiple sites so I could get more feedback on my writing style from readers. Oddly enough, FFN is the /only/ site that has given me that. All the others, people simply read quietly and don't review.

It was when the admins started saying I needed full legal citations for use of the word "Terminator" in a chapter that I couldn't deal with their bullshit any further. So I didn't, because there are a /ton/ of other, better sites out there. Which is why their attitude amazes me. Their process sucked and there was no upside.
