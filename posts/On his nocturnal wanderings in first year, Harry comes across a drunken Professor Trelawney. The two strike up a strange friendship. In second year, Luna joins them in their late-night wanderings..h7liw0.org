Bonus points if other insomniacs/crazies/outcasts also occasionally show up and it ends up turning into a weird little explorer's club. -Inspired by several sleepless nights.


** I'm tempted to give this a try. I have wanted to write a H/LL fic for awhile. Isn't there already a long Trelawney as mentor fic out there though?

** Tagging [[/u/books_dresses][u/books_dresses]] & [[/u/MoDthestralHostler][u/MoDthestralHostler]] as well, but here is my teaser:

Petunia Dursley loved astrology. Every Sunday morning, she'd read her son's and husband's horoscopes to them. Sometimes, when she was in a good mood and he'd made a good show of cooking diner for the family, she would read them to her nephew as well.

For Harry Potter, those times with his Aunt were the only thing that could be called affectionate in his difficult childhood. So when he encountered Professor Sybill Trelawney, a real life Seer that could tell the future, at the edge of the Forbidden Forest one night, it was only natural that some of that positivity and longing would transfer to the Divination instructor.

Follow the coming of age journey of a young boy, a child of Prophecy, as he divines the secrets of fortune, friendship, fame, and just might find love along the way.
