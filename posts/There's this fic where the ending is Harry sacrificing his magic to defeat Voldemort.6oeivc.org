** Was it the one where goblins were involved somehow, and after winning Harry is living disguised as a Muggle? He even changed his name and became blond IIRC.

** You may be thinking of a fic where Harry and Hermione discover a spell that removes the magic from an object or person. They deal with all the Horcruxes and Harry lures Voldemort into a shed where the spell is triggered to affect both of them.
