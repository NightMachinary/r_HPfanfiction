***** M/m slash. Mostly Snape/Harry. Mostly fairly - well, I'm not sure "fluffy" is the right word, but non-angsty. Snape is usually OOC, more reasonable and sympathetic than his canon self. The exception is "Fallen Far from the Tree," which is a wonderfully nasty noncon fic I found pretty disturbing and which I enjoyed precisely because it up-ended my preconceptions about RaeWhit's work.
