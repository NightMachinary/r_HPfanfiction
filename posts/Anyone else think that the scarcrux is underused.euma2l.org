I know that in canon it is used to connect tom and harry but i always end up thinking that there were no other consequences to housing part of another's soul? Anything from stopping harry from functioning as best he could to actually having a conscience

there are a few fics where harry merges with the soul piece and gains toms memories and I really do enjoy those so long as they don't end up being edgy just because or are just powerwanks with lots of bashing


** I remember reading a fan concept that the reason Harry almost went to Slytherin was because the Sorting Hat caught a glimpse of Tom's soul. Maybe this could be extended upon to show Harry's personality slowly being warped by it?

Like, if someone has something they don't want their parents to find and they know there's a floorboard in their room that isn't nailed down, what about that situation makes you think someone wouldn't put two and two together and hide their stuff in the floor? You make it sound like you think everyone that isn't super intelligent and hasn't been abused is borderline retarded and wouldn't be able to think of a better way to hide something than just tossing it in their closet. At this point, it's not even Harry's cleverness I'm talking about, I'm just honestly confused about why you think this is such an odd thing for someone to do. I'm also not sure why you think you'd need to have a particularly stressful or harsh life to have an item you want to hide or protect.

************** You know that's not actually true in real life, though, right? I get we're talking in a subreddit dedicated to a children's book series, but you know real life isn't a children's book series, right? In real life, the simplest plans are the ones people think of first because they're so simple and obvious. Hiding something in a loose floorboard is very simple and obvious, so most people will think it. That kind of story-telling cliche is what authors that can't think of actually clever things to write fall back on.

Even your own logic doesn't make sense. In the beginning of this thread, hiding something in some floorboards was apparently complex enough that doing so makes Harry clever because most people are too stupid to think to do it and putting them under a bed or in a closet is the simple and common tactic. Now you're saying that the simple tactic is actually the clever one because people won't think of it for some reason (???) and hiding something in a floorboard is actually so stupidly simple that most people will overlook it.

******* Harry is clever and cunnings, WHEN he fells the absolute need to. Something often passed over is that harry was a damaged child form the onset. he was already conditioned to only do the bare minimun, and the mind seldom is logical (ironic isn't it) so he already had a mentallity to only do as well as he needed in EVERYTHING unconsiosly. Clever is clever, no matter if it was a fluke gamble from a 12yo, a logic leap on a fucked up time-paradox or a double bullshit pretending to be dead and then getting lost in the haze of battle. thing is he really only put his gray matter between his ear to work, when he absolutely felt cornered. I can tell you that 80%; if not more, of our traumas and fixations are devolopted on our early childhoods. Just think about it and connect the dots.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** I think after it being a part of him from the get go, Harry becomes used to it for the most part except the obvious connection and the consequences of it. Probably never gets a headache again after it's gone. Overall that one horcrux was probably the weakest of them all because it was accidental and Voldemort had already split his soul 5 other times and I assume each time it was split, the soul he put in each was a smaller part. It never did possess him or try to overcome him like the locker or diary. I do like when fanfics use it to help influence the actions of the Dursleys. We know what they can do to a magical being so imagine what it would do to someone that at the very least dislikes them who couldn't fight it at all. Any negative thought etc would have been magnified and of course Harry would have been hated. Petunia wasn't a witch and was jealous of Lily and didn't want anything to do with her because of it from what we know. Imagine seeing her nephew show up, no explanation beyond a letter. Magic split the sisters apart and now she has to look at her magical nephew as he grows up, look at his eyes and see Lily. The pain and suffering, the jealousy and hate are made worse by the Horcrux influencing her and Vernon.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** The scar Horcrux is the magical concept I despise most in all of canon. It makes no sense IMO that Voldemort, after just being defeated by Lily's protection, is able to overcome it with only a piece of his soul.

That's why I try to get rid of it as quickly as possible in any of my stories. I also don't enjoy it as a plot point because by my logic, it should not be there in the first place.

*** In some stories it says that most of the protection magic was spent fighting Voldemorte's 'Avada Kedavra'.

And then Dumbledore uses the protective magic to protect the Dursleys' house, causing it to need more time to recover to fight the scarcrux, and as the years went by Harry needed the magic to recover from injuries and malnutrition.

And each school year the magic was used to help Harry get through the challenges of the year.

I know that this theory has many holes, but it is the best I found.

No, if you spend the "energy" to protect the house, that protection should then drive off the soul shard as that is where the "energy" went.

*** Well, Harry was able to handle most of the horcruxes (terrible conjugation: shouldn't it be horcruces?) without setting them aflame, including his scar itself. (The only ones he never touches are the ring --- which he only saw after the soul fragment was removed --- and the snake.) The diary didn't react even when the soul shard was active, when Harry was communicating with it. We're never given any details on Lily's protection (surely she's not the only mother to refuse to move aside to let her child be killed), but from the given facts it seems that it only affects Voldie when embodied.

** I can't remember details, but at least one fic I've read has his holly-and-phoenix wand no longer be a good match for him once the scarcrux is gone. I've also seen it change his magical signature (which I don't believe is a canon concept).

In the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] series by flamethrower (Snarry, still in progress), a horcrux in a living being has to destroy something in the host to make room. It's determined that, in Harry's case, it's his sense of self-preservation: he only acts when it will protect others, disregarding any thought to his own safety. It explains why he puts up with the Dursleys' behavior.

In a few fics, such as Some People Never Learn from Their Mistakes by Elvirakitties linkao3(7483032), "Tom" talks to Harry in his head.

Many fics have Harry's magic damaged by the removal/killing of the scarcrux.

On a side note, I like the fics where Harry gets hit with an AK either at the end of the TriWiz or in the Ministry, and the horcrux is gone ahead of Dumbledore's schedule. (A guilty pleasure are fics where the goblins or some other agency remove it, because of course Dumbledore's hubris would not allow him to even research whether others can remove it.) One fic I've read (The Accidental Animagus, perhaps?) has surgeons physically remove the scarring, which goes all the way through his skull into his brain.
