So something where Harry leaves Magical England (or just the Voldemort conflict, tbh) and goes off on an adventure and ends up brutally reforging himself in the ruins of a civilization destroyed by hubris and/or breaking seals not meant to be broken ect.

if you haven't read it, here's the link: linkffn(Bungle In the Jungle)


** linkffn(By the Divining Light) and it's sequel is amazing.

Might not be exactly what you wanted, but also try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone).

For anyone who wants the pacing and writing like Bungle in the Jungle, there's an unknown fic that I loved : linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue) starts differently, but goes on to amazing action.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
