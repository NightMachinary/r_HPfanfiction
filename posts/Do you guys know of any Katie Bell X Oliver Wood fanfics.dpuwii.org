** I've not read any with this as a main pairing, but there seems to be a few one shots and shorts with them as a focus here:

Hopefully you find something good among that list :)

PS: "Request" would be a better flair to use for this post. "Recommendation" implies that /You (OP)/ are recommending a specific fic.

**** Linkao3(5025334) That one is about 2k. It's not that long and you can really give it a go. I highly recommend it. I thought that it was really good. It's a little soulmate Au and for the most time it's just Wood thinking about Quidditch. Their Rivalry is very well done in this story as close to canon as you can go with that pairing. That's the fic that got me into that ship.

#+begin_quote
  Oliver Wood wakes up in the Hospital Wing a week after his first Quidditch game ever with a head injury and his soulmate's thoughts wound around his left wrist. Frankly, he's more concerned about missing the Quidditch game.
