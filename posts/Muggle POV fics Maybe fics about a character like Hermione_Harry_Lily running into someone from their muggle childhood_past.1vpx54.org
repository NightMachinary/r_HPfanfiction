I love fics that focus on outsider/muggle impressions of the characters we know so well. I also love fics that illustrate how much the characters have grown apart from the muggle world or simply how much they have grown as people.

For example, I read a fic by MagEd about a primary school classmate of Harry's running into him in a jewelry store. There's another one on Ff.net about Hermione and Ron going to Hermione's cousin's wedding by KDSanders.

Are there any other fics about characters' muggle childhoods and muggle POV fics that people would suggest?


** I can't believe no one has mentioned this one yet! I found it on this very subreddit a while back.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] by Northumbrian. "The locals in a sleepy corner of the Cheviot Hills are surprised to discover that they have new neighbours. Who are the strangers at Drakeshaugh?"

It's a mystery with bits of other genres thrown in, told entirely from the point of view of a muggle woman after strange new people move into the neighborhood...

*** If you like this one Northumbrian has another snippet set farther forward in time where a muggle kid from the Strangers story is in college (or grad school?) and reencounters Harry's son James Potter and starts to realize maybe some of her childhood make-believe wasn't made up after all.

** I only have a couple oneshots to offer, but I really like both of them:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet by CheddarTrek]] - Colin Creevey leaves his camera with a muggle girl but never returns to collect it. (sad)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9273375/1/Raising-Hermione][Raising Hermione by chelseyb]] - They knew, when they sent her off to that school for witches, that Hermione would change. They had no idea how much. (from the perspective of Hermione's parents; a bit sad)

*** I second all of those. In HP and the Natural 20, it wasn't a failed Obliviation IIRC, it was the people destroying the monitor and not the body of the computer.

** One of the best ones I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss][Hocus Pocus Adele Polkiss]]

#+begin_quote
  HPxOC. Runs along with the original storyline. Adele Polkiss is the younger sister of Piers Polkiss, a close friend of Dudley Dursley. This way she meets Harry Potter, a curious boy with a mysterious past, and a wonderful secret... Magic! COMPLETE

** Well, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes][Behind Blue Eyes]] by Paffy.

The first seven chapters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire][the Refiner's Fire]] by Abraxan would qualify.

There was also this short but heartfelt fic about James falling for Lily, even though she was just a muggle. Can't remember the name or how I found it.

The trick is to find a story where the muggle viewpoint isn't just a holier-than-thou rant about how stupid the wizarding world is and how much better things would be if they adopted cell phones and listened to CDs of bands that may not have even existed during the story timeframe.

** This fic was very well written, and I enjoyed every moment of it:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2053712/1/][A Muggle In The Magic World]] by Phoenixfox Harry Potter u:02-01-2005 - It is absolutely impossible for a muggle to find her way into Diagon Alley, visit Hogsmeade, see Hogwarts and play a pivital role in the magic world without having any magical abilities. This fanfic proves it all wrong. COMPLETED. +01-03-2011
