:END:
I remember once I read a fic on FF.net were Harry believes that the Hufflepuffs are trying to take over the world or something and at some point Harry discovered a secret area in the castle filled with traps and obstacles and when he finally gets through it, he comes through a trap door under Hufflepuffs table in the great hall.

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner. AU

** The Hufflepuff conspiracy is actually a recurring joke in many stories, I remember one in which Harry went into Hufflepuff (while being the archetypal baby dark lord -the type that becomes “evil” because he thinks it's sounds cool and ends just coming off as sort of cute) and asked Quirrel for help in buying Ron's soul in exchange for a card, from there Voldemort ran off with the fact and came to the conclusion that Hufflepuff alumni were the power behind the throne.
