I mean a story that incorporates e.g. Greek or Roman mythology. I'm also fine with stories where the gods in question are simply really powerful wizards (after all Dionysus/Bacchus was said to be a human king before he was deified). And no, I'm not looking for a Percy Jackson crossover.

Has anyone got any recs like that?

Good.

Because you won't find any worth reading.

**** Yeah, that's definitely one of the best of the lot. There's maybe two or three others that I would recommend. Everything else, including everything in the PJO fandom that /isn't/ a crossover... It's just so terrible it makes me depressed. It feels like there's not a single author in that fandom that's above the age of sixteen, and none of them can write worth a damn.

***** It's so strange that I've not seen a single decent PJO story. It truly dumbfounds me. Like, if you go to the most popular HP stories, you get tripe like Harry Crow, but there's some genuinely good stuff right next to it. But going to the most popular PJ stories, you get nothing good at all, even if you go back like 10 pages. It's so weird.

****** linkffn(Son of the Western Sea) is the only legitimately /good/ PJO fic I've ever read. I heavily recommend it. Linkffn(The Death God Alliance) is also a good one, but it's a Kane Chronicles crossover.

But yeah, the sheer amount of bad fanfiction, even rated by favorites, is astounding. It's the third biggest book fandom and yet we get shit like PJxArtemis and PJxHera sprawled across the top fifty? Unbelievable.

******* Thanks for the recs, and although I dislike slash, I'll give Western Sea a shot.

PJ/Hera at least has some potential if someone goes for a "Percy becomes a god" route, then again, one of my favorite fics is Harry/Merope, so that may be my fondness for strange pairings coming through. But PJ/Artemis is absolutely unforgivable and always reeks of author avatar and Stu crap.

** Linkffn(Yule ball panic) and its sequels have a lot to do with feminine mysteries, and goddesses and rituals play a large part of the plot as you move on. In Linkffn(patron) there are a lot of references and invocation to Gods as well.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
