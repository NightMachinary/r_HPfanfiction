No fics were girls just jump onto his lap. He's got to be a smooth talker. No slash, I just can't see him as being gay


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] definitely fits, lots of really great action too.

** Strangely or not, Harry as a smooth talker seems to require a change of House.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What would Slytherin Harry Do?]] by Big D on a Diet.

An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

*** While I wouldn't consider Harry the Hufflepuff a Casanova character, that fanfic /is/ really good, funny, has a few awesome twists, and has a sequel for second year.

** Nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] definitely qualifies. Harry's and Sirius's ability to pick up women with surprise morning-after connections to one another is a running gag throughout.

Joe6991's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wasteland of Time]] also features a smooth-talking, flirtatious, Armani-suit-wearing Harry.

Harry in Perspicacity's pair of one-shots [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/10/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Sirius Gives Harry 'The Talk']] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/11/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Broom Closets and Socks]] might qualify in a pinch (though most of the action is off-screen).

*** I remember reading A Black Comedy. It was wonderful.

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time was also enjoyable.

You have excellent taste in fanfiction.
