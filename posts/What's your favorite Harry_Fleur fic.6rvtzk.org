***** Write.

Writing is work. That doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable. But it takes time and effort to produce. And the only way to produce it is to put in the time and effort. A lot of people think you get an idea and it magically appears on the paper. This is not the case.

It's beyond important to plan everything. And then to do it. If that means setting aside a schedule or whatever works for you then yes do it. Writing is often very far from rewarding during the process. And often it sucks while writing. The reward comes when it's finished.

My biggest general advise usually shocks people. Muses are bullshit, writer's block is a fallacy that just means you're looking for an excuse to do something else. Treat writing professionally. Don't treat it whimsically. Make yourself do it. Sometimes it will feel like a chore.

*** Why do you like Dagger and Rose? I thought the world of magic was well expanded but I hated the fic. Harry was powerful but a complete push over and no one gave any shits or reacted appropriately when people (I forget who exactly, Luna??) were killed in the crossfire or Fleur was raped. All moments of vindication were glanced over and no one really expressed emotion afterward.

****** I have read most of these as well but for some reason I stopped somewhere in the middle of gods amongst men which is strange cus Harry/Fleur is in my top 3 favorite pairings so I usually finish those stories but I cant remember why I stopped. Also Whispers in the night hasnt been updated for a couple weeks which is weird because he usually updates every week like clockwork.
