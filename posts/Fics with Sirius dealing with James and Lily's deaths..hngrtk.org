I tried googling things like 'Sirius grieving', but all I got was fics with Harry mourning Sirius.

Please help.


** Linkffn(The Bureaucratic Error). It's a good fanfiction, but if you're interested in just Sirius dealing with their deaths and readjusting, then read the 'Sirius, X' chapters. But there's definitely more of that sprinkled throughout other chapters.
