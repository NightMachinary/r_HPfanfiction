In The Deathly Hallows Ron manages to open the passage to the Chamber of Secrets by randomly hissing. You know what else hisses? Pipes, whispering students, cats... In retrospect, a password that just requires random hissing noises isn't very secure at all.

In addition, in The Philosophers Stone, Hermione hides in the girls bathroom, where a troll comes in and smashes some sinks. Change the bathroom and it's entirely possible for the troll to smash the entrance open.


** I am betting all my fortune that JKR did it to demonstrate that finally the legendary trait of Salazar Slytherin did not confer any advantage exclusive to his lineage for them to rule.

*** Yeah, "emulated". This has always been a point of contention for me.

Three/four times in a row? (first door down, Second door down, Second door back?, First door back)

Ron was a parseltongue. Being a pureblood, it's highly improbable that he wasn't related to Slytherin. Him winning the lottery for the parseltongue ability is way easier to explain mimicking a magical language from memory. If that is even possible. His reaction to it is how he was raised to HATE Slytherins.
