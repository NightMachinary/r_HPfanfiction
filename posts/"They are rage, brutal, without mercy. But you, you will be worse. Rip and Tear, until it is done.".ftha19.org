Because the hype for Doom is Eternal.


** (its not that good of a prompt writing but hey... I'm sleepy and just finished rewatching Jacks play Doom eternal and thought why not.. Enjoy my brain fart -_- )

All was lost. At times like this Harry wished he still has his magic, but there's no use in dwelling in what ifs. his magic is busy keeping him alive and boosting his physical prowess. That life felt so far away from him. Like a fleeting dream, it's gone all that's left is the carnage and blood. All that struggle for his friends and family, was all for nothing in the end. Nothing can stop him anymore, after all, he had nothing to lose anymore. Only vengeance is left.

the title of Master of death, a title that allowed his survival in hell and kept his magic in, adapted his magic for a far more suited for to combat the hellspawn. Kept him alive in hell, kept stitching his body together and function to assist him to fulfill the burden it bestowed upon him. A wand that chooses the strongest as well as one willing to fight. A stone that tests temptations, why choose someone who can fall prey to hells lies. A cloak, one who knows death but does not fear it. He found out its true purpose on his second foray in the in between. In the end, Harry was always fated to kill the Dark Lord. Not a dark lord but The Dark Lord of hell, the king. And the only way to him is through his horde of semons

The battle with Voldemort had ended as his win but it was against lazy wizards who rely on magic to do everything. He misses it even. Those were simpler time. If Harry knew what being a master of death entails, he would have chucked that snitch out and never touched that stone. He knew, with the help of the ressurection stone that the afterlife is real. He should have realized hell is real too. But he never thought it was a lot closer to home, just a portal away.

It all started with a mission. Mundanes got a hold of a unique type of energy called Argent. Surprisingly, the people in Department Of Mystery has figured that this was in fact a bridge between technology and sorcery. The ultimate fusion of science and magic, what humans could be. But the muggles security is tight when it come to this energy and the ruins where they found it, the only way to do it is to infiltrate their ranks. It was simple, pretend to be a muggle soldier to be stationed to one of the installation. The job was aiming for a long con, thus changes had to be permanent and not simply a swap the imposter in. Harry had, in his own face, under a new identity enlisted. He never thought that literally hell will pour out of the moons of Mars. Nor did he expect his new muggle soldier friends end in such a gruesome death.

His magic faltered and rebelled within him when the raw energy of hell filled the vicinity. It enhanced him the way the hell magic strengthen those demons. He cannot fully bring them out but it roared beneath his skin. And just like that, the loss of his new Marine family, senseless death and sense of impending doom, had caused his own strength to be amplified by magic and anger. Backed to a corner so far away from he had tore through the bodies of the demons he cannot let them reach earth.

Unfortunately for Harry, upon finally returning to earth he found out that he was too late. Magic is easily corruptible and it seemed that the gore nest and the launch point of the invasion was the portal, the veil of death. Thus the invasion started at the hearth of the Wizarding world. It was from a discarded report of one of the unspeakable did he find out what those tentacles fed on. It fed on magical life. All the wizard Harry had ever met had been consumed and incorporated into that Flesh. No wonder some areas have tentacle like cancerous flesh growth while others didn't. Those that did were areas with wizard, we're wizards. All the magic in the earth were tainted and consumed. No wonder the cloak that fused with Harry's body prevents Harry from accessing his magic when he means to use it outside his body. It would have been corrupted and turned him into a flesh architecture.

All of the Wizarding world is gone, all of earth's magic is gone but Harry is still here. he can't die until he kills or is killed by the king of hell. Harry intends to take as many as he can with him.

Rip and tear. Full of rage and brutality, without mercy the master of death is born. Only death and carnage follows him, a beast that only last for the death and destruction of all of hell.
