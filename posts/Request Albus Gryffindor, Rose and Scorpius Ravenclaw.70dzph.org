So in my headcanon I have Albus as Gryffindor, Rose and Scorpius as Ravenclaw. Was wondering if there was any stories that had them sorted in those houses?

Any rating is fine. I don't follow Cursed Child myself, but if the story has hints of Cursed Child or follows it somewhat then I suppose it's fine. I just don't care much for Cursed Child myself.

I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash pairings as well.
