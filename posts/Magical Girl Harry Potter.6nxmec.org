By the power of TRUTH AND LOVE!


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved]]) It's a bit humorous but eventually begins to unravel. Still worth a few giggles for the sheer bizarreness of the idea.

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon

#+begin_quote
  At the end of Harry Potter's second year the horcrux of Tom Riddle stored in a diary learns that the world he encompasses is quite small and that real magic is far more powerful and in some ways more terrifying than any dark arts could be. In the eye that is the universe magical Britain is no more than a single photon. fem!Harry, master of death!Harry

  !Crack!Mahou Shoujo AU! In which Harry and Tom are both very much female, very much attracted to each other, and very much costume-wearing, weapon-toting, badass magical girls. And this is a story of how they got there. Oneshot; FEMSLASH TMR/HP
