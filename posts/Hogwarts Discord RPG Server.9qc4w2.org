This is a Hogwarts School of Magic Discord Server, everyone MUST be 18+ to play.

We are looking for people interested in play with us in a serious server, with lot of RPG in it. Warning, we have some NSFW channels.

We are open and accepting applications, but that doesn't mean we accept everyone. You must pass an interview with a member of the Teacher's Council to be accepted. We had problems in the past with people who came.. and didn't put any effort. We want everyone playing enjoying, so this time we are more strict.

** Game starts November 1st.

You are a new Student in Hogwarts, with an age of 13-15 years old, and you could choose between 2 Houses of the School (We want to keep it balanced, but also give choice).

We have a complete economic system that makes playing more interesting and rewarding... duels, bets, paying others to do you favors... All that system is integrated in the RPG game.

So... if you want to joins please come and take a look here:
