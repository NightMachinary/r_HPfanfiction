#+TITLE: Obscurials are much more of a danger than in canon. They form far more easily, don't spontaneously die at a young age, and can level small towns rather than at most damaging a few city blocks. Even worse, repressed magic can sit silent for years before forming an Obscurus out of the blue.

Here's some details that might go in a story with this premise:

- When it comes up in conversation that Harry grew up with muggle relatives and they don't like magic, all the other students are terrified and insist he go to the infirmary to get tested for repressed magic
- All the people who say bully muggleborns are in Gryffindor, since muggles aren't aware of proper protocols for minimizing the risk of raising a magical child, and poking a possible WMD is a very Gryffindor-at-its-worst thing to do
- The magic supremacism Grindelwald's supporters believed in came from the previous generation's parents telling them from birth that magic was the best thing ever so that they wouldn't develop repressed magic; since then, techniques have been refined to have fewer side effects

  - The pre-Grindelwald generation was the first one to understand the problem well enough to take steps to solve it. Ariana Dumbledore was among the last magical-born Obscurials, and Albus feels guilt over not pushing his parents to follow the newly-developed protocols, in addition to over maybe having fired the curse that killed her
  - Or alternatively for why this wasn't already fixed by the time Ariana was born: (1) obscurials used to be like in canon, but then (2) an Unspeakable in the pre-Grindelwald generation developed a spell to gather ambient magic to power wards when ley lines are inaccessible. (3) kids' repressed magic started copying this spell in order to get backup, rather than just brute-forcing an Obscurus, and (4) with the assistance of ambient magic, an Obscurus is more destructive to the environment and safer for the host, and without the host's safety at risk, it takes way less mistreatment for a child's magic to try blowing things up.


** I don't know why more people don't like to write about that facet of HP movie!cannon that Fantastic Beasts gave us. (It fits Harry's upbringing pretty closely) is it just because it was Fantastic Beasts that inroduced it?

*** It's a fairly common sentiment to avoid all post-canon stuff because you don't want to have your view of HP stained by it. It started with the whole twitter account/pottermore thing containing some ridiculous shit, then really escalated with cursed child being the mess that it was.

*** But Harry didn't repress his magic. He performed several feats while trying to protect himself from the Dursleys. Also Dursley don't actively try to prevent him from performing magic. Seeing as how Harry after 9 years is OK to mention flying motorcycles to his magic-hating uncle and aunt, he clearly doesn't know the consequences (Dudley plays videogames and watches shows which might involve un-normal things). My best guess is that Harry is normally a neglected child who gets blamed when unusual things happen. But he is not specifically told to not perform them, nor does he know he is performing them (hence bringing forth punishment) in order to know what to control.

**** It would make a great canon divergence fic though. If Harry was a bit more observant and linked his aunt hating the word “magic” to him performing strange unexplainable feats and getting punished for them, I can easily see how it would happen. The first line of the book is “Mr & Mrs Dursley... were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much” so wouldn't it be feasible for Harry to want to be normal too to fit in? To try and repress that part of him that isn't quite like the others because if he was normal, they might love him.

Without any preconceptions, kids in that situation notice the strangest, specific details if it will help them avoid something that will get them in trouble.

*** Fantastic Beasts is a decently interesting story so long as you don't try to reconcile it with canon. Best to imagine that it's taking place in some /other/ world of witches and wizards.

** August 6, 1945

The bombardier on the /Enola Gay/ was having second, third and forth thoughts about his mission. But the war effort was counting on his entire crew. As the B-29 bomber passed over the drop zone, the bombardier, with a tear in his eye, shoved the terrified child out the bomb bay doors, "Sorry kid."

Moments later a mushroom cloud began to form.
