Okay, so I know Hermione has been called 'Brightest Witch of Her Age' but that's just it. Of Her Age. I want to take in everything such as things like Lily Evans, Snape's potions skills and it is said that Bart Crouch Sr. speaks somewhere around 150-200 languages.

I don't believe Hermione is the smartest ever [I am a little biased] but I would love to be proven wrong if it is so.

** Going by academic prowess being a strong indicator for magical prowess, Dumbledore and Riddle would be the front runners, but Slughorn managed to coast by pretty swell on his people skills until everything went tits up. Ollivander certainly managed to master a branch of magic considered to be weird and fanciful even by other wizards, and Snape invented spells, improved upon potions recipes, and defied Voldemort.

However, I would consider naming a singular person as the most intelligent is a fairly useless endeavour, especially when intelligence can manifest in so many different ways.

** Rowena Ravenclaw is the obvious pick, being noted for her intelligence even among her peers.

If we go with the 'not actually Death' origin for the Deathly Hollows, the Peverell brothers created three of the greatest magical artifacts in history.

Nicholas Flamel cracked the secret to the philosopher's stone.

I'm sure other notable wizards throughout history were no slouches either, Merlin, Morganna.

** I don't think you can make 'the most' argument in terms of intelligence. You can differentiate between smart and not-so-much people, but when regarding those on highest level it's not quite possible to discern. I.e. Einstein was a genius, but so was Marie Curie, Oppenheimer, Tesla, Faraday, Newton, Euler and a myriad of other people.

When it comes to HP - Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort, Founders, Merlin and Flamel are their own league, and I don't think Hermione measures up to them. She's studious and not an idiot, but whatever scholarly achievement she has is due to immense amount of studying - from what we're shown she's one of the most studious people in her year.

In a roundabout way - out of Weasley children the twins are probably the most magically talented (as far as we see, we have no info on Bill and Charlie), definitely beating Percy in terms of skill and talent, but not amount of study. Percy got 12 Owls. Hermione got 10 or 11 (?) - thus I'm pretty sure they could be considered comparable - but definitely not amongst the smartest wizards ever, or even alive.

** Albus Dumbledore followed closely by TMR and Gellert Grindelwald in that order. There's a large gap between them Snape and maybe Ollivander. McGonagall, Flitwick, and Slughorn aren't too far behind them. I think you can make a case for James and Sirius in either group.

*** I think James and Sirius would be on Snape's level, if not higher. They're regarded by their teachers (and Dumbledore if I recall correctly?) as skilled and bright. Sirius pulls off a nonverbal conjuration after 12 years in prison with a mis-matched wand.

I think that Tom Riddle would tie or out-edge Dumbledore though. It's clear from canon that intelligence is an important factor when it comes to spell casting (and learning the theory to cast spells). Given that Voldemort draws out Dumbledore with the elder wand and forces a temporary sacrifice from Fawkes as well as Dumbledore's comments on Voldemort, Voldemort is definitely a peer of Dumbledore. Grindelwald is behind both though.

Tbh, I wasn't thinking about the duel. It was strictly what they achieved academically. Dumbledore was published, receiving alchemy awards, won every spellcasting award Hogwarts had, and was writing to the father of theory, a notable historian, and creator of the philosopher's stone all before leaving Hogwarts.

I always wonder about this line of thought. I'd think that the older the better for highly skilled and knowledgeable Wizards, so long as they're not one foot in the grave. Greater knowledge and practice and skill could easily make up for slowing down due to age.

****** I've always had it that, like all things, wizards had a peak; a prime. Dumbledore was clearly more able than the average 70 yr old muggle to say nothing of those over a century, but I think /he/ wasn't as fast as he was even a decade prior. He might have even said so in HBP.

Edit: “You're quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made the back of Harry's neck prickle unpleasantly. “I am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand . . .”

***** Eh, Dippet lived to 300. Dumbledore was performing a perfect breaststroke through the frigid ocean with a dead hand. Dumbledore was described as agile and moving faster than the eye could see throughout the books. I don't think age is a limitation. It might even be a bonus with the extra time to study and learn magic.

To be fair to Tom, his stuff would not net him awards. Like Grindelwald, he dabbled in the Dark Arts. He found the Chamber of Secrets. He clearly did exceptionally well academically to receive both compliments from Dumbledore and Head Boy. He was the first to pioneer the multiple horcruxes and created a spell for unaided flight later on. I think Tom was certainly the near-equal, if not the equal, of Dumbledore when it comes to academic achievements.

(I'm not entirely sold on the resurrection ritual, given that you'd think the inventor of horcruxes would think to come up with something similar, but I think it's safe to say that Tom at least modified that ritual to some extent.)

If he'd killed Bellatrix using the witch statue he could've had it defend him. That statue was impervious to spells too.

Basically he fought Voldemort and Bellatrix while keeping Harry protected AND giving himself a handicap by not using lethal curses/effects.

I'm always the first to say Sirius and James were extremely bright and talented, I'd say they had the potential, but given what happened to both it was completely wasted. So following the original timeline, Snape has the better opportunity to learn when he isn't rotting in the ground or withering in Azkaban, Sirius and James are stuck to their 21 year old skills.

** Hermione is both Author Insert and Plot Device. She is smart enough so that she can always know/figure out the things needed to drive the plot forward. I find it hard to figure out exactly how smart she is from that - I mean, yeah we know she's an exceptional student, although if I could rewind time for my classes I am sure even I would do better in them. But how smart is she compared to others? Who knows? Is Luna some sort of savant who just can't be understood? Who can say she isn't? Is Draco Malfoy actually second only to Hermione in class rankings like in fanon, or is that just fanon? If so, how much can his daddy's riches be given the credit for it?

** Hermione is the ‘Brightest Witch of her age' just because she decided to read ahead and read Every. Single. Book. Before beginning Hogwarts. If she didn't, she would've just been a ‘normal' student, like Ron. I have no grudge against her (well... that's a lie... fanon makes her fricking perfect in every way although she has heaps of imperfections) but in Canon she didn't actually do anything ‘big'.

Snape had invented spells and altered potions already in his 6th Year

Lily had helped Snape quite a lot and was described as someone who excels at charms

The marauders (exc Lupin) were animagi by their 5th Year.

Riddle and Dumbledore had achieved ridiculously high OWLS and NEWTS and went on to become two of the most powerful wizards, although against each other. (and dumbledore discovered, along with flamel, the 12 uses of dragons blood if i remember correctly)

Crouch Sr knew over 150 languages

The founders... well... little is known of them except the fact they developed a flipping school

Merlin and Morgana could've been fantasy in the HP world but were still probably ridiculously powerful wizards/witches

Flamel discovered the key to immortality without splitting his soul

There were many other great wizards and witches in the history of magic that discovered great things or weilded great power.

Hermione fans would probably say that these people ‘aren't her age', which is true, considering she is the ‘brightest witch of HER generation', but, the others in her year could have great potential, and she would never have gained this title if not for her obsession with studying.

However, she doesn't wear this title like a crown, like Malfoy would, but does ‘enjoy' being called it.

Somewhere in Ootp: (indirect quote as I have sadly forgotten what it actually says and do not have the book on me)

‘-You're just smarter than us, do you like rubbing it in?' Ron asked (incredulously??)

‘-Don't give me that nonsense,' Hermione exclaimed but still looked slightly mollified (it was mollified, right' as they trudged off the herbology.

The first part is pure speculation and simply untrue, it's mentioned nowhere and the second part is false, because her wand was described as good for charms (although we can safely assume she was good). The only real description is from Slughorn and he says she's good at potions.

** Wouldn't Merlin count? The founders of Hogwarts too though they're not mentioned. Voldemort really is one of the most intelligent people though we don't really see it as the Horcruxes fried his brain (and I really doubt his intelligence if he actually was dumb enough to make the objects so obvious (family ring like really) and hide them in obvious places (you literally couldn't /wear the freaking ring?/). Dumbledore is probably high up on the intelligent list too. I'd think Nicolas Flammuel (I butcher his name, I know) would be pretty freaking smart as he made the Philosophers Stone.

You know, well after the Statute, but before mental illness stopped getting you treated worse than condemned criminals.

What we know as 'intelligence' is a talent that only really manifests in the way you speak of it when given academic opportunity. For the greater part of human history, most people lacked that opportunity entirely.
