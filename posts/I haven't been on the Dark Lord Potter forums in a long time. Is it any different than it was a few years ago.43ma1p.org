** I've been on DLP for 8 or so years now and I'd like to tell you a little story of my experience of the place.

When I arrived I was 17 or so. I hadn't been allowed to post on Portkey and probably sought a place to post and to get feedback. And goodness did I get feedback. My fem!Harry fic got torn to shreds.

I did what I see a lot of here. I complained, threw blame where it should not have gone and acted much like a 17-year-old who had always gotten good grades in English despite never really bothering studying might.

I huddled comfortably in denial for quite some time, dismissing the criticism as cruelty. Maybe it was, on some level, but when I checked the thread some time later, I came to realize that my story had indeed been shit. It wasn't that my grasp of English was bad, it was that I didn't know how to tell a story properly.

I have since improved but I'd like to think I've also kept that lesson with me. DLP isn't about coddling people. Those who post here choose to do so knowing full well that if their work has flaws, they'll get pointed out mercilessly.

This is how things work here. You might get pushed down once or twice in the process, but you'll hopefully learn. If you act like a moron - like 17-year-old me did - you will probably have a bad time.

This should be read with the giant glowing disclaimer that this was nearly a frickin' decade ago. The community has since gotten far more patient, as people tend to get with age.

So if you want to improve the quality of your HP fanfic, or of your writing in general, I can think of no better place than DLP. But if what you want is confirmation that you're special and brilliant, I suggest you talk to your mother.

** As a sometimes user (mostly lurker) on the site, I don't think I've encountered any venomous attitude. Comments by some of the newish people could be seen as immature (i.e. dark!Harry worship, character bashing), but I don't think that necessarily reflects on attitude of the site as a whole. From what I've seen the older members are much more level headed and mature.

Also, their WbA is hella good if you're wanting feedback outside the usual 'OMG UPDATE PLZZ' fare of ffn.net. It's definitely made me more concientious as a writer. Don't expect them to sugar coat anything though.

I guess my one issue would be that it has that 'boy's club' feel to it as far as fic preferences go. But then again, so does this subreddit, so I really can't criticize. /shrug/

Edit: oh one more thing, it's a very Harry-centric fic community, as the name implies, so the fics recced tend be largely of that variety. This probably excludes a good deal of fics in the fandom. Sooo, probably not everyone's cup of tea.

I find DLP's culture to be very liberating, honestly. Everyone is allowed their own opinion as long as they can defend it. Personal attacks are frowned upon, but you aren't required to sugarcoat your words so you aren't hurting someone's feelings.

I suppose it comes down to what you define as an attack. A recent member who.. was banned. Considered that she was 'being attacked' because she was asked to clarify or elaborate on her statements/opinions, and then got angry that she was being asked to and claimed that we were trying to 'make her cynical' and 'try to 'convert her'. Weird situation all together.

Unless people have personal issues with each other there aren't really any 'attacks' that happen. If a new member joins and acts like they have the run of the place, and that everyone should do things their way... that's when things can get messy. An apt comparison would be if you walked into someones house with muddy shoes and when you asked them to clean up they started jumping on your sofa.

DLP isn't a nest of vipers hissing at each other and sinking their fangs into vulnerable flesh, no matter how much people try and force that image. I'm not gonna pretend that people can't become acerbic toward one another, but it's never a simple case of 'I feel like being mean today'. Most instances of 'DLP is mean!' that's been brought up that I've seen has been a case of the person having done/said something that was either downright offensive or ignorant, and then when they were called out on it they acted like the victims and exacerbated the situation.

Obviously there are exceptions, but for the majority of cases (as staff) that's what I've witnessed.

I'd be lying right through my teeth if I said that DLP had a perfect and spotless past, since it's far from it. But with that said, a lot of the members who contributed to that... colourful past have pretty much moved on. Some of the 'old guard' is still around certainly, but with the time that has passed has come a tiny bit of maturity. Most if not all of those 'incidents' sit in the Hall of Shame, which is a subforum that basically showcases stuff that isn't tolerated on DLP, or is, as the name implies, considered 'shameful'.

To be fair to Sree, he was heavily downvoted whenever he posted, even if the posts now show a surplus of upvotes. He genuinely wanted to put his best foot forward in regards to this subreddit but, there ah.. have been some users who have soured him significantly.

With that said, he would have been allowed to post that on DLP and if users took offence to it they have the option to report him and specify what was unacceptable about the post, at which point the report is sent to every staff member. I personally think he was a bit blunt, but I also understand his perspective on the situation having been around as past threads have unfolded.

I would say that he wasn't entirely justified in everything he said, but that I understand why he said it and felt that way.

It really depends on you and your personal preferences in discussing things. I mean, everyone who's there joined at one point, obviously. Jon had the right of it when he said it's not for everyone.

Take just the most obvious example: There are a lot of boards with an in-built profanity filter and corresponding rules. We don't have that. It's free speech, pushed as far as possible -- and that's exactly why I like it. Feel free to "personally attack" me -- either you have a point or you don't, if you do, I'll consider it, if you don't, I'll roll my eyes and move on.

That kind of atmosphere is very liberating, because it allows for open discussions of nearly every issue. But I get that others prefer different kinds of environments, and it maybe it does take a specific kind of person not to drown in that kind of situations.

I wouldn't know. The funny thing is that although I wouldn't care either way, I don't have any negative memories. So perhaps the bottom line is that those who would be able to deal don't have to in the first place. Which explains why I can claim we /don't/ usually debate issues with personal attacks -- it's only people who don't fit in to begin with who have that problem.

******* How dare we act snarky and rude when people insist on attacking us on this subreddit. The utter gall, right? How dare we feel the need to defend ourselves against blatant lies and bitter people that didn't like that we held different opinions than them.

What a bunch of feckless thugs. Coming into a public forum where they are decried as miscreants, assholes, children, and /mean/ and having any sort of reaction at all, since anything other than agreeing with the current groupthink would be seen as an overreaction.

You realize initially, I was all for trying to be understanding and nice on this subreddit? That got me nowhere. That got me people downvoting me on principle alone, ignoring what I said, and plainly refusing to care about anything which dared to force them outside of their narrowminded view of DLP. Palindrome, up above, currently sits at -1, and why? Because she dared voice her opinion that she didn't appreciate being whittled down to "female staff member" and having her gender used to insult a place she likes.

It's not like there's a DLP hate thread every couple of weeks on this subreddit. It's not like this subreddit is full of people trying to steal our author's works which they want kept private, so much so that your head moderator had to make a sticky post in order to curb that sort of behavior. It's not like this subreddit is hypocrisy personified.

Do you know how many threads on our site there are about how you guys are so mean and rude to us? None. Yet there are multiple on this site. And you ask why we're 'mean'? Lol.

In my original post, I simply pointed out that the aim of the post which Dromeo responded was probably not to single out female mods. That it was in fact a positive post about DPL. I also expressed that even if that /was/ the case, even I felt put out with how it was said. In response, you attacked me, and then proceeded to rant for a paragraph about what Dromeo felt was a legitimate complaint (which at no point did I argue against) in the meanest possible way. When I pointed this out to you, and the fact that many of the other pro-DLP posters here were being just as rude you decided to post a condescending, sarcastic rant which targeted not only me, but the entire subreddit proving exactly what I said.

#+begin_quote

Looking back at your posts in this thread, the first is a very public dressing down of Karinta, then 2 posts which could be thought of as 'nice' or at least neutral, then a post in which you defend an attacking Karinta, then a post calling Karinta a narcissist, a post calling Almavet bit stupid, the next post then admits you /didn't actually read the post you were calling Almavet stupid for/, then a post which is snarky to Aristause, a post calling out Wordhammer, then two posts attacking me. So out of the 11 posts, only 3 don't call someone a name or attack someone. /The first post was already quiet mean./ I really don't understand how you can claim you tried to be nice.

Maybe your attitude is exactly the reason why there are threads posted here against DLP. And maybe, the reverse isn't true because DLP isn't welcoming to that sort of post, being more focused on story critic then the wider focus here. If you're a mod, which I believe you are, then are you saying you would allow such posts? Because from everything I've heard about DLP, that isn't the case. That is /not/ evidence that the people who frequent DLP are any nicer then here, simply that HPFF allows posts from a wider range of topics and has different ideas about acceptable content.

********* There was literally one part of my original reply to you that could be considered 'mean' and that was the part you originally replied to. The rest was me trying to explain Palindrome's point of view, in no way did I attack you in it, or was rude.

I'm not talking about my initial posts in this thread when I said I tried to be nice, I'm talking about my initial posts on this subreddit. I made this account specifically for this subreddit. Go to my very first post made, I don't have very many to get through, this account is only a few months old. I've only started to get sick of trying to be nice when all it's done is earn me nothing but hatred and blind certainty that DLP is the root of all evil. When someone is nothing but vitriolic towards me, there's only so much I can take before vitriol starts flowing from me as well. Want to know when I got pissed off? When people on here were circumventing rules and taking intellectual property to freely distribute here, in spite of the author's wishes.

You keep talking about my attitude. What about yours? I, at least, have conceded that DLP was indeed immature and stupid back in the day. You? You called this:

#+begin_quote
  Drome's point was that she was annoyed that he thought she was ever excluded from DLP on the basis of her genitalia, when she always felt included. Can you not understand her being vexed when someone says that a place she is fond of used to think of her as less, because she's a woman? Not only that, but then using her promotion and gender as a way to show that they've somehow matured and grown to like her instead of hate her?
#+end_quote

Mean. How is that mean. Jesus. How did this attack you? How is this a rant? This message and the one preceding it? Yes, rants. That? Not so much, buddy, not so much.

I said I skimmed Almavet's post, found a few keywords which stood out to me, and decided not to read it fully. I don't waste my time with people who argue with terms like "buttbabies", sorry, especially when they're trying to speak for a community that I'm part of. What's funny is that that post was part of a good conversation I've had on this subreddit, the only one so far. It was clean, it was free of insults, and it was resolved in a happy manner with a member of this subreddit who doesn't frequent DLP.

Might I point out that our 'attitude' is only in response to yours? We have no desire to argue with you, and we have never come on here to start one. Take a good, hard look at your own attitude before blasting others. You keep talking about how "you hear such horrible things about DLP" but you've never actually taken the time to see for yourself, have you? You're arguing from a biased perspective and have no wish for that perspective to change. Even arguing against someone when they said that something someone said on here personally offended them, like that's something you have any right to argue against -- purely because you don't want DLP to have any sense of credibility.

I challenge you to look past your prejudices. I challenge you to join DLP, join some conversations, and let's see what happens. I can guarantee you that as long as you keep an open mind and don't intentionally provoke arguments, you'll find that it's not as bad as people say. What do you have to lose? If you do accept, and somehow find that you were right and that you find DLP disgusting, why not PM me (Narf, one of the Admins) on the boards and link me to whatever poster or post you found abhorrent, and I swear that I will work with you to fix whatever issue you're having. Who knows? Maybe I'm wrong and biased myself, and this might just end up making DLP better for everyone.

DLP is one of the biggest HP fanfic sites still active. There is no way we would be so active if we really were such hate-filled, vitriolic bastards like everyone on this subreddit claims we are. No, we're not vulgar-free, child friendly, mugglenet nice -- but neither are we 4chan.

Could you move the goalpost any further? This isn't an Olympics for Victimhood. The original post was asking about the current climate of DLP and did not make any reference to anyone's belief that 'DLP is the root of all evil.' Indeed, the only two users present in this thread who might attempt to make such an assertion are now-former members who have already displayed their own biases. It's completely unfair to assign their motivations to [[/u/mangaguy]] or [[/u/TheBlueMenace]]. It also makes you appear to be unable to bear /any/ amount of criticism towards your own community, no matter how valid.

********** The tone which you start a comment influence how the rest of it is read. So I'm going to start with this adorable puppy in a gryffindor scarf. Hopefully, this will mean the rest of my comment comes across in the spirit it is meant (i.e., not angry)!

[[http://imgur.com/EUCGEXc]]

With that in mind, starting a post with an insult to me is going to mean I will not be in a frame of mind to be objective to anything else you say. If you had simply posted the rest, I have no doubt the conversation wouldn't have gone down hill so quickly, if at all. It did not help that the rest of this thread was filled with vitriol, even if not all of it was even pro DLP. For example, that still only make 4 out of 11 of your posts which were neutral or nice (at the time) for this thread. I'm not going to bother counting up all your posts, I think in fact that would be counterproductive. Instead, I think I need to point out that the way people use this subreddit is very different to a regular forum. The people in a forum like DLP form a community. Posts influence other posts, building on to form a greater whole. Forums carry their history whether they want to or not. Reddit is not like that. There may be some meta, but for the most part, each thread is a self contained unit.

Reddit is a train station, people come, people go, there is transient links between threads, but such things are short lived. Trains often repeat themselves, to allow new people to travel. People on one platform (subreddit) may never visit other platforms. You can carry your baggage from one train to another, but all the stickers and boarding passes aren't the same, and the others on the train may not understand them, and are not going to appreciate it at all. If there is someone yelling and being angry in a carriage it will attract others with the same opinion (who will all pat each on the backs) but you yelling will only make it worse. Instead, go to a new carriage, and in a calm, logical, friendly manner state your points. You were never going to convince the yelling group anyway. It is also no reason to be angry at everyone else on the train. And there is especially no reason to be angry at any other train, no matter how much they look alike or if the same yelling people are on it.

Forums are a community centre. People visit for the specific purpose of contributing to that community and that community alone. Everyone generally knows each other, and both in the community centre, and often outside it. If someone is having a conversation in one corner, basically everyone is listening in, even if they don't participate. You store your baggage there, and everyone can access it if they want. Someone yelling something the majority disagrees with will be kicked out, often after being shouted down by everyone else.

What I am trying to say, if you were to repost exactly what you said before, in a forum you can expect the same response, on reddit you can't. So I encourage you to try being nice again. I know it is hard to set aside your anger at earlier responses. I suffered from exactly that in this very thread until I took a breather. But letting go of your anger is the mark of maturity, and the internet in general needs more of it.

Despite your invitation, I am probably never going to join DLP unless I or it changes dramatically, which is why I visited this thread in the first place. There are a few reasons for this:

1. I read FF for fun. I have no wish to analyse what I read, to pick over the dissected remains of a story and pull out the plot tumours or the particularly shinny innards. I write FF solely for my own enjoyment, I don't care if is a cliche filled spelling error infested mess. Pointing those things out to me just lessens my enjoyment of a story. These parts of DLP therefore would not interest me.

2. I like slash. And I don't mind mpreg. And non-Harry centric stories. And I love fluff heavy romance. Sometimes I even like trashy overpowered, fix everything easily Harry. I do not like Harry/OC (of any gender, and including named but non-developed characters such as Daphne, Gabrielle or Blaise). I don't like Harem. I hate stories which are little more then male driven sex fantasies. But I am also not a big fan of complex, plot heavy, philosophical novels. For FF I generally want fun quick reads with characters I know well. If I want original characters and ideas, I go read original fiction. The idea of the DLP library /does/ tempt me, but honestly, would there be anything to my tastes that I can't find currently available elsewhere?

3. For the most part, I only have the energy for a single community at a time. If I was to join DLP, I would be a lurker, and would contribute little to nothing. If I'm not visiting regularly to read, then I won't visit to participate either. I will not use IRC, mostly because I like having time to edit my posts.

If I'm not there for the criticism, the library or IRC, what would I go to DLP for? DLP may no longer be as it once was, but that is still a long way to being somewhere I would go, and I don't expect it to change just to suit me. So thank you for the offer, and I hope others here will take it up, but it probably won't be me. In closing, have a picture of this ravenclaw puppy. [[http://imgur.com/J1uk3DH]]

********* Every DLP post regarding archiving fics is for fics which have disappeared from either being deleted by ffnet or for some other reason. And yes, we've had a few times in which authors have asked us to stop, and we've done so immediately.

The difference is that we did stop, and that we didn't start to do it in order to skirt author's wishes initially. A fic like Jono's /Stranger/ is only available fully within his yahoo group -- the only problem is that he suddenly disappeared without a trace and never came back. His yahoo group was closed and requires him, and only him, to approve of new members because of bot spam. So, obviously, no new members were coming in and they couldn't read the latest chapters of his fic because he wasn't around any more to let them in.

This is different from Santi and BWL, because Santi is still around, even if it's sporadic, and it's still available to view in the way he wants it to be viewed, as long as you take some time to make a few posts.

DLP is not a platform for criticizing bad fanfiction. It is a platform to review fanfiction, good or bad. It's obvious just how biased you are just from saying that, and it's clear that I'm not going to change your mind, so why don't we just leave it at this, hmm?

A stalker who was in love with Harry because he was famous who was still above reproach because she was a fiery redhead who takes no shit from no man.

It was boring, it was cliche, it was everywhere. It wasn't there because we hated Ginny as a female, it was because we hated the fanon interpretation of Ginny's character. It was one of the main reasons DLP was formed, so we could get away from all the Harry/Ginny fics running rampant on ffnet.

Was the terminology we used stupid and immature? Yup, for sure. But then again, we were stupid and immature. Did we do it because we think women are lesser than men? Nah. Of course it could be construed as misogynistic -- but so can most public forums in the world.

You asked above if I had ever been a "hormonal teenager trying to be edgy"---if I were to learn that the friends I've made in my twenties ever talked like that, and remained so unrepentant, I would very quickly reevaluate those relationships. "Stupid" and "immature" doesn't cut it---this is not normal (or rather, acceptable) behavior, and it far exceeds the bounds of youthful indiscretion.

That said, DLP has definitely improved /a lot/ in the intervening years. It is home to a lot of interesting writing and discussion.

Never suggested that you were a mod because you were female. I was answering the OP about the nature of DLP compared to eight years ago when (by evidence presented) the tone of the place was very frat-house-like.

I would compare this to 'Has race relations in America actually improved in the last fifty years' being answered by 'Well, we've elected and re-elected a black President, so I'd say representation in government has improved.' That doesn't mean the problems aren't there, nor that I may even be a contributing factor for them, but I'm proud that the country has improved.

Obama wasn't elected purely because he was black or because he would champion black issues. You have been a very involved and responsive mod and that speaks well to you as a 'citizen' of DLP.

***** Ah, that's not quite my main issue with what you've said.

The first is that you call DLP misogynistic, even if you call it 'tampered down' now. I've never found that to be the case at all in all the time I've been on the forums. I don't understand where you're getting this impression about a women-hating attitude: this isn't something I've encountered myself. Like I said: you seem to be pulling that one out of your arse.

If you're talking about the proportion of women to men on DLP, on the other hand, then yes it's definitely still a sausage-fest. :P According to the last survey we took, 90% of the active membership are male. That's pretty staggering! I don't believe this proportion has changed much over the years, either. But, so what? The proportion of men being high does not in any way mean a hatred of women.

I take some issue with your notion that there's any particular value in women being 'represented' on staff. Firstly, there have been female moderators for a very long time - in 2008 [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=10426][Tinn and Kate]] were chosen on the moderation team. Secondly, why should it matter what genders the staff are? There is no misogynistic attitude /to/ 'improve' as far as I am aware; no one has ever been in a worse position due to their gender - there is no glass ceiling. This is why I ask "why should my gender have anything to do with being staff?"

So... I hope that adequately explains why this topic frustrates me.

***** And yet again, you're dead wrong. DLP started out with female staff members, and constantly has had female staff members since inception. In 2008 itself, right around the time the thread everyone referencing was made, we promoted Tinn and Kate to moderator.

So your base assumption was wrong, your base point is wrong, and your implication is therefore wrong. If the way to show DLP is somehow not misogynistic is to appoint female staff members, then that milestone was passed in 2005 and 2008 and 2015.

When a sentence follows another in a paragraph, usually they're linked. It's not a very hard stretch to see that it could imply "Look at DLP, they're not women haters, they even promoted some women to staff!"

*** Very early on DLP we established a societal rule that gender shouldn't be brought up - you're either an interesting/likable person or you're not.

If your profile was made to show off the fact that you were a woman and you ever referenced it, you were obviously trying to get kid gloves/favor and those people got shit on/banned because that kind of thing is cancer (see: GamersGate, Kaceytron).

If you were lowkey about it and everyone decided they liked you as a person then being female was an incidental detail and you were as welcome as anyone.

It's not misogyny so much as it's understanding the mentality of someone that goes "Hey boys, I'm new here, I'm a girl" and shutting it the fuck down early.

** Been on DLP for going on ten years now, the user base has matured quite a bit, I really doubt there are many teenagers anymore.

I've always said that DLP is the best place to go in the fandom for intelligent discussion and high standards, and I stand by that. While there are some threads that become shit shows, they aren't the majority, especially now.

What's even the point of this thread? Do you just want to shit on a community that you don't like? Are you trying to insult members of DLP that hang out on this subreddit? Honestly, posting something like this shows just as much about you as the thread you used as an example.

If you want to know what DLP is like now, make an account and find out. As long as you aren't an idiot (of at least are a funny idiot) you'll most likely be welcomed cheerfully.

In that case It would be better if DLP staff has nothing to do with writing it. If it's hosted here it should definitely be an outside opinion because any participation could be looked on as bias.

**** Hi, Karinta. Why exactly are you mad? Are you mad that we didn't ban you for purposefully derailing conversations in IRC because you were bored and didn't like the discussion at hand? For calling Palindrome a cunt? For spamming the chat with Asian characters, again, because you were bored? For constantly coming into chat when no one was talking, saying "This chat sucks", and then leaving right after?

Or how about when you start up heated discussions and then get angry at people when they don't agree with your political views, then throw tantrums and call everyone cunts before you leave the room in a huff? Even in private messages, you would get riled up when people were being nothing but cordial and proceed to insult them and again, quit, all because they didn't agree with your extreme point of view on matters.

How about when we didn't ban you for saying male rape was funny and gave you another chance not to be an asshole?

How about when you [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=31446][posted a thread]] on DLP saying you wanted to kill yourself, and even though no one knew you, everyone was sympathetic and tried to cheer you up/help you? Were we a shitfest then? Were we being toxic towards you?

We didn't ban you for all those things or when you posted an attention seeking message saying good riddance to DLP (after being kicked out of IRC for, again, annoying everyone when you were bored), but I'm sure as hell going to ban you now.

Karinta, you obviously have problems that you need to deal with. I'd suggest leaving the internet and not using it as a forum to communicate with others, because it probably exacerbates your generally terrible mood more than anything. Please, for the sake of your sanity, get some help. Talk to people about things other than politics and extreme feminism.

Some of what Narf wrote was revealing far more than acceptable. Not only was Narf's reply /completely over the top/ for what Karinta wrote, but it was personal and directed against Karinta, rather than Karinta's argument.

I consider attacking an individual more serious than attacking an aspect of some community. Threads quickly become more volatile, people start to engage in witch-hunting, etc - the harm that can be done by an attack on an individual is more serious than the harm that can be done by an attack on an aspect the community. One is targeted against a person; the other is spread out amongst many individuals and targets the nature of the community instead.

Narf's comment was targeted because it was reported. Mods do not and can not read every comment of every thread. If you report a comment, we will take a look at it. With regards to the comment you mention, they contain /nowhere near/ the amount of targeted personal information that Narf's comment did.

********** I think this is drawing something of an artificial line between the personal and the impersonal. Karinta's "argument" was that she had a bad personal experience at DLP and that therefore DLP is a terrible place. Commenting on the circumstances of that personal experience seems to be entirely fair. Karinta was the one who brought the situation up. If she didn't want it mentioned and talked about, she shouldn't have posted making reference to it.

To say that Karinta is permitted to use personal information in attacking DLPers but that DLPers are not permitted to reference that very same personal information in their defence seems like an absurd double standard. You're basically saying that you can make attacks at people but they aren't allowed to defend themselves.

And that is why, incidentally, it's not a witch-hunt: Karinta was the one who started it. It's not a witch hunt if the "witch" is the aggressor. She could have kept her DLP drama on DLP, but instead she decided to come to Reddit and bring it up here. Sree was merely responding.

And what do you call every second thread here that asks for Harry having buttbabies with Draco/Lucius/Snape/Voldemort? or Hermione having a romance with pretty much every male and female character in the series? or Snape adopting Harry? those things aren't tolerated there, and in that respect, they care so much more about the original series than most of the fandom. They actually revere canon, where here half the posters think that "magical cores" are canon or that Harry and Hermione are compatible.

The amount of stupidity in this fandom is exactly the reason why DLP is so filled with venom.

You may want to slow your roll on that; from the looks of things, the DLP ship is pretty clearly Harry/Fleur, the sheer absurdity of which (in JK's canon, at least) makes H/Hr seem proper soulmates like, in comparison.

**** Don't think DLP really ships in any direction. DLP is much more focused on Harry as an individual than his relationships. That was always kinda DLP's USP - in a fandom full of people who define themselves by ships, DLP defined itself by plot.

**** The DLP ship is clearly Harry/Fleur? I'm sorry, I've been on DLP since it's inception, and I have never seen this mentality. People on DLP love Harry/Fleur, don't get me wrong, but people on DLP also love Harry/Hermione (DarkSyaoran, one of our administrators, regularly browses ffnet with a H/Hr filter on and has read almost every H/Hr fic published). They also love Harry/Luna, Harry/Daphne, and even Harry/Ginny if it's well written.

The biggest ongoing Harry/Fleur fic out right now, Cadmean Victory, is regularly hated on in DLP for the sole reason of the ship, because of how lackluster it is. If we were truly as obsessed with Harry/Fleur as you say, we would read the fic because of the pairing, not despite it.

***** It's been years since I've lurked on DLP with any regularity, so you're probably right, but it's still entirely beside the point I was making: DLP prefers "absurd" ships over the canon ones, contrary to what was implied in the post above mine. Harry/Luna aren't compatible because she's insane, Daphne is an OC in all but name, and I'd imagine an H/G fic would have to be very well-written to overcome the bias DLP has against Ginny. Furthermore, you've said a DLP admin reads a whole bunch of H/Hr, so all that bluster the OP made about DLP revering canon because they aren't sheep who think Harry and Hermione are compatible, comes off as a bit ridiculous.

Whether my original blanket statement was wrong or not, the point still stands: don't knob off a forum for something they don't do.

****** I, uh, have nothing to do with who you replied to. I don't know who he is nor do I agree with his statements. I find him a bit stupid, in fact. I was simply replying to your statement about Harry/Fleur.

I'm confused, is every ship 'absurd' if it's not canon? What makes them absurd? Realistically, the only absurd pairings for Harry would be male ones, given that we see no sign of Harry being even remotely gay throughout any of the seven novels. Likewise, any hetero pairing involving Albus would also be absurd, given JKRs assertion that he is gay, and also given the canon evidence that he never married nor showed any leaning, hetero or otherwise.

******* Well, I'll happily admit to being wrong about H/F, then.

I don't think any of these pairings are absurd; with the right amount of character development, no ship is really too unbelievable, except, as you said, slash-fics, which directly conflict with Harry's sexuality as we see in canon, and people like Bellatrix, who Harry would probably kill before fuck.

When I used absurd, I meant in the sense of OP's definition, because if H/Hr is retarded and doesn't "revere" canon, then what is Harry/Luna, or Harry/Fleur, or Harry/Daphne, but infinitely more "absurd"? But, as you said, neither of us agree with his statement, so all's well that ends well.

**** While I do agree with you that Harry and Fleur aren't compatible, and don't like stories with the pairing, I'd say they are certainly more compatible than H/Hr, simply because of their more lax attitude and propensity to engaging in dangerous situations. And Harry thinks of her as a /natural/ beauty, unlike Hermione.

So /much/ higher? So higher hits the ear wrong.

Here are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3xtmhe/luna_as_a_seer_misses_the_point_of_her_character/cy7nvqs][two]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3xldgx/book_club_alexandra_potter/cy62wq0][of]] my higher rated posts on this subreddit. What would I need to do to them to make them worthy of DLPs sensibilities? Should I have made it instead about the unsuitability of Bonnie Wright for her role in the films based on my subjective standards for beauty?
