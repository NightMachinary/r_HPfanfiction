Dumbledore and Snape were really the only mixed characters in their views.

Any stories where the good guys doing the occasional bad thing, and the bad guys doing the occasional good thing.

People not knowing who to trust, what was happening.

Where even the trio's friendship is a bit rocky, given every single thing that they've been through.

Note: I am NOT wanting bashed characters, NO bashed characters as I feel like that's NOT good writing.

Would also rather not have Over Abusive Dursley's as I get tired of that trope

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes/etc

Anyone can be the MC/Can be on Any site/can be any length/etc

Note: It does not have to have absolutely everything that I asked for, as I know that might be a bit more difficult, but just some of that is fine.

Extra notes: Does not have to focus on the Golden Trio Era, can focus on the Marauder's era war or even what happened with Gellert.


** You know I would love to rec you a fic right now but I can literally only think of, like, real books you know?

***** Mhm, I don't usually listen to audiobooks, but for such a long series, I might have to change that, thanks!

Edit Can you link me the channel, so I know the first one?

** I mean, if it's not too presumptuous, I could do a self-rec. if you're all good with AU, a handful of OCs alongside the main cast, an original magic system, and a tiny repurposing of Norse mythology, my series might fit the bill: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1652104][Doppelg√§ngers]]

** I feel an underrated character who could fit the requirements would be barty crouch. Not seen any fanfics about it but it would fit Canon to see his dissent from the beginning of the first war to pushing for unforgiveables towards the end.
