I've been reading fics for a long time, but only just got around to writing/publishing linkffn(12327848) , which was the result of a brainwave I couldn't extract. I'm having some problems with my information dumps and dialogue, I think, so any feedback or critique would be hugely appreciated in working on those problems. Thanks very much in advance!

Edit: - I've changed the summary to not be so icky sounding. Urgh, it's good to get these things read back to you!


** I only skimmed it as I'm at work - I'll come back and read properly tonight - but my initial thoughts is that there's a lot of exposition, both in the narration and dialogue. I'm also slightly concerned that your summary sounds a bit... rapey? If this is the case please tell me as I won't want to read any more. If I've misunderstood then perhaps we need to look at how to rewrite the summary so it's a bit clearer.

The dialogue sounds relatively natural and the SPaG is mostly very good. I think you're taking a risk opening with OCs but it could pay off if they're well written.

*** Yup, absolutely nothing like that at all - hadn't even thought about the summary being read in that way! Will change it anon. Thank you for the criticism; I've a problem with verbosity in general, and I tend to frontload a lot of info - I'll have to work on those aspects. On the OCs front, I'm really planning this to be something of an anthology, shifting attention across characters - but, as you say, it's something of a risky move; I just wanted to start with wizards estranged from the magical world.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Go forth and multiply -- even if you have to break every ethical rule you have and a few more you hadn't thought of along the way.

** Okay, following your story because, well, I love it! The first chapter was a little overboard with commas and dashes and other pauses to the writing but the second was better about that.

I love love love having usual main characters (Lily/James, for example) as 'side characters'. It's enough to keep me very very interested, but keep your story idea unique.

Do you plan on following just them doing it (I can only look forward to James learning about a sperm bank) or the actual impacts of it? I think it'd make two separate stories or one story with two parts, like a time jump in between.

I'm invested in your OCs, and I like that you have a lot of plots going on. There is the main plot, obviously, but there is also each characters personal life plot and that keeps it interesting. Kind of like anime, where they have 6+ characters and all have their own arcs outside of the main plot.

Anyway, love it, can't wait for the next chapter!

*** Thank you - that's very kind of you! Like FloreatCastellum said, I've some problems with purple prose, which I definitely need to work on (I need to read more of [[/u/thewhitesquirrel]] for that - in my eyes they're basically the gold standard!); but yes, the plan is not to dawdle around (a pet peeve of mine is when a fanfiction spends fourteen chapters between Harry getting his hogwarts letter and actually getting sorted, so to speak) and get to consequences/development once the groundwork has been laid to get there.

Thank you again!

**** Fantastic! I'm so excited. Especially like, what are the kids of this going to think/will they know? The butterfly effects of this are interesting.

Everyone has that flaw, at least your writing isn't too simple or at a 4th grade level. When I read it I don't feel like I'm reading a kids book, though the involvement of sperm may have something to do with that... lol

**** I actually keep a spreadsheet that shows how my chapters line up with the books' chapters so I know when I'm getting too long-winded.

Good start. I'm definitely interested. I like seeing the magical world get put in its place, and your writing is generally pretty good.

That said, I would recommend that Graham and the others stop and think about the logistics here. If the birthrate suddenly increased tenfold in any community, it wouldn't just be disruptive; it would be crippling because there wouldn't be enough resources to handle it. If Hogwarts figuratively collapsed under the weight, it might do more harm than good.

***** Thank you for having a look; re: the issues you raise, I definitely agree! A goal of the story is to examine what will be very problematic consequences on exactly that issue, coming in large part because not enough thinking is going to go into the long-term consequences resulting from the magical population possibly doubling (let's say) over ten years.

Thank you also for the idea about the chapters/length spreadsheet, by the way - that makes a lot of sense, and also would be good so that I make sure to make a good amount of progress in a given chapter instead of grinding to a halt.
