I'd prefer no slash, thats I would like minor characters who werent mentioned as having a relationship or family in the epilogue. Thank You!


** Well, this does involve a major character, but I really enjoy Dignity in Fear, which is Hermione/Tonks. I didn't even know that this was a pairing to get into until I read this. Very well written. Link below.

  Hermione is tired of being the trio's conscious, and finds respite with someone unexpected. Set during OotP, a few days after Harry's arrival at the safe-house. Rated M for later chapters. Eventual Femslash!

** The only fics I know of where non-major characters are LGBTQ are slash fics that focus on a same-sex relationship. There's a fair amount of Dean/Seamus and Oliver/Percy out there, for example. For femslash, there's so little of it that's decent in general that almost all of them are for major characters, such as Ginny/Luna.

*** I don't mind slash as long as sex isn't the focus of the story. Do you have any Dean/Seamus fics to recommend? I love that pairing.

I'd click on the relationship tag then sort by kudos to get more. AO3 has more and better quality slash fics than ff.net.

  Dean has known he's bisexual since he was sixteen, but he's never told anyone, not even his best friend Seamus. This would be less of a problem if Seamus wasn't so obviously straight. Or if Dean didn't have an amazingly inconvenient crush on him. Dean/Seamus (Deamus) slash. Takes place three years after Hogwarts.

  #+begin_example
      Author’s note:  I have a multi\-chaptered Dramione fic called Inosculation, and at some point while I wrote the twelfth chapter, I produced this line: “\[Hermione\] helped Dean and Seamus \(who had finally gathered the courage to ask one another out last year\) move into their new flat\.” That was a spin\-off story waiting to happen, of course\. So I sat down to write a little Dean/Seamus side\-story, and my efforts spawned this monster of a one\-shot, which is nearly 7,000 words long\. You can’t trust me with a keyboard\. This story is technically in the Inosculation universe, but it really doesn’t have much of anything to do with that story\. As such, you don’t have to read Inosculation to understand this fic\. Of course, I recommend reading it anyway, because I’m into shameless self\-promotion\.Three lovely people helped me with this fic: my betas Caroline, Marnel, and Rianne\. Thanks to all three of you\! I hope you enjoy this little figment of my imagination\. Here it is: Not Technically Lying\.
    Author’s note: What did you think? Please write me a review to let me know, for I dearly love receiving them :\) Special thanks to Marnel for being game\-savvy enough to take all of three seconds to answer “Goldeneye 007 on the N64” when I asked her what game two twenty\-something men would play in 2002/2003\. And special thanks to Caroline for not being a totally sexually inexperienced recluse like me, and helping me figure out a bunch of realistic sexual habits and histories for Dean and Seamus\.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

** I'm currently writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11079096/1/Seven-Devils][Seven Devils]], it focuses on Michael Corner and the Ravenclaws and there is an eventual male/male pairing. The LGBT storyline is secondary to the main storyline, which is set in Hogwarts during the 1997/1998 school year. It's not going to be a long story though, and aside from an epilogue it doesn't extend past Hogwarts. I know it's not done, but I do intend to finish it by the end of 2015 (a chapter per month)
