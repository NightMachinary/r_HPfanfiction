*** I came to recommend this. It is such a perfect ending, so brief yet so satisfying (for both the fic and canon concepts).

** NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series (next gen) has a fantastic ending - wasn't a fan of the last chapter personally but the epilogue is really, really good.

The first volume of Accidental Animagus had a pretty good ending IIRC.

The Chronicle of Halo Wiggins (by Benedict Dragonpatch) and Ignite (by Slide) have pretty similar big battles at the end, not sure if that's what you're looking for. '

Alexandra Quick books 2 and 3 have objectively amazing endings. 4 not so much, but 5 looks like it will have a bit more closure.

Lastly, To Be a Slytherin isn't the greatest fic overall, but the ending is very satisfying and emotional.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
