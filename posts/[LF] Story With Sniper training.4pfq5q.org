Once upon a time i read a story where Harry (and Hermione?) recieve marksmanship training and end up dropping deatheaters and Voldemort from a distance in Hogsmeade.. I can't for the life of me remember the name of it.. Halp?


** In linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5), Muggleborns rebelling against a Ministry that had tried to appease Voldemort seek out paramilitary training, among other things. (Hermione gets some sniper training, but it's not her specialty: someone else in her group specializes in that.)

*** They don't really get sniper training, though - it's basically long-range shooting training. And (as far as Hermione is concerned) they only get that because the boys think "sniper" is cool, not because there is a need for a sniper a normal marksman with a precise rifle can't do as well, given the average effective range of a fight, and the alternatives magic offers. Even those who "specialise" in it only spent a week on it, which doesn't make them snipers.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Things didn't entirely get swept aside after the conclusion of the TWT. Dumbledore doesn't get his way. Riddle or Fudge won't either. Some OCs have large roles.
