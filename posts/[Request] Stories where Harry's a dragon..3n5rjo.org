Preferably ones that don't lapse into ALL HAIL LORD HADRIAN DRAGONKIN JAMES PERCIVAL GRYFFINDOR SLYTHERIN AZKABAN POTTER FIRST OF HIS NAME or stuff like that.

Example of a good one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][Enter the Dragon]]


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3177607/chapters/6902765][Alone Together]] is a pretty interesting twist on the premise. It's a cross with Temeraire, although I enjoyed it just fine while knowing diddly about the series.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603/chapters/7050041][Island of Fire]] and the followup oneshots are great as well if you're into dragons in general.

not really. I just think stories improve a ton when one or more characters have the ability to turn into a giant maneating lizard. It's why Lung's my favorite character in Worm.

A whole island full of half-trained, magic-wielding teenagers and universally firebreathing middle- to heavyweights plopped into the middle of the Napoleonic Wars (as influenced by DRAGONS and Chinese ambition)? Yes please.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons!

** linkffn(5475405)

This one is my guilty pleasure as it suffers from many tropes, but I still love it, I read it when I was going through a bad stage and for some reason it really helped me out, so it will always hold a special place in me.

Tropes:

- Gary Stu (Harry)
- Drarry
- Soul Bonds
- Veela Draco
- Helpless and Clingy Veela trope

You have been warned.
