I really love reading LGBT+ fanfiction in every fandom I maddle in. I include everything here. From gay and lesbian over trans to ace, whatever there is, I read it. But the most I found in HP was gay or lesbian and the occasional polyamorous fanfic. I'd love to read something Hermione centric, but I'm also open to Hermione just being a huge supporter.
