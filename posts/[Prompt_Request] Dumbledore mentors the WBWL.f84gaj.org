Dumbledore either wasn't the one to announce the twin as "the defeater of Voldemort" or if he did, it was a genuine mistake based on faulty info from Hagrid/Lily and James. When the twins come to Hogwarts, he notices how Harry is treated, especially once going to Slytherin or Ravenclaw, and how he never goes home for Christmas, and starts to look after Harry.

Alternatively, Dumbledore DOES deliberately misname the conquering twin, and forms a relationship with him to shape him into the self-sacrificing hero.
