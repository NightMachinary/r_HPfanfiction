Hi all, I am looking for a crackfic I read a while ago. The only thing I remember sadly is a sideplot where Dumbledore tried to make sure Snape was Harry's favourite teacher. At one point he asks Harry who his favourite teacher is and when Harry lies and says Snape, he's over the moon. Any help would be much appreciated
