To clarify, I'm curious what the the advantages and challenges of crossing with a specific universe.

For example: The hardest challenge in a HP/Game of Thrones crossover is that magic is way overpowered in a largely Muggle world. How do you balance out the main characters?

It's hard to build tension when the protagonist can take out any of the antagonists with a wave of his hand.

The biggest advantage of a HP/GoT crossover is that the scale of warfare is much much large in GoT opening up opportunities for some completely new combat situations. Also, the White Walkers are a particularly compelling opponent.


** I wish there was more HP/Stargate fic. It seems like such an easy mesh. The timelines are pretty close. HP trio would be young adults when SG1 starts, making it easier to get them involved in secret government programs. Bill Weasley is a quick connection to mysterious Egyptian artifacts. The Stargate program later includes the British government. One alien is obsessed with creating advanced humans with special abilities. If the war causes muggles to be more wary of wizards, they'd be looking at alien tech to combat magic. These two stories can exist in the same universe pretty well.

With X-Men and superhero crossover, you usually have to take a bit of a turn from canon. (Fine for some people, but I like crossovers that divert from purely canon points.) Why are they barely noticing mutants? How has no wizard (muggleborn at least) mention the flying alien? How does it make any sense that the HP characters are just getting introduced to this? I may just be picky but things like that can destroy a fic for me. If the fic fails to truly weave even the backstories together, it all feels shallow.

Dropping Harry into totally different timelines and realities is made possible with magic. But then you've gotta balance magic (or magic vs technology) without overpowering either side. There also has to be a legitimate reason for him to meet the people he meets. I've read crossovers where he lands on the death star or in the forest in front of the stories just because "That's where I need him to be to move the story forward." That doesn't make sense. The GoT world is bigger than that. There has to be a reason he ends up in that time and place besides convenience.

One thing that applies to all crossovers is that they can't be friends in 2.5 seconds. It's ridiculous. Harry's not the most friendly person and many of the crossover characters aren't either. If people in GoT were all that trusting, they'd be dropping dead more regularly than they already do.

**** I've been pondering a HP/SG-1 crossover, with Hermione getting invited to Colorado after she publishes a paper on dimensional portals or such.

"Harry? Remember that article in The Quibbler about Egyptian snake demons being aliens from outer space? She was correct. We need to check those urns in the DoM."

Problem is the main plot - going up against goauld seems a bit overdone, struggling with Kingsey's goons only works if the guy gets some magic backing, inventing a new antagonist is tricky.

** My all time favorite crossover remains Browncoat, Green Eyes, because it seems like a plausible continuation of Firefly and contains the only time I've ever liked Harry/Luna (I'm mostly a Harry/Hermione shipper on the rare occasions I care). The worldbuilding was complicated enough that it was a plausible follow-up to Firefly/Serenity. The one thing I would say is an annoyance is that there's not much to show how magic and tech coexist while Harry lives on Serenity.

There've been a few good Avengers ones. The one coming to mind is Wand and Shield, where Harry enters the Avengers world. Also, because it's Marvel, it's not as if Harry is the weirdest or most OP character there. Dropping HP characters into other universes usually needs nerfs to what wizards can do, but in the Avengers' 'verse it's not so bad.

*** I'm curious why Harry/Hermione shippers seem so resistant to other pairings. I mean, I can understand not like H/G, because of canon, but Harry/Luna is such a benign pairing that doesn't seem to threaten/overlap with the Harry/Hermione dynamic much at all. I mean, I guess Hermione doesn't like Luna much as first, but they warm up eventually. Are there other pairings you like too?

**** I mean, for me personally, I don't like shipping in general. Harry/Hermione is just the one I can more consistently find fics I like in. Usually I prefer gen fics and AU fics that focus on plot and intrigue, rather than shipping.

I do appreciate good shipping fics, even for ships I wouldn't normally read (like Harry/Draco for example, because I usually just can't see those two as romantically involved), but they also have to have really interesting worldbuilding and plot for me to read it. I don't read fics for the sake of reading about a ship.

*** I really liked /Browncoat, Green Eyes/ the first time I read it. However, it really doesn't hold up well if you go through a second time - for me at least - because there's no real tension and the characters drift too far from canon. There's no drama (the stakes aren't high enough), and the few points we get that have actual plot events happening rather than just character interaction [[/spoiler][basically just Earth-That-Was and the Reaver rehabilitation]] are far enough apart that most of the story just reads as /Serenity/'s crew plus super!Harry to fix any problems they have.

I have issues with the plot as well, but mostly it's just that there's no one thing that the story does well. We don't really worry about things going wrong, because Harry is really strong. The 'good guys' get along, for the most part, and Harry can smooth over any issues that do come up. [[/spoiler][River's healing]] goes fine as well.

The world-building, characters and so on are all interesting, but not interesting enough to carry the story on their own - or at least not for more than one read-through. I still think it's a good fic, especially by fanfic standards, but I don't think it's great any more. (That's not to say that I can't understand why other people do.)

**** I can understand that. I enjoyed it a second time, but I also enjoy the occasional super!Harry fic . I definitely felt there was less tension in it the second time around, but that wasn't too bad for me. It's not my favorite because it's great, but rather I like the way the two stories combined in it. Good worldbuilding is something that can get me through an otherwise not super interesting plot. But yeah, if worldbuilding alone can't keep you interested, then I can see how it's a boring reread.

** I feel HP/LOTR works best. Sauron's Ring was pretty much another implementation of Horcrux, there was powerful magic in LOTR universe, and the line between good and evil was clear cut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/Steelbadger][Steelbadger]] writes beautiful HP/LOTR crossovers, such as *The Power He Knows Not* and *The Shadow of Angmar*, linkffn(11027086;11115934). Unfortunately, his stories only have Harry going to there alone.

I much prefer multiple HP characters going to other universes, because if it was just Harry alone, the other universe basically assimilates Harry, and stories become Harry Potter in Another World. *Forging A King*, linkffn(8250381), is not bad, but introduces an AU element in LOTR universe that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. *Failsafe*, linkffn(11281891), is very nice, but seems to be abandoned. So, I'm still waiting for my first perfect HP/LOTR crossover.

** An advantage is definitely the diversity of characters. It also serves as a way of making an OP character or a really depressing fic ( Character stuck in another world, character ancient and everybody else dead). I find the easiest and my favourite ways to do a crossover is to make Harry MoD, or stick him in another universe. Another advantage is it helps give characters more power without having to explain their origins too deeply.

It is also very fun to mash the universe's together as the wizarding world is secret anyway. For example you could have Sherlock trying to figure out a wizard/witches secret.

My own personal favourite crossovers with Harry Potter are The Avengers, Death Note, Lord Of The Rings and Tokyo Ghoul.

I overall think crossovers are awesome, and spice up the fanfiction a bit.

** My favorite crossovers are Avengers, Sandman, Naruto, and Star Wars.

Star wars goes well with HP but you have to be careful to keep them on a level playing field a la Havoc Side of the Force.

Naruto is one of the few universes with powers on an equal level or possibly even more powerful than HP magic.

Sandman because I'm a huge sucker for Master of Death fics :3

Avengers because the whole cast is fun to play with, and the Asgardians interacting with wizards is always fun to read.

Bleach is another good one, but I haven't given much thought as to how well Reiatsu or whatever it is would interact with magic. I do have a plotbunny for a yoruichixHarry fic where Harry is a cat animagus and wanders into town, apparates in Yoruichi's sight and then it devolves into a game of cat tag.

Supernatural is probably also a good fit, but I don't run with that fandom so I couldn't say how well.

The advantages are clear: You have a lot more variety to work with, and if you can make the power scales of different universes work relatively well together you can craft compelling conflicts without making either side too overpowered.

The downside is that some universes just really don't work; not without a lot of handwaving, at least. Some universes /need/ dimensional or temporal portals to set the stage, which can be a tiresome trope at times.

Beyond that, it's all execution. With a lot of planning, you can make just about anything work.

As someone writing a crossover where that literally happens in the first chapter in order to set up the rest of the story.... well I'm sorry but sometimes it just works. Also it's HP/Warcraft and portals to other worlds aren't unheard of in the Warcraft lore.

***** The problem is that ninja are too fast. With throwing weapons and AK available, HP/Naruto crossover fights are basically between glass cannons and whoever attacks first wins, unless one side has some sort of extra protection (and in that case, the protected side wins).

Harry Potter has unaugmented humans, which makes for some difficulties with various crossovers. In a lot of worlds (especially anime), it's expected that people can tank serious hits without dying, but in HP you dodge or shield or die, pretty much.

After that it becomes its own story rather than reusing a lot of HP plot crossed with Pokemon, and the characters have developed enough that there's not much of the HPverse left in it.

** I'm a huge fan of HP/GOT, and still waiting for a proper Harry/Daenerys fic. I'm sure it can be done, it would just take a far more talented writer than me.

Also love HP/Dresden Files. It's got a ton of advantages, but one of the biggest is that playing field is relatively even. A normal HP wizard and a normal Dresden wizard would be on a (relatively) even playing field. Besides for things like the killing curse (which is inherently imbalanced even in the HP universe), you can give good points for both magic systems.

The "big bads" in the Dresden universe also tend to be far bigger and far badder than anything HP has to throw around. Voldemort ain't shit compared to the Walkers, nor the Lords of Outer Night. The Dresden verse has a huge world and amount of interesting characters to bring together, and multiple points in the timeline that HP Harry could be integrated into fairly easily.

To be honest I've read so much HP fanfiction I always prefer crossover fics where Harry wanders into another world, rather than the opposite. That said, the HP world is so big and expansive that you can integrate things from other books/movies fairly easily, without really disrupting everything.

Yeah, I feel that. I think it really depends on the story premise. The idea of having canon Harry somehow get transported into the GOT world is /really/ hard to do, even though I'd love to see it done right. It's just that the ideals and morality of the worlds clash so much, it seems like the only real possibility is Harry being gutted when he fucks up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]] is the best HP/GOT crossover I've read, and it gets around this by making Harry a reincarnated version of himself. His memories of his past life are hazy, so it's not really the same character. That said, I think it works because many of the base characteristics that make Harry who he is are still there. It's just that he was raised in a certain way and in a certain society. He's still rash, headstrong, quick to anger and sometimes childish, it's just that he was raised as prince in the GOT world.

***** I'm on that Fic, glad the Author is doing regularish updates now.

I am okay with a little OC, or starting out regular and then adding more development in a a long deck of a chapter to make him OC, like in 'The Difference One Man Can Make' where Harry goes on a world Journey following the fall of Voldemort and learns all kind of magic, gets transported to the GOT universe and then basically builds an empire from the Wildlings. that's an enjoyable story where I can totally see Harry doing due to his motivations.

There are others that I hate, that basically say, oh this is Harry reincarnated, his name is some amalgamation of Harry and a Targaryan name, and now he is a blood thirsty tyrant that has 3 sister wives all have dragons and they all have naughty threesomes... /please review my story(read self insert porno)!/ or some variation of that.

**** Read "Wizard of Harrenhall"

It's the only good Harry Potter/Game of Thrones I have ever read.

In this story, Harry does not waste time pandering to nobility, or kissing up to 'honorable schmonable' Starks, or Daenerys.

Instead, Harry brings magic back into the world, crushes the nobility, turns their castles into schools for the common man.

The best part of the story is the confrontation between Daenerys and Harry. She is completely owned.

"Wizard in Harrenhall" shows what would really happen if a freedom fighter with reality altering powers, like Harry, entered a world like Westeros where Nobility oppresses the population.

You can obviously guess that Harry doesn't waste time pretending to be a lord or kissing up to nobility.

Honestly the worst Gary Stu ever. Harry would be dead in a week. It doesn't take him losing in a sword fight, it just takes someone poisoning his food or slitting his throat while he sleeps or stealing his wand or basically any other underhanded tactic commonly employed throughout the Game of Thrones series.

Oh let me guess the author explains it away by making Harry super OP and being able to read everyone else's minds so they can't betray him. He probably also has the ability to see auras or some other nonsense so that he can tell when he's in danger.

Whoever wrote that story doesn't understand Harry Potter or Game of Thrones if they think Harry would just come in and completely remake the world. Game of Thrones is a game of political intrigue, alliances and betrayals. The entire point of the series is that the white knight doesn't win, he get's stabbed in the heart at his Uncle's wedding.

Also Dragons. Drogon would bbq Harry in seconds.

****** While I agree that the fic in question seems like a Gary Stu breeding ground, it's extremely unlikely that Harry would be easy to kill in Westeros. The magic in ASOIAF is mysterious, dangerous, and near impossible to control; if you were to drop in your average HP universe wizard, his magic would beat the stuffing out of most of his opponents, purely because the more "mundane" magic of the HP world works on a more consistent and accurate basis than the magic we see in ASOIAF. Furthermore, he's got the ultimate power in being able to apparate the second he senses danger; in a world where it takes weeks to travel a few hundred miles, it's incredibly difficult to overestimate the advantage of being able to traverse that same distance in a few seconds.

#+begin_quote

Well, this really isn't the point of ASOIAF. The "bad guys" in the series get punished just as suddenly and mercilessly as the good guys; to suggest this is the point of the series is at best a shallow interpretation of the series.

The point of the series is a criticism of feudal society, which most high fantasy presents as strangely utopian. Most fantasy describes the lives of peasants as a rural idyll of wholesome work by day and telling tavern-tales around a roaring fire by night, and the lives of nobles as being filled with rich extravagance, big castles, and grand balls. GRRM's point is that a society brought together through brutal conquest and held through nepotism, creates a perfect vacuum for political intrigue and everything that entails: from competing interests to wedding assassinations to [[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Elia_Martell#Robert.27s_Rebellion][grotesque war crimes]]. And [[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Oberyn_Martell][revenge]] for grotesque war crimes. And revenge for revenge for grotesque war crimes, [[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ellaria_Sand#Quotes_by_Ellaria][round and round forever.]] All of this serves only to disenfranchise both peasants and nobles alike, and ultimately undermines that society's ability to defend against greater threats, such as The Others.

In a straight up head to head fight Harry would be hard to kill because he has magic, I never disagreed with that. I disagreed with the fact that any of his opponents would fight him in that matter.

Although with the premise of this story he probably happened to have a 7 compartment trunk with a fully stocked library, mini-mansion and quidditch pitch in his pocket when he was transported to Westeros. In GoF Harry had his Firebolt which is the only way he survived that dragon, otherwise he was dead.

It's not particularly easy to do any of those things you've suggested, even if Harry's not particularly powerful. Few people in the series get assassinated in their sleep, even the stupid ones. Poisoning happens, but requires an incredible amount of foresight, planning, and dumb luck. Same thing with stabbing a person in the back.

I agree with you here, but it's not necessarily negative: this would be a good way to balance Harry out in an ASOIAF crossover, since he's so obviously overpowered in a fair fight, and it would force him to use alternative methods than brute forcing his way through the fic.

I'm fairly sure the dragon broke free of its chain and Harry was fourteen, without the proper knowledge of how to defeat a dragon. And, it's fair to assume that in the case of 1v1-ing a dragon, Harry would have his wand out and ready to apparate when things go sour.

The FM sets their prices depending on the how well-known and secure/powerful the target is. A mummer and a merchant in Braavos aren't worth much, a full-blown wizard, a man who is practically unbeatable in one-on-one combat and taking on the great houses of Westeros, would certainly cost more than most are willing to pay.

** Harry Potter / A Song of Ice and Fire does crossover very well, and I don't think magic is very overpowered, unless you significantly buff canon Harry.

The magic in the world is quite strong, even if it is spread out. The Others present a challenge that isn't easily overcome, but in most fic they will be a secondary antagonist.

The problem with the crossover comes from motivation. Harry isn't very ambitious so authors have to find a believable way for Harry to want to do X which is best achieved by making him seek revenge. The primary conflict of a story being political in nature means it can't be easily overcome with magic.

An issue I've had with this crossover is that most people either forget Harry is essentially from the future. Harry won't know how to recreate most technologies, but he definitely has an understanding of disease and how it spreads which is the primary problem of the time.
