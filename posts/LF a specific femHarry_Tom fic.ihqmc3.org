:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it on ao3. I'm not sure if it's posted elsewhere.

It's Female bisexual Harry. Towards the end she was staring to turn dark. Voldemort starts talking to her as a horcrux when she's a kid. Then she starts hanging out with Diary Tom Riddle when they find that horcrux. She's sorted into Slytherin and becomes friends with Draco. At one point she dates Hermione but it doesn't last that long and they're friends after. The last I remember she's dating one of the Weasley twins and Locket Voldemort has been found at Grimmauld Place and trying to manipulate her in her dreams. Sirius knows she's talking to horcruxes but loves her anyway (not in a creepy way).

I've looked all over ao3. I noticed I hadn't received any updates in my email and realized I couldn't find it anywhere. I'm afraid the author may have deleted it but if anyone happens to know what I'm talking about please let me know if it's still out there somewhere.

It is not Lily and the Art or Historical Importance of Runic.


** I'm pretty sure I know the fic you're talking about, but I'm also having trouble finding it right now. I know it was on ao3 but it's not showing up in the related tags or my bookmarks.

If I remember correctly, Fem Harry and Hermione split ways right after Harry's name comes out the Goblet and Hermione stops speaking to her for a bit? And Sirius realizes she “has someone in her head” (or some phrase along those lines) after their confrontation in the Shrieking Shack?

I might be totally off base here, but were there two Tom Riddles? Like, one that projected from her scar and the other from the diary horcrux.

Oh no, it's going to bother me for a while if I don't find it.

*** Yep! I think it's been deleted by the author. I loved it, I'm so sad if it was.

** It's not that lily and the art of being siphyius (don't remember how to spell it so can't link it) with “wizard Lenin” is it?
