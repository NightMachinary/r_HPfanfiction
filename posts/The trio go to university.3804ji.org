I'm currently working on a fic where Harry/Ron/Hermione and a few others at Hogwarts to go a magical university, and I'm just wondering whether there's any similar stories out there? I certainly have never seen any, but I'd be interested to know if there's any out there.


** I've read a couple of fics where Harry or another character goes to a muggle university, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3973687/1/Crazy-Little-Things][Crazy Little Things]] is the only magical university story I've come across.

** I would definitely recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/281883/chapters/448385][A Writer of Fictions by eilonwy]]. It doesn't quite fit your brief, as its a Draco/Hermione story and they attend Muggle Oxford, but it has won a bunch of awards and is well worth reading if you remotely support such a pairing.
