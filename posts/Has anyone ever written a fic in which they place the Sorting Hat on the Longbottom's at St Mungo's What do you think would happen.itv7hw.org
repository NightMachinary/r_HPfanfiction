** The hat would take a look around, and very softly go

“Oh. Oh dear. I remember you very well, but not at all like this...”

I have a sneaking suspicion the hat has a very good memory. As in, able to remember the mental shape of damn near every student who's ever tried it on. The moment of recognition would be there even for Frank or Alice, but recognising shattered pieces as belonging to something you've seen before doesn't mean the pieces can be put back together again.

** I personally don't think experiencing trauma would change your house designation.

And if you meant it more like "can the Sorting Hat connect with people of varying cognitive capacity", then I think yes. People without magic can connect with each other and recognize areas of strength and challenge, so I think there's no reason the Sorting Hat /wouldn't/ be able to.

** I don't think the Hat would help their condition. It was made asses not change mind, it's probably not as powerful that it could nudge their mental state in better direction. And besides it has seen their minds as a 11yr old children not adults they were when the trauma happened.

So sadly any healing-by-Hat-powers fics out there would be just wishful thinking

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.
