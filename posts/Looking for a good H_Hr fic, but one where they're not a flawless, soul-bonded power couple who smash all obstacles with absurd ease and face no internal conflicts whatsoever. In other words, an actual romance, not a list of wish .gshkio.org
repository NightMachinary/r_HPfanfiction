Does such a fic even exist? God knows I haven't found any sorting through the ones with the most favorites/kudos. I guess when you do it that way, you find the stories that are the most pandering, rather than the ones that are highest quality. That's why I'm here.

As I said, H/Hr needn't be the main focus; in fact it's probably best if the general plot isn't centered around evil Dumbledore/Weasleys keeping our destined couple apart. I probably don't need to say at this point that I don't want any character bashing, right?

If I can't find any, hell, I might just try the old "if you can't get it done right, do it yourself" wisdom, although that would distract from my original stories -- a bummer. (Maybe someone reading could try it out? PM me if you ever do)


** linkffn(13405869) That's what I'm attempting to do in my story. I'll let you be the judge whether I've pulled it off.

The Many Deaths of Harry Potter is also very good. HHr isn't the focus of the story, but it's still well done.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more.
