A fic where Hermione is essentially her canon self, with a Harry as talented as a teen Voldemort. Bonus points if there's a Luna that is just a weird girl from the death of her mother and her father being super eccentric. Double bonus points if Luna deals with her issues. Triple if there are no lordships. No slash preferably. Before anyone recommends it, I have read the Mind Arts by Wu Gang.


** You'd probably like A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned. It starts at year four and has a powerful Harry that is on level with Hermione but then outstrips her. Luna it's not featured too much though. It doesn't have Lordships and all that.

*** I've already read it. It's unique, but the whole "I do not forgive, I do not forget" is silly. Thanks though. It fits the requirements!

** The Art of Self-Fashioning has a Super!Harry but a canon!Hermione. Harry isn't a lord.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079]])

Hogwarts Battle School has a Harry who is initially bested by Hermione but gets better to such an extent that she gets jealous. No lordships.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School)

The most obvious one to me would be HPMOR as Harry gets a massive boost, but Hermione not so much.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
