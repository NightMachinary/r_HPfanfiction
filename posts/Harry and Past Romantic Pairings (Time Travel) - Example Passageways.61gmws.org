I am interested in suggestions for Harry Potter fan fiction which has Harry paired with people in the somewhat recent past (around the time period Harry's parents generation was in school or just before or after Voldemorts rise). An example of such a fic would be Passageways linkffn(8378840) which has Harry and Bella paired up with movement back and forth in time at the start and takes up the mantle of a new house to work within the past.

I would prefer a fic where Harry does try and change history in some way, but am not picky on how or whether light, grey, or dark. Just no "passive" or "wimp" Harry. Political, or Powerful Harry are fine... even OP Harry is acceptable.

It obviously has to include romance/pairing, but I am not real picky on that front (However No male slash please). It can be a single pairing, multiple pairings, or group pairings (example Harry and the Black sisters) or even a Harem. It can be an OC character, or a character known in Harry's original time but reworked to be different in the past (Yes including Lily or other such more unusual pairings that might be seen as Taboo). I prefer mature fics that don't hold their punches or become afraid when it comes to violence, language, sex, and so on. Smut/Lemons are perfectly acceptable PROVIDED there is solid plot and the plot is more important.

Fair warning I have read a few Harry/Black Sister or Sisters fics, so feel free to recommend but don't be surprised if I have read them. I am just looking to find more variety.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
