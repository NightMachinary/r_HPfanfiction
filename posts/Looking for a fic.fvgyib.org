I'm looking for a James-and-Lily-return fic that is realistic and doesn't have Harry believing them immediately, too much out of character crying (i understand that people will get emotional, but don't have them crying at every single little thing if the character wouldn't have cried at that in canon), Harry immediately getting along with his parents, etc. Whoever helps me find a fic like that, you're an...umm...cute lily pad. yea ðŸ˜…

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily
