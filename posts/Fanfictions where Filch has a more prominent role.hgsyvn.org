I've read stories in which filch was treated nicer by Harry and he was in turn treated better by Filch. Are there any stories in which Harry ends up closer with Filch for any reason? For example, the story requested today about Harry being almost a squib, he gets closer to filch because filch can help him do things differently.


** linkao3(15465966; 331625)

Harry pretends to be a Squib in The Second String, and he briefly works at Hogwarts as Filch's assistant or something like that. The treatment of Squibs in wizarding society is a major plot point.

Magical Relations has Vernon buying both Harry and Dudley's school supplies, so Harry doesn't know about his Gringotts vault at first. He gets a job helping Filch to repay Vernon.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. AU.Harry and Dudley's first year at Hogwarts. Highlights include bullying, subversive tactics, new friends, and misplaced magical objects.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** linkffn(The Squib and The Cerberus)

This is the first of a series with a different take on Filch's character. This specific fic doesn't have any interactions with Harry, but in a later story he helps Filch defend Mrs. Norris' honor from other cats. There's also another one when they run into each other in London over the summer and have to work together to escape some magical creatures.
