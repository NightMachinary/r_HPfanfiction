Normally I have lots of preferences and specifics but never really get any replies so I'm just looking for anything Dramione as long as it's well written (in your opinion)

If possible it would be nice if they could be quite a bit longer but if it's well written I'm happy to read it :)

Many thanks!


** It would be interesting to see an AU good!Draco/Hermione interacting with the canon jerk!coward!Draco.

Are there such fics?

** Okay, let me see if I can remember all my favourites off the top of my head! (And also what site they're on, stick with me here...)

My top favourites are The Die, The Request, and As Certain Dark things! If I think of any more I'll leave another comment. :)

linkffn(Isolation by bex-chan; Rebuilding by colubrina; The Die by colubrina; Broken by inadaze22; The Request by redhead414; Presque Toujours Pur by shayalonnie)

Also small plug, I'm writing a kind of different marriage law-ish Dramione, if you're at all interested. linkao3(Don't Take This Sinner by hexmionegranger).

  Astoria was never a fan of Hermione Granger, but pretty soon, she would be gone, and Draco was going to need all the help he could get. Rated M for future chapters.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger couldn't help but think that no matter how difficult they had all figured rebuilding their society would be, no one was expecting anything quite like this. It was another stark reminder that just when things were finally starting to level out, they would never truly have peace and stability. Her entire life in the magical world had been full of shocks and stumbles, and this one seemed like the biggest of them all.A post-war Dramione marriage law fic... with a twist!

  Dark Magic changes a person. What lines do you cross to kill Voldemort? What do you give up to save the world? And how do you live afterwards? Starts off VERY dark and gets lighter; some sex & torture. Hermione-centric story; slooowly develops into Dramione. The wait is worth it, though; promise. 1 yr post Battle of Hogwarts.

Those are the first two I always recommend. I've made lists upon lists for people in the past, but once again I am on mobile. If you just look up Dramione in the search bar you will likely find them...

  "In the glow of the fires, her unkempt hair was a halo, her eyes were Baltic amber, and he was panicking." Born and raised in France, Draco Malfoy attends Beauxbatons and leads a privileged, well-ordered existence. He meets Hermione Granger for the first time at the Triwizard Tournament, and that's when things get... strange. But kind of wonderful, too.

  Hermione is offered a war-stake by Dumbledore. She ignorantly accepts the beautiful scroll only to find she has thereby agreed to become Wife to the House of Malfoy. An on-the-go education by Minerva, Molly, and Astoria ensues as Hermione enters formal courtship by Draco and Lucius. Utterly absurd and a tad naughty. AU, OOC. Utter tripe.

** There was a fic I read a long, long time a go. Draco saves Hermione from (I think, it's been a long time) Malfoy manor but she's cursed blind as he does so. He basically has to be her eyes for several months as they rough it through europe(?) and they build a pretty neat relationship along the way. God knows what it's called but maybe someone else can remember. It might not be as good as I remember either, I was much younger when I read it and I had more tolerance for shite writing.
