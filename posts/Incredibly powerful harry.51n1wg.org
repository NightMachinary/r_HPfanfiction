I'm looking for out of the way or hard to find stories where harry curbstomps everyone even dumbledore and voldemort. And preferbly long, completed stories, but they have to be hard to find stories because i've read all the ones where it's stated in the title or has godlike in it. It can be a crossover.


** If you are okay with an avengers xover linkffn(a fallen god) fits your request.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

**** This one i have read already. I enjoyed it. Any others, it's just i have nothing to read and i'm re-reading stories. Basically bored crapless. Oh and i'm looking more for completed stories because incomplete ones frustate me. If it's spectacular i'll read it but otherwise completed.

** I just finished reading one called *For the Price of a Soul*. Even though Harry is super powerful, he still has an incredibly difficult life.

*** It looked interesting but then i got to the hp/dm and all interest went out the window. It's not that i don't like gay couples but that it's very hard to picture harry with a guy let alone draco. I don't like the idea of him and draco if he was gay i would expect him to go out with neville all things considered, They have more in common.

  When Vernon Dursley's abuse escalates to unbearable levels, Harry Potter makes a deal that gives him incredible power at the tips of his fingers. Ten years down the line he's going to have to pay for it, but a lot can happen in ten years. (Eventual HP/DM.)
