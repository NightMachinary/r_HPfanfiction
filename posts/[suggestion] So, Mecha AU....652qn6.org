Just a thought that has been on my head way longer than it's got any right to, so, discuss? So, Harry, Ron and Hermione are three school friends who have dealt with difficult situations, in particular, they helped bring down a cult in the past. Harry and Ron are both on the football (soccer, of course), Ron being the goalkeeper and Harry being their school's ace striker. Hermione is considered a genius and quite a promising scientist (she went to politics in the books). Depending on whether Lily and James are alive, Harry might be more outgoing, snarkier or more likely to retaliate, but more or less a good kid. Tom Riddle is both an occultist and a genius in engineering, the bastard son of a noble family, but disappeared several years ago. A decade before he tried to lead a coup, his followers using weaponry he himself invented and being known as Voldemort, this time, he is a cyborg, still chasing immortality. His attempt failed, and he disappeared from the face of earth. It was rumored that he found ruins of an ancient civilization, and discovered power like none have seen before. Dumbledore is considered the greatest scientific mind on the world, finding a mineral he called Merlinium and a new type of energy, which is even capable of reacting to human emotion. Voldemort has come back after several years, his followers and his weapons, but now, he brought a new machine, he refers to them as (okay, can't think of anything good), machines bigger than buildings unlike anything seen on earth, of unknown origin and nearly impossible to damage. But Dumbledore and the people of the Hogwarts had one thing waiting for them, three machines powered by the Avalon power, which seem to become the last hope they all have...


** While I think this is an interesting idea, it does suffer from some issues commonly found in the mecha genre.

First off - keep Harry an Orphan (look at Gundam: Iron-Bloodied Orphans for inspiration here). Being an Orphan gives him greater flexibility for friendship fics and motivation.

Two - the school setting. If you go with that, look up Unbreakable Machine Doll. Not necessarily a mecha show like you've described but mecha enough to give you an idea how magic and the school setting comes into play. I'd personally suggest against it unless you're going the traditional anime route of "teen heroes"; personally I'd age them up.

Three - timeline. Unless you're doing Voldemort's actual age here, he can't really disappear with enough time to create a new branch of cybernetics that would go with your idea. Which leads to...

Four - the creation of the mechs. I'd suggest doing it as an art that has existed for YEARS like Founders - gives a world building feel that's a bit more Escaflowne - and then over the years and at the start of the industrial revolution mecha became more popular and widespread in both the magical and non magical world. (If there's magic in yours?) This gives it a sense of history and you don't actually need to explain much.

Five - character interaction. What is Harry's goal? His purpose? Don't do a Code Geass. Think more Kuromukuro (freaking in LOVE with it right now - if you haven't seen it, it's on Netflix and Kissanime) or Gundam Wing. What reason would Ron and/or Harry have for being Hermoine's friend if there is no troll?

Consider the trope elements of a mech genre: The hero, the sidekick, the love interest, the elderly scientist/brain, the mech engineering team, the one family member or butler, the annoying but cute little sibling like figure.... who could you cast in those roles? Or repurpose them?

What is he antagonists role? Why should we care?

Anyway this went on longer than I planned. Link if you do write it!
