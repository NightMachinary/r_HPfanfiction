** I honestly don't read any new gen stuff because the epilogue and Cursed Child was so bad I don't want to read anything that includes those characters.

I would have been mildly interested before cursed child. But now? No. I am not interested. I've been reading FanFiction since 2002. In those years I have read hundreds of FanFiction's that I would pick as reality over Cursed Child.

If I had to guess, the old time FanFiction readers are just not that interested in things that happen to those future characters.

**** I can understand that. I pretend CC doesn't exist. But I feel equally strongly about the epilogue. It shouldn't have been included lol. So if I did read a third gen fic, it would have to be new characters, nothing to do with any of the ones mentioned in the book.

** Pre-CC, all the next gen characters were basically blank slates. There were no canon characterisations to even think about, so shipping a particular pairing makes no sense. You could easily transpose the character someone made up for Rose to any other girl in that year, including OCs, and it would make no difference except for name recognition.

Now there are canon characterisations, whether you like CC or not, and that gives fics a foundation to work off. Obviously Scorbus is more popular based on that.

** Not gonna lie, I was halfway through this before I realized you weren't misspelling Scorsese.

*** Same. Pretty much the only next gen fics I've read are Hogwarts Houses Divided, because Inverarity is amazing, and one or two others whose names are escaping me, so I had basically no idea what OP was talking about.

Thought they meant fics that had plots similar to a Scorsese movie used to be popular, which would be awesome, but I don't think that's ever been a thing.

** Scorbus is probably the only side effect from CC that stayed. Everything else CC-wise is basically ignored.

** Oh, is this Scorpios/Rose pairings?

Scorbus...is....Scorpios/Albus?

Weird seeing the side of this FF series I have never looked into.
