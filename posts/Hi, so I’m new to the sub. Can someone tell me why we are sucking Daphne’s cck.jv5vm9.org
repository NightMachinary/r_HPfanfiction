*** Haha I just tried to make the title attention grabbing so people would be more likely to click and answer my question. I guess it worked ðŸ¥º. And ik people like the ship, that's why I asked lmao. I don't even find the canon pairings that satisfying that's why I like fan fiction lol.

*** Hi sorry for asking!! I'm new I don't really know the vibe. Maybe I should have lurked for awhile before asking. I thought it would be harmless.
