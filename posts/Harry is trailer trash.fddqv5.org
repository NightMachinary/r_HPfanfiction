Following an incident with the Dursleys, Harry gets shipped off to live with distant relatives in the States who happen to be poor residents of a trailer park, but take in Harry as one of their own and love him very much. By the time he gets his Hogwarts letter, Harry's already trailer trash himself.


** And it's Hogwarts rather than Salem because his parents pre-enrolled him when he was born and paid a deposit to secure that enrollment, yes?

** Harry immediately beats the shit out of Draco for talkin fancy, then when it's time for the sorting he refuses to wear the sorting hat because "sharin hats is how his cousin got the itchy critters" and when Dumbledore calls him to his office to talk to him about it he just tells him "only my ma/pa and god can judge me and why dont you take your fairy twinklin eyes and fuck right off".
