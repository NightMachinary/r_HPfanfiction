:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I need help. Im looking for a LF (i remember it being long and completed) where Harry tries to commit suicide i think jumping from the tower. He almost dies and everyone think he is dead but then the unspeakables take his body and heal him. They train him and he trains to defeat Voldemort. Everyone believes him dead throughout the fic but he has a secret identity that he uses. I believe it is a Ginny/Harry fic. He has a different name that he uses alot throughout the fic. There is this big battle and when he defeats voldemort or just before his real identity is revealed and his true face emerges. Before this I think Ginny has suspicions about his identity. It is an amazing fic please help.
