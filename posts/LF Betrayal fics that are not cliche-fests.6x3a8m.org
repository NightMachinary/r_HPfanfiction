Oh, look! Harry Potter just killed Neville! (because it's /always/ Neville). No matter how out of character it is, /everyone/ knows he was "going dark"...

But wait! It's the trial now! And of course he's guilty, there's witnesses and all! What's that, ways of making people believe that they saw something that it's not? This is the Wizarding World, not /crazyland/...

And of course, his former friends take so much glee while burning his things, because *obviously* a Dark Harry Potter will be oh so sad to see his school robes burned...

I could go on, right? I just resumed so many fanfics...

If you know of any that is not so... /that/, I'd be really grateful.


** I think "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" counts.

*** I tried it. It's as /cliched/ as the others, just... different cliches.

*** I had to drop it after like 40 chapters because nothing was really happening. I can only take so much political bs. I think it was a bit after ^{^{^{spoilers}}} someone was sold off to Slughorn and Harry, being the ultimate badass 10 year old he was, married them instead. It was just barely even Harry Potter anymore at that point.

*** DPaSW is cliched as fuck, it just happens to give them a tiny bit of a twist to make them palatable.

*** It's definitely a clichefest. It's one of the biggest clichefests to come out in recent years.

** Hm...ah...hrmm...I dunno.

I suppose I could link you to a snippet I wrote once, featuring a Good Harry being sent to Azkaban for pretty sensible reasons: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6iiyfa/are_there_any_good_harry_is_falsely_imprisoned/dj6y5r1/?context=3][Here.]]

** You can give ffnlink(imprisoned realm by lovehp) a go... various characters betray one another and no one burns their things lol.
