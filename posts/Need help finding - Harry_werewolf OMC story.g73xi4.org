:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's an AU story with Harry/OMC. The OMC is a male alpha werewolf - I think he owns a club or pub and he is from Greece? I don't remember the exact circumstances but I believe the OMC smelt Harry by a car and knew Harry was his mate.

Harry was adopted by a couple (vampires ?) at a young age I believe. From what I can remember the story starts when Harry is 16/17maybe? I think he dropped out of Hogwarts.

I also remember something about there being a catering company? And Harry was working for it as a waiter?

Sorry its a little vague, it's been a long time since I read that story and the last time it was still WIP.

Any help is highly appreciated! Thanks!

Edit: Update! I finally found it. I dug through my previous hard drives from 10 years ago and went through every WIP story I recored and found it at the end of the list. Venom Kisser by VampyricRedemption linkffn(3967986) for anyone who is interested in reading. It is still WIP unfortunately.


** Was the story on FF.net or ao3.org?

*** I believe it's on ffn but it's been a few years since I read that story, so I could be wrong. I don't think I was on ao3 a few years ago.
