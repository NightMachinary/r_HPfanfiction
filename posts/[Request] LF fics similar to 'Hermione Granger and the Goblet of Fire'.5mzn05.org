I just finished reading "Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire" (thanks to [[/u/JumboCactuar69]] and [[/u/Ambush]]) and loved it. I was wondering if there were any similar fics out there? Hermione focused/POV, still in Hogwarts, not massively AU, possibly H/Hr, etc.

Any suggestions?


** Also just read it, also enjoyed it. Also am interested in Hermione POV fics. There are some good Ginny focused (The Changeling, some good 6th year fics), but don't recall many Hermione POV H/Hr fics. Portkey's demise kinda sucks.

** Well, there's always chem prof's fics. Hermione's POV, although a little bit more AU than Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire.

You should check ARedHair's profile. He's not an author, but has an interesting essay up on his bio and his favorites consists mostly of H/Hr fics.
