Harry watched in absolute shock as his blood was added to the cauldron with Wormtails hand aswell as the powder from the grave. A great fog billowed from the cauldron and from within it rose a humanoid figure.

Its skin was pale and deathly, it was definitely male though not by much. His eyes were a deep crimson with no whites at all. His head was hairless and yup, hairless down there too. The other defining characteristic if this man thing was the lack of a nose in any form. The man stretched his fingers and ran his hands across his face, he paused quickly followed by a scream of rage.

"Peter you fool, you idiot, you absolute fucking biscuit, I told you to use the right hand you filthy rat!" By now Wormtail was a quivering mess, be that because of his missing hand or the man infront of him Harry could only guess.

"I-I am s-sorry my lord." Peter croaked out.

"Sorry! Sorry isn't going to bring my nose back you idiot! I loved my nose, it was the best part of my face, do you know how many unfortunate souls live with a hideous nose, to big, to small, to wide or to thin. Even your rodent pecker stuck between your eyes. But not me, I had the best nose to ever sniff and ever smell. I prided myself on my nose. You destroyed my baby, for that you will pay with far more!" The man that Harry had now realised might be Voldemort screamed about all things nose related and even made Harry question his own nose.

"How will I smell the scents of the world- oh, we have a guest. Not that it shall matter for you will doe very soon Harry."

It was a very short lived rebirth that Tom Marvalo Riddle enjoyed as the fire of the cauldron began to burn his feet and legs. Many rituals to reduce all forms of pain did not help him here as he was oblivious to his burning body.

Harry blocked his nose from the horrible smell of burning flesh that Voldemort unfortunately, or is that fortunately did not smell.

He will have a power the dark lord nose not. Who thought that it was not a sixth sense but one of the main five.
