[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13186327/1/The-Afterlife][This excellent one]] made me fall in love with the concept, but I haven't managed to find any other good ones. I'd really like to read one that involves characters who weren't in the story I linked, like Hagrid, Dobby, and Cedric. I'd also really like a story that addresses what happened to Voldemort in the afterlife - maybe he never got to the afterlife because of how damaged his soul was, or maybe he exists in the afterlife as a helpless creature doomed to eternal misery or something.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: I found [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6719754/1/Reunion][another really good one!]] This one has two chapters - the first is focused on James and Lily meeting their deceased loved ones, and the second chapter is about Harry doing the very same. I love this story, totally recommend it for anyone who's as eager about this "afterlife reunion" concept as I am!


** This sadly doesn't fit the bill in the Voldemort department, but an old classic that I read years ago is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6755363/1/No-Hurry-At-All][No Hurry At All]]. A bit of a divergence in what you're asking for but does include Harry meeting his deceased loved ones. Hope you like it! I'll peruse my reading list to see if I have another that fits what you're requesting more closely :)

*** Thank you so much! This isn't really what I was looking for but it seems pretty good so far and I appreciate the recommendation all the same! Don't worry too much about the specifics I mentioned in my post, those are just things I'd like to see if possible - any story that focuses on Harry reuniting with the people he lost works just fine. Thanks again :D

** Northumbrian's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7312702/1/Centuries][Centuries]] is similar

As for Voldemort, it's pretty clear from canon that his mangled soul would rot in limbo/hell forever!

*** Thanks a lot for the recommendation! I was looking for something a bit more focused on Harry reuniting with everyone who died, but this was a really nice wholesome story nonetheless :D

And yeah, you're probably right about Voldy's soul! DH made it pretty clear what happened to the fragment that lived inside Harry, but I was always curious about the final fragment, the one in Voldemort's body. I suppose it probably met the same fate, but I think a different take would be really interesting

** This may be very out of left field, but linkao3(All Hallows by esama) was a fun take on the Harry dying concept. Harry dies and becomes an agent of death, but not actually DEATH. It's a bit melancholy, but I found it interesting. It's also technically a crossover with Rise of the Guardians (but those characters don't really factor in).

*** This is a bit out there for my tastes, and it doesn't focus on the "reunion with Harry's loved ones" aspect as much as I'd like, but it's a very interesting concept and I like what I've had time to read so far. Thanks so much for the recommendation!
