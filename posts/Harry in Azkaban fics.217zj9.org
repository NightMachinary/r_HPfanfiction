** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium_for_the_Sleepless_Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] by Voice of the Nephilim.

The author did such a great job of making Azkaban a terrifying place, and the mystery will keep you interested throughout the whole story. Oh, and the plot twist is awesome.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1291535/1/Betrayed][Betrayed]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3595986/1/Fugitives-of-Azkaban][Fugitives of Azkaban]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4478398/1/Riddick][Riddick]] are a couple that I've read recently.

Harry isn't sent to Azkaban, but camps out there for a while anyway in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All_The_Dementors_of_Azkaban][All the Dementors of Azkaban]].

*** I've read all of these but Fugitives of Azkaban and I can say that they're pretty good.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/750576/1/Never-Alone-Never-Again][Never Alone, Never Again]], a well written fic about Harry being rescued from the Dursleys, and Sirius and Remus struggling to provide him with love and family. Harry gets sent to Azkaban for a while somewhere in the middle.
