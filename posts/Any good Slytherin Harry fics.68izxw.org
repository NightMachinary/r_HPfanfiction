Exactly what the title says, though preferably with Dark Harry and without any slash. And Complete.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) Very good take on what would happen if Harry's horcrux became conscious and started interacting with Harry. Great writing.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Path of Decision Linkffn(4438449) - A crossover with sandman comics. But don't really need to know about the comics.

What if love wasn't the power the dark lord know not but Endless was? Features 7D: death, desire, destiny, delirium, dream despair, destruction - are family of Endless.

** linkao3(Red Sorrow by lupinlaughed) -- not Harry-centric, but he's still a major character. I read this a while ago and while there were some parts that were a little slow, it was overall pretty good.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) -- WBWL done really well. updates are slow, but there's a lot of really well written fic there already. Not exactly Dark!Harry but lots of cynical Harry

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/270848/chapters/427550][Session Transcripts]] --hands down one of the best and most original (both plot-wise and stylistically) fan fics I've ever read. For some reason, the bot never links the fic, so I attempted to link it.

linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectare) -- fabulously written; also contains one of my favorite portrayals of Severus Snape.

linkffn(They Shook Hands: Year 1 (New Version) by Dethryl) -- honestly I don't remember a ton about this one because it's been a while since I read it but I do remember that it was good enough for me to read through the entire series

*** Wish there was more stuff like Red Sorrow. I love family drama of this sort, but unfortunately, the premise is a bit out there and most author's can even render it in the same zipcode as believable.

*** Red Sorrow was legitimately finished today, and I really liked the ending. However I'd never call it a good SLYTHERIN Harry fanfic. His character is very well written, but he shows absolutely no Slytherin traits. I'm pretty sure the only reason that the author put his character into Slytherin was to make sure that Harry had reasons to interact with Snape, and that Snape would have some conflict between Harry and Ariel.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
