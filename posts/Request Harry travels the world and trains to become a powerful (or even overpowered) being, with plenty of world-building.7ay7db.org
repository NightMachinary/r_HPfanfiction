Preferably non-crossover and definitely non-slash. The fic has to be well-written and either complete or regularly updated.

I want a Harry who, for example, decided to leave the UK after Voldemort's defeat. He travels the world for several years, training in numerous hidden locations - muggle and magical training - and returns years later to face a new, even more powerful threat.

Well nevermind then.

^{E: Ha! Two people got it before me.}

Not many globetrotting fics, sadly.

Maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10349675/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lightning-Scar][/Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar/]]? I think it's limited to one place in the US though. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][/A Second Chance at Life/]] has an arc in Incan(?) South America that was interesting when I read it. 2/3 of trilogy complete, third dead. Maybe not well-written? Been years since I read it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][/Bungle in the Jungle/]] is also limited to one place (in Brazil this time!). Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][/A Long Journey Home/]] More globetrotting than the others! Also more time-travel than place-travel. Updating sporadically.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Book One of the Wise One trilogy is pretty much this. Harry is taken from the Dursleys by Sirius before he goes to Hogwarts, and the pair travel the world meeting some very well-written OCs and learning magic.

Book Two turns into a pretty standard Harry at Hogwarts story, and the less said about the ending of Book Three, the better. Shame, because the first one has a solid place on my favourites list.
