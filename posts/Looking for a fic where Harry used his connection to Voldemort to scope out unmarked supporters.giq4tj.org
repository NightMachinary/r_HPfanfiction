:END:
I've been searching for a fic that I read some indeterminate time ago where Harry used his connection to Voldemort to uncover the identities of unmarked Death Eaters/supporters and assassinated them. The most specific thing I remember is that Harry always left a calling card-- a plastic pony figurine (the tipping point for his killing spree was witnessing the death of a muggle family; the only thing he found in the rubble was a child's pony figurine). Not sure if I read it on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] or AO3. Not in my A03 history but if I'm reading on my phone I'm often not signed in.
