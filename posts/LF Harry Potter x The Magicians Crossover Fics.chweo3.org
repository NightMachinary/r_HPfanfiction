anything will do really, just want to see a crossover.


** I have one planned, but I doubt it'll see the light of day.

I think the trick with a HP x Magicians crossover is the timing issue -- the HPverse is set so many years ahead of when Quentin and Julia arrive at Fillory, so unless its a second gen or the HP cast as we know them are teachers (Harry as Dean Fogg would be hilarious), finding a way to intersect them will be hard.

That said, I might write that story as a one shot and post it...! If so, I'll link it here.

*** Easy, most of hp can safely ignore time scales, so just move one world back and one forward. Not everyone is familiar with the magicians, so set that back in hp timeline?
