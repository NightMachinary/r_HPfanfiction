:FlairText: Prompt
:END:
I'm reading a lot of Naruto fanfics lately and had the idea for this prompt.

-Percy is actually op and kills all Weasleys expect Ron

-Percy crucios Ron and disappears

-Ron becomes super edgy and lives only on to get revenge on Percy

-This starts before Ron goes go Hogwarts

Optional:

-After Ron kills Percy he finds Percy had to kill his family because they planned to dose the bwl with love potions (Dumbledores orders)

-Ron now wants to get revenge on Percy

-Snape beats him to it


** And Harry Potter, our orphan protagonist whose dream is to become the next Headmaster.

*** And Hermione, the incredibly intelligent third member of the trio, who becomes increasingly irrelevant even though the series could use someone with brains...

Oh, wait.

**** The first half of Naruto is really similar to Harry Potter in quite a few regards.

** Death Eaters = Akatsuki obviously Voldemort discovered Salazar Slytherin in the Chamber of Secrets and is using the Death Eaters to enact Slytherin's plan to kill the Muggles and Muggleborns. Then Slytherin gets stabbed in the back by fucking Dobby who has been manipulating magical history for centuries to revive mfing Herpo the Foul! Because more plot twists!

** Throughout the fic, Ron refers to Percy as "him". Lol.

And he's also doing that sasuke/gendo pose.

** On a serious note, if Percy is Itachi and killed the Weasley's then Ginny can't stand-in for Hinata.

Thus I vote for the Patil family to be the wizarding worlds Hyuga. Padma = Hinata and Parvati = Neji.
