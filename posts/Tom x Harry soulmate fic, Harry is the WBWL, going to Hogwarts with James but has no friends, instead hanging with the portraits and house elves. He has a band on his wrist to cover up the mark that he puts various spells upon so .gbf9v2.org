** This one doesn't match exactly (Harry doesn't have a brother and his parents aren't alive) but Harry does have a bracelet on his wrist that is almost impossible to take off. linkao3(18394907)

*** Ah, that's the one! Yeah - it appears I got some of the details wrong, I've just read so many fics since then that the details of them are kinda muddled together haha. Thank you very much!

  Harry has some weird words on his left wrist. That must be one of those strange things that Aunt Petunia hates so much. But it's okay! He likes them.Then, it all turns even weirder. Hogwarts, magic, a Headmaster and a Dark Lord await Harry - he would prefer if they all just left him alone, thank you very much.But when has it ever mattered what Harry wants?

** Harry isn't the WBWL, my bad. Harry ends up living with the Dursleys whilst James is praised for defeating Voldermort. I believe they both have scars? But Harry's is ignored

*** Oh, I just realised that these were the two fics I was messing up between! The other was the one I was looking for, but the incorrect details that I gave were definitely from this hahaha. Thank you!

  Bearing the Dark Lord's soul mark on his chest certainly isn't easy when his family is firmly on the Light Side. HarryxVoldemort SLASH. Set in the Past.
