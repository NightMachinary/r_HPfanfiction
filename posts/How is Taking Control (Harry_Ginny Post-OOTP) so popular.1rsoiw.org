I do not tend to rant about or bash fics, in fact this is the first time I've really ever done it.

How is Taking Control so popular? It is a Harry/Ginny Post-OoTP fic that is outrageously OOC, and pretty much bashes Ron and Hermione.

Here is the story, for reference: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking-Control]]

For starters, there is no warning about character bashing, but it does so greatly, especially with Ron and Hermione. The author makes them fight to the point where the aren't the dynamic trio anymore. Harry would absolutely die for his friends, and yet in this story, you do not see that. After the events of in the Department of Mysteries, Harry's feelings for that factor goes up. Definitely not in this fic.

Ron and Hermione are not only bashed (the author doesn't seem to realize it either, he pretty much apologizes for doing it, and then continues to do it, even though he says "they are still very good friends"), they are outrageously OOC. There are things they would never do in canon (even worse, this story isn't labeled OOC or AU!), and it sickens me. I tried to read up to about chapter 13, hoping it got better, and it doesn't.

Also, some of the canon stuff that is very much implied before and during OoTP gets trashed. Two Animagus forms possible, wandless magic being untraceable, apparating seems too easy. This author rips canon (pre-HBP known canon) to the point I am surprised he didn't just give different names to all the characters and be done with it.

How is this story so popular (2000+ favorites on FFN)? It is beyond me!

Sorry for the rant, but it is outrageous. I hate when authors bash characters, especially the Golden Trio and their friendship, which lasts through hell and back many times.


** Disregarding the merits of your complaints, keep in mind that the story in question was posted in May of /2006/.

That's an average of only 20 follow/faves per week. Given the story's length (520K!) and update rate, that's not utterly crazy.
