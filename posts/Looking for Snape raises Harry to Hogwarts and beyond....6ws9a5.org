** I once read a time travel fic where Snape goes back after realizing Harry's terrible upbringing and raises/trains him as a father. Snape and Sirius manage to be friends. Dumbledore is very frustrated.

I will update if I remember the title.

Edit: technically prehogwarts, he takes Harry on the day Hagrid takes him to Diagonal Alley.
