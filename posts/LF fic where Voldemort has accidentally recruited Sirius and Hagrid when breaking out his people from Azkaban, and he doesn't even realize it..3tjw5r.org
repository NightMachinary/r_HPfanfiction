** It's probably this one, linkffn(10677106) , although Voldemort does realise it, but he thinks they are his most devoted followers, because he doesn't remember them.

***** Hmm ... yeah, the crack contained within makes looking at the original story kind of hard without starting to laugh.

Because there doesn't seem to be anything in canon that actually contradicts the possibility that is presented in this story. And that makes it that much more hilarious.

Also, “Harry's” narration in this one is so lemony sometimes that it's hard to keep a straight face. Like the very start with the Dursleys and their detection of evil.

But then again, you do know that already ... still is hilarious, though.

******* Yeah, the guy's hilarious. And the silliness that ensues because of his lack of understanding of certain things ... Dumbledore's dark magic, anyone? Or killing people with love? Trelawney the Death Eater?
