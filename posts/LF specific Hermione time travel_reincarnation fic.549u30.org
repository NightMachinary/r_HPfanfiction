In the fic, Hermione and Ron's children are fully grown. Voldemort returns and forces them to flee. Hermione ends up trying to find the fountain of youth in order to prevent Voldemort from using it. She ends up being reincarnated as the twin sister of Lily Evans.

Think it's a WIP.

Thanks!!!!

** I think the story would be more interesting if Hermione overwrote Petunia before she got together with Vernon.

**** Imagine Lily's surprise when Petunia completely changed and became a total bad ass.

Also, I wouldn't have Voldemort coming back. Instead, I would have Hermione experimenting with a magical artifact and it blew up in her face, forcing her to do things all over again in a different body.

*** I miss her earlier version, /The Thief of Time/. It was way more accessible and fun to read - this new version reads like my PhD theory books. :(

***** Her Tumblr says that she was harassed and stalked by a fan of ToT, and that's why she stopped writing. :/ So that combined with a laptop crash probably didn't help. I just like that version better compared to her new one of /fair fortune/... but, she hasn't really gotten into the story aspect of the new one yet, so I'm still giving it a fair chance!
