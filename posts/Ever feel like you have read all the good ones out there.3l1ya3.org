Any newer good stories over 100K words and complete?

EDIT: a few more criteria...no slash I guess, but other than that I dont exclude much. I do tend to like powerful/independent a bit more than others, pairings dont bother me

** After about thirteen years of reading fabrication, having high standards, and generally enjoying only a certain kind of fic (Harry centric), I often feel that way.

Then I happen across a fic I've never read before, and fall in love all over again

Can't really rec any fics at the moment, laptop is dead with all my bookmarks, and running on a tablet at the moment. I will say that someone recommended Cadmean Victory, which I found borderline unreadable, even being the Harry/Fleur fanatic that I am.

#+begin_quote
  When Regina becomes curious about the two notebooks constantly tucked under the Sheriff's arm, she vows to discover their contents. Doing so, however, leads to a much deeper discovery-the discovery of a side of Emma Swan she had never even known existed; a haunted past, a complexity, a talent, and a beauty unlike anything she had ever expected to uncover. Rated M for content.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing.

  In the wake of the blood war, the magical world is on the verge of being discovered. However after years of 'terrorism' parents of muggleborns are reacting badly to discovering the truth and its only going to get worse if the rest of the world finds out about them with the current public sentiment. With that in mind the idea to introduce the magical world in a VRMMO is proposed.

Trying enjoying another fanfic community, say Dresden Files, and feel the despair when there are only 900+ works.

*** You can't find any and you've only been at it for a year? I find that to be rather shocking. I am curious what your parameters are. Personally I tend to only read 100K completed stories and are still able to find many stories. Granted, less than I used to, but there are still plenty. I have learned how to wade through so much of the crap to find the gems over the years. If you tell me what kind of pics you are looking for, I would love to see if I could help you find some. I started as a G/H shipper for a little while, then became a HUGE Hr/H and have since branched out to many other ships that I enjoy reading. H/Tonks, H/Daphne, H/Luna, H/Susan, H/Fleur, etc. Eventually you learn to branch out a bit more but you always have a soft spot for your personal ship

** Well, sometimes it seems like it - but then again:

I only read certain types of Fanfiction (no slash for example!) and I don't like all the pairings either (like say Hermione/Ron as the main pairing...having them as a background pairing is bad enough -.-)...and then something new comes along (or I stumble across something I haven't read), like ATM:

Cadmean Victory on Fanfiction.net (it's Harry/Fleur...a pairing I really like which could use more people writing it -.-)

=> Note that's WIP and doesn't have the required length yet, it was just to show that there's new fictions popping up all the time :)

ps: I agree that giving additional criteria would be helpful (so that no one recommends stuff you don't want to read about anyway...like for me: Slash, I always put in my requests that I don't like slash (well: main character slash - slash in the background is ok!) recommendations!)
