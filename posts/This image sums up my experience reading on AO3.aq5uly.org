*** It doesn't work perfectly though. Some people don't tag protagonists or don't tag the pairing. And poly is not filtered properly.

For example, excluding Hermione Granger/Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger/Lucius Malfoy does not exclude Hermione Granger/Draco Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy. And blacklisting Draco Malfoy does not exclude pairing tags with him involved.

**** Sadly the same could be said for FFN. Authors failing to tag is a universal problem, but on FFN it's exacerbated by the fact that tagging is limited to 4 characters, which can be misleading in cases where the fics has more than 4 central POV characters, or more than one central multiship. Unlike Ao3, FFN lacks the "multi" tag entirely, so there's no way to filter out that and other kinks without using an external resource such as Scryer.

I've checked out of curiosity, and there are only 13 fics with this pairing, and half of them are also tagged Hermione Granger/Draco Malfoy and/or Hermione Granger/Lucius Malfoy. So it's very unlikely that you'll find them in every or even most search results. And you can easily scroll past a fic that occasionally slips through the filters if you clearly see by the tags that it's not what you are interested in.

And it's not like FFN doesn't have its fair share of Dramione or Hermione/Lucius

***** Yes, but blacklisting characters on FFN eliminates them completely from the results and given that you can only tag four characters, false positives are less likely.

I way using Lucius as an example, there are more fics with Hermione/Draco/either Nott or Blaise around. At least it feels like that. Another example would be excluding m/m, but m/m/m still show up because they are tagged as multi.

But excluding him on Archive removes significantly more stories, most of which simply have him in the background.

And looking for rarepairs is a real chore on Ao3. FFN is pretty upfront about the absence of Harry/Katie Bell or Harry/Demelza Robins. But Archive will give you a bunch of longer fics where they get a few background mentions at best, but you can't tell without reading through 150k of Snape/Hermione or something of similar disgustingness.

And say what you will about disgustingness on AO3, it's all clearly tagged and thus can be avoided, meanwhile I've had some very nasty surprises that made me want to bleach my brain on FFN more than once.

Well, I still haven't figured out how to search for something specific on FFN and mostly find new fics through favourites of user/writers who have similar taste to mine.

The only real problem with AO3 is tagging all the pairings and characters that ever appear in the story, so that searching for rarepairs or popular secondary ships is hard, but at least you CAN search for them. On FFN, many fics don't even bother tagging the main pairing and mention it in the summary instead.

***** I've recently had issues searching for new fics to read due to the lack of pairing tags on FFN stories, so I can commiserate on that subject particularly. For example, I sometimes enjoy reading stories with a OC POV character, but I don't want the OC to be paired with the male character I am searching for (because usually those are SI Mary Sues). Unfortunately, nine times out of ten when the "OC" tag shows up on a story it's a pairing story but not tagged as such.

***** Agreed. I've counted, and unless the story is very short and simple, 30-40 tags is actually right about my sweet spot in terms of providing enough detail to be helpful, but not so much that my eyes glaze over and I scroll right past. I have a terrible time finding anything on FFN due to the overly simplistic tagging system.

The inability to tag primary vs secondary characters and pairings has been one of my few complaints about AO3 for a long time, but the new otp:true filter has been very helpful as a starting point when I'm trying to look for a pairing that is more unusual or that usually appears as a side or background pairing.

******* When you're on a pairing tag, just put otp: true in the Search Within results box, and it will return works that are tagged with only that pairing.

As an example, here's the Sirius/Remus tag [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Sirius%20Black*s*Remus%20Lupin/works][without the filter]], and here it is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=otp%3Atrue&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Sirius+Black*s*Remus+Lupin][with the filter]].

It's not perfect - it does cut out fics where your pairing is the main one but there are other secondary pairings - but if the pairing you're looking for is rarer or often appears as a background ship, it's a really helpful way to find fics that FOCUS on the pairing you want. As a bonus, it also gets rid of those Tumblr ficlet collections with 30 different pairings given 200 words apiece. :P

** Well hp is trash on Ao3 but for other fandoms, asoiaf for example, it is the better site.

*** I heavily disagree that HP is trash on AO3. Sure FF.Net has about 500k *more* stories, but AO3 still offers a superior browsing experience in my opinion.

** I really don't like AO3, the design is horrible and it's a royal pain to find fics when it needn't be. FF.net might not be perfect but at least it has a more coherent design than AO3!

*** I like the look of AO3 better, I like how you can easily download fic, and I like how there are "comments" where you can see author discussion. I stick to FFN because it is a huge source of HP fanfic. AO3 has its issues but it has been thought out to some extent and exclude filtering is very useful.

*** Huh, I always have so much more trouble finding what I like on FF. I basically only browse AO3 by tags. Yesterday I was on the MoD Harry tag. The day before I was on the time travel tag, filtered to exclude all Harry/Vold fics.

I also find that the older I get, the more I prefer the things found on AO3. Like I seem to find better fics on AO3 from a writing standpoint? Maybe it's an older crowd? (Less true for Harry Potter but more true for Avengers, I think. Probably because of when the fanfics started, Avengers is a newer fandom.)

*** AO3 was specifically designed to be the maximum inclusiveness possible. Its really easy to navigate with things like screen readers. FFnet cant say the same

***** You probably also started using FFN *long* before you even heard of AO3, as is the case with most readers.

I had the same complaints for a long time and absolutely hated AO3 compared to FFN, but then I realized it was just because I was averse to change.

The tagging system for AO3 is honestly just flat out better than FFN in terms of finding fics that you want to read, and for most fandoms, AO3 is more active than FFN nowadays, Harry Potter being one of a few potential exceptions for whatever reason.
