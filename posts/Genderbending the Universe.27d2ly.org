I am a fan of genderbending but taking things to their [usually illogical] extremes, I find myself hesitating on genderbending the Harry Potter universe for one reason: Names. Not first names [though I can't really think of a female version of Tom] but last names. Severus Snape becomes Serverina [cringe] Prince, easy. But I want to genderbend his parents too so Eileen Prince becomes Eli Prince but Tobias Snape...who was his parents?

So it becomes an issues of not only names but family lines. Granted, I could just genderbend one character or genderbend only a small group of characters but the last name thing still haunts me.

So how do I work around this? Change the names however and just make up what I don't know or will it require university-level reserch? Mind you, if I do get around the names, I am still also follow through with other changes...like if Tom was a girl and Merope was a man, would Tom would have been abandoned as a baby? Would she be raised by a cringing weak man or a still love-potioned Tom Riddle Sr?

TLDR: How do you deal with names in a genderbent AU? What changes do you think will happen in a genderbent universe that you think will be necessary due to a change in gender?


** Is the similarity of names really that important? I've read some genderbent AUs (granted not any where every character was a different gender). In the girl!Harry ones, sometimes the author names her Harriet with Harry as a nickname, but I've also seen Rose (playing off the flower name thing), Haesel, Holly, Hollis... and it doesn't make much of a difference to me as a reader.

I'm not sure what your question is about Tobias Snape. You want to make him a female and Eileen a male, so you have Eli Prince marrying, say, Tabitha Snape. Easy. Why does it matter who the parents were? Unless you're saying that the last name would need to be different since it would be coming from the other parent. Like if in canon Tobias's parents were John Snape and Mary Snape nee Jones. In your genderbent AU it would be Jane and Mark Jones, so Tobias would be Tabitha Jones... is that what you're getting at? If so, then I think you're causing yourself a whole lot of unnecessary pain and suffering. Just go back as far in the family tree as we know exist from canon. Why agonize over characters that are never even mentioned?

EDIT: And your question about the fate of Tom Riddle Jr. if Tom Riddle Sr. were actually Thomasina. If you're going to be as purist about genderbending as it seems -- like, every single character in the universe, central or not -- then that's only the tip of the iceberg. Take Merope. Man-Merope would have a mother and a sister instead of a brother and father. Would her mother speak Parseltongue if she wasn't born a Gaunt, descendent of Slytherin? Would that change the family dynamic, if they had to converse in English? Make them less isolated? Would Tom Riddle Jr. even be born? And Dumbledore. Would Alba Dumbledore's life have been different if her mother went to Azkaban for attacking muggle children in defense of her son? In the late 19th century, with how few options women had and how rigid gender roles were, losing the husband/father would have different effects on the family than losing the mother.

This is pretty interesting, but I think eventually you'd just need to stop going back that far in family trees, or else change the way society works in your AU. None of this would be an issue if your world was more matriarchal than patriarchal. The last names would all be the same as canon, because men would take their wives' names upon marriage. Mrs. Dumbledore going to jail would have pretty much the same effect on the Dumbledore household as in canon if traditional gender roles were switched.

It's fun to think about, but I think you'll have to decide how different you want the world to be. If it's pretty much like canon except the genders are different, then I think to prevent headaches you'd have to draw the line somewhere, and keep the genders the same going back two or three generations.

*** I really don't think I am going to write it but if I were going to, I would make it through and epic. My name question is with the last name, not the first. I can reasonably think of genderbent names of all the characters but the last name though is a killer.

If I wrote this, it would be a massive epic that would change the universe all the way back to Merlin if I could. Even the smallest families would be effected.

Case in point, the Blacks. They name all their kids off of Stars. In story, we have 7 named Blacks [or Black named] people that have roles in the story: Sirius, Regulus, Narcissa, Draco, Bellatrix, Andromeda and Nymphadora. I would ahve to switch their names around because you couldn't have a man named Bellatrix. A lesser person would just rename him to Beau, not thinking of the naming scheme but someone who is as anal as me would switch it with a male character so Bellatrix become Regulus or Sirius or even Draco. Well Regulus is taken now so Fem!Regulus needs a name and the process starts all over again.

The thing with Merope depends on how I want to write her...er...him. I could write him as a Neville-like character bullied to near squibhood which is close to canon OR I can write him like that but underlay his personality as a magnificent bastard that willingly lets his daughter be raised in an orphanage so she will cultivate a hate of muggles or even going further, he rapes the charming Tomasina because he wanted that beauty and charm in his bloodline and knew that a little bit of blood will make his darling daughter strong.

I want to go back because this stuff is FASCINATING and fun to think of. Even if I can't be assed to write it, it's great to discuss and who knows, someone will be motivated to write it or collab with me so this idea doesn't die.

***** Hmmmm that could be a solution...

Not a bad one. Now to work out the changed dynamics and the ones who have a naming scheme like the Blacks...and most of the characters named after romans [Lucius, Severus, Remus, etc]

** Have you read the Firebird Saga by Darth Marrs? It has pretty good Genderbending names. Dean is Deanna, and there's a few more as well.

For Harry most people use Harriet. In a couple of stories I have not posted but are WIP on my computer, I use Hailie. I like it better.

*** You are kind of missing it. I don't care about FIRST names I care about SECOND names. Snape becomes Prince but will there even be a snape to begin with if tobias snape, snape's dad, is a female? What would Tobias' maiden name be if his, now her, parents were gender swapped? Deep thoughts here, deep thoughts.

I could give two figs if Harry becomes Harriet, Halliey of Hannah Montana, the story I want to know is if you genderbent Harry's parents, what becomes of Lily Potter who is now Lilan Evans, bookish person who was kind to the Slytherin outcast, Severina? Would James Potter be as big of a bully as a female? Would Dumbledore still be Headmaster or would it go to McGonagall? Ask MORE questions.

** I've read a story where Harry gets transported to an alternate universe where everyone is the reverse gender, including a female version of himself.

Without going too deep into the plot, the author had a very interesting take on how a reverse gender univer worked. in his world the roles of men and women were reversed. Not biologically, so men can't get pregnant etc. but socially.

For example, in this world Harry was very surprised at how promiscuous the girls were and how easy it was for him to have sex. Until Orestes (male Hermione) points out that boys weren't supposed to have sex with everything that moves and that it essentially made him a slut. He was also constantly underestimated as "just a girl" and people were extremely surprised that he acted as aggressive and self-confident as he did.

In a world where everyone changes gender, essentially no one does since they still keep their same place in society.

*** That is pretty interesting. So it was a matricial society instead of patricial. As much as I want to explore this, it doesn't feel...idk, fresh. Crosses and Naughts is like this but with race [oppressed whites, black people in power, etc] but it still felt like a non-escape. There is nothing that separates their world from ours and as much as I am for writing what you know, it makes fiction, especially fanfiction boring. That's why I avoid high school AUs and even muggle AUs since there is nothing aside from the novelty of 'ooooh new scenery'.

If I did write this, there would be a change. Take the Malfoys. Lucius would be the wife while Narcissa is the husband. In canon, Narcissa is the society wife while Lucius is the trust fund baby with some dabbling in government [I would kill to see a fict where he has to deal with Mycroft Holmes from BBC Sherlock]. In my universe, I don't see Narcissa as one to rest on her laurels, even as the third son/daughter, [s]he's more ambitious than that so I would have him/her become a private healer with rich clients. Lucius may wind up as the arm candy/trophy but with a nudge, [s]he would do some government things like Amelia Bones.

**** Be careful though: there is a fine line between "an original approach to canon" and "effectively redesigning the entire universe".

You are planning to change so much that it essentially stops being a fanfiction, you might as well start writing an original story for all the things you change.

***** Funny I just told that to someone. The personalities [and looks] are more or less the same to be honest. I have gone far enough to morph a genderbend into original characters and stories but I know the line and can toe it.

It still boils down to 'harry potter genderbent' with the same events in canon but there are some little twists here and there. Fem!Vernon I doubt to be as violent as her male counterpart [unless I go down the same road as Precious but that is a fict for another day], for example.

Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

Harry Potter - Rated: M - English - Drama/Romance - Chapters: 15 - Words: 66,217 - Reviews: 1135 - Favs: 1,710 - Follows: 1,922 - Updated: Sep 22, 2010 - Published: Nov 16, 2007 - Harry P., Luna L.

What's there is interesting but hasn't progressed beyond exploring the concept into 'how will this help Harry go home and win'. The author is still active, so maybe a bit of encouragement will prompt him to revisit the work.
