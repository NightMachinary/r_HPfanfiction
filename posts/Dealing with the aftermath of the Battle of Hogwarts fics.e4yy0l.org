I'm an avid fan of next gen fanfics so the world of ALL the other types of fanfics is basically unknown to me. However I've stumbled upon a few great fanfics about the trio and Weasleys dealing with the traumas right after the battle of Hogwarts and I'm interested in reading more of these fics. I'm not looking for any particular pairing or POV, any of the 'good' characters will do (though other not-so-good characters' POV is also welcomed). The more scope and characters the fic depicts the better, I want it to show the whole 'dealing with the consequences of the war' picture, not just a specific character. The fics I read and loved similar to what I'm looking for are: Ottery St Catchpole by Erisah Mae, Fifty Six Funerals and From the Ashes both by Chanel19.

Must caution you, it's only 4 chapters long and incomplete so far, and I'm not sure when she plans to update, but I really like the concept behind it. It's set 10 years after the war, but makes a number of references to the more immediate aftermath of the war, and the plot deals with the long term consequences of the war and Voldemort's rise to power.

Anthony Goldstein is a Ministry prosecutor who is assigned a case that potentially involves neo-Death Eaters and the use of the Imperius Curse. He also keeps in close contact with several DA members.

  Anthony Goldstein, Ministry Prosecutor, has to prosecute a case involving neo-Death Eaters and the Imperius Curse ten years after the war ends. There's something more to it, though, and he can't get the Auror division to investigate -- so he's going to have to take it into his own hands.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817/chapters/36799368][15809817]]) is a great one about a truth and reconciliation commission to deal with justice in a post-war world. Broad cast of characters and situations. It's also complete!

** I've seen this one recommended here several times. I tried reading and got to chapter 9. While it is very well written there isn't a lot going on. Harry hires some people and has an endless string of business meetings. Now the second one is much more fun. Well, not exactly fun, but at least stuff happens and Harry deals with PTSD.
