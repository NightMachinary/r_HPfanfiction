I've been trying to find a fanfiction that i read ages ago, but cannot find it. It contained: * Snape getting a letter, which leads him to check on harry (pre-hogwarts) * being taught by the Flamels, Snape and Mcgonagall * Evil Dumbledore (with Arther Weasley and wormtail helping him)\\
* Dumbledore can speak parseltongue * and Fawkes is actually a spy for Flamel that is all the main points that i can remember. if any of you guys can tell me whats the name of the fanfiction, it would me much appreciated.
