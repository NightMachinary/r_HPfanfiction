There's also the fact that I don't believe in statutory rape laws and set ages of consent (they don't take the maturity of that person who was supposedly "raped" into account (sorry, but I myself would have loved to have a consensual sexual relationship in my teens - as young as 12 (I saw my first propper porno movie at 11 at a friend's house - the guy had found his dad's stash! Hell, I his dad might have planted it for him to find even, because that guy had a seriously cool father! After seeing that I wanted to have it for real, but it would be ages till I even got close enough into a relationship with a girl to be allowed a few gropes! So no, I would not have cried rape if someone would have offered to bed me back then (if propper BC was in place, I knew about that already because my parents gave me a book about sexuality and puberty etc. at that age and we had sex-ed, too at that age! (Germany! We don't do abstinence classes or such shit, even at private Catholic Schools, like the one I went to!)) and anybody who might have told the police would have only faced my scorn!))

******* You do realize that just a short few hundred years ago (a blink of the eye in history), children marrying as young as 12 and having sex was common place right? You also realize that in some countries and locals, the age of consent differs than in others? Do you grasp that science agrees that the age of sexual awakening (while not exact) is roughly 13 years old and many teens are capable of having sex at that age in a perfectly safe manor? In addition, are you aware that this is FICTION, and just because people read it, does not mean they live their life like it, or agree with it, or any other such sentiment?

You are horribly naive and ignorant.

There are critically acclaimed stories and novels out there that win awards that have graphic child abuse or rape... which are MUCH worse things than consensual sex between minors. Lets remember these are stories, and not reality. Those who read them are not necessarily going to act out what they read in real life whatsoever.

** 18 or older.

I know, some would argue with age of consent, but I'm seriously uncomfortable imagining sex between two people that aren't legal adults in the real world.

I can skip, and therefore ignore, short scenes with sex between character below that age (but older than 15), but straight up smut is out.

In time travel I get a bit antsy. Stuff like "Dodging Prison and *Stealing Witches*", where Harry basically raises his harem up from child-age. That creeps me out so much, the whole story dies for me. At times, when you realize how old he is in that story and then read how he talks about some girl, he sounds like a pedophile sexual predator. Especially that one sentence where he gloats about how nice it will be when he steals the *8 year old* Ginny away from his brother. But I don't want to make this about a rant of this fic...

I really prefer time-travel in which Harry gets together with a (much) older witch. I'm talking Fleur and upwards in age. Exceptions may apply, of course, if the right explanation is given.

In fics where Harry is possessed by someone, it just depends on who it is. And here is where I wanna answer that last question. I have a small start of a fic written on my harddrive where Voldemort gets control over Harry from time to time, and uses that control to get Bellatrix out of prison. The catch: Whenever Voldemort is confronted with emotions from Harry he doesn't understand (Love, Compassion, Friendship, Grief,...) he looses control. Bellatrix so ends up exorcising Voldemort from Harry since she never stops showering him in affection from the moment she is told Voldemort is in Harry. The great break is when Voldemort arises again and Bellatrix refuses to follow him, claiming he is an impostor. Then again, even in this one I only mentioned sex. But that is probably because I am super-shit at Smut. Can't write it to safe my life, let alone give anyone a boner or wet panties. I haven't even gotten to the point where I would think about the age of characters in smut scenes, because I simply don't write 'em.

And edit: Shit like in "The Real Us" I even report. Anything written has once gone through the mind of someone, and from this fic alone I would place the author on some watchlist. Creepy bastard.

**** Well, for a first here, the beauty of culture is that its creation is ever ongoing by the simple propagation of ideas. I propagate mine, you propagate yours and eventually there will be a consensus (or not and a split occurs).

I'm personally of the opinion that a culture is not only able to but should enforce certain taboos (mostly those correlating with their laws/rules and general morals), always walking along the edge between Freedom and Liberty. May it be the culture of a nation, of a region or of a forum. By reporting I propagate my idea that *children* having sex - or in the case of "The Real Us" blatant child-porn erotica, should not be on this website that I dwell on.

The argument you cited is a simple slippery slope fallacy. It's saying that if I report, and subsequently the mods ban something like "The Real Us", it /will/ lead to the censorship of more and more content and topics. Its saying that if I report the mention (and in this special case even glorification) of child-porn, it will lead to the ban of violence, or other topics the quote mentioned. This is simply not so. We are able to say this yes, but this no. We can draw borders between what is alright and what isn't. [[http://cms.boloji.com/articlephotos/Grown%20up%20Harry%20Potter.jpg][Underage sex between teenagers who have a general idea of whats up?]] Reluctant yes. [[http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/17800000/1st-year-harry-potter-17810371-500-208.jpg][Twelve year olds?]] Absolutely not.

In the end the balance will be found by a mix of admin-decisions, reports and endorsements, voted with views and clicks of users. As I said, a culture is the average of its members opinions and the weight and quantity of these opinions. I decided to put my small weight on the side of "No Child Porn". The reason I reported "The Real Us" and not "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" is that while the second is creepy as fuck, the first actually goes all the way and shows us an eleven year old and a twelve year old fucking. That is not okay, and that opinion is final.

Time travel adds an additional layer, like if fifty year old Harry goes back into his fifteen year old body and bangs Hermione, who is still school age physically and mentally, even though they're both /physically/ the same age, mentally they're not and that's also nope territory for me.

Same as if Voldemort/Sirius/Bellatrix/Dobby, etc. was to possess Harry.

** 15 or 16. 15 because I think people definitely start having feelings at that age and a character of that age having feelings for another character that age is realistic.

I find adults having feelings about minors creepy in any context. Minors is 16 and under, as I live in a place where 16 is the legal age and that's the framework I've grown up with. In HP, 17 is also the age of adulthood so I can't find it creepy for anyone to be having thoughts about anyone of that age. After all, Harry's own parents would have married at age 19 or 20 or so, having dated since that age.

EDIT: Is smut sex or is it just feelings? As an adult I'm not comfortable reading about teen characters actually doing the dirty. That was one thing that turned me off the (otherwise interestingly-crafted) Firebird saga - Luna and Ginny did not have to be 13 years old for the storyline still to run and be logically consistent.

That said, I don't really feel the need to read smut nowadays, for whatever reason, so I'd only read it if it was a part of a story with good (or at least decent) plot and those generally tend to have characters at least of that-and-that age. Also, since the “happens organically” part matters to me, sometimes I happen to start reading a story that happens to have smut with two adults and find the participating characters to be immature enough to make me go “there's no way those two ought to be allowed to have sex” and quit. I don't think I've ever read a story with a character below 14 or 15 (not sure which it was, as the author didn't just state ages and I didn't care to see when the character aged up, so to say) doing anything.

That said, I think I did get through some ... well, let's call it “crap”, with presumably younger characters, when I was an early teenager. Though ... well, what I'd been doing at that time certainly didn't count as “reading”,

** This may seem young, especially for American readers, but where I live (Scandinavia) we don't bother with purity or trying to save ourselves for a special occasion. Virginity is a wrapper, not a prize or a collector's item. The UK and the rest of Western Europe is not much different. But this is real life. How realistic do we expect fanfiction to be?

Anyway, 13 is definitely too young, though I know of a girl IRL that started at that age. She has no problems or regrets, but I suspect she was lucky. But no, not in fanfiction.

From 14 and up I'd expect some experimentation and pushing of boundaries. That's what we did when I grew up. Kissing, groping and fumbling. Smutty, but not pornographic. No shagging. It's that awkward age where hormones are trying to overrule the age of consent. And at a mixed-gender boarding school? The windows would be permanently steamed up.

16 and up? Age of consent. We've waited long enough. Shagging. Just pop over to Poppy and get a potion first.

No sex before 18? What are they waiting for? A permission slip from their mother? Unrealistic.

Of course, the magic angle muddles everything. Old soul in a young body? That turns creepy really quickly. The same goes for generation-sized age gaps. In theory, if it was written by a skilled author ... but there are very few of those in fanfiction. So, no. Don't go there.

But real life rarely translates to believable fanfiction. Perfectly normal behaviour in real life can be uncomfortable to read about, especially when it involves heroic knights in shining armour, which Harry basically is. Slightly tarnished armour, but still. Shift the ages up a year or two.

On the other hand, the age when wizards are considered to be adults is surprisingly low. Many apparently married straight out of school, so I'd expect all the age boundaries to be shifted slightly downwards again.

No matter the age or situation, the trick is to not overdo it. The description of the acts shouldn't take longer to read than they took to perform. Dial back the details. We don't need or really want to know which testicle hangs lower. Leave most of the lurid details to the mind of the reader. Subtlety is a very powerful tool. Use it.

Most of the smut seems to be written by inexperienced early teenagers who managed to stumble across internet porn. That's not how it's done in real life.

** Thirty-plus as a general rule. It's not that I find it uncomfortable to read stories with younger protagonists, they just don't interest me. I do like people to have some life experience under their belts if you know what I mean (I expect you can see why I don't find much to suit. Perhaps that's why my geriatric romances fail so resoundingly).

But seriously, if anyone can rec any romance fics where the protagonists are over thirty, I'd be very grateful. I could just read a good little romance tonight.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1323856][DIY Messiah]] has a 40+ Draco and Harry and a really sweet friends to lovers thing.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/324649][The Swaggering Plimpies (or this one time at quidditch camp)]] - after the DH Epilogue, Harry and Draco are friends and both newly divorced. Draco has an idea to start a summer quidditch camp and Harry helps him. This is really well written and the Harry in this is so sweet and really similar to canon Harry (but just as an adult) in his awkwardness with dates.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/639538][Eye of the Beholder]] - a post epilogue 1st person Draco story. It's really well done and reads like a character study of Draco. There's a nice sequel too.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][TURN]] - you've probably already read this but on the off chance you haven't, start here! This fic is incredibly well done.

*** I remember when I was 12 nobody I knew had sex. Maybe as early as 14 is one case I know, everyone else - from ~16 or later. At 12 boys started to tease girls, play kind of naughty games, run after each other and the bold ones kissed. Certainly there were some hormones involved, but not sex. It was kind of taboo still.

**** Sadly im from an area in the US that kind of twisted my perception of it all. I knew what sex was at 9, i walked in on my parents and was explained it all. Im 20 years old and haven't even had my first kiss let alone sex.

But the common belief where im from was much different among my school mates, i knew a few kids who were active at 12, the general consensus among them was that 14 was the latest you should be a virgin, and that if you werent in a relationship you should find a pity fuck to lose your virginity too, i got picked on constantly for my take on saving it until i was in a legitimate relationship.

But as for the OP's question, i generally dont pay attention to characters ages, as long as they are 3rd year or above. usually whenever i think of Harry and the gang i think about their actors appearances in GoF/OoTP, even in first year. So i can read a 3rd year harry smut scene because the ages may actually be 13 but in my head i see a maybe 16 year old Daniel Radcliffe

***** 12 doesn't seem normal to me... To be fair, I lived in Russia from age 10 till 19 (my parents moved for work), where I would say sex is something people don't really talk about that much, and boys and girls are even a bit embarrassed to talk to each other until ~15. But that's probably a bit extreme, and in my opinion it comes from an inequality of genders (I don't know if that is a correct term, my English is still not that good) - in Russia girls are treated as weaker, but also like princesses, guys always (and I mean ALWAYS) have to pay in restaurants for them, be cavalier, really like gentlemen from 19 century. I'm really sad to hear that you got picked on for a mature decision. I hope you don't have some kind of trauma because of that. I know plenty of people who lost their virginity in their twenties. Myself - at 19, and I never felt like it was too late.

****** Iv been trying to reply for an hour and its hard to put my thoughts to word.

I come from the south in the US, i am lucky in that i come from a generally more middle ground area than most of my school mates did. My middle school was made up of 500 students, of which around 300 or so came from the ghetto that is in our city.

Many of the students at my school were pretty good people who didnt get involved with the affairs of others, but just as many would act so horribly that they made up for the good students.

At my middle school we were required to have an armed police officer on campus at all times as a security guard. We had to have them to deal with students who would assault classmates and teachers. In my 3 years at that school i saw my godmother (the cop) have to restrain around 30 kids, for everything from assault, to drug possession and many other issues.

My classmates were people who did what they wanted when they wanted, they would only do things for self gratification, sex alcohol, drugs all of it. and that was in 6th year that that became a big thing. the aggression actually cut down in high school though the drug deals and sex definitely made up most of the illicit activity in the student body. Though it was still bad enough that we still had to have the armed police as guards for the school.

Now there were good students as well, who treated everything more normally but even they were starting to get sexually active by the time we all hit high school (13-14). And generally the students started acting like normal people around this time. But all those things about being a gentleman, ended up getting you looked down upon by anyone not a member of the school staff. None of the students wanted that, and many girls would call you out on it if you tried.

I got by through being a reader, a gamer and a dnd player. I had my friends and hobbies and i didnt interact with people who could pressure me into doing something stupid. I dont think i have any real trauma from it, i mean i have great friends now and they help me through my issues whenever i need them.

Seriously, I was always more prone to influences of people around me, and that resulted in some things I did that I'm a bit embarrassed of. Strength of character (perseverance?) is one of the the best traits in people.

**** Keep in mind that I'm from the deep south, but I remember kids started having sex around 11 in my school. By 13-14, if you were still a virgin, then you were "uncool". It was a smallish school (about 80 people per graduating class) where everyone grew up together since birth pretty much, so maybe that's why.

** What kills me in fics the most is when you have a time travel where 21 year old people take you pic of who they are end up in their one year old bodies and start having sex with each other. I shit you not I have seen this before and you know damn well that the bodies aren't even equipped to preform at that age.

As for students having sex in the first 4 years at Hogwarts. I always mentally age their bodies up and pretend that they where just too stupid to pass their Hogwarts exams like everyone else in their age category.

** I don't really like reading smut most of the time because most people just can't write it well. I only enjoy it if it's done realistically, and most people who write smut/sex write it like something out of porn or an incel fantasy (which I also find odd, since aren't most fanfiction writers female?).

Putting that aside, I'd say 15 is the lowest age, if it's a) done well and realistically, as in awkward first time, embarrassment, learning together and so on. No "sex gods" at 15 please. And b) if both characters are the same age, more or less. Generational gaps shouldn't be a thing at this age. This includes time travel, adults souls etc.

People who write 11-12 year olds as having sex are incredibly creepy (unless it's a story approaches it from the angle of abuse etc) and even if the story itself is great and I really want to know how it goes I will stop reading.

** Keep in mind folks... the age of consent was once 12 in many areas and still is in some in the world. Also keep in mind how old fashioned the wizarding world can be at times.

All that said... 13 is, in my opinion, the "minimum" age. This is because it is technically considered the age of sexual awakening by science. It is perfectly reasonable to expect 13-15 year olds to possibly be sexually active today. Maybe it may seem a bit young, but thats not reality in todays world.

Also keep in mind that this is FAN FICTION. Emphasis on fiction. Lots of people read fiction that has things in it that SOMEONE out there is going to be offended by. Whether its religious, or of a violent nature, or in this case perhaps sexually depicting teens or children.
