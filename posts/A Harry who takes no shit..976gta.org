I'd like to read about a Harry who automatically gets defensive when someone brings up his blood, his parentage, his friends, or his intelligence. A Harry who has no problem punching Draco in the face, or sending a dark curse at Snape when he insults him constantly in potions. A Harry that scares the shit out of most of the student body unless they treat him with respect. Every time I read the series, it makes me sick how much Harry is walked all over. His friends attacked and insulted. I want a fic where Harry is Judge, Jury, and Executioner when it comes to those that want a fight. Crouch should be scared to put Harry's name in the Goblet, because he knows there will be a reckoning. Basically Harry Potter if he wasn't a pushover and more like the Punisher!


** That, or a fanfic in which Harry overdoses on U-No-Poo.

**** Its the way a petulant child responds. Rising up to the bait like that is exactly what instigators /want/. For all his other problems, Snape had one piece of advice that Harry should have taken to heart.

OOTP:

#+begin_quote
  "Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord! ... Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily --- weak people, in other words --- they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter!‚Äù
#+end_quote

What the OP is asking for is not strength. In fact, they are asking for what Harry /actually is in canon/: a reactionary teenager. Remember the scene in OOTP after the quidditch match where he threw himself at Malfoy for insulting his mother once? Or in HBP where Harry, instead of just reveling in blocking Snape in his first lesson and knocking him on his arse, decided to throw in a one-liner that only made it worse?

Thats not strength. Its a sign of how juvenile someone truly is.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Growing up on London's streets and having nobody to rely on has led to a different from canon Harry Potter start his first year at Hogwarts. Add an ancient and mysterious pendant, pureblood pricks, a scheming headmaster and a goddess as his mother-figure in the mix and you have a genuine Alternate Universe. Grey, asshole Harry.

The blurb is slightly misinformative in that he doesn't hate all muggles like you are probably thinking. Also he comes across as very smart and more dark than evil but without any morals about killing people who try to screw him.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years
