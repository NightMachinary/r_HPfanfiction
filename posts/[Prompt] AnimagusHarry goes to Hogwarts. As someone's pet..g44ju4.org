Pretty much title?

So, Harry becomes an Animagus (hello, accidental magic that can do anything the creator wants) and becomes something really mundane. A dog or a cat would be my choice.

Then, through whatever events transpire, Harry ends up "adopted" by a Hogwarts student. I like the idea of the student being Hermione, with him replacing Crookshanks.

Not entirely sure for the rest of the plot (except maybe catching Peter early), but I like the idea of an Animagus fic that does something a bit different.

Maybe his "owner" knows, and teaches him magic (while respecting that he doesn't want people to know about him). Maybe he goes with them to all their classes, watching everything so he can learn.


** it's just a couple of drabbles, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/25/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop]] chapters 25+26 of this. technically also chapter 3, but chapter 25+26 is the expanded version of chapter 3

** Funnily enough, The Accidental Animagus by White Squirrel exactly fits your description. linkffn(9863146)\\
It contains a lot of fandom-specific cliches like wandless magic and lordships and abusive Dursleys and a house-elf minion, but does its best to weave a good story out of all of them.

...But now, aside from that, I'm wondering; would a pet animagus wear a collar in their human form?

*** I've read (at least some of) Accidental Animagus and there's just one small difference between my prompt and it: Harry attends Hogwarts as a human. I want him to attend as an animal.

Good fic though, even if I dropped it for... some reason. Can't remember why, it was well written. Weird.

**** I dropped it for the same reason you did, probably. It became a trope checklist.

Abusive Dursleys - check

Lord Potter - check

wandless magic by "wanting it really hard" - check

the only thing that matters is belief or intent - check

etc etc.

I never really liked those tropes for casting magic, because that would mean an insane person would be a walking reshaper lens that is tearing up the land around them.

***** From memory it does the tropes pretty well, so I don't know if I dropped it for that reason.

I think I just got tired of the storyline that was happening in Chamber of Secrets. Or I moved on to something else and didn't come back.

It just doesn't feel like the tropes were the reason I dropped it.

****** Yeah, I think it switched in my mind with something else.

I think for me it was that the whole entire point of the story had become just another retelling, with the cat form as another unused power in his arsenal.

******* It's not entirely unused, but yes, it does kind of start as a retelling. Actually I think the more fundamental change is that he has a loving and involved family.

However, by the time of the sequel, things have gone off the canon rails. The villains (yes, plural) have been level grinding too.

******* Yeah, that feels about right. Although they /did/ use the cat for spying on Malfoy.

Maybe I should write my own fic like this, just so I can use the animagus effectively. Or invert the problem: he's /only/ good at being an animagus, and passable in everything else.

Can't underutilise the power if the power is the only thing he really has going for him!

***** I got sick of it because of the painful 'overprotective muggle parents kowtow Dumbledore and the ministry with contemptuous ease' trope, but thinking about it i think the point that i dropped it was when Harry and Hermione arbitrarily started referring to each other with entirely different names because they watched star wars

***** White_Squirrel has an uncanny ability to write into the most overused tropes and keep his head together. Even those Lord Potters, muggle-wank (healing of Longbottoms), etc. are kept somehow in the small enough dimensions of the village council, that it doesn't bother me too much.

**** I dropped it because it well it got too out of hand near the goblet of fire. it felt like there was 7 paragraphs about some random person you don't know. harry barely uses his animagus anyway. There was too much to keep track of I guess idk I just know I never finished it.(please don't upvote I don't want useless notifications.)
