  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Sequel to Wastelands! Time has all but run out for Harry Potter. There are no more second chances. No more desperate bids for salvaged redemption. The game has changed, and in the end Harry will learn that the cost of his defiance has never run so high.

** Can anyone chime in RE Heartland's quality?

I remember reading the couple chapter stub years ago after finishing wastelands, and not feeling as into it (even though I loved wastelands). That said it was only the setup that was there at the time -- so tell me whether or not I should get excited to read it :)

** Although still amazing, and I'm glad that it's finally finished, did anyone else think the ending felt a bit rushed? Or is that just me?
