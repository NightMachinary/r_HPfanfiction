What for you is the pinnacle of HP crossovers? For me, the absolute best one I've ever read was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] a HP/Firefly crossover. I can reread it just for fun and enjoy everything. He gets the characterization right, unites the two universes in a believable way and as the next logical step.

What do you like?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince That Was Promised]] is quite good. It's a HP/A Song of Ice and Fire crossover, where Harry is the son of Cersi Lannister and Robert Baratheon. It hasn't been updated in a while, but what's there is pretty compelling.

*** It's been half a year since he updated, but I still hold out hope. The only other HP/aSoIaF crossover that's decent is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9396091/1/A-Secret-of-Spells]], and it too hasn't been updated for half a year :(.

** The Denarian series by shezza is my favorite Dresden crossover. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza]]

My favorite Star Wars crossover: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]]

Wand and Shield is the most well-known Avengers crossover and for good reason. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield]]

This Avengers crossover is short but has a lot of potential imo. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8582660/1/Of-Hel-and-Earth]]

** I second Brown Coat, Green Eyes.

I meant to ask this very same question this morning, but what I'd love to hear about are people's favourite crossovers where the other series /isn't/ that popular. Something unique but awesome where someone's melded their favourite little-known book/movie/cartoon with HP and done it right.

** Bobmin's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth][The Queen who fell to Earth]] and its sequels are excellent x-over's with the Dragonriders of Pern.

Even without reading anything of the Dragonriders series, it is one of my favorite fics of all time.

** I had a huge like 15+ list but then reddit fucked itself so here's the shitty version:

Darth Marrs' Star Trek and Star Wars XOs\\
Natural 20 being the most obvious along with Browncoat\\
Hermione's song\\
some deadpool xo I happened upon ages ago but can't find now\\
The elder sect and a bunch of Clell's other stuff\\
KB0's recent Start Trek xo\\
Some of Dunuelos' LT stories are XOs

and that's about it. I'm too fucking annoyed at reddit to bother filling out the rest of the list.
