** Not a fanfiction-related answer but this question is answered over in the FAQs in [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]] with a quote from JKR and some additional comments:

“Why didn't Fred and George notice Peter Pettigrew with Ron?

JKR said:

'It would not have mattered if they had. Unless somebody was very familiar with the story of Sirius Black (and after all, Sirius was not Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's best friend -- indeed, they never knew him until after he escaped from Azkaban), Fred and George would be unlikely to know or remember that Peter Pettigrew was the person Sirius had (supposedly) murdered. Even if Fred and George HAD heard the story at some point, why would they assume that the 'Peter Pettigrew' they occasionally saw moving around the map was, in fact, the man murdered years before? Fred and George used the map for their own mischief-making, so they concentrated, naturally enough, on those portions of the map where they were planning their next misdeeds. And finally, you must not forget that hundreds of little dots are moving around this map at any given time... Fred and George did not know everyone in school by name, so a single unfamiliar name was unlikely to stand out.'

Fred and George primarily used the map as an actual map. This is why they elected to give it to Harry when they still had two more years of school, and why George tells Harry that he and Fred know it by heart” and “don't really need it anymore.” The twins used the map as a navigational tool. As long as they weren't out after hours and trying to avoid detection, they weren't paying attention to any of the other dots on the map.

It's also important to remember that Hogwarts has eight floors plus towers and dungeons. Any map of the castle would be immensely complex, and it's unreasonable to expect the characters to retain all or most of that information. When looking for a person or place on the map, Harry or the twins would instinctively filter out all information that wasn't the person or place they were looking for.”

Would be interesting to see some different takes from a fanfiction POV though

*** That is a terrible excuse.

First of all, the Hogwarts years aren't so big that they wouldn't have ever heard of or at least seen this Peter Pettigrew fellow. Just that alone would be suspiscious enough.

Second, this Peter Pettigrew is with his brother and harry everyday in their room. This would come up, considering that the number of roomates are limited and they know who Ron and Harry room with.

It just makes no sense for it to never come up at all in 3 years.

** My head Canon is they just never looked for Ron, he's their annoying hanger on of a little brother and outside of running into them while they are mid prank set up they have little reason to watch for him. Also when your out selling sweets and pranks to other students in the dead of night your not looking at your little brothers dorm room

*** That would be nice, but Harry sees his name on the map and then runs right over the top of him and into Snape. It's likely they thought the map had an error and so ignored it.

**** Presumably all the Marauders knew of the charm and he reversed it? Probably when he was broke down and decided to bring Sirius in, only to see Pettigrew on the map as well and piece it together

**** I haven't seen it in a story, but there was a theory floating about reddit a while back that the map only revealed someone in their animagus form if the one who activated the map knew about the animagus form in the first place. So Lupin would have seen Peter and Sirius, but Harry, Fred, and George, would not have.

** I would assume it was because they didn't know who peter pettigrew was. Also they used the map more for making sure they weren't gonna get caught by teachers, a random student named peter pettigrew probably wouldn't catch their eye...but who knows. As for a story, I have no idea.

** When was a time they slaved over the map to find a specific dot?

Probably only in the second book to look for Ginny, other times they don't really care, now why didn't Peter try to get the mapout of th way is a much bigger question to me, especially once Remus showed up in school. I mean did Peter seriously didn't have an idea the twins could have it? Steal it in the holidays or something

*** I doubt Peter had any idea the twins had it. Until the third book, Scabbers was living a pretty normal relaxing rat life. He didn't do much but live in their dormitory (seriously there's like no mention of Scabbers after we meet him in PS until PoA). And there's no way the twins would've mentioned the map with Ron around at home. They might've left it in their trunks over the summer.

** I've read that the names were close together/overlapping in the common rooms & dorms because of everyone living in close quarters (especially in a tower where dorms are literally one above another), and that there was another kid with the surname Pettigrew in Gryffindor. It seemed plausible to me.
