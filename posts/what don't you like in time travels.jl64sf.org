currently my favorite genre and actually thinking of writing one soon, so what is it you hate in time travel fics? I personally hate it when:

- it's a fic that doesn't change the past/future. I just think that is the point in time travel fics and that's why I like them, that the characters are going to fix stuff.

- the fic is an exact copy of canon. especially if nothing really changes even though the character does make changes. in this case, I would rather just read the canon, since it's the same. this is pretty common with Draco time traveling fics. where it's all the same, except Draco is present too.

- the traveler tells Dumbledore, or someone else, right at the start. (it would be the sensible thing to do, I just don't like it)

- the traveler is absolutely incapable to blotch en exam or two, and generally being absolutely terrible at pretending not to be from the future, while trying to appear so. would it really be so hard to not write all essays Outstanding? it's not like everyone remembers stuff they were taught in school when 11. and anyway, how hard could it be to fool 11yo classmates. esp. if it's someone like Snape. he was a spy, lied to Voldemort and yet he can't act?

- they don't save someone they know is going to die and have the power to do so. like Regulus. Or Cedric. this also fits to the fics that don't change the future, but it's extremely frustrating if it's a fic where the character does change stuff, they just decide to not safe someone's life. I straight up tossed a fic where Harry didn't save Regulus. he even had a monologue about it: ah, about this time Regulus is dying. ah well... ugh (I am completely ok if someone else dies with the travelers actions, or if they don't save someone because it can't be fixed)

- smut with children. aaah, the infamous tongue and cheek fic. because an 11yo boy is just so sexy while eating that popsicle. sure.

- fics that are too easy on the character. so we know about the horcruxes, they find all of them in one week, goblins help with the cup of course, Voldy is killed. everyone is happy. I mean, we need /some/ plot.

.... and yet it's my favorite genre, what can I say.

** Things I like:

Harry doesn't shy from showing his skill. He does his own thing to save the world without telling anyone. He doesn't involve himself in romance and doesn't spend time touting his superiority to his teachers like you see in bashing fics.

To the teacher's perspective, he's a power boy with difficulties fitting in. To his friends he's talented if a bit secretive and quiet.

I don't like it as much but it can be enjoyable when he work with either Dumbledore or Snape. I also like it when there's psychological issues that Harry's going through. Maybe he realizes that his past/future friends are gone. Maybe he's still stress from the future war, etc.

What I don't like:

1) Telling everyone about time traveling

2) Despite being older, acting like a brat (unless there's an actual reason for it)

3) So afraid of changing the future that they do nothing

4) Forgetting key part of the plot: "Oh shit Ginny is currently being possessed, almost forgot about that!"

5) Instantly fixing people: remove Draco's bigotry with a five minute conversation or making Neville more confidant in minutes, etc.

** Time traveller in a younger body hooks up with the younger counterpart of their lover? Partner? Spouse?

Manipulating their friends younger counterparts to be the “best version” of themselves rather then letting them grow especially when the mc then accuses Dumbledore of doing the same thing. The hypocrisy ruins the story for me

Doing things the same way the second time around simply because they assume there is no danger

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** My favourite time travel fics are ones that don't take place in the Canon time. I like it more when they take place either during the first war, or during the Grindelwald war. Or, even sometime in between. I think Canon has been rehashed so many times, nothing is really interesting anymore. I don't really care whether or not they change the future; I actually prefer they don't, but I'll read either types. The important part for me is the plot. There has to be real conflict. Not just OP Harry beats everyone.

** I think I agree with a lot of these. I do think that a time travel fic should start with a strong premise, because there are so many. Like the Don't Fear The Reaper challenge was interesting but there are now so many fics with that premise, that I think you need to know that your question or concept is interesting enough to carry a fic.

I like it best when they explore relatively unknown characters, or a different face of the war than they did in their first life, maybe something that they didn't understand about magic or a person or some part of the magical world they never knew before, or the whole other dimension thing where things are slightly different, so they don't necessarily know what might be different than the world they know

That's actually something that you can make without doing much to canon, though it's pretty difficult. IMO "What's her name in Hufflepuff" does it really well (though it's techincally an SI and not a timetravel fic) - just make some fun things happen while having some sort of a longer plot thing going on.

** Main thing I hate is canonrehash. seen time travel stories where like 90% is just copy&paste from canon with literally ZERO real changes.

Another thing I dislike about majority of time travel is that they don't explore the potential negative consequences.

Another thing that springs to mind - stories that deal with Founders time. One thousand years ago. Time before modern sanitation, understanding of germs/bacteria, time when average life expectancy was around 20/30 years, time when English would have sounded quite a bit different, to the point that modern speaker would have real trouble understanding it. Yet never deal with the issue that there are no toilets, showers, or that food and water would be absolutely disgusting by modern sanitary standards. Very likely cause time travellers to get quite sick in fact, not to mention manner of dress, culture, what was and wasn't appropriate...

There are likely diseases around that modern human would have no immunity for, or there would be no cure for. Almost never take into account 1000 years of magical progress and almost invariably show how much wiser and more powerful the Founders were than modern witches and wizards.

** I don't like ones that are more dimension-hopping than time-travel. As in the logic of how time travel works is that they go back in time and split from the original time-line. Mostly because it defeats the purpose? Like, if you split from the original, the original still exists and continues in the original way anyway. So you aren't really saving your timeline, but playing hero in newly created one.

(I hope that made sense). Additionally it needs a consistent, fully-structured timeline rules as a basis
