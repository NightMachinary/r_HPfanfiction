What are your favorite, most anticipated HP stories that you check your alerts or mail for? I'm asking because I want to know about generally good recent fanfics that get updated regularly (weekly to at least once a month) which deserve to be read.

The story I personally look forward to is: Gorgoneion By: Asuraa linkffn(11860415) And a crossover: Sky Rose By: silencia20 linkffn(12018948)

Also which stories you just NEED! to be updated like RIGHT NOW!, but unfortunately take a while (TOO LONG DAMMIT!) to get written. (This should include stories that haven't been updated for a while (MONTHS! @_@ ... T_T ... x_X), but aren't abandoned or left to gather dust for more than half a year or so.)

A 'vanilla' HP world story would be: The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited By: michaelsuave linkffn(9708318) My top crossover would be: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For By: kathryn518 linkffn(11157943)

I hope this Request/Discussion (how do you even set that?) results in finding some very good stories of authors that deserve some acknowledgement for their work. Also it's a good way to find stories that you pic up and can't stop reading and want more, because they are that good!


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

I take it as an article of faith that it's going to be updated.

  Sequel to "Weasley Girl"! Potter's Gang are back for their second year at Hogwarts, and face a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light. It looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** Well, first off is Taure's new fic linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forgotten Labyrinth). Sure, it's only one chapter so far, but it is already better than every single other [[/spoiler][Sirius takes Harry away from the Dursleys]] fic in existence, and I am greatly looking forward to learning what the Forgotten Labyrinth is.

Next up we have what I've recently decided is my FAVORITE "full" AU in Ihateseatbelts' linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome). A fic with a larger wizarding world, muggleborns fostered into wizarding families because their parents give them up, a Grindelwald who runs a large portion of the world, and dueling is a more major sport than Quidditch. Also wandsong is goddamn brilliant.

Then is my favorite crossover in Zenzao's linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra). A Bill Weasley centered Harry Potter/The Mummy (1999 movie) fusion that takes place post-DH and post-Bill/Fleur divorce. Only four chapters at the moment, with incredibly slow updates, but those four chapters are pure gold. Gold I tell you.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) which I'm not going to say much of here because it has gotten plenty of discussion on this subreddit in the past.

For what is easily the best HP/Elder Scrolls crossover in linkffn(Knowledge Comes at a Price by slayst). So far it is only three chapters, but still better than all other HP/Elder Scrolls crossovers, though a few of the decisions the author made I don't really like.

My second favorite crossover, and the most favorited LoTR crossover: linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger).

And finally is a Ron-centric time travel story that came out not too long ago: linkffn(The Red Knight by Demon Eyes Laharl). Though I wish it wasn't first person, and I wish magical cores weren't a thing (though they are /barely/ a thing, on the good side), it features a through-DH canon Ron who went from Auror to Unspeakable who somehow gets reborn as his younger self (during his birth) but with imperfect memories, and in a world that is slightly... off in how his mother acts, and in the Potter-Who-Lived, [[/spoiler][Violet Potter]].

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** 'Tony Samuels' has recently become one of my favorite authors on ff.net. He's a good writer and i really like his ideas. He seems to be branching out a little more but my favorite story is still linkffn(12080292) because it combines some of my favorite OOC!Harry's into one story by utilizing a unique idea.

I really hope it gets an update soon, it would be a shame if it ended up abandoned because the author started too many projects at once.

** Enjoy and updated somewhat regularly:

HP and the Prince of Slytherin - I find a competent protagonist to be extremely gratifying, especially when the author levels up their antagonists to provide an appropriately difficult challenge. This author does a pretty good job of this. linkffn(11191235)

Lady Archimedes - The previous recommendation was for a competent Harry, this one is for a very competent Hermione. It is the sequel (starting 5th year) to The Arithmancer, which covers years 1-4 and is a delight to read. linkffn(11463030)

A Long Journey Home - Quite simply, this is my favorite HP fanfiction of all time. It was last updated in April 2016. Each chapter is so well put together, that I wouldn't be surprised if the author of this has had original fiction published. linkffn(9860311)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) - massive AU, unique style. Updates are kinda slow, but no more than those for my own WIP.

Linkffn(Circular Reasoning) was updated recently. Updates are /very/ infrequent, but it's not abandoned.

Linkffn(What You Leave Behind) was going very strong in its first year, but has stalled. AFAIK it's not abandoned, so I'll read when it updates, but I'm not checking it anymore.

  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.

The Futile Facade is the 4th in a series, which typically gets updated on average about once a month, but the author was on a 3 month vacation somewhere without internet or something, which is why it hasn't been updated in a while. But they are back now, so I am hopeful that when it resumes it will be back to the once a month or so schedule.

I also really like silencia20's hp/naruto crossover linkffn(Chasing-Shadows) but it hasn't been updating very frequently recently. Possibly partly because of the story you mentioned in the OP :(.

But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

"Malfoy" She said, hoping reasoning with him might help. He had a bruise forming on his jaw from where Ron had hit him, and his eye was beginning to blacken. "Why would you protect him?" Malfoy hissed at her, stalking closer, no longer throwing curses now that she was disarmed. Hermione/Draco naughtiness within.

  When Hermione Granger is caught by Snape she must fake her death with Snape's help, and assume a new identity and appearance as the illegitimate and previously unbeknownst daughter of Severus Snape. Going by the name Mina Graziana-Snape, Hermione must navigate this new world where she's rubbing shoulders with Death Eaters, forced to participate in revels, marked as a Death Eater herself and doing her best to balance the dark and light warring for dominance inside her soul. Isolated from the Order and her friends, Hermione must play the wickedly sinful and alluringly promiscuous daughter of a Death Eater just to survive. With Snape as her mentor and the only one who knows every dark truth about her and the girl she's becoming, Hermione must protect her heart on all sides. A scheming Rabastan LeStrange wants her for a wife. A werewolf Draco Malfoy is a tentative ally and possessive bedfellow. A murderous Bellatrix LeStrange seeks to end the lives of both Hermione and Severus. Fenrir Greyback is trying to overthrow the wizarding world under the Dark Lord's nose. Furious friends are baffled by how well she can play the bad girl and Hermione's stuck in the middle, trying to keep her head above water.

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

** For me, the one fic that I anticipate more than any other is The Legacy linkffn(9774121). Updates had started at weekly in the beginning and by June when it was last update they had been getting out once every month or month and a half. I started reading it when I was interested in Harry/Daphne and it's the only one I still read (and probably the reason most of the others don't appeal to me anymore). It's also the only fic I've read that included a marriage contract and actually used it in an interesting way. But the fic is 81 chapters and 750000 words in so I think there is still enough interesting stuff in there even if the writer never ends up coming back, though 5 months is not long enough to give up hope yet anyway.

** Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw by LeadVonE) which has suddenly gotten more interesting.

Linkffn(Whispers in the Night by Jean11089) which is getting a bit dull.

Linkffn(Lesser Evils by Scott Press) which has got a whole mystery angle going that isn't quite as interesting as the author thinks it is IIRC.

Linkffn(For Love of Magic by Noodlehammer) which is one of the main reasons I check my fanfic account for updates.

Linkffn(Harry the Playboy by Elven Sorcerer) which is a fairly fun sort of Smut/Crack fic.

Linkffn(Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly by tkepner) a timetravel fic that has some seriously funny moments in amongst its genuinely creative and interesting plot.

Linkffn(Muggle-Raised Champion by Stargon1) which is fun.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse by HunterBerserkerWolf) which is much better thought out than the premise would lead you to believe.

Linkffn(The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie) which is by James Spookie.

Linkffn(A Scattered War by TheUnrealInsomniac) which is a sequel to Linkffn(The Reluctant Champion) which you should also read.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) is awesome but you have to stick with it.

Linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) is one of the best fics out there IMHO but the newer chapters are flying dangerously close to the wind.

Linkffn(The Futile Facade by murkybluematter) which is the fourth in the Pureblood Pretense series which is so good that if it goes the way I think it is going to [[/spoiler][will probably be the only slash series that I actively follow]].

And so concludes an abbreviated version of the list of how I spend my lunch breaks.

Edit: I also agree with [[/u/InquisitorCOC]] on his Iist of fics that'II probably never be completed but we follow anyway.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway.

Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
