Hear me out, but i recently read one called, Harry potter is a Jerk. I'd like another story like that COMPLETED AND OVER 100K WORDS. Where No matter how many times Harry insults someone, they ignore him due to some magic. They just cant hear him. when they are insulted by him.


** Not exactly what you're looking for... but harry is and arsehole in Harry potter and the daft morons

** I've read (the first few chapters of) a few Indy!Harry fics where the author seems to believe that writing Harry as an enormous twat makes him “cool”. But I doubt that's what you're looking for.

In linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) I found Harry to be an apathetic asshole, though it's well written enough that I finished it. Haven't picked up the sequel yet though.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files
