Just a little idea I found funny. Tell me what you think.

​

​

So much Mary Sues have appeared throughout the part of the multiverse which contains fictionnal Universes lately that the whole Multiverse is on the verge of collapsing under the weight.

​

Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, Vanquisher of Voldemort and Fate's Bitch is chosen to deal with the problem. He and his team will travel to each Universe in turn fighting this danger through every means possible.

​

Crossovers with Monday Next series, Oh My Godess or other similar things to flesh out the background are welcome.

Harry can travel both to fanfictions or to regular fictions.

Remember that Mary Sues are reality warpers (the laws of their home universe bend to favor them).

​

Edit: I botched the title. I can't modify it. Appologies.


** What was the proper title supposed to be? Neat idea, anyway.

*** Forgot to remove the comma and the word taking when I decided to change the title.

** Oh man I wish I could remember the author who used to post about this. She wrote a bunch of Mary Sues imploding while trying to meet Harry Potter, but it was on LJ in like, 2004.

*** Not exactly the same idea, but if you happen to remember the title I'm interested in reading it.
