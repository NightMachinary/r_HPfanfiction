Hey guys, can I get some recs for fics where Harry discovers his parseltongue early and has a gift with magic cast using the language. Bonus points for snake familar etc. I would prefer that if it's not complete, then at least has a good update history i.e. Updated within a year


** I would cautiously recommend [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/]["Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond" by keiramarcos.]] Warning though, as the title says it's a soul-bond story and it has lots of Weasly (Ron/Ginny) bashing. Also it's a bit heavy handed in the social-justice author-tract department... *but* the lore is IMHO fantastic. Harry is the leader of a Parselmagic Coven and the story has lots of amazing worldbuilding with ritual magic and snakes. It's very AU and kind of a shame that it's so heavy on the tropes... you'll probably either hate it or love it, but it has all the checkboxes of what you're asking for.

** linkffn(6413108)

This one is complete, but it is both: a. A time-travel fic (Snape travels back in time) b. A pretty super-powered Harry fic

So, if you don't like either of those, may not be a great choice for you. But, parselmagic is a huge part of the story & there is a snake familiar.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

** I would also cautiously recommend linka03(A Year Like None Other) because while this one is finished and so is the sequel linka03(A Summer Like None Other) I am still eagerly waiting for the third and final part despite not having news for the last 4 years.

However it's a Severitus with brother!Draco. Very well done, but if it's not your thing...
