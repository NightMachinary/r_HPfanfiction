I'm looking for a decent length fic (preferable 100k+) which involves Harry in a relationship with someone that isn't Ginny, Hermione, Luna or Daphne.

There's nothing wrong with those pairings, I've just read a lot of them recently and am looking for something different.

Thanks!


** Well you can read a Harry/Pansy story We're in This Together by zugrian that starts shortly after the Chamber of Secrets. Now I typically access it via hpfanficarchive but the author has an fanfiction.net account.

linkffn(12900811)

And you can also try a Harry/Fleur story Harry Potter and the Silver Vixen by patton44.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
