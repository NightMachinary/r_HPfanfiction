Hi, This is The Kop-Who-Scoused. I write on our family collective account: Harmonious Cannons, (*which was started by our late cousin)* on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]. I currently have a political Harry story, where neither Dumbledore nor the Weasleys are bashed and Harry is a Gryffindor. So, if it interests you enough, please do read, review, criticise and so on:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12244768/1/The-Great-Manipulator]]

There is also a sixth-year story, which comprises of Harmony without any bashing, again, though Harry does veer away from what passes for Canon. Leader:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12789594/1/Leader]]

I also have continued one another older story, Prophetic Intervention: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11878952/1/Prophetic-Intervention]]

which is complete

I suppose that is enough self-promotion for now :)

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

**** No problem. I was invoking a bot to turn your links into more detailed descriptions. Just being helpful - not a criticism in the least.

  Harry strays into the library's newspaper archives. The Hat wanted to put Harry into Slytherin. Harry was not just not stupid, he also was fairly clever if he wanted to be. Well, the Ministry needed a new player for quite sometime now. Not a bashing story. Part one - Sirius' freedom is complete. Irregular but not infrequent updates.

  The mother in Molly reaches out to a grieving child. Harry starts worrying about Dumbledore once he sees the hand, and decides that they need a contingency plan. Over a bowl of too hot onion soup, the course of the war is changed. Voldemort is faced with an actual adversary in the form of the Order of the Phoenix. Mentors Bill, Moody, and Fleur.

  Two more people heard the prophecy...entirely. They took it upon themselves to change the course of the war, as they saw fit. This is what happens when the True Marauders, including Lily, Frank and Alice, and their friends from the Order, and three wise guides, the main characters, avert the prophecy. Good Dumbledore (somewhat); horrible Snape. COMPLETE. DONE. FERTIG.
