**** Well in the fic he was raised by a pair of fairies. And some (debunked) research says that people who are raised by "those people" are more likely to also turn out "that way". I mean isn't that why they want to adopt in the real world? Isn't that part of their "agenda"?

***** Thanks for making me laugh :D - as if most gay people have an agenda! They just want to be left alone to do as they please without others harassing or abusing them!
