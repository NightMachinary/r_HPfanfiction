I am trying to figure out what happened to Harry after his parents were killed.

- #+begin_example
         Potters are murdered.  Late enough to be dark, early enough that the family is still awake. (Before Midnight on 31 October)
  #+end_example

- #+begin_example
         Peter arrives, retrieves his master’s wand, leaves (?)
  #+end_example

- #+begin_example
         Snape arrives, mourns Lily, leaves
  #+end_example

- #+begin_example
         Hagrid arrives, gets Harry
  #+end_example

- #+begin_example
         Sirius arrives, Hagrid refuses to turn Harry over, Sirius gives Hagrid his motorcycle then leaves in pursuit of Peter
  #+end_example

- #+begin_example
         Hagrid leaves as Muggle authorities arrive.  MoM presumably arrives soon after
  #+end_example

- #+begin_example
         Word get out somehow that Voldemort is dead, people spend the day celebrating enough that the Muggles, including Vernon Dursley,  notice. (Harry and Hagrid’s location unknown)
  #+end_example

- #+begin_example
         Hagrid meets Dumbledore at Dursley's late enough that everyone has gone to sleep (at least 10pm)
  #+end_example

Where were Hagrid and Harry for that missing time? At least 20 hours. It couldn't all be travel time.

*/On an unrelated note Hogwarts letters do not arrive on the students 11th birthday. It's just a coincidence that Hagrid finally caught up with Harry on his birthday!!! Sorry, this has been mentioned in the last three fics I've read and it's starting to annoy me,/*


** I always presumed harry was being checked over by pomfrey in an undisclosed locale

** It isn't a plot hole, also Snape wasn't at Godrics Hallow, and Peter being there is only conjecture.

Voldemort shows up -> Booom -> Hagrid shows up -> McGonagall finds out from Hagrid where Harry is going -> McGonagall goes there -> Hagrid takes Harry to Private Drive.

So we don't know where Harry was, but we can conclude that Dumbledore checked Harry out during this time to make sure he was okay, and determined where he was going next. Since Hagrid knew to tell McGonagall.

*** Except when Hagrid arrives at the Dursley's Dumbledore asks Hagrid “No problems, were there?' ‘No, sir - house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.”

*** I agree Peter being there is just a guess. That's why I put the (?). Though to me it is the only thing that makes sense.

You are right about Snape though. I just checked the book. I could have sworn there was a scene of him weeping over Lily's body. I guess that's just in the movie.

  Where were Hagrid and Harry for that missing time?
#+end_quote

Hagrid is taking Harry from pub to pub, announcing what happened, for twenty hours, in order to promote Harry's brand. Which also explains why Dumbledore didn't use phoenix fire or Apparate with Harry.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The Dursleys had a young child, so 8:30pm is probably the earliest plausible time, if we're only talking about them being asleep and not the neighbors. (It would have been dark by 5pm, so that's not a significant constraint.)

I like the thought that Harry had his first bar crawl at a little over 1 year old.

*** “In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.

Apparently it was close to midnight.
