There is a basilisk in the Great Hall. There is nothing to fear.


** I really love this series. You do a great job of highlighting how Gryffindor changed Tom without overwriting who he is. In a lot of ways he feels more terrifying than Canon Voldemort, because he's willing to take risks Canon Tom won't. He's just a lot of fun to read.

Dumbledore was great as well. Feels very true to Canon for me, which is very refreshing considering how he's usually written these days. That Dumbledore has a plan even in such an unexpected circumstance and untimely death is great.

*** Thank you! I've been especially worried about writing Dumbledore well.
