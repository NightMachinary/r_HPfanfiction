Hello, I am sucker for Snape and Harry's messed up relationship (or rather, lack thereof) and I'm looking for fics which take place following Harry's defeat of Voldemort, include a living Snape and focus on his reconciliation with Harry. I'd prefer a dark and bitter Snape and for there to be a rocky road to them finally coming to grudgingly see eye to eye. Is there any such fic at all?


** There are many slash fics like this, if you don't mind that.

  In a world where winning the war was only half the battle, will Harry Potter's crazy heroics be enough to save an outcast?

** linkffn(3389525) is fairly angst ridden. But it's interesting in that rather then having Harry draw Snape out of his ten year brooding session, Harry is the one who finds himself more and more inline with Snape. I didn't finish it, it's not really my style of story but I still thirty something chapters because it was so well crafted.

It is also complete.

  AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE
