For me it has to be the (overpowered) Lord!Potter fics in which Harry claims a Lordship title.

I was really into that when I first started to read fanfic but overtime my focus shifted and these days I rarely find a fic like this, which doesn't make me cringe. Of course, there are exceptions, but the majority of them, I just can't read. (It might also not help that I mostly read slash and gen so I don't have a good grasp on what this trope is like in het!fics) I think the trope has so much potential, especially if one were to go down the political route.

A few other personal examples for this are creature!inheritance fics and creature!fics in general

Have you made similar experiences?

*** Hell yeah, I would read that. You could also use the Grindelwald & Dumbledore relationship super well in various ways to write the evil!Dumbledore character.

*** Yes! Completely agree!

Complex, thought provoking stories are just so much more fun. There should be the good, the bad and the ones caught in the middle who are neither. With how small and connected the Wizading World is, there is just so much potential for conflicting loyalties between friends and family.

In the books we get the Black family with the hardcore blood purists and Sirius and Andromeda who are different. There should also be more attention given to those who value blood purity but aren't Death Eaters.

Also, having sly, manipulative Dumbledore successfully gain the trust and admiration of the main characters that when they do figure out the truth about him later, it is more impactful.

** “Dominated by bad fics” is a bit unfair for this trope, but I do wish time travel was less rote. I read a lot of stuff that is set pre-canon, and that often entails one of the 90s era characters going back in time, and there's many story beats that stay the same across fic in this genre. I suppose it comes down to the “stations of canon” issue, given that we know so little about the past that the setting might become unrecognizable if a plot diverges too much from canon-timeline events, but... that's what I want. I would love more time travel that radically alters the timeline or goes off and explores a completely different story than the set of events that we know led to the wizarding wars.

*** Yeah, personally I'm a huge fan of time travel and I know what you mean. Though I know a few fics - while not totally changing the timeline - do deal with different topics or are very interesting characterwise. Though I guess you've read most of them if you read slash But here are a few recs if you are interested

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21527806]]) This one is a gen fic called Princeps by Lomonaaeren. The summary should give you a good overview, sequels are also finished. Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521]]) Step back in time. This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in the marauders era, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966]]) Don't know if you know this fic, it's called "The Second String" Harry ends up in the past. He pretends to be a Squib and ends up working in the Hog's Head. Pairing is Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. It's a brilliant fic with plot that wildly differs from general time travel fics that end up in the Marauders era! Highly rec

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Also not Harry in the Marauders era, Snarry fic, features Harry as a Professor When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488]]) while not exactly a time travel fic (dimension travel) it's one of my favorites. It's called World in Pieces. It's a gen fic. Basically right after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry is summoned into a different Dimension by the Order because their Harry is dead and they need someone to defeat Voldemort. It's very good, intriguing plot, powerful!AUVoldemort. Highly rec

Tomarry fic. Very interesting. Harry gets trapped in a memory inside Dumbledores pensieve. He changes timelines. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/995179]])

Harrymort fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magicand Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting. Mostly Tom Riddle pov. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

For instance in Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia I really like the way the Americans look at integration and keeping the statute. The way Harry treats wards is also interest inv and fun. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/]])

Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches has a lot wrong with it, but the way the Grangers are used isn't one of them (up to the part where I bailed anyway). They're very enthusiastic scientists, and pretty keen to use things like Muggle industrial etching on a micro level to help with magical problems (such as fitting tunes on small objects, or a lot of runes onto any object).

There's also one I've been trying to find to read again where Luna gets involved with nanotechnology, and another where squibs sort of become a weird hive mind collective thing through thinking about things from a Muggle perspective? Or something?

There's a major lack of original male characters, not just in Harry Potter, but in essentially every /single/ fandom; I can't tell you how difficult it is to find an interesting/well-written original male character in something like Batman and Supernatural.

I mean, I could read and enjoy an original female character, but they're all more or less the same, and they're almost always the sister of Harry. Typically, they're in Gryffindor or, sometimes, Slytherin. Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw aren't usually an option.

What about other characters having a sibling? Why does it /always/ have to be Harry? Why not give Ron another sibling or two? Hermione? Or, hell, I'd even take a sibling of Crabbe, Goyle, Nott, literally anyone. There are other characters to choose from!

It drives me up the wall.

**** Fic idea: harry got turned into a werewolf halfway through his hogwarts schooling. He was told that to overcome his instincts and not submit to the enemy wolves, he had to become an alpha wolf. The one to talk to him meant for him to become strong and fierce.

Harry didn't know what an alpha wolf was supposed to mean, so he asked Hermione. She told him that the so called alpha wolves were just regular wolves defending their pups.

Cue Harry Potter becoming stronger and more in control than expected by "adopting" the firsties at hogwarts. All of them. The first years are pretty okay with this, even if they don't really understand what the hell is going on.

** I like Slytherin-centric fics that have social politics. Just, it has to be logical... 11 year olds scheming and behaving like full grown adults are a little overdone. Having them be that way later on, at 16 or something is alright for me. Earlier years should show them being somewhat childish/dependant on their parents' opinions and advise or something before growing up.

By 14-15 having them be more mature seems fair to me. I think if teens are treated like adults early on and are groomed to be that way from a young age, they tend to mature faster. (At that age in the olden times people are usually married, aren't they?) But 11 is pushing it for me.

Also, I do love dubiously good Slytherin stories. Where they help the 'good' side for their own sake.

Good Slytherin fics are fun if done right. So are bashing fics. Completely flipping the good and bad side feels a little like cheating IMO. How can everyone supposedly good be bad and manipulative? Everyone???

And if they are so manipulative and sly, how are they somehow beaten by literal teenagers?

There is also a distinct lack of adult figures being involved in those fics. It feels more reasonable to have adults heavily involved with anything dangerous.

Horcrux hunting, experimenting with dangerous forbidden magic etc.

This is just my opinion. There are many good fics around like this, I just wish there were more...

** There are plenty:

- Tom Riddle fics - they are all repetitive fics that portray Tom as this tyrant who controls a bunch of canon names with an iron fist and they all cower in his presence. Quite frankly I think Tom Riddle had to be more careful about this because I don't think the purebloods would accept an orphan of dubious origins as their leader if he started bullying them from day one. I like to think that he built a reputation by helping his mates with schoolwork and acted as an advisor to the gang of blood supremacists when they wanted to play a prank on muggleborns but he himself stayed out of it.

- Indy!Harry - I would like to read a Harry that is less dependent on the adults around him (like he is in the first three books) and not a whiny bitch that hates the entire world except for his grilfriend(s)/boyfriend.

- Fleur Delacour fics - it's a shame JK (who claims she's a feminist) didn't use her more. She is a proof that women can be both powerful and feminine at the same time. She eventually faded into the background as an eye-candy for the guys and someone to hate for the women. Unfortunately in most fics she is central character she's basically just a sex toy for Harry or whoever the male lead is.

- Dark!Harry - most of the fics portray Harry as either being dark from the start or making 180 degrees turn after interacting with someone. Most of the times he is also a shittier version of Voldemort. I would like to see a Harry that gradually descends into darkness and he does it for his own reasons not because he had an enlightening chat with Voldemort or whoever.

Because Dark! Harry is often just a pale copy of Tom Riddle (or what the author think Tom Riddle was) and Tom Riddle was Dark and lived in an orphanage. Though these fics tend to ignore the fact that Tom Riddle was a sociopath who had a pretty big chance to turn Dark no matter where he went.

*** I love dark Harry AU stories as well, but they're usually so filled with bashing and flanderization it takes me out. My best guess for the orphanage is because the authors want to form an even stronger bond with Riddle than there already is.

** Sirius raising Harry has so much potential and nearly every fic just devolves into sickening amounts of fluff (which if thats your thing then fair, i like fluff sometimes too, just in smaller doses) and seemingly inevitably all of them go for the 'lordships blah blah Lord of House Black' when really what I want to read is a Sirius that raised Harry on Rage Against the Machine and angry rants about aristocrats (give me ancom sirius please it would be so good)

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.

** Wizards fully separating from Muggles or the destruction of Muggles. So far the best I read on that line is "Be Careful What you Wish for" and its sequel "Rise of the Wizards".

More pureblood culture fics (along the lines of Conspiracy by Maethoriel Raina).

Harry goes to a different school, but without the excessive dumbing down of Hogwarts.

I agree with those who said "Dark Harry". We need better ones.

And I apologize for the lack of links, I still haven't fully mastered how to share them (?)

** I am searching something more... Magical... i know Harry Potter is about Wizard but most put Magic as a Tool or the Undiscovered element which ‘Science' is lacking to be able to create life... but there's so much that could be Happening, like Rituals and Traditions Like: There was this Drarry fanfic where Harry could feel his magic pushing him to the Black Library where there he read about how to do the rites to be accepted by The Dark Magic and he feels that magic is like his mother, Or The White Lord where Harry was Chosen as The Light Lord and Tom Riddle is The Dark Lord, and like they are literally soulmates cause Magic is about Balance and Light without Dark can't exist so when Voldemort Dies the World starts to crumble, so he has to go back in time, to bad it was dropped
