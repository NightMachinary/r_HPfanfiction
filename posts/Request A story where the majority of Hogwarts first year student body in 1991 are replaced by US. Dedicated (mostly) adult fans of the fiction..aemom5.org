The major students (Harry, Hermione, Ronald, Draco, Neville and the like) are not superceded but everyone else is. And it's subtle, too. To where no adults or older students are aware that any thing has happened barring of course should some ickle firstie say something. Also, the switch comes as a surprise to every one of us who went over there, and we're all pretty certain we're alone.

The chaos that would reek! A whole year of world weary ex-muggles that are aware of future events trying to subtly change them, the professor's utter confusion at this new batch of wizards and witches, Draco's difficulty finding an ally in his own house and year. The somewhat baffling cooler reception that Dumbledore would receive by some of those not Slytherin; and warmer besides, the amount of people giving Neville, Ron, and Hermione equal stares and hushed whispers as Harry.

Should the story continue past first year, have the same happen for each following first year. (Luna does not get replaced, of course)

Everytime I've pictured this story its always told from several perspectives.

1-4: Notable ex-muggles from each house, usually a group. (Side note, everyone gets proper sorted.)

5: The Golden Quartet (I think that slimey snake just smiled at me! WTH?)

6: The professors. ("It's leviosAH, not levOsah, I swear Dumbledore, all my first years today said the exact same thing and started cracking up at some joke. All of them! WTH?)

Self inserts are welcome, just please don't be the focus of the story.


** Every entering class at Hogwarts was expected to show a heavy dose of anxiety - a mixture of homesickness, excitement about learning magic, and the fear and anticipation of making new friends.

But this group... there was something /wrong/ with this group, McGonagall thought. They almost all showed a nervous, silent reserve that one normally associated with adults in uncomfortable social situations rather than keyed-up children. When the ghosts appeared in the hall, there were no exclamations of surprise or fear. None. That had never happened once in all her years at Hogwarts. Even the Muggleborns stared placidly at the ghosts, with only the Granger girl and young Harry showing any surprise at all.

As she lead the group into the main hall, she saw lots of gaping mouths and wide eyes, reassuring her somewhat. Okay, so this was a weirdly reserved group of 11 year olds, but they could still show surprise and delight upon entering Hogwarts for the first time.

She caught a number of students with their gazes fixed fiercely on the staff table. Following the line of vision, it looked like nearly a quarter of the group was staring at Professor Quirrel with predatory focus. Another quarter seemed transfixed by Severus with the remainder glancing around, constantly stealing looks at Harry and the Weasley boy.

She gave her head a little shake and told herself to stop wool-gathering. There was a sorting to get through.

--------------

Hermione Granger was happier than she'd ever been in her short life. From the moment she set foot on the Hogwarts express, she was absolutely /mobbed/ by students all eager to be her friend. These two Muggleborn boys, Justin something and Kevin Entwhistle, had found her on Platform 9 3/4 and stuck to her like glue all day.

First they helped her get her luggage settled and then kept peppering her with questions about her life, her family, her magic, her... well, everything! They laughed at her jokes and were incredibly impressed with the magic she was able to do on the train.

They were trying out some charms on the train and Justin was pronouncing the incantation wrong. She very well knew she tended to be incredibly bossy but she just couldn't help herself - she sharply corrected him.

A moment of silence filled the air. Hermione was sure she'd gone and screwed everything up, and they hadn't even arrived at the school! Then Kevin burst out laughing so hard he could barely speak, coughing out "IT'S LEVI-/OH/-SAH!" at the top of his lungs.

A jolt went through Justin. He dropped his wand and stared, open-mouthed at Kevin. Kevin finally caught his breath and saw Justin staring, having gone pale as a sheet. His lips moved silently.

"What was that?" Kevin asked, still recovering from his freakish laughing fit.

Justin whispered, "No Ron, it's not levi-oh-/sah/ it's levi-/oh/-sah."

And then Kevin dropped /his/ wand. What the hell?!? It was the weirdest thing she'd seen since entering this strange, magical world.

"Oh my god," Kevin all but whispered back. "You too?"

Justin gave a little nod and recited something in this weird chopped cadence, something that sounded like a rehearsed litany: "Diadem Diary, Cup and Ring, Locket, Snake, Harry."

Kevin hissed his response. Something urgent, the way he was leaning into Justin, but it was too quiet for Hermione to make out.

Not a moment later, the door to their compartment banged open, a pair of girls standing there.

"Oh my god, are you Hermione Granger!?" the Indian one all but screamed. And then she had four friends.

Despite the weirdness, Hermione was SO looking forward to the next seven years.

--------------

Any idiot could tell that there was something profoundly /wrong/ with this group of children. Without even his astute mind or mastery of the mind art, Severus mused. He'd indulged himself with skimming along the surface of the Potter brat's mind and found nothing amiss. The barest glance inside the minds of the students on either side of him - a Weasley and some buck-toothed girl that was obviously Muggle-born - also showed the typical childish eagerness and anxiety.

It was a puzzle that only temporarily distracted Severus from his usual mental pastimes - designing new potions in his head and wallowing in a chest-deep pool of regret.

His mind was well on its way to sussing out an improvement to the wit-sharpening potion that would reduce addictiveness by 10% of more when a little first-year student at the Slytherin table suddenly stood up on his bench and proceeded to kick aside food and stand on the table.

What the hell did the Crabbe boy think he was doing?! Severus started to rise from his seat when the boy's voice belted out across the great hall:

"Okay, how many of you are self-inserts?!"

The absurdity of his question was met by a momentary silence. A beat later it was broken by a voice at the Hufflepuff table, "holy shit."

Two Hufflepuff boys looked at each other and immediately stood up. One raised his hand and then clambered up onto the table, "Quick show of hands to answer Crabbe's question!" his tone of voice held that slow, easy cadence of someone used to being obeyed.

Severus was now fully standing and was about to interrupt this farce when hands started going up all over the hall.

The entire first year class.

All of them.

Wait, no. Severus noted several confused students at the Gryffindor table. Potter, the Longbottom heir, and Potter's two friends all looked completely confused. A moment's glance around the hall showed only Malfoy similarly bewildered.

Severus opened his mouth, drawing in a breath in order to intervene. Before he could, the Hufflepuff boy continued speaking.

"Alright folks, keep your mouths shut. No running off to the Chamber of Secrets or the Room of Requirement until we've got a chance to talk things over," the boy seemed to pause for the barest moment before suddenly exlaiming, "Oh shit, who's got Scabbers?!"

The improbable question was answered by a boy at the Gryffindor table standing up, holding a... rat? "Ron sold me Scabbers. I'm gonna keep him very safe and very well fed, okay guys?!" the rat-wielder glanced around the room, giving all the "self-insert" students a look whose meaning was lost on Severus.

"Mr. Entwhistle," Albus spoke, the old man finally intervening. "I think it would be best if..."

The little Hufflepuff git /interrupted/ the Headmaster: "Albus, you need to clear the room right now of everyone except the first-years and Severus. Maybe Minerva."

How /dare/ he?! "That's fifty points from Hufflepuff, and how dare you interrupt the -"

"Take your fucking points and shove them up your ass, Snivellus. This concerns a certain /Riddle/ that the Headmaster is trying to solve and us first-years are going to help him."

That proclamation was met with an uproar of shouts, laughs, and... were some of the self-insert students complaining or objecting? What the /hell/ is going on here?

The Headmaster had eyes locked on the Hufflepuff boy. He'd gone completely still.

Levering himself up, the Headmaster coughed lightly to clear his throat. "It seems that Hogwarts is host to some remarkable happenings this year. Prefects, please lead all students back to their dorms, except first years. All first years please remain seated. Heads of House, please remain as well. The staff is likewise dismissed."

Entwhistle turned and immediately spoke into the silence that followed Dumbledore's proclamation. "Someone get the map from the twins."

**** Pomona Sprout liked to think of herself as unflappable. The rock upon which the House of Hufflepuff was maintained. Her matronly demeanor was simply one tool in her arsenal, one she carefully cultivated. There was no problem that couldn't be solved with teamwork, focus, and tons of gumption.

But... this...

This.

She was no longer unflappable. She was thoroughly flapped.

She'd barely remembered to draw breath for the past fifteen minutes, much less participate in the discussion. One of her little badgers, Kevin Entwhistle, had spent the past fifteen minutes ordering around Severus /and/ the Headmaster! He demanded something called a "muffliato," which was apparently a form of privacy charm. How on earth on Muggle-born had heard of charm invented by Severus, she had no idea.

He'd then referenced Alastor Moody by first name, and ordered the Headmaster to apply enough privacy wards and charms to satisfy "that paranoid old cyclops."

When Albus had suggested retiring to his office to continue the discussion between just the two of them, Mr. Entwhistle had casually refused, asserted that he was merely acting as the spokesman for the group, and affirmed that collective bargaining was the bedrock of all meaningful social change.

There was something of a hub-bub going on amongst the children:

"Goddammit, Susan, shut the fuck up. You're speaking out of turn!"

"I told you, my name is Caleb. I don't care if I'm stuck in the body of an 11 year old girl."

Miss Abbot whacked the Bones girl on the back of the head hard enough to send a resounding /smack/ through the nearly-empty Great Hall. Hannah then grabbed Susan's arms in her own and leaned forward, hissing something in ear.

"Thanks Hannah," Entwhistle continued.

Hefting a rat back and forth in his hands, he went on: "Okay, so there's 38 of us with our 'special knowledge'. To keep some semblance of order on things, raise your hand if you'd like to speak.

"You may /only/ speak if you're holding the conch. I mean Scabbers," he said.

"I'll be the chairman for now. Draco, would you please act as our Sergeant at Arms?"

Mr. Malfoy's expression went from confused to profoundly anxious.

"Uh, what's that?" he asked, his piping voice failing to carry.

Crabbe, towering nearly half a foot over Malfoy, turned to answer: "basic parliamentary procedure. There's too many of us to talk all at once or it'd be chaos. Only people holding Petti... I mean the rat... get to talk. If anyone talks out of turn, you get to hex 'em. Preferably something that shuts them up good."

Pomona couldn't believe what she was hearing. By all accounts, the Crabbe family spawned an endless series of barely-literate thugs who'd be lucky to pass even one or two OWLS, and here the latest Crabbe boy was lecturing a Malfoy on principles of government!

"Okay, so first order of business is obviously the Horcruxes," Kevin declared. His statement was meaningless to Pomona, but based on the many grim nods around the room, it looked like most of these 'self-inserts' agreed.

Susan Bones objected. She opened her mouth and started a rant, but one of the little Lions merely turned to Mr. Malfoy, jerked his head towards Susan and gave him a predatory grin.

Draco seemed to finally shake himself out of his bewildered state. He drew his wand, a smile spreading across his face.

"/Petrificus Totalus!/"

"/Serpensortia!/"

His first hex collided squarely with Miss Bones's chest. As the girl started toppling backwards, a three-foot long brown adder emerged from Draco's wand.

"Goddammit, Draco!" one of the Ravenclaws exclaimed. "Quick, Harry, tell the snake to stop moving!"

Heads swiveled towards Mr. Potter.

"Uh... what?" he was even more confused than Pomona was, and clearly very uncomfortable with the sudden attention.

A Gryffindor girl that Pomona thought was named Lavender something turned to Harry and answered him, "Harry, you can talk to snakes, like at the zoo! Tell the snake to stop!"

Harry's mouth opened, a question on his lips.

"No time, Harry, the snake might bite someone!"

Mr. Entwhistle turned his attention on little Harry.

"Harry," his voice again carrying the calm authority of a person decades older, "we'll answer your questions later, but for now, please tell the snake to stop."

Severus interrupted the children's bickering by smoothly drawing his wand and dispelling the snake. Mr. Entwhistle merely nodded at the man in thanks.

Pomona had /no idea/ what was going on, but the way these firsties were conducting themselves promised one thing: the next seven years would be something to remember.

--------------

Filius was /fascinated/.

Sure, he cultivated an appearance of excitable affability to put students at ease, but he wasn't the head of Ravenclaw for nothing. He was, first and last, an academic. Even his achievements on the dueling circuit were merely an extension of his studies into mobility charms.

He watched as a few dozen 11 year old students organized themselves, following something called "Robert's Rules of Order." They formed committees and even sub-committees. They bickered back and forth in a manner that was reminiscent of nothing so much as a contentious faculty meeting.

He caught snippets of conversations that seemed to make reference to other lives. If he could believe what he was hearing, many of these students claimed to be decades older, with a disproportionate number of them making references to places that were in the U.S.

Even that phrase - "/self/-insert" - was so very tantalizing. Self? Which self? A soul? A mind? And inserted into what? Into these 11 year old bodies? The implications for the original inhabitants was worrying in the extreme.

The discussions drew to close after no more than a half-hour. Mr. Entwhistle gathered together a bunch of muggle papers with the notes taken by each group of students. After running through them for a few minutes, he cleared his throat and looked like he was going to start speaking.

One of his Ravenclaws - a Mr. Goldstein - interrupted him. "Okay, I've had enough. Who the hell put you in charge, Entwhistle? Who are you that you get to speak for all of us?"

Mr. Entwhistle turned a withering gaze on the little Eagle. "I'm in charge because I am. I'm in charge because I was a successful VP-level executive at Unilever before all... all /this/ happened.

"I'm in charge because I was the mother of five rambunctious children, each of whom could put the twins to shame. I'm in charge because I will stop at absolutely nothing to get my family back.

"I'm in charge because I. SAID. SO. NOW DOES ANYONE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT!?"

His voice cracked slightly at the end, but the effect was diminished not at all. Forty-three very intimidated pairs of eyes looked away, none daring to challenge Mister... Missus? Entwhistle's claim to leadership.

"Very well. Albus, let us begin. First, for the name and location of the horcrux located here in Hogwarts, we demand that you bring Horace Slughorn back as potions master..."

Filius couldn't help himself. He quickly pulled out a sheet of parchment and charmed a quill to take notes. He was one of the most accomplished charms masters in the world and yet he'd never even heard of a "horcrux." It was clearly a word to conjure with, a thing of dire power, given the expression on Albus's and Severus's faces each time Mr. Entwhistle made reference to them.

--------------

This was a gift. A gift that beggared all belief. A gift beyond imagining.

Albus watched as this entity wearing a boy's skin made demands of him. Demands that were somehow reasonable, somehow /good/. They asked for nothing for themselves, showing no greed. They asked for things that would improve the quality of Hogwart's education. Above all else, they asked for things that would help Harry.

The smallest flex of his authority had his heads of house remaining silent, holding their peace for now. Albus needed to focus all of his attention on this impossible phenomenon. This gift.

The universe was handing him the means to remedy the third and final of his great mistakes. He would join Ariana and Gellert some day, but he could not rest until Riddle was permanently defeated. Plans and contingencies were in place. Manipulations proceeded, some delicate, some blunt. Yet everything hung on a thread.

And here were 38 eleven year olds, stomping into his life, ripping the thread in half, and showing him that the abyss over which he hung was little more than a mummer's trick of black cloth and low lighting.

They made demands about Cuthbert, Horace, and Severus. They referenced Sirius Black and Harry's muggle relatives. One particularly loud group demanded that all students, including first years, be allowed to try out for Quidditch.

It was that last demand that sealed it for Albus. The sheer surreality of the scene could only be real. Only reality would so casually mix the mundane with the transcendent.

They made their demands, and Albus haggled simply to keep up appearances.

A mere two hours after the Sorting Ceremony of 1991, the negotiations wrapped up, and Albus broke into his first untroubled smile in nearly a century. He stood from his chair, clapped his hands once, and ushered in the future.

***** Nah, if you wanted to turn this into a longer story, you'd have to focus on the absolute horror that is an adult suddenly waking up in an alternate dimension in a child's body. Your spouse or partner, gone. Your family, gone. Your friends, gone. Everything you knew, everything you valued, is gone.

And what about the body you insert in to? Through no fault of your own, you've gone and killed an innocent 11 year old child.

This could make for a compelling story as we learn the backgrounds of the inserts, and see the wildly divergent ways they react to their new circumstances - the basement-dwelling NEET who thinks this is the greatest thing ever to happen, only to fail just as hard at this new life because his problems are rooted in his personality and behavior, not his environment; the hard-driving barrister for whom fanfic was a guilty pleasure, suddenly finding herself stripped of the power, prestige, and position she's accustomed to; the depressed young man snatched away the night before his wedding to the love of his life; the mother, wailing in agony as she realizes she's lost the only good thing to come out a string of abusive relationships - her perfect little angel, her baby.

The drive of the story would have nothing to do with Voldemort, as that is trivially solved by a fully-informed Dumbledore within the first week of the school year. No, the real story is the melodrama that ensues and your central characters would need to find themselves in conflict - one leading the "get home at all costs" faction who delve into the deepest, darkest corners of magic to find a way home, another leading the "we will never leave" faction who fall in love with their new lives and fear that the first group will carry out a ritual that will drag them, unwilling, back to the real world, and finally the diplomat leading those caught in the middle, just trying to survive and accepting their new circumstances with resignation or grim stoicism or ambivalence.
