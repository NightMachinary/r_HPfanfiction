Lying to Dumbledore "The stone was destroyed" but actively keeps it. All the fics of him stealing it early or it not being destroyed have him return it to Flamel, instead of actively stealing the stone for himself somehow. "Oh i don't plan to use it Mirror" stone in Pocket "I lied" my stone now. The Elixir could theoretically destroy the Horcrux, but it'd be a better way to give Harry the "Infinite gold" that fanfics tend to without him being Lord Everything.


** Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise by Marshall Angmar features this. The second half of the fic is a bit wonky but the first half is rather well done.

*** Just don't look him in the eyes. Dumbledore wouldn't actively cast Legillimens on a child (he's not Snape) unless there was a reason to. Child looking at your feet when upset is common. Plus you wouldn't need to be a Master of Occlumency, because the passive surface scans are all you can do without the incantation (or a direct connection IE Voldemort)

**** This also implies Harry knows enough about it to avoid eye contact, plus a stone that gives unlimited life and gold disappearing all but guarantees Dumbles would go out of his way to get a read on Harry since he'd be the only lead.

***** Equivalent Exchange is just how Alchemy works... You cannot first gain without giving in return. So there's BOUND to be Sacrifices, unless the HPverse decided to fuck up Alchemy, and make it something entirely different with Alchemy as a name, there'd HAVE to be some kind of sacrifice invovled,.

****** It's how what we Muggles know as Alchemy supposedly works, but HP is /always/ messing about with real-life magic lore.

But anyway, I'm having trouble figuring out where you're getting that from. What I know of alchemy is that it was based on purifying all matter in the belief that all matter was a mix of ethereal and base substance, with gold being one of the matters with the highest ethereal vs. base ratio. Nothing about heavy sacrificies. Managing to create a Philosopher's Stone was a sign of ultimate enlightenment and spirituality, not something dark and sacrificial.

****** The fuck are you talking about? You're watching too much anime. Alchemy in real life was the precursor to chemistry with a focus on mettalurgy, creating a pancea, and philosophy. What little is known about canon alchemy implys that it has it's basis in real world alchemy, due to the philosopher's stone being the ultimate creation of alchemy, which succeeds at 2 of the main goals of alchemy (converting metal to gold and providing the elixer of life).

Alchemy has little to nothing to do with sacrificial exchange.

******* Given real life atomic transmutation, which is definitely possible, it just requires anywhere from a large particle accelerator to a star to do it, maintains conservation of mass, equivalent exchange would almost certainly be a thing in HP alchemy, unless the extra energy is coming from magic, and thus maintaining the law conservation of energy/mass.
