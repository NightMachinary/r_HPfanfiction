All right, I made a previous post about this before, but it didn't get anywhere.

That being said, I read a fic around 3-4 years ago where Hermione was sent to a reverse alternate universe. Basically, all the houses and their respective members were swapped.

Harry and the canon!Gryffindors were in Slytherin (one detail I remember is that Ron's parents were wealthy, as opposed to their status in canon) and Draco and the canon!Slytherin's were in Gryffindor, with the change also swapping Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw students. Also, Hermione stayed in Gryffindor throughout this swap and Draco was good, while Harry was bad. I don't remember if Voldemort was mentioned in the fic, though.

Additionally, the staff was also swapped -- however, Dumbledore was unaffected and was aware of the unusual change.

I believe I read the fanfic on fanfiction.net, but it's been a few years so I lost track of it. Could anyone help me locate this fic?


** I don't have a rec for you, sadly. I'm just curious as to the point of a story like that would be. Why not swap the names of the characters in the real book? You can't really separate a character from what he/she symbolises in the book. Wealthy Slytherin Ron might as well just be Malfoy... right?

*** Yeah, in retrospect, it seems pointless. Like I said, though, it's been a few years since I read it, so I don't remember everything except the concept and minor details. :(
