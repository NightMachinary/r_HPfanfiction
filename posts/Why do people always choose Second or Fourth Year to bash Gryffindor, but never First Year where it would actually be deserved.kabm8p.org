Second Year Gryffindor mostly stood by Harry, and Fourth Year I don't think it mentioned any Gryffindors wearing Malfoy's badges, but that was just a Primary school child's attempt at bullying rather than anything else.

You can't exactly send Harry to Slytherin because Snape is a dick. But in First Year, after the Dragon incident (why is McGonagall anyone's favourite anything again?) with a disproportionate punishment (and an obnoxious detention that would have killed Harry if it wasn't for Firenze being a badass) the only reason things went back to normal was because Harry risked his life to stop Quirrel (even if they thought it was Snape at first)

#+begin_quote
  "But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him 'the Seeker'."
#+end_quote

That means Fred and George, two notorious pranksters, were acting like hypocrites over house points and were ostracising Harry over something they do constantly, because of an over the top punishment.

** Most stories from writers interested in Bashing trend towards their Indy/Genius/OP/Time Traveller Harry avoiding the problem with the Dragon. Thusly, it never even comes up in the first place.

Structurally you can cut out the Dragon side plot, so most hobbiest writers do so. It's an easy way to show Harry being clever because every FF reader already knows the alternative.

However they cannot write around the Tournament and the resaulting fallout or the Petrificatons because they are part of the Main Story. So they are stuck with the general flow of events and that is why the bashing happens when it does.

*** Exactly that. Interfering with the Stone just gives Voldemort more information for exactly no gain whatsoever.

I more-or-less alternate between Harry believing Dumbledore can solve the Basilisk himself if he is forced to pull his finger out, and he does, Harry believing the same thing and being hideously wrong, and Harry going all in with some solution or other.

My 'bashing' has to fit in with events in canon, but I do like me a good evil Dumbledore. It's a very lengthy way of yelling at the books.

I agree with you, characters don't completely have to be 100% good and in favor of the protagonist all the time. I can't tell you how many times I was a jerk to my friends in high school when I probably shouldn't have been. Its what I like about Ron's character. He makes a mistake in GOF, he lets his jealousy cloud his judgement and acts like a prick, but he isn't satan or something. He gets over it and he and Harry make up. Its completely natural.

** The best explanation I've heard for McGonagall's behavior that night is that when she sees a little James Potter clone and his friends running around after curfew and pranking Slytherins, starting his troublemaking even younger than Potter Sr., she has Maurader flashbacks and tries to cut the whole nonsense off at the knees.

Which is not to justify her behavior. She reacted to what she /thought/ she saw instead of investigating what was actually there. She essentially committed the same sin as Snape, seeing Harry as a substitute for his father instead of a person in his own right.

Going by this explanation, and assuming 50 points each is wildly out of proportion for breaking curfew, I think it's reasonable for the other students to assume they did something /horrifying/ that they won't admit to. When you're 13 and you think your classmate did something too awful to talk about, well, ostracism is rational, if immature.

So there's some room for bashing, at least Percy and the twins should have known their brother better, but overall this is less unreasonable than the school's reaction in 2nd, 4th, and 5th year.

I think the point was so great because to her it seemed like the Trio worked to trick Draco out at night for an unknown reason (she was teaching during the whole Mauraders try to kill Snape event). Then Draco is out trying to get in trouble and Neville falls into the whole thing which really he shouldn't have had 50 pts away but suppose she can't take from Draco and not Neville, especially with Lucius on the Board of Governors.

So up late, running around the castle (we currently has a deadly corridor), tricking others to do the same and then not telling her the reason so she has to assume the worst

Plotting to put another student in trouble is pretty much opposed to everything Gryffindor is supposed to stand for, hence why she took so many points from Harry and Hermione, as for Neville and Draco they got the same punishment for the sake of "fairness".

But to be honest, Rowling probably just wanted to have Harry experiment some hardship by being shunned by his House, and pulled an explanation out of her ass to justify the massive loss of points.

** I suppose it depends on how far you define bashing. So I'll just assume standard Harry going against Gryffindor.

Personally, I would use fourth year if I wanted to have Harry separate from Gryffindor. It has the context advantage of everything that happened prior has happened. You could essentially have Harry think to himself, this is the third time in four years a portion of Gryffindor turned against me and the second in four that a majority is against me. (For fourth year most of the Gryffindor being against Harry was after his name came out and before the first task.)

Second year I do agree, the majority of Gryffindor didn't actively turn against him. That being said I do recall that at least a portion did.

First year. Your points here are valid but you need to remember context. Harry just came off of 11yrs of abuse, and thrust into the spotlight. He's (in theory) at least somewhat used to how people are treating him here. Gryffindor was the first major group that accepted him, but them turning during first year verses fourth after he's understood what the group really means and has been in the group for a significant period of time (I'd argue ever since second year as it was a minority that turned for Parseltongue) really wasn't as impactful.

** Personally, my take on the punishment they received is that the teachers already knew about the dragon beforehand. Charlie wouldn't be able to sneak a dragon to the reserve long-term, the other workers would eventually notice there was a new dragon, the administration would need to account the resources for a new (and still young) dragon and this is ignoring the undoubtedly heavy security measures and monitoring in which Nobrert would need to be included to stop poaching and Charlie /knew/ it from the get go. I think chances are that the adults (including the professors and dragon-handlers) decided to keep quiet and pretend they didn't know about the dragon to have plausible deniability while organizing and monitoring everything and letting the kids have their adventure, but to not encourage such behavior the teachers probably decided to hunt the kids down the second the exchange was made and give them an unreasonably harsh punishment.

Think about it, McG's entire speech was utterly bullshit if taken to be about the breaking of curfew, but is something I could actually expect from an utterly-done-with-your-shit local police officer or teacher at a boarding school that just found a bunch of very small children trafficking a bengal tiger back to it's home-country, it is just too big to let pass unremarkable, but at the same time those /are/ children, so you can't really let it go on to court, you are not a heartless monster after all.

Should we go with your hypothesis there is still the fact, that Hagrid for whatever reason wasn't punished, don't care if it hurt his feelings or not. If they wanted to be seen as reliable and respectable people, they should have taken care of it themselves and not let children, knowingly break rules and be in danger (I mean should dragon escape or burn them) and then they give them detention with irresponsible person, at night ( when they should be sleeping), in place where it is quiet dangerous even in daylight let alone in night. Excuse that she is done with that shit, gave her no right to put them into such situations to begin with. If she is overworked, she has three positions after all, then she should either give up some of them or quit entirely if she can't uphold all her duties which are required of her because of her field of work and adult who is supposed to watch and care over kids. If she can't make it, then she could change profession too. Regarding others adults at Hogwarts, the less said about them, the better.
