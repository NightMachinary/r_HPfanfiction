There's many fanfics with Voldemort as Harry father or grandfather, and one prompt in this sub-reddit brought the idea of fem!voldemort being Harry's mother, so i bring the idea of Voldemort being Harry's grandmother, Euphemia Potter (or Dorea, depends of the writer, i know that some writers put Dorea Potter as Harry's grandma).


** Given the differences between lily and petunia it's conceivable they have different mothers. Voldemort being Lily's mom and giving her up because let's face it Voldemort is not really the mothering sort could work.

*** Voldemort could also be the sort of asshole to do "magical experiments" producing children and dumping the "failures" with a random family, since Voldemort doesn't think they have magic and knows the pain of being a baby in an orphanage. A few memory alterations, and that family gets a new kid they totally gave birth to!

**** Wouldn't Voldemort just off them instead of giving them up for adoption?

***** Depends on the experiment. Might be curious if one of the failures would end up going full kookoo and murdering its nest-mates/enslaving parents

***** That's not collecting proper data! Long-term effects is just as impactful! After all, if Voldemort is testing possible longevity/power rituals, making sure the subjects don't explode three years in is important.

** Could be interesting I guess. Get some kind of darth vader dynamic going on there, but still not a total rip off.

** Good idea.

â€‹

There was a fic once where Grindewald was Lily's grandfather and Voldemort her father. I do think Lily being the one---considering she looked nothing like Petunia---being the child of Voldemort would be interesting.

*** To be honest i was thinking about James being Voldemort's son. Euphemia Potter is the name of James mother in canon (while many fanfics puts Dorea Black as James mother).
