  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** You should put your actual request in the title.

You should also change the flair to "Request". The "Recommendation" flair is for when you're recommending a fic.

That being said, there's linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/8253087/1/The-Power-of-the-Mind]])

Harry accidentally ends up with a phoenix, a basilisk, some kind of magical wolf, and a nemean lion. I think that's it. It's a bit of a running joke. At some point Harry vows that he'll never go to Africa because he refuses to have a nundu.

  The Sorting Hat serves more purposes than is apparent. One of them is as a safe guard against abusive families. What changes might be wrought from this? Rated for coarse language and mild violence.
