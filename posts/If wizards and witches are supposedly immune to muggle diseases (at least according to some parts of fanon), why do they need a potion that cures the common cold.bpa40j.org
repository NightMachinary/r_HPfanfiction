** Wizards arent immune to muggle disease, they are just able to cure all of them. Rowling mentions it on her Pottermore arcticle about Illness and disablity.

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. *Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it;* he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason that Gilderoy Lockhart, victim of his own mangled Memory Charm, has permanent amnesia, why the poor Longbottoms remain permanently damaged by magical torture, and why Mad-Eye Moody had to resort to a wooden leg and a magical eye when the originals were irreparably damaged in a wizards' battle; Luna Lovegood's mother, Pandora, died when one of her own experimental spells went wrong, and Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after his meeting with Fenrir Greyback.

*** The comments about surviving non-magical venoms does suggest a higher level of innate resilience, however. Also supported by surviving Quidditch injuries which would be instantly fatal to Muggles and Fantastic Beasts comments about Muggle fragility compared to wizards.

It appears to be a mix of the two: wizards are more physically resilient than Muggles AND where that higher resilience is insufficient, they also have superior medical capabilities.

**** Sure, we also know that wizards when bitten by a werewolf are less likely to bleed to death than a muggle. But I see nothing to suggest that their durability affects how often they get diseases, like none of those feats looks like it would stop a virus or an infection.

** The Common Cold isn't one disease, it's a couple hundred different weak viruses that, whilst our immune system is absolutely capable of fighting off without much effort, for whatever reason cause it to completely overreact and purge the hell out of you, causing the symptoms. Basically, it's the muggle disease that it makes the most sense for wizards to be susceptible to.

** I we ignore the fanon, I don't think Canon ever said something like that. I always saw it as "Wizard can catch Muggle Illness, but they can magically heal them so quickly even the worst disease is a passing annoyance for them".

Also I guess they don't heal Muggle because they don't care (this is a prime example of "They would annoy us to deal with all their problems"), and giving a potion to a muggle probably count as a breach of the Statute of Secrecy.

** ...What does atheism have to do with any of it? But at any rate, I believe fanon kind of misinterprets the point: they aren't /immune/ in the sense that they never catch Muggle diseases (though they are more resistant to them), they just have easily-produced potions and charms to cure /any/ Muggle disease.

It's a meme. It's referring to a "gotcha" moment where a theist will present an argument against atheism that they believe is irrefutable proof of a god (or smth similar). But it's now basically a meme.
