Dumbledore intended the power of the Elder Wand to die with him, as his death was planned. However, it was staged to appear as a murder. Voldemort would have thought that the power of the Elder Wand had transferred to Snape. Even though it was actually Draco who disarmed Dumbledore, Voldemort wouldn't have known this and he would've assumed it was Snape and killed him in order to gain control of the wand. This is exactly what happened. However, wouldn't Dumbledore and Snape have both been able to predict this outcome?


** Well Snape wouldn't have predicted it because he didn't know that Dumbledore had the Elder Wand, and may not have even known that the Elder Wand as anything more than a myth.

And Voldemort had never shown any interest in the Elder Wand before, and very few people knew that Dumbledore had it. He may have felt that it was safe to assume that Voldemort would never look into it.

*** King's Cross, Deathly Hallows

#+begin_quote
  ‘But you expected him to go after the wand?'

  ‘I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort's in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus ...'

  ‘If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn't you?'

  ‘I admit that was my intention,' said Dumbledore, ‘but it did not work as I intended, did it?'

  "Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore's death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand's last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand's power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!”

***** This only adds to the point that Dumbledore expected Voldemort to go after the wand and doesn't negate that he should have expected Voldemort to go after Snape to conquer it.

****** My point is that Dumbledore's plan was to die as the wand's master. And you are right that it does put Snape in the firing line, but Dumbledore wouldn't intentionally do that to Snape, so that can't have been his intention. And despite what Dumbledore said in your quote, Voldemort hadn't done anything to indicate he would go after the wand until after Dumbledore's death.

This is all just part of why the entire Hallows subplot seems tacked on at the end and not like something Rowling had planned for any length of time.

** Yes, and he should have. I suppose he didn't expect Snape to answer Voldemort's last call or that he would give Harry the info he and flee.

(It's really just a misstep on JKR's end and further legitimizes evil Dumbledore for those who enjoy it.)
