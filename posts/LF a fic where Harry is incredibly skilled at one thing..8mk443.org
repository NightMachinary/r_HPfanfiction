I recently read a fic where Harry was an incredible thief who had managed to steal from Nicholas Flamel. I think he got bethored to Fleur? Anyway, I'm looking for fics where Harry is incredibly skilled at one thing. I also read The mind arts where Harry the emotion vampire/dementor hybrid thing was going on...


** There is Muggle-raised Champion linkffn(11610805) where he is good at woodworking. You also have The Tinkerer linkffn(12461030) where he's good at fixing things.

For magic abilities, you have Runemaster linkffn(5077573) where he's a genius with runes. And The Art of Self-Fashioning linkffn(11585823) for Transfiguration.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.
