Luna Lovegood is the subject of what is termed as "reverse-bashing"; her flaws are instead portrayed as a method of concealing multiversal wisdom. More often than not, this is worse than straight-up bashing a character. Additionally, the one thing that /truly/ annoys me, is the fact that none of the other characters ever try to help Luna. Instead, we get Luna saying/doing another one of her crazy shenanigans, while another character chuckles and goes: "Oh, Luna!"

There is never a case of Harry (or another character) bringing Luna over to the side and explaining to Luna why saying/doing what/why she is saying/doing makes her a target for bullying or is inappropriate. Is there even a fic where Luna is taught to still be her eccentric, bubbly self, only with more self-restraint and (self-)awareness? Here is an example of something I think should happen:

 

#+begin_quote
  Luna: [Insert weird may-exist-or-may-not-exist creature its description in an unacceptable situation]
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  Harry: Uh, Luna, could I have a word?
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  /(brings her over to the side, away from everyone else)/
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  Harry: Luna, you know I love you, right? And I find your stories on [insert creature name] really cool. But, you have to remember that some people won't really get what you're saying. I am *not* saying completely change who you are, not at all. All I'm saying is be aware of how you may sound to other people.
#+end_quote

 

I like Luna as a character. Hell, I even shipped Harry/Luna for a little bit. Luna has always struck me as a character with boundless creativity and occasional bouts of wisdom beyond years. At the same time, Luna has always struck me as somewhat mentally ill - possibly due to witnessing her mother's death and her upbringing. As I've grown older, Luna being 'quirky' has gradually changed to a girl who needs help. In most, if not all of the Luna fics I've read, Harry and co. seem to be /enabling/, rather than trying to help her.


** Luna is a character designed to be no more than a side character. Any kind of close examination ruins her because it forces you to abandon ambiguity to actually commit to either:

A. The stories are false but Luna really believes in them, in which case she's that person you deleted off Facebook because they kept talking about energy healing and chemtrails.

OR

B. The stories are false but Luna doesn't really believe in them anyway, in which case she's some kind of sociopath.

OR

C. The stories are true, Luna believes in them, but they are some kind of code and Luna has mystical powers.

OR

D. The stories are true, Luna believes in them, they are literally true and the HP universe is high on meth.

And here's the thing: none of these options are satisfying.

******** Ooooh yea. I suggest a dive into the Wikipedia section on Irreligion [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion]]

At a high level, you have Atheism ("God does not exist"), Agnosticism ("We do not know if God exists"), and Apatheism ("It doesn't matter if God exists"). All three have variants, and some variants are certainly mutually exclusive.

For example, Agnosticism has "Strong vs Weak" Agnosticism ("We cannot know if God exists" vs "We do not know now if God exists"), and "Atheistic vs Theistic vs Agnostic" Agnosticism ("We do not know for certain if God exists, but [he probably does] / [he probably doesn't] / [it doesn't matter]")

Edit: Actually, "I might believe" wouldn't be Agnosticism at all: It would be either a weak form of theism or possibly implicit/weak atheism.

********* *Irreligion*

Irreligion (adjective form: non-religious or irreligious) is the absence, indifference, rejection of, or hostility towards religion.

Irreligion may include some forms of theism, depending on the religious context it is defined against; for example, in 18th-century Europe, the epitome of irreligion was deism, while in contemporary East Asia the shared term meaning "irreligion" or "no religion" (無宗教, Chinese pron. wú zōngjiào, Japanese pron. mu shūkyō), with which the majority of East Asian populations identify themselves, implies non-membership in one of the institutional religions (such as Buddhism and Christianity), and not necessarily non-belief in traditional folk religions collectively represented by Chinese Shendao and Japanese Shinto (both meaning "ways of gods").

** Ive seen this post before I think. While characterization of Luna as if she is some kind of a sage is completely OOC, She is wiser beyond her years. Luna is that kid at school that everyone thinks is weird because of the things she does and says. But Luna is a kind person who loves her friends and because she doesn't obsess over being accepted by the kids at school, she often offers insight beyond her years. That's how JK Rowling built that character and that's something FF writers have never been able to do properly. She's a much more subtle character than most FF writers are capable of writing.

*** I think [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1075603/chapters/5542160][this particular chapter of Tomorrowland]] might appeal to both you and OP, as Harry /does/ talk with Luna about her beliefs here. I'm sure you've seen this fic recommended before, and don't worry: it's a collection of linked one-shots, so this chapter can be read on its own. But the whole collection is great.

Key line: "Looking up at Luna now, Harry felt like he suddenly understood her in a way he never had before. He wasn't sure how much she really believed in the existence of heliopaths, nargles, wrackspurts or any of the other creatures she talked about. What she believed in was the possibility of them."

I think Luna definitely has some childhood trauma, but I don't think she's mentally ill. /Xeno/ might be, but I think Luna has a bit more to her character than that. One of my thoughts has always been that Luna represents the ability to have faith in something and to look at the world through a more spiritual lens, whereas Hermione is 100% calculated scientific reasoning.

Luna isn't some mystic seer, but she also isn't crazy. Tbh, I'm a bit sorry for OP that their image of Luna has changed over the years, as that indicates they have lost some of their own sense of childlike wonder...

In all seriousness, Luna is a brilliant character. She's one of a small group that likes Harry for being Harry, not saving the world, or for being famous. She's dependable, always there when Harry needs her, and is quite empathetic (in a human, not supernatural way).

I don't think she needs to change and neither does Harry. Not even a little bit. I think the writers who change her by giving her super powers ruin the awesomeness that it is Luna Lovegood. JK writing her was letting the world know that it's okay to be weird, and believe in whatever you want, and yes there are people out there who will appreciate you regardless.

** I love Luna Lovegood, she's one of my favorite characters in the series but I will admit that it is very difficult to write her, I have done it and I have hopefully kept her in character, or as in character as possible. But upon saying that it is difficult.

So I can see why people have trouble writing her, even though it does irk me when she's crazier then she is in canon or all about mythical creatures or is seen as a seer or other similar such nonsense.

Luna is socially awkward, making others around her uncomfortable with the things she says. But she is quite perspective. She talked to Harry after Sirius' death, she was able to realize that it was Harry under the Polyjuice Potion.

She does have her theories, but she is very smart. She's kind of like the opposite of Hermione though, Hermione only believes in facts and the like while Luna is willing to believe in her theories and her magical creatures. It's a nice contrast.

TLDR: Overall Luna is perspective, smart in a different way then Hermione, and isn't afraid to say what's on her mind even if others don't believe in what she does.

I cannot agree with your characterisation of Hermione.

Hermione believes in authority. That's why she is so focussed on finding her answers in books and teachers over her own experiences. Throughout the series she has to learn the hard way that "fit to print" does not equal factual correctness and that even in people in positions of trust and authority truth takes a back seat to agenda.

And this also colours her relation to Luna. We have seen again and again that Hermione has a hard time accepting things that contradict the established narrative and Luna pushes a narrative that diverges from any other one available to Hermione.

Well anyway I'm reading it and I'm really liking how the author is writing Hermione, it's very believable and is even dealing with some of her issues that she has; for instance raising her hand at every question, writing way more in an essay that is needed ect extra. I'm really liking what the author is doing with not only Hermione but Severus as well. Nothing romantic has happened yet; which is nice, I like a slow burn when it comes to romance stories, feels more realistic.

Again I normally stay away from Severus/Hermione because it's not my cup of tea (no offense to anyone who likes the pairing of course). But I'm really liking it so far and the author seems to have Hermione's and even Snape's personality down pretty well which is a relief. I don't know how the romance part of it will come about, but it has me interested I suggest trying it out if you haven't yet, but up to you of course.

*** Hermione is the one who would follow all the instructions given in class to the letter, while Luna would be more willing to experiment and invent her own techniques for spell-casting, potion-making, etc.

**** Yup definitely agree with you there. As much as I love Hermione, Luna as a character has always fascinated me because she seems like a rule breaker, but not in the sense that she would be doing it to make anyone mad or anything, just because she liked how she was doing it.

So yeah I could definitely see her doing things in class that would get most people in trouble, but her being Luna, didn't mean any malice behind anything.

** A Luna who is actually socially inept and delusional is not fun to write or read about. She'd be a charity case to feel sorry for. The only reason to ship her with Harry in the books was because she had room for growth.

If Luna's character growth stopped at the end of book 5 she'd be incredibly boring. If she was made normal she'd be incredibly boring. Giving her eccentricity a good reason, or explaining her tortured childhood, or giving her "the sight" are all ways to expand her character and make her interesting to the reader AND the author.

** I still don't understand why is she treated like a crazy person because of those creatures. Especially Hermione's reaction against her. How can she be so stupid? A few years ago, she wouldn't have been aware about magic, now she can consider that those creature exist. I'm not saying that those creatures exist but people shouldn't be convinced that they don't exist either, especially not in the effing magical world.

*** It's actually quite easy when you think about it. Hermione's the type of person to require proof before believing it exists. She isn't the person who'll just accept the existence of a creature like a snorkack without multiple points of reference in books, through eyewitness accounts, etc. Luna's the exact opposite. She doesn't need that, just the simple belief in her mind that it actually does exist. That's why the two of them often clash.

*** Luna doesn't just believe in those creatures in a vacuum. When trying to decide if something is true taking the source into account is important and someone who gets most of their knowledge from a tabloid that talks about government officials cooking goblins in pies is a big red flag. There's such a thing as being so open minded your brains fall out. I like Luna but do not blame Hermione at all for treating what she says as rubbish.

** I never actually liked Luna that much in canon, and can tolerate a fic only if she's a really minor character precisely for this reason. I think the problem is that she's "untouchable", she is perceived as being a good person and infallible under any circumstances. The other problem (in my opinion) is our society actually - we came to the point that criticizing any faults in other person is wrong, and these faults are being called life choices. People are not encouraged to change; in fact, today social interactions are about acceptance and safe spaces and 'always be yourself', 'no -something- shaming' and all that stuff. So there is a sort of taboo on pointing out flaws in other people. I think authors just feel good about themselves when they seem to accept Luna despite her weirdness.

The other thing is that she is almost always written as not having emotions - just staring mysteriously or saying something about nargles or whatever. She is not relatable and she never has any character development so I say (once again) she is just providing a way for the authors to point out how their main characters are good and accepting.

*** She's observant and she'd be one of the few people willing to think time travel is a reasonable explanation for Harry's weird behavior.

Now I kind of want to read a story where Harry is acting weird for another reason and she thinks he's a time traveler. lol

***** That's ridiculous indeed. And by some weird association of idea, I wan't to see a fanfic that replaces Luna by Worm's Tattletale, and plays with this trope a bit.

***** How is it Luna's fault if her house is gaining up on her and bullying her? Have you ever been bullied? Going to a teacher doesn't stop it. It often makes it worse. Being bullied in a boarding school would be even more terrible. You don't even get to go home at night and feel safe.

I don't really care how she's been portrayed in fanfics... I'm not going to let that change my opinion of her from canon.
