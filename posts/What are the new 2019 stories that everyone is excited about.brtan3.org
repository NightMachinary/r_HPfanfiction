** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

It's a truly great story. A lot of times you would think that you've got the story all figured out but keep reading because you can't go three chapters in this story without some new life-changing knowledge bomb

******** Surprisingly not. The pacing seemed perfect to me as there are no times where I was just trudging through to get to the "good" parts. There is always stuff happening and most of it is interesting. Only parts I am truly bored by are the Ron/Daphne stuff but it's not often enough to be annoying.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no one is perfect.

*** Nice! Thanks for mentioning the story here, truly appreciated!

I'm writing it for all of us here who like a skilled and resourceful Harry who worked hard to get there. I'm also tired of reading about 11-year-olds: this story starts in 2019 after everyone had some time to grow up and get comfortable with their magic.

If you like the sound of that, there's a chance you'll enjoy it.

(PS: No one jumps through any veils in this story)

  "I'm going to make you immortal, Harry. The least you can do in exchange is to stay civil." - in which Voldemort learns the truth behind Harry's scar and the world changes greatly for it. AU from the Battle of Hogwarts. Powerful!Harry. Independent and mature, too. Well, from time to time.
