Why do people who have never written a fic think it's fine to criticize things that writers do and write them off as "lazy" or "unoriginal?"

You haven't ever written a thing?

Then you don't have the right to call an idea "lazy," because writing fics can be quite difficult and time-consuming.

Yes, it's fun, but why on Earth should that mean that if I, say, use magical cores in a fic to measure power and explain why some wizards are weaker than others in an easy to understand way, I'm "lazy and unoriginal?"

I personally don't really use those in particular, but the writers who do are */just fine as well./*

Write your own fic where you avoid everything that is used often, avoid all that you think is "lazy," "freakish" or "just plain wrong" and then, */only then,/* you may call other writers lazy, and even then, it's wrong of you to do and tells quite a lot about what kind of person you are.

Edit: I know it's fine to criticize. But calling someone lazy when you can't even do half as good as they is just stupid.


** Your overall argument is fair but I'd just counter that if criticism in general is ok, then calling a fic "unoriginal" is valid and not rude. Calling a writer "lazy" absolutely can come across quite rude, unless its contextualized correctly. But I'd argue calling a fic "unoriginal" is a perfectly valid critique.

So we are allowed to call people lazy if we have written something? Where do you draw the line? More words than the person we are critizising? More followers? More story followers/favs?^{^{/s}}

** It's completely valid to call something lazy. Too often when I question a writer's reason for some characteristic or plot point, all they say is, "Because I thought it was cool, lol." That is pretty much the definition of lazy. If you want to make a change to an established character, that's fine, but please put some effort into the reasoning and setup. Too often fanfic readers are asked to accept some pretty ridiculous changes with very little effort put into the /why/ of the changes.

That's not to say that writing fanfic doesn't require effort, but one can still execute a story in a very lazy fashion.

** Personally I generally hold to the idea that there are no bad plot devices, only badly written plot devices. Magical cores for example can be really good, really effective for the purposes for the story. They can also be really badly portrayed, really lazy writing where there would be more effective devices to use but which would take more world building, or more effort to explain.

** This is a touchy subject because I think ANYONE calling people lazy and unoriginal is kinda being harsh, as we're all here to have fun, not make money, and mostly writing for ourselves.

That said, if you don't write fic, you're still consuming fic and that gives you the ability to see where things go wrong. I'm not a politician, but I can criticize my local politicians, as I'm affected by what they do.

I don't make films, but I watch them, and if they mess up somewhere I have the right to point it out. It's not okay for me to be rude about it, but as a consumer of their media I see things from an outside perspective. That can help someone writing sometimes.

Like lots of editors and publishers don't write their own books. They just read books.

TL;DR it should be okay to criticize, but not okay to be rude about it.

** Ok, i feel called out.

First of all, writing fanfic isn't lazy. It might be a bad one, or a good one, regardless of quality it isn't a sign of laziness.\\
Now, throwing fanon tropes of rather big and influential ideas (i.e. magical cores and blocks on magic and whatnot), without even an ounce of original spin or change on top of them? It is kinda lazy.

If you write a fic, and then put it out there for others to read, you need to be prepared for facing criticism. Is calling an idea 'lazy' too far out there? I don't think so - it might be as valid as any other critique. There are some things i don't enjoy in fics, and i will say so if i read it, but stuff like 'Ooo, Dumbledore put a block on Harry's magical core because he's soo powarful" for the umpteenth time does seem not only to be annoying, but also lazy - we've seen the same dozens time before, no need to redo it.

And just FYI - i did write some stuff. I just later deemed it to be rather shite and scrapped it instead of publishing it. If someone decides to publish his work? Fine, just don't get mad if someone doesn't enjoy it or criticises it

** Except a lot of HP fan fiction is full of tropes and ideas and the repetitive usage of them is lazy. Daphne Greengrass' fanon personality and description are good examples.

Using the idea of magical cores and removing a block to make Harry a super powerful wizard /is/ very lazy and cheap. We are shown in canon what makes a wizard talented/intelligent and it's a good way to develop Harry's character, but many refuse to do that. Indy, powerful Harry can work, but many refuse to properly take on the task.

Edit: spelling

** It's a touchy thing because, on the one hand, the reader is the audience. On the other hand, the criticism is directly sent to the writer in the form of reviews that are very easily accessible. You can watch any tv show or movie and think the director is shit and say it in the theater or in your living room, however, I can't imagine the director is sitting right next to you when you do it.

People should be able to say whatever the hell they want, in my opinion, but maybe they should think a second longer about their intentions before sending in bad reviews. Because honestly at the end of the day, the fics that I write are for me, I'm glad other people enjoy them and I like sharing them with others, but I write the stories because I like it because I enjoy reading it just as much as writing it.

** I understand the annoyance that is felt by statements like these. It is extremely annoying when you or someone you know or something you like gets painted over by a very broad brush that ends up being nothing like the truth. I too have ranted about J.K. Rowling, Ron Weasley, Finn Mikaelson and others have been more or less shat upon by people.

However to give you some advice that I myself haven't been able to always implement, it's best to never give too much credit to vague statements. It's practically guaranteed that you can't tell what a person is actually thinking by some short statement they make. One thing I am very good at is always looking for as much detail as possible before making an argument. For instance, while I had some things you said in the original post that I could have ranted about but I read all the replies you made in the thread which provided me a clearer picture of what you were actually thinking.

Back to the original topic, I don't think calling something lazy and unoriginal is a valid criticism on its own but both those criticisms contain more detailed issues.

Calling something lazy usually means that the reviewer believes that not enough thought was put into making something enjoyable and believable.

Calling something unoriginal is pretty self-explanatory. Things can certainly be unoriginal, which makes the criticism valid, though whether the thing being called unoriginal is actually unoriginal or not is an entirely different matter.

As for calling certain tropes lazy, I definitely don't think this is right but what people usually mean when they say that is "[Most of the time, the execution of] the magical core trope is very lazy and unoriginal."

P. S. If by chance you disagree with my comment, try to think of what could make you call it lazy even though I certainly put effort into typing it out.

** Some writing is lazy storytelling. Just because physically getting something on paper (so to speak) can be difficult, doesn't mean that you did enough plot planning where you've thought of a new way to tackle old tropes, character development where people face challenges and reach low points before they succeed, lifelike sounding dialogue where each character has a different voice etc.

If you don't put work into those areas than what you are doing /is/ lazy writing. There's way more to writing than typing out a story, and it shows when you don't put that work in.

** When I first started writing I thought this too. However, I came to realise that people are entitled to their own opinion. Fanfiction is littered with stories so if you don't like the term unoriginal, try making your story better with more ideas/scenes that you have never read or heard of. Ask the reviewer why they think it's lazy or unoriginal and, if they answer with specifics, try to update and twist your ff with a new idea of your own. If they don't respond with a helpful idea they may not be worth your time. I have had stories with reviews that they love it and want more while others think its stupid and unreal. I know reviews like the ones you mentioned can be frustrating but try and either ignore them or work on making your ff even better. That's just my thoughts though and people might think differently.

** People can use whatever vernacular they want. You're free to disagree or dislike however much you want, but your opinion is just that, same as anyone else's. Lazy is a perfectly valid criticism that some people deserve regardless of how much effort they put into a fanfic, be it 1000 words or 100,000. That's not to say the person themself is lazy, but that the implementation of a story element(s) they use is lazy. There's a fine difference between insulting someone and calling out a poorly thought out plot element in a story.

** Lazy when it comes to the amount of effort you put into your character development and plot.

I've seen so many fanfiction where authors basical use the same old tropes and ideas.

For example. The Lord Black trope. The Time Travel Trope. The Political Harry.

Most fanfictions that use these tropes, have the same or similar plot. It's only an exceptional few that have original ideas.

Just because the most reviewed or favored fanfiction uses those tropes doesn't mean everyone should start using them.
