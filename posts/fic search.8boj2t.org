I'm looking for Hermione/Godric. I'll read anything that is long, but oneshots are also acceptable. I've read "how old is your soul?" (I believe that's what it's called) and I did enjoy it, although I wished there was more.

I hope I'm just stating the obvious, but I don't want to read a fic where she's a teenager and he's an adult. And if they're below 18 I reeeeaally don't want there to be any smut, lol. That kind of shit grosses me out. Obviously.

Also! I do not care how old/outdated the site it's on is, I really don't. I'll take anything.

Well, I know this isn't an easy request (I've already looked), so sorry, and thanks. Best of luck.


** I don't have any recommendations for you but I have to ask, why is this thread titled " fic search " while the first sentence of your post ( "I'm looking for Hermione/Godric" + fics) is so much more explanatory

*** Ha, good question. I guess I thought I shouldn't get too descriptive in the title, but instead I ended up doing the exact opposite. Oops.
