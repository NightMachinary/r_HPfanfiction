So, general question to readers and writers of all kinds.

What sort of story structure do you prefer when there are multiple story threads running concurrently and interacting with each other?

As an example, the story I am currently trying to outline and write has three main plots, each interacting with the others to varying degrees across the span of the story.

Originally, I planned to alternate perspectives each chapter, similar to Eragon or The Bartemaeus Trilogy. However, the different threads are not well balanced, with storyline #1 dominating in the beginning, and slowly transitioning to storylines 2 and 3 toward the end. All three are present at all times, but the volume of meaningful content to keep things concurrent is unbalanced.

What would you recommend for a structure based on your experiences? I know in books with single perspective chapters, the temptation to skip to the next chapter of your favorite character is a major issue.


** I'd have different sections for different perspectives, but all in the same chapter. Size the chapters based on how much you can reasonably write, review, and publish in a certain timeframe so that you can have a reliable upload schedule.

*** This probably the best balance.

** If you seek honesty, then I must tell you that I hated the POV changes in Eragon. I hate them on almost every story. Not in Worm though, I like Worm's /Interludes/.

P.S Cliffhangers are Evil. Stay away from them. /Specially between such chapters./

*** I would not cliffhanger often if ever. I agree, cliffhanger and then cutting to another storyline for two chapters is the worst!
