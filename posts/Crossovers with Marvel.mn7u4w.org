** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer][Wanderer]] - Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10997165/1/The-Widow-and-the-Wizard][The Widow and the Wizard]] - "Would you like to come with me?" Harry stared at her eyes, big and green like his. Anything would be better than returning with the Dursleys, he believed it firmly. So he slipped this small hand into hers and held onto it tightly. AssassinInTraining!Harry Eventual Clintasha

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11537017/1/One-Soldier-Two][One Soldier, Two]] - Evangeline Potter is used to damning the Potter Luck. This time though, she's beginning to see just why no Potter ever went to a Curse Breaker about the issue. Bucky Barnes is certainly not about to start complaining. Fem!Harry/Bucky. Don't own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11627720/1/The-Wizard-and-The-Super-Soldier][The Wizard and The Super Soldier]] - 2 Years Post War. After the Battle of Hogwarts, Ron betrays Harry and Hermione, and they are left on the run for two years. After being caught and escaping Azkaban, Harry decides to do the greatest vanishing act in the world, going through the Veil. On the other side, he meets a man that desperately needs help, and makes great changes to Harry's life. MOD! Harry Slash *On Hiatus*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11426820/1/The-Sorceress][The Sorceress]] - Nine hundred years since she defeated Voldemort. And nine hundred years since she fled the wizarding world. Alexis Potter is the Mistress Of Death, alone until she meets Tony Stark. She now works for him and has become his best friend. But there are things about her he doesn't know. It's just the two of them at first, until she picks up a couple of extras on the way. Fem/harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9348546/1/Ink-Stains][Ink Stains]] - In which Harry was sealed inside Tom Riddle's diary during his second year and tossed into another world, upon where he finds himself in Bruce Banner's lonely hands. With the life Banner leads, he supposes that he shouldn't be surprised by this "Harry Potter" being. Really, there wasn't enough coffee in the world to deal with this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10835321/1/Behind-the-Shield][Behind the Shield]] - It was a good thing the new scientist, Dr. Harry Evans, was working out so well. Because nothing else was going Fury's way. And that was before Loki made off with the Tesseract and some of his people. Maybe AU to Mortem Cantor by Kyandua.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/I-See-The-Moon][I See The Moon]] - Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028/1/The-Observer-Effect][The Observer Effect]] - After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards. A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8105139/1/Hurricane][Hurricane]] - He only ever wanted to bring Sirius back, but in Harry's life nothing ever goes the way he wants it to. LokixHary.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8105674/1/Taking-Chances][Taking Chances]] - AU. He left before they could do anything about it. It was for the best.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8282559/1/Trouble-Finds-Him][Trouble Finds Him]] - While working in the Ministry as Head Auror Harry intervenes during a raid in the Time Chamber.The attackers are after The Sands of Time.Harry rescues the object but when hit with the killing curse while holding the ancient object Harry is teleported to another time...to another world.He wakes up in 1940 New York and meets Howard Stark,and goes down with the ship just like Steve...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]] - When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8750290/1/Moved-by-the-Law-of-Probability][Moved by the Law of Probability]] - The probability of Harry Potter living a completely normal life was low, but that was okay. Normality is over-rated and boring anyway. He's managed to do some pretty interesting things with his life since the war. Don't own, not canon compliant.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/Steve-And-The-Barkeep][Steve And The Barkeep]] - Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** Safeguard - (written by the same person as Island of Fire) The chitauri invasion brings an age of TechnoMages (wizards with technology). When Jarvice finds a TechnoMage web page run by Harry, what will happen, how will Harry deal with his friendship with Jarvis. Harry doesn't know Jarvis is an AI and Jarvis is basically just a smart human without a body as the residue magic from Loki caused him to become more human. Harry/Jarvis.
