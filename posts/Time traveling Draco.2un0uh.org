We've seen Harry. We've seen Hermione. We've seen Ginny. We've seen Tom Riddle. I can even remember one Hedwig one, so what about Draco Malfoy? What would he do if he could redo everything? (I don't care how ridiculous or bad, in fact as long as grammar and spelling are halfway correct, anything will do.)

*** It's "MandibleBones," actually, and it's not abandoned so much as "on indefinite hiatus." I do intend to finish it eventually. Thanks for recommending it!

*** This one definitely looks interesting. It may be abandoned, but it's a good read enough read so far.

/After a dark family ritual followed by an encounter with Death himself, Draco Malfoy gets transported to the age of the Marauders, and discovers much about his parents' past, while his girlfriend follows him back in time to ensure that he has a future.../

Snape is really good in this one as well.

** Regrets Collect Like Old Friends is a pretty strong fic about a time traveling Draco, it's complete and there are sequels but I found it goes really off the rails the further into the series you get.

On mobile, so I can't get a link, sorry~

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8070162/1/The-Seventh-Turn][The Seventh Turn]] (DM/HP) was pretty good. It has Draco doing some time traveling but it might not be exactly what you want (he doesn't stay in the past).

A couple of time traveler Draco stories that I have on my 'want to read' list are [[http://hd-bigbang.city-of-lights.org/fic/paradox.html][Paradox]] (DM/HP) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time to Spare]] (not sure on pairing-it is rated K). In Time to Spare, both Harry and Draco go back in time 200 years. I haven't read those two so I can't speak on plot quality.
