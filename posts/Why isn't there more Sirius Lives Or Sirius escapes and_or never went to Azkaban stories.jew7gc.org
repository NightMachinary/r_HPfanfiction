I understand, writing a more original work, for fanfiction, is incredibly difficult, but while there are some, Sirius Lives, or Sirius escapes, or was never sent to Azkaban, there aren't as many, as you might think.

I just find, that it's criminally underdone. It'd be great, for Harry to have a supportive adult male character. He has some female supportive characters, but not as many adult male ones. Harry can still be the one, to find Horcruxes, or do x, y or z, but would be nice, for more Sirius is around, stories.

*** It'd be interesting, how different would Harry be, if his parents died, but Pettigrew was captured, before he could kill those 12 Muggles and frame Sirius?

Harry, could still be the "main character" if an author wants to go that route, so that way, Sirius can be there, and be a frequent character, but doesn't "need to be" the main character.

Sirius freed, would be the best course, instead of never imprisoned, imo. There's more, that you could potentially do, with his character (That I mentioned below), and you'd probably be able to find more stuff, that just didn't, come to my mind, immediately).

***** Would be interesting, to see an author developing Sirius more, outside of just the comic relief type of figure.

I can actually see, Sirius end up going the political route, because of him being imprisoned. He might not like going that route (and would be interesting to see him not liking it, but realizing, someone has to). That way, he could potentially help things out.

He's a Pureblood, a Pureblood that was wrongfully convicted of a crime, he might like Muggles/Muggleborns, but I think a lot of people in charge, would have to listen to him, after what he went through, just based on the fact that he's a Pureblood, would be interesting, to see Andromeda, used more, as a way to help, Sirius too.

I'd love to write something like this, but I haven't written in years. And don't think, I'd be able to do it right.

******* In fanfics, Sirius and Andromeda were close (Don't think, it's canon, though), but if authors wanted to incorporate it, to the fics, they could use, Andromeda's character, more.

With Sirius, it just makes sense, for him wanting to change things, especially if, you don't want him to stay as just the comic relief type of character.

** I wish, I haven't seen many fics where people remember Sirus is 21 and the challenge of parenting during post-war a messiah child ... or any child, cut off from the family fortune since I can't remember when the Black Family brought him back? or if he was only brought back because of being the last male heir. Trying to balance grief, adulthood and a child while Remus is running off spying on werewolves on the continent. Just one man's attempt to change his family, raise a kid without just acting like comic relief.

Or a Sirus escapes Azkaban early and gets Harry out of Durskaban and they go on the run (harry thinks its vacation). It's weird the older I get the more I want Adult Being Relatable Adult fics, with all the confusion of I'm An AdUlT but I also have no idea what to do but have to pretend that do because the kids the kids.

** Because if Sirius is not considered a criminal (and therefore as godfather gets dibs on custody), then the series will look like this.

Harry gets raised by a caring adult, although Sirius might not be the best at parenting.

Harry comes to Hogwarts

Canon stuff happens

Sirius is a responsible adult and pulls Harry out of there by the first petrification, if not earlier.

If you want to have an adult figure who actually cares, this should be a consequence. TWT might be the exception due to the contract which is supposedly binding, but other than that, it ought to be goodby Hogwarts pretty quickly.

** I think that there are a lot of stories like this---Sirius rescuing Harry is a prevalent trope. However, maybe you're looking for Sirius in a more supportive role of Harry during canon-like events. One that I can think of is called Path Diverged by hp_fangal. It's on the site “Sink Into Your Eyes.” Sirius survives the DOM and is a strong paternal figure in Harry's life.

Personally, I'm writing a story called “To Be Loyal” that starts in the Marauders' sixth year and has some AU elements. I plan for the first big change to the canon timeline to occur on October 1981 and for Sirius to be an important figure in Harry's life (not spoiling). Check it out on fanfiction.net if you're interested; my pen name is Eriadu.

Remus, Sirius and a couple of /other characters/ are all supportive figures in Harry's life to the point Harry considers them their family.\\
It's pretty much that sort of butterfly effect story, small changes lead to different paths in Sirius, Remus and Harry's lives.

I can picture a The Rage in Placid Lake type scenario where Harry inherited a lot more Evans than Potter, and he either turns out like Oliver Wood, or is the Hermione/Percy type. I can even see it being that he's autistic, and he doesn't understand sarcasm or metaphors, and takes pranks really personally (sorry, I and a lot of autistic people genuinely cannot see most pranks as funny. They're mean) and gets overwhelmed by loud noises, and Sirius has to deal with this sensitive, non-rebellious kid who wants to work in accounting or something. I can also see it as making him think a lot about his brother, because I head canon Regulus (and Orion) as autistic (though in the magical world they call it ‘magic sensitive')

*** There's still room for conflict. The authors that can handle it (though, admittedly, I'm sure there's not as many), could tackle Sirius' never growing up, outside of age 21, when he was sentenced.

You could also tackle, the psychological aspects, of him spending years in Azkaban, unfairly.

If you want him, to still be on the run, for a good portion of the fic, you can have him pop in randomly, from time to time, to help Harry, when he can, so he's not as constant of a figure.

You can have him, be freed, and want to change things, politically, him being freed, could see how corrupt the Ministry actually is, and want change, for those authors, who want to write a political fanfic, that way, you don't have to write an 11 year old, to be politically in charge.

Edit: Just thought of another one: You can also, have him try to help creatures, like Werewolves, Vampires, Mere people, et cetra, because of his friendship with Remus, and that would help with the war.
