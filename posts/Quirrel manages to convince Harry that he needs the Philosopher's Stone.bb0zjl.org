Looking for the fic where Quirrel is sort of friendly to Harry and convinces him that he needs the Stone and steals it for him. Then it turns out Harry knew it was voldemort all along when Quirrel escaped. I've been trying to find this fic for ages and i just can't seem to remember.

P.S Not HPMOR

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".
