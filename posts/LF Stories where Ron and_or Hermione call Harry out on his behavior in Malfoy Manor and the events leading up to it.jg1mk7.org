** Harry apologized while still in the Malfoy Manor dungeon.

He was the one who got them out and turned this disaster into a significant defeat for the bad guys:

- Called Dobby
- Fought the bad guys effectively
- Beat up Draco Malfoy and won the wand ownership shenanigan
- Deduced the location of the Cup from Bellatrix's reaction
- Deduced the wand ownership shenanigan
- Got Griphook on their side temporarily

I think he performed extremely well under the circumstances, and I don't see the need for the other two to call him out.

*** - He didn't know Aberforth was looking. Dobby is Aberforth's success, not Harry's -They all fumbled their way out -Again sheer luck

I agree that a apologize suffices. But Harry was no amazing mage there and if it wasn't for an impressive amount of luck... Everything could have ended there.
