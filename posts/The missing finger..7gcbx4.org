As such the cunning creature of wormed tail cut his finger, then blasted the street full of muggles with nary an effort, for Black, his pursuer, the creature of padded feet and the omen of death was inferior to him in every angle.

And as he ran with his missing finger, never stopping to heal it and never regrowing it, (why for? curious.) chooses to reside under the nose of redhaired devils, who were under the glucose addict.

Regrow a limb, that you can. A finger? impossible. And in here plot-screwing, fanfic-ing, friends of mine, is where I question your poweress of mind.

I suppose we fall into the old debate on the nature of Dark Magic again... I see it not as an inherent /kind/ of magic, but as a classifications agreed upon by wizards, much like "Beings" and "Beasts" for magical creatures, covering magic that was designed to be harmful and has no other stated purpose (which is what sets it apart from spells like /Diffindo/).

Or did you never wonder why they were learning about jinxes, hexes and curses in Defence Against the Dark Arts, or why there was that whole argument about counterjinxes in OotP?

************* Many, many magic systems in fiction have set rules that make sense on their own even if they don't fit in with conventional physics. TVtropes calls this [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA][Magic A is Magic A]]. Without the story actually delving into it, there is no canon indication on whether HP magic is like that as well. I like to think it is. You like to think it's not. Well, fine, but your opinion and mine are just as valid, canonically speaking.

***** That seems unlikely. Pettigrew's spell caused an explosion, and I don't see why he'd have used a dark curse for such a straightforward effect, especially since he wasn't all that intent on killing the muggles (I think it was more about causing enough commotion to hide his flight). And it would be a strange curse indeed that caused an explosion of a sufficient radius to kill twelve bystanders, /and/ also neatly cut off a single finger off the person who cast it.

So it's quite reasonable to assume that Peter can't do it, or at least can't do it well enough.

Peter is also a coward so instead of risking his life/freedom trying to get someone to regrow/attach his finger he just healed it as much as he could and lived with it.

***** I've wondered that myself, and ultimately this kind of thing is where magic sort of breaks down because it's, well, fiction. But if i wanted an in-universe answer, maybe the curse effects your astral body limb, like the space where that finger needs to be, and therefore the finger can never be grown back even if you cut off and regrow the rest of the hand.

** There are fanon theories that the spell Wormtail used to kill the twelve muggles is some sort of dark spell whose power was increased by the sacrifice of the finger. If that's the case, then he can't regrow that finger as injuries caused by Dark magic (and presumably, used in dark magic) can't heal the normal way.

Is Wormtail described as having as missing a finger after GoF? Because dark magic or no, Wormtail wouldn't have had an opportunity to regrow his finger before then. After killing the muggles he transformed into the rat and stayed that way until PoA.
