** COMPLETE. Good maintenance of canon characteristics: linkffn(The Best Revenge)

COMPLETE. Old fic with time travel to Marauders era; very Snape-centric: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]]

Edited to add Tread Softly also has a completed sequel

COMPLETE. Also older, Harry has lost his memory. It has one of my favorite lines that actually made me want to take more responsibility in my life. Ofc, very Snape-centric: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2209675/1/And-So-Life-Goes-On][And So Life Goes On]]

COMPLETE. I wouldn't say this is as Snape-centric as the others, but he is very influential: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]]

COMPLETE. AU imagining Harry's love of potions being strong enough to change the course of history. (He likes cooking) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]]

COMPLETE. ABSOLUTELY my favorite series in all the fandom. Snape and Lupin steal Harry together. Touching and sweet and sad in all the right measures. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]]

If I think of more, I will add them

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
