Perhaps Harry isn't the BWL and it's Neville (leaving him to have all the "adventures" in the background as passingly noted events) -- perhaps he is. Either way, Harry Potter has a particularly nasty blood-curse on him not from his father's side, but from Lily via her (and by extension Petunia and Dudley's) magical ancestor.

As he begins staying in the Hospital Wing and St. Mungo's intermittently throughout his school years, he becomes acquainted, and then friends with, Astoria Greengrass when she comes to Hogwarts in her first year (he's a Third), who is also as intermittently sick due to the blood-curse on her family.

The tone, sadly enough, would be like two people going through chemotherapy that frequently meet each other during hospital stays and outpatient treatments, becoming friends, but with each knowing that the prognosis for both of them is not good.

The two ill kids/teens become friends, morally supporting one another through their respective illnesses, to the point where Astoria sees him as an older brother-type figure.

Amusingly, her sister, who is a bit of a complete scatterbrain, develops a slight crush on Harry when they meet, and she tries to pull off the "Ice Queen" stereotype with him to try to attract his attention (and failing miserably, which Astoria and Harry find hilarious.

(Which, you know, isn't really hard and she doesn't need to do this, since she's a pretty girl and boys at that age are like "oooh, shiny", lol).

If Harry and Daphne having some sort-of relationship makes the two happy,Astoria's all for it.

After all, Harry and herself should each try to find some semblance of comfort and happiness in the time they have left.

"Hey, 'Stori," Harry whispered hoarsely, and Astoria's slight smile made him smile as she carefully made her way over to his bed from her own.

"Rough night?" She reached over and took his hand, giving it a gentle squeeze despite the stickiness left from his sweat.

"Couldn't sleep," he mumbled. "Too hot."

"Lucky you," she said, rolling her eyes. "I was too cold. Healer Abigail said my blood circulation was being bothersome again."

"You could have asked for my blanket, you know," he said, frowning.

"And get your ickiness on me? Pass." The grin on her face grew in amusement as he snorted. He began to wheeze for a brief moment as he cleared his airway, and her grip tightened while her grin became a tad strained. "It's okay. Just breathe."

He coughed, and she handed him a tissue.

"Sorry," he said, after he'd finished and lobbed the scrunched up tissue into a nearby bin. It /vanished/ just as it entered its event horizon.

The redness around his eyes had darkened a shade, contrasting with the glittering green of his eyes and the paleness of his clammy skin, and frowned. "Should I call a healer?"

"I'm fine," he said, almost in reflex. Then he looked at the clock on the wall. "Almost time for our potions."

She grimaced, wrinkling her nose. "I hate those bloody things. They taste like Snape's old socks that've been left in my sister's room for a week. Bloody slob."

"'Stori, your nose."

She blinked and wiped her nose with the back of her hand.

Blood.

"...Bugger."

This time it was /his/ turn to squeeze her hand. "Back to bed, Princess. Last thing we need is you fainting and hitting the floor again."

If it wouldn't have hurt too much, she would have stamped her foot. "One time, Harry. One time!"

She turned and began to shuffle her way back to her own bed, but stopped halfway, looking over her shoulder at him and grinning. "And I did not 'faint'. I passed out, thank you very much."

He laughed, shaking his head, and she carried on shuffling.

/Mission accomplished. By Merlin I feel like crap./ She winced as she felt a sharp lance of pain in her chest, and she was thankful Harry couldn't have seen it. /Yeah, I'm definitely going to suffer for this later. Worth it, though./

Unseen by her, Harry's hand began to tremble and twitch. He grimaced and clenched his fist a few times, eyes flicking up to see if Astoria had turned and noticed, and the pain lessened with each curling.

He scowled down at his hand as though it had betrayed him somehow. /Damnit./


** Wow so many feels. There are so many ways you could take this. I really want to read more of this now ahaha.

One question, do you think this prompt should have a happy ending or not. As in do they survive/get cured or do they both die in the end?

Personally I could see either being good stories depending on which way it goes. Could be a dark, depressing ending or happy with them finding each other and getting better.

I'm more of a happy ending sucker myself ahaha.

*** I could see it happening either way, and there are many ways to explore it, I think.

They either both pass in the hospital, with one mourning the other until the inevitable;

One dies but the other survives and grows up to have a family (Astoria canonically survived until sometime after she married Malfoy and popped out a kid);

They both survive and become close friends throughout their lives, even if Harry doesn't become her brother-in-law or something;

One recovers but the other remains sick;

They both survive into adulthood but both remain horribly ill, and they both try to live their lives as best as possible despite the clouds hanging overhead.

Edit: Also, as it's implied Astoria and Daphne were bigoted early on in their lives (Astoria is said to have changed much like Malfoy did over the course of the series, due to what Voldemort does), his being friends with her could catalyst that change earlier -- might even change Daphne if she's bigoted like her friends/Pansy and company are, too.
