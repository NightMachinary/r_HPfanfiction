** Honestly I tend to assume that most fic is written by women until proven otherwise - in every survey of fandom I've ever seen, women pretty dramatically outnumber men. I can see where you're coming from with "harem fics are probably by guys, slash fics by girls" bit, but I'm curious as to what lead to the rest of your assumptions. (And for the record, I'm a woman who likes Ginny, Ron, and Harry/Ginny and doesn't much like Snape or Harry/Hermione.)

*** True.

Fics written by men tend to have far greater body counts.

Fics written by men tend to have lots of military terminologies.

Fics written by men tend to have lots of strategizing and tactical positioning.

Fics written by men tend to be far more hardline towards antagonists.

You use your own example to prove that you are more violent than males from central Europe. But this sample size is rather small (exactly 1) and could be easily explained away by individual variance. Furthermore, have you looked at men from Middle East and compared their attitude with yours?

********* While I think anecdotal evidence is a dangerous debate tactic due to how easily it can lead people astray, I happen to agree with much of your core point nonetheless.

There is an undeniable link between gender and predisposition towards unnecessary violence. However that is not to say that women are weak or incapable of violence by any means.

I agree with you, in that I think environment is a better predictor of tendency toward violence than gender is. Necessity breeds a great many things in people of either gender, including the ability to fight or to kill or to be callous regarding the deaths of others. (I think “A song of Ice and Fire” and “Game of Thrones” depict this really well: there are differences between the genders but both genders are capable of violence in various forms.)

Ron and Ginny bashing is mostly contained to indie/super Harry genre (which is mostly male), Harry/Hermione (which has a lot of guys write) and, in case of Ron, some Dramione and Slytherin Harry fics.

Now, I rarely see Ron bashed in slash, for example, which has predominantly female writers, and Ginny-bashing trend died long ago there. Unless Ron interferes with the ship, female writers tend to portray him positively, while some guys are happy to throw him under the bus in emo-Harry powerwanks.

A female writer will almost always have an incident in her past where she had a boyfriend who was into her because he could ask her to morph out his fantasies and it left her feeling a bit unseen/used. So she chose her romances more carefully going forward.

A male writer will not--- she'll be 100% cool with everything morphing entails and never had a negative experience with being objectified. Because she's so cool and laid back she can't have feelings about being objectified.

** As a male writer, who does Harems but tries to actually make them meaninful relationships... I'm torn here.

But I want to point out what I notice, that not everyone mentions.

Harry is not really seen interacting with many boys his age, other than Ron. He lives with Neville, Dean, and Seamus for most of a year and barely talks to them. Even Neville who joined him the DoM debacle doesn't get much screen time.

What we do see is Harry interacting with Hermione a lot, Ginny to an extent. Mentions of Angelina, Alicia and Katie. Luna, Cho, etc etc etc.

Harry has (seemingly) a bad time with guys his own age, probably due to his interactions with Dudley. He connects more with women, having been somewhat immasculated and emotionally starved his whole life. He has more female friends mentioned throughout the books than male friends.

So Harry having a lot of deep conversations with women, showing emotion more than a normal teen boy, etc etc etc... I think it all makes sense. So even as a male writer, even in a non harem situation...it just makes sense to me that he is surrounded by women; and those women are all probably interested in being his significant other (and have a better chance actually being his friends first).

But I am not a typical guy I guess. I try to balance my fics to be smutty with explosions, but plenty of actual characterization and relationships and fluff.

Oh yeah, I feel you can tell a fair bit of the time. Some more you missed, qnd these aren't neccesarily limited to just HP fanfiction.

Main character always reassuring women around him about inane things. IE yes you're pretty enough, you shouldn't listen to them. = Female

Reasoning: fanfiction is an actualization of fantasies more often than not. Men don't worry about reassurances, women do.

Main character hyper against rape from a young age despite never having anyone around him be raped or raped himself. Or on the flip side rape being used as the generic "bad guy is bad and doing the worst thing possible" way of showing who the antagonist is. = female

Reasoning: While I doubt many men would say they condone rape if asked, its just not something we think about. It's not somerhing we're going to write into a character trait simply because we don't have to ever worry about it and will never think it neccessary to put in.

Women flock to main character and just become a harem. =male

Multiple women fight over main character. = female

Reasoning: The last two make sense as two sides of the same coin, men just want to see the end result but women see the "fighting for love" thing as a part of romance.

Overuse of the word pervert. = female

Reasoning: I literally don't think any of my freinds have ever thought of something as perverted. Either hot or wrong or anywhere in between. But perverted isn't an adjective we'd use.

Descriptions of characters that even remotely include bust size for anyone other than the MC. = male

Reasoning: if its done for the MC its swlf actualization on how you'd like to look. If done for others its self gratification on the ideal women you'd like to see.

Main character starting family or saying he always dream of doing so. = female

Reasoning: not something men really think of until they already have one

You know, its at this point writing this and thinking it through that I realize how many more indicators I notice point towards female than male.

Complaining about ron's table manners. =soft tell leaning towards female

Reasoning: men really don't care most of the time, but some do

Graphic torture scene = male

Reasoning: this ones just a gut feeling

Lemon scene = male

Reasoning: men see sex as more neccessary than women

Yeah, big fricking no on this one. Seriously, come over to slash fandom and try to make that stick. Almost everything I write has graphic sex. Almost everything I've bookmarked as favorites contains explicit sex written by women. Fanfiction is a fucking /boon/ to women who want to write sex scenes that cater to their kinks. I realize reddit and journal fandom rarely overlap, but from the beginning, HP fandom on LiveJournal and Dreamwidth - which was huge in its day and was 95% women - embraced "the internet is for porn" idea with glee.

Sorry, but this assumption not only doesn't fly for me, it needs to be buried with a stake through its heart.

/Multiple women fight over main character. = female/

This may be a thing in het fic, I don't know, because I'm picky about the het fic I read in fandom, so my sample size is too small. But I haven't come across it. It's the sort of stereotyping that would throw me out of a fic the moment I got a whiff of it.

Also, I notice that when you type "main character," you default to MC = male, which isn't a given. Presumably it's a reflection of your reading tastes, but not all main characters in fic are Harry Potter.

***** Well, sex scenes can be good or bad, depending on the writer's skill, but I don't think the quality of the sex scene necessarily points to whether the writer is male or female. Random lemons are simply poor craftsmanship. Of course, if the writer is young and inexperienced at both sex and storytelling, ignorance about How Bodies Work can be a dead giveaway. Ditto fixations on body parts, since a lot of men have rather distinctive ways of describing women's bodies - although plenty of women (again, in slash fandom) will go into lengthy descriptions of dicks and (male) asses purely for pleasure.

I've always assumed that women who write het fic dwell lovingly on the sex scenes, because most of the women writers I hang out with prefer NC-17 fic. I know Snape/Hermione writers do (I don't read it, but I have fandom friends who ship them), and in one of my non-HP fandoms, my preferred het ship gets a decent amount of smut despite not being terribly popular.

Re: fighting over a love interest = female writer. I suspect those writers are young. This is an adolescent concept of relationships. Also relevant: most of the fics I read focus on the adults in canon, not the teenagers. And 50% of them have someone besides Harry as the main character. So I think it's a case of "HP fandom is so huge it's impossible to generalize based on your own corner of personal preference."

*** “Lemon scene=male”.

Generally the opposite, actually. And we really need to differentiate between straight and queer or trans men here.

Straight men to write a male protagonist as an object of sexual interest to the women around him, tend to write him having a lot of sex and with the option to have more. But they don't tend to write the sex itself.

Also:

Graphic torture scene of antagonist= male.

Graphic torture scene of protagonist= female.

“ Or on the flip side rape being used as the generic "bad guy is bad and doing the worst thing possible" way of showing who the antagonist is. = female”

George R. R. Martin would like a word with you. This is actually a really male thing. Women tend to use rape as a trauma inducing tool for their characters or as part of a rape/dub con fantasy fics. They think about the effect on the person raped, not the perception of the rapist. Most women can't help but relate with the victim.

The prime example would be Japan in the Asian Mainland theater 1937-45, but the Eastern Front is also ripe with examples on both sides.

  I'd like to object to the rape bit. I'm a guy and tend to include it whenever Death Eater atrocities come up.
#+end_quote

I'd say that there's a difference between using it to show atrocities and using it for the sake of plot. The latter (which includes rape attempts as well) makes for a rather shitty device.

***** Perhaps, but OP's reasoning is

#+begin_quote
  Or on the flip side rape being used as the generic "bad guy is bad and doing the worst thing possible" way of showing who the antagonist is. = female
#+end_quote

which sums up what I am doing pretty well. Although not the "worst possible thing", since there are way worse things you can do since the dark arts seem to be "1001 ways to make someone suffer as long and painfully as possible".

**** “I object! This thing isn't a male thing. I, a male, do it!”

No-one's claiming that ‘rape as a weapon of war' isn't a thing. It's very much a thing. It's even probable that the Death Eaters do rape- it was implied by the treatment of the campsite owner's wife at the Quidditch World Cup.

It's just men tend to write about it as horrible thing people do.

Women tend to write about it as a horrible thing to have done to you.

YMMV.

*** There's also some fics that have male characters be overly dramatic, emotional, reassuring, and interested in gossip. Pretty much a sure sign that it's a female author.

**** Are you saying male characters aren't overly dramatic? Eh.

Now, you may have a certain kind of melodrama in mind that strikes you as OOC (weeping at the drop of a hat, for example - something most women don't do, either), but male characters - especially in media favored by fandom - run around being angsty, belligerent, flamboyantly noble, long-suffering, etc. all the time. Male villains in particular tend to grandstand and act out emotionally.

***** I've noticed that some writers like to have their main character have panic attacks whenever they get too emotional. Even characters or settings where that doesn't seem to make sense. It strikes me as something a young female writer would write about. What do you think of that?

****** Since that's another one I haven't encountered in the wild, I'd have to see the specific fics for context. It could certainly be a young woman writing for maximum emotional self-indulgence and laying the OOC behavior on thick because ridiculous excess of feeling is fun for them (in fiction). I tend to lump stuff like that under emotional kink - something that trumps characterization and plot for the writer and is the real point of the scene or even the whole story. Really new writers usually don't realize they're writing kink; older writers who have been in fandom for a while will actually set out to write it deliberately, with creativity and flair - which is great if you happen to share their kink. If you don't, it's better to shrug and back-click unless you trust the writer.

** I generally make the same two assumptions as your title but not the rest.

I usually assume fanfics writers are female except for the aforementioned harem fics, blow-by-blow battle scenes or play-by-play sport scenes. If the fic contains those, I'm going to lean male. And skim them until the actual story starts back up, because they almost never add anything that couldn't be summarized in one paragraph (basically, who's dead and who's badly injured, both of which could be covered in a post-battle/game scene).
