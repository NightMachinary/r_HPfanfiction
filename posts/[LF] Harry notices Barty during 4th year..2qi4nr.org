** The only story I can think of where Harry unmasks Crouch Jr. without pre-knowledge via time travel is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]].

*** In Cold Blood, Harry smells the polyjuice potion on Barty's breath, but is knocked out a few seconds later. He never knew it was Barty, but he noticed the polyjuice potion.

**** Are you talking about DerLaCroix's story? It was one of the first stories I followed (it may have been the first but I deleted a bunch that hadn't updated in several months). iirc it went hardcore towards Creature Fic and lost me quite a bit. I still read it when it updates (rarely) though.

***** Yep. I was wary about the creature twist, but the overall plot has been pretty solid so far. The dialogue is going over a cliff in recent chapters, however.
