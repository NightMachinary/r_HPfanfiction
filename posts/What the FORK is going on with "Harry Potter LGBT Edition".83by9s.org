Ok, so if you don't know about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12817894/1/Harry-Potter-LGBT-edition][this fanfic]] yet, all I can say is that it's a huge mess. It's supposed to be "satirical", but all the author does is constantly insult their readers and complain about how hated they are. It's honestly the most bizarre thing I've ever seen, and it just won't stop getting weirder and weirder. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10274799/LGBTGirl][The author]] (who calls themselves "Jessica") started to write another fic which they quickly deleted, has removed several chapters from /HP: LGBT Ed./ after claiming they were hacked by their "boyfriend", and have apparently now set up [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10438640/xXBloodTommyxX][a second account]] claiming to be from said "boyfriend" (although, really, it just looks like someone trying to imitate Tara Gilesbie's writing style).

What the heck do you think is going on here? Is this person just a giant troll, or do they have psychological issues, or both? Is there any chance this is the same person who wrote /My Immortal/ all those years ago, or are they just a copycat?

(Also, as a sidenote, you've gotta check out the reviews. They contain all the insanity of the fic and the author's notes, except ramped up to an even weirder level.)

  I respect J.K. Rowling a lot. Her books were pretty good for their time but unfortunately the books aren't progressive and don't live up to the modern standards that we live up to today. This is 2018 and we have all kinds of people: Gay, Trans, Lesbian, Gender Binary, Asexual, Gender Fluid etc. Unfortunately, members of the LGBT and the fellow generation will disregard the HP books, considering them offensive and sexist and transphobic. This is because the Harry Potter series alienates them, forgetting to include the LGBT altogether and only focusing on gender norms and traditional sexual preferences. Harry, despite his close friendship with Ron, falls in love with only girls throughout the book, again an example of pushing straightness on us.

How the fuck did you make it past the opening A/N?

Yes, tell me more about how Harry being straight is a direct attack on all the Tumblrettes of the world.

*** 99.9% of books, like people in the real world, do not have gender dysphoria present. It's not something being forced on anyone, it's just the way things are /normally/.

Only on the internet could you possibly surround yourself in such an echo-chamber that you think it's a super common thing and there's some conspiracy to silence you.

Don't get me wrong, I believe gender dysphoria is a real thing in the same way that I believe in the Big Bang and Evolution. It's a demonstrable and observable thing. If someone accepts that part of themselves, all the more power to them. It doesn't bother me at all.

What bothers me is this delusion that it's so much more common than it is. And because of this delusion, people expect all of culture to bend to the whims of 0.01% of the population.

EDIT: For clarification, for those who thought that my 99.9% and 0.01% statistics were some statement of absolute truth, I just mean "really really small percent".

I imagine, though, that not every transgender person who was to take this survey - assuming it was a survey. If they're talking about anonymous counselling reports, there are a lot of transgender people who simply can't go to them - would admit to being transgender.

With that in mind, the fact that it's estimated as high as 0.5 to 0.6 is honestly shocking to me.

***** I would say there's a huge discrepancy between people who claim to be transgender and people who have literal gender dysphoria.

This is perhaps cynical, and I'm not trying to make it sound as if I believe true transgender people are going through a phase, but look at it this way: What percentage of doom and gloom goths actually commit suicide?

People claim things about themselves all the time for attention. My 0.01% claim is not at all based on any scientific data and could very well be too low or too high, but I also believe anyone who knows a lot of people who claim to be transgender probably also know quite a few people who are making false claims about it.

********* I'm not sure which point to start with to actually convey my full opinion on this, so please read the entire thing before judging me too harshly.

In my mind, you're whatever gender you appear to be, unless you tell me otherwise. If you /do/ tell me otherwise, that's a wish I'm more than willing to respect. I'm not sure what all of those options are, though I know there are more than just male and female, but a heads up is all I ask. I'm willing and open to discussion on whether or not it's appropriate for me to ask for your pronouns before referring to you as anything whatsoever, but so far I haven't heard anything particularly convincing on why that makes sense.

People mutilate their bodies or take risks with their health all the time for attention or acceptance. It's unlikely that hormone therapy and surgery are exempt from this behavior, though I imagine that the rates must be severely lower than normal, considering the life-changing aspects of it.

To clarify, though, I wasn't targeting those specific people in my previous posts. I suppose "Transgender" was a bit too vague, but I was referring to the people who have yet to undergo any counselling, let alone therapy and surgery. /This/ number of people is where you're likely to find people who're just saying things for attention.

And to be fair, not everyone is in a position in life to be able to do these things to properly transition. Be it do to family pressure, access to healthcare, whatever. I'm not trying to persecute transgender people at all.

I do not know what precisely 'doom and gloom goths' are nor how they compare with doom goths, gloom goths or your everyday goths.

I do know, however, that one can attempt suicide without committing suicide; one can be suicidal, i.e., experience suicide ideation, without either attempting or committing suicide; and one can be depressed without any of the above.

I almost closed with snark; instead I'll simply point out that the belief that there is 'a huge discrepancy' (90-99% based on the numbers in your posts) between people claiming to be and being transgender is quite a strong claim.

******* My example was simply meant to convey that people make false claims or act in way which is perpendicular to their actual feelings and desires for attention. This is not a new phenomena and I'd wager the vast majority of people have done this in some form or another at least once in their life.

My point was simply that if you "know" a statistically above normal amount of transgender people, there is a near certainty that you're going to be exposed to a higher than normal amount of people who are claiming to be transgender for attention, rather than any actual gender dysphoria.

My number was a figure pulled directly out of my ass. Perhaps I should have clarified, but typically when you're presented with a figure such as 99.9% it's to more signify "very small" than it is a claim of absolute facts.

I don't believe your claimed point relates to your previous comments. Particularly as the stated fact is independent of the frequency of the lie; true even if people almost never lied about being transgender.

You conflate your two claims: the size of the 'true' transgender population with its relation to that of the 'lying' transgenders. Perhaps the claim that a large majority of people are lying should be more considered.

********* First, it's extremely easy to lie online. Especially sites such as Tumblr, where users are allowed to create multiple accounts and switch between them without any third-party applications (having multiple "blogs" is part of their system).

Secondly, I can only assume you're pulling "overwhelming majority" (majority being at least 51% and "overwhelming" implying upwards of 75%) from when I said "huge discrepancy". You can call me pedantic all you want, but when I brought up this discrepancy I wasn't at all imagining a percentage nearly that high. I didn't even really have a number in mind, but if you inferred that I meant the /majority/ of people were lying about being transgender, you inferred incorrectly. Whether or not that was my fault because of my verbiage, the fact remains that my position is being represented differently from how I intended.

Thirdly, while the discussion later turned anecdotal, relying on people [[/u/blueocean43]] knows in real life, we were /originally/ talking about the online community. I would absolutely not attempt to claim that there's a huge discrepancy in "real" versus "fake" transgenders in real life, though undoubtedly one exists. How large it is isn't something I would have any knowledge of but, statistically, it must be there.

TL;DR: I never said the overwhelming majority of people were lying about being transgender. Just that there is a large discrepancy which exists in the online community between people who claim they are transgender and people who actually are.

***** It straight-up reads like a parody of every sanctimonious fic writer ever.

The author notes are the first thing that give it away with that /transage/ bit. The second thing is that there are misplaced periods, apostrophes, and commas in a fic where the writer has a fairly decent grasp of sentence structure and other punctuation. It's too clean, and the "mistakes" are too consistent to be genuine.

Just an example of something repeated throughout:

#+begin_quote
  "Whatever." said Hagrid with a self-righteous tone.
#+end_quote

A novice writer will generally do something like

#+begin_quote
  "Whatever" Said Hagrid with a self-righteous tone.
#+end_quote

I actually wouldn't be surprised if this was written by someone who frequents this sub, because it reads like a checklist of pretty much everything people here generally don't like -- slash; copious A/Ns; sudden best friend Hermione syndrome; ridiculously shitty Dursleys -- and that's just in the first chapter. Later on there are things like: stupidly tiny chapters; at least one chapter consisting only of an author's note; notes in the middle of chapters; and a sudden lack of previously-demonstrated punctuation and grammar.

And, most damning of all, someone claiming to be the author has recently posted here.

It works all right as the joke fic that it is for a couple chapters, but quickly gets stale. Now, a good troll that invokes Poe's Law, that's on another level.

Assuming that you're not catfishing us, as I suspected earlier, let me extend you the benefit of the doubt and believe, for the moment, that you're genuine. In /that/ case, I certainly think you haven't been very polite to people, and that's the reason why they're firing back at you. You've clearly got a chip on your shoulder, and I would advise that you talk to a counselor or psychiatrist if that's what you need. I'm glad you're interested in creative writing, but there's a lot more healthy things you could be doing with your time than getting into arguments over this story. Maybe if you weren't so darn confrontational in your notes, we'd have paid more attention to what you actually had to say.

But please tell me, because I'd like to hear it from you: are you the same person who wrote /My Immortal/ twelve years ago, and if so, can you prove it? Are you connected to the author Rose Christo in any way, and if so, can you prove it?
