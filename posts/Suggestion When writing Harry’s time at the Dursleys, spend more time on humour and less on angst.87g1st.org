Picked up Goblet of Fire yesterday, expecting not to like it anymore, but have been pleasantly surprised so far. It's been said before (esp by Sesc), but Harry's time at the Dursleys is more comically absurd than it is miserable.

Dudley's ridiculous diet is here to poke fun at how incredibly fat he's gotten. I don't know what kind of diets were popular in the 90s but the idea of a suburban family feasting on grapefruits is hilarious. So is Harry's observation that he still got less than what Dudley got just to appease him. Of course, he doesn't give a shit, cos he's baller and got his friends to send him meat pies and cake. Ha!

Harry's having a right laugh watching Vernon turn into a plum (good god, who actually turns /purple/?) at just the suggestion of broomsticks. Then he's blackmailing him by mentioning that his serial killer of a godfather might worry that he hasn't heard from him in a while. There ya go --- Harry's sneaky and manipulative, no need to create contrived situations to make him morally grey.

And then there's Ron's ridiculous owl. I'd forgotten how charming Rowling's writing could be.

On another note, I also see Malfoy as being as much of a farce as the Dursleys. What the latter are to muggles, he is to wizards and witches. He's just a big joke.

#+end_quote

It is miserable. Though many fanfiction writers feel the need to have Vernon actually beat Harry to make it more dramatic and obvious, what Harry in the books goes through is also very much abuse. It's just painted as comical because of the way Harry thinks of his relatives and how he deals with the situation.

Harry is someone who needs humour to get him through dark times. That's why I agree that it's good to focus on the absurdity and humour in Harry's time at the Dursleys. But that doesn't mean his time there isn't miserable or that he doesn't give a shit what his relatives do to him.

That's why he never really stands up for himself in the whole series, I am sure most of us wouldn't have let Snape bully them (I myself would have stopped going to the class and I wouldn't have gone to detentions for not showing up for potions either and neither to any other detentions assigned by Snape or because of Snape!) or their fellow classmates (without striking back that is - I was bullied for 5 years and it was a miserable experience, but I took any chance for some payback that I could get! Hell most of us would probably have been angry with Dumbledore for being responsible for the abuse suffered and for the communications blackout after GoF and OOTP etc. etc.)! He defends his friends to death (and his dead parents, too), he fights for everybody else - but Harry himself is not all that important to Harry! Otherwise Harry wouldn't willingly sacrifice himself before ever having truly lived and for a world that doesn't deserve that sacrifice! Sure he survived, but he didn't know that he would, so he in essence commited suicide in order to save everybody else!

Of course, I am not advocating angst here, but either accept that the Dursleys are human trash and do something about them (like planting a ton of magically multiplied cocaine on Vernon and then call the police or simply posting their adress in the Daily Prophet while Harry is at school and let a mob raze Privet Drive) or write an AU where they are decent humans.

******* One point to remember though is that the dursleys aren't just there to make the reader feel sympathy for Harry. From a literary standpoint, the the Dursleys abuse of Harry is an obvious foil for the abuse Tom Riddle went through growing up. It was JKs intention to in a way, desympathise Riddle, because how can people woobify Voldemort and excuse his terrible actions because he had a shitty childhood, because Harry had a terrible childhood and he never went darklord in Canon. IIRC, it's damn near explicitly stated in CoS, when Harry is talking to Dumbledore and expressing concern that he could have easily ended up as Voldemort, and Dumbledore goes on a whole spiel about how 'it's our choices that define us' which is a core message in the books. Having Harry undergo abuse at the Dursleys hands, and grow up in a loveless home, never knowing anybody will come to save him, just like Riddle, yet still making the choice to be a kind giving person, unlike Riddle making the choice to be a manipulative selfish person, is integral to supporting that message. Give harry a loving home, and you take away that foil.

On the other hand, just because jk intended it that way doesn't mean it's a bulletproof foil. Given that we can assume that at the very least, the formative initial decisions about being kind versus cruel were made at a very young age, the audience can say that Tom and Harry can't have their actions at such young an age held against them, because they weren't well developed enough to understand the outcome of their decisions, and that by the time they were able to, their paths were set for them. If 11 year old Tom Riddle had felt a smidgen of guilt or regret about his actions prior to Dumbledore showing up, it is unlikely he believed he could ever be forgiven for them, and that repenting would only lead to pain and suffering, so as far as he knew he had no other choice but to continue down the path he was already on.

This is not to say Tom riddle did have feelings of guilt, given what we know about him in all likelihood he never held any remorse for any of his actions. But if he had felt remorse, by the time someone made him aware of another path, he had already committed actions that he could have believed made him irredeemable, and that it was too late to take the better path. He may have been a creepy sociopath, but he was an 11 year old creepy sociopath with a very limited worldview. Can he truly be judged for actions for which he might not have been aware of the consequences, or for not taking the path he might have thought already closed to him?

I was under the impression that you were trying to say that there were lots of other ways for a hero to gather audience sympathy without being the poor abused orphan, which I agree with. I was attempting to offer that Harry didn't just have a shitty childhood to garner audience sympathy and to have a reason to beat the bad guys, but also to show that our choices define us, via character foil.

There is a big difference of specifics between Harry and Riddles childhoods, but what seemed to be JKs intention was to show that despite both growing up in loveless homes, knowing nothing about parents they've never met, being treated badly by those older than them and being bullied by those the same age, having no hope of things ever getting better or of someone coming to save them, still manage to make different choices about the kind of person they want to be. The exact circumstances and time periods aren't as important. I vaguely remember there being a scene in either CoS or HBP where Dumbledore straight up tells Harry that he and Riddle had very similar childhoods, but Harry has the ability to choose to be a better person than Riddle did, despite growing from similar roots. I would look it up, but I sadly don't actually own any of the books, except the first audio book.

#+begin_quote
  There is a big difference of specifics between Harry and Riddles childhoods, but what seemed to be JKs intention was to show that despite both growing up in loveless homes, knowing nothing about parents they've never met, being treated badly by those older than them and being bullied by those the same age, having no hope of things ever getting better or of someone coming to save them, still manage to make different choices about the kind of person they want to be. The exact circumstances and time periods aren't as important. I vaguely remember there being a scene in either CoS or HBP where Dumbledore straight up tells Harry that he and Riddle had very similar childhoods, but Harry has the ability to choose to be a better person than Riddle did, despite growing from similar roots. I would look it up, but I sadly don't actually own any of the books, except the first audio book
#+end_quote

You are entirely correct, such thing did happen (in CoS I believe). However, JK later introduced dates in an attempt to stay relevant, which that undermines/contradicts the point CoS was making. For example the fact that Tom Riddle lived through WW2, which could have been where his hatred for muggles came from. Or maybe it was the abuse or daddy issues.

Definitely true. It ties into what I was saying about how JK /tells/ us that we shouldn't woobify voldemort because Harry managed to not go psycho in similar circumstances, but things are rarely so simple. Not only did Tom have a shit childhood, he had a shit childhood in a shit period of time, whereas Harry just had a shit childhood. Who's to say Harry didn't have some life event or interaction that defined his choice to be good, that Tom never got? Maybe Tom was legitimately mentally ill and never got help for it, while Harry was only dealing with bad circumstances, without having to deal with bad brains.

************ You know, that would work better if we hadn't been shown how Riddle came from ‘bad blood', as the Gaunts were so obviously evil it was a little painful. By contrast we're also shown James and Lily Potter were actually good people. (James's initial childishness aside, that he presumably outgrew).

************* That's a good point. On the other hand, the same can be said for the Blacks. By all accounts Walberga (sp?) and her husband were awful people, and it's safe to assume Narcissa's parents were as well. Very much what one would consider 'bad blood.' And yet, Sirius became a Gryffindor, Regulus betrayed the dark lord of his own volition, sacrificing his life to do so, and Andromeda married a muggleborn. In the Harry Potter universe, while blood may effect you, it's shown time after time that the choice for good is ultimately up to the individual. And while Sirius may have had a saving grace of good influence by being sorted into gryffindor, as far as the audience knows he was not a cruel or harmful child prior to attending hogwarts. And Regulus was sorted into slytherin, where he likely had no such good influence, and still managed to make the good choice (and if i remember correctly, he did it without any ulterior selfish motive, say, wanting vengeance for the death of someone important to him, that he himself was partly to blame for.)

************** Sirius was considered an oddity even by his friends. And considering his behavior (even making allowances for the 10+ years in Azkaban) it was less him being righteous and more like getting acceptable targets.

Also, Regulus switched because apparently Horcruxes are that horrific and some things are just beyond the pale. (That doesn't diminish the bravery of his act, but there's nowhere to suggest that he got an epiphany and realized Voldemort's ideology was wrong)

*************** Regardless of how much of a cocky reckless shit head Sirius was, he wasn't evil. At the end of the day, whether it was finding acceptable targets or not, he never committed the kinds of actions Voldemort did, even before going to hogwarts. If anything, he had /more/ of a reason to go dark side than Voldemort, given that his entire family was pro death eater, and hated 'mudbloods.' Before Hogwarts, there was no one to give him a moral compass and show him the better path. He chose not to take it on his own. Tom Riddle, on the other hand, did not make that choice.Tom Riddle had just as many chances as Sirius, and he chose to kill muggleborns near indiscriminately. Yes, Sirius was an oddity. But does that mean that all the other blacks did not have the choice to go on the better path? You are saying that since Tom Riddle had bad blood, he had less of a chance to make the better choice. Except Sirius had just as much bad blood, bad blood he was actually exposed to and grew up with, so therefore had just as much chance to make bad choices as Tom did, and yet he didn't.

**************** I never said he was evil? Just that he wasn't a very nice person (and his time in prison did him no favors). Which is the part that I believe was influenced by the Blacks.

However, we might need a better sample size because of the known Black family members we only have consistent characterization for like... three of them.

Regarding Tom Riddle, I'd qualify him as a highly charismatic psychopath. And growing up in an ‘evil orphanage' TM probably helped regarding his disregard for muggles. (Killing animals, scaring others and stealing trophies are indicators that something wasn't quite right with him even then)

Harry and Tom's upbringing are deliberate foils for each other, and shine a spotlight on the power of choice. Yes, Tom had bad blood, but Sirius did as well, so JKs idea of our choices defining us rather than our pasts still stands.

There were plenty of other ways Sirius could have acted out that didn't involve deciding muggles deserved to live. There were plenty of other things Tom could have done to vent his feelings that didn't involve deciding muggles didn't deserve to live. Regardless of their reasoning for their choices, they ultimately made different ones, when they could have just as easily made the reverse. Intent /does/ matter, I agree, but the intent behind their choices doesn't override the value of choice itself.

As I knew it the whole 'can't feel love because he was born of a love potion' is a myth based on JK saying him being conceived under love potion has a symbolic connection to him being unable to feel love, but had he been raised and loved by Merope, things would be entirely different.

If it's about what your choices make you, then Harry is qutie the asshole for causing all those deaths...in fact the world as a whole would have been better off if he told Moody, Remus etc. about the horcruxes and then would have killed himself! The adults then could track the rest of the horcruxes down in a timely fashion and engage Voldemort in a deadly 5 or even 10 on 1 duel to the death (Snape could surely give then Voldemort's location or tell Voldemort something - like "Hey I know where Harry Potter is!"

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

Absolutely not! Harry was abused (and badly judging by his reactions to being touched - especially hugged - and otherwise shown affection! Hell, the frying pan scene is pretty telling on its own IMHO!) and if you don't write an AU (with good Dursleys or at least not abusive Dursleys!) you should show this!
