I am looking for some good stories of when Harry has to raise a kid either alone or with help while still having to deal with Voldemort or as a result from the war. Just something where Harry has something to fight for or has to put them first in his life. I have read a couple of them but there is probably some more out there that you can recommend.

One of the most recent ones I read was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3123443/1/][The little child to lead him]]


** (spoilers) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][In the Denarian Renegade]] (695,362) the author eventually makes Harry have a daughter. She acts a little like Wednesday Addams, and most of the time Harry has no idea what to do with her, since he himself is not much of an adult yet either. I don't know how well this will fit your request.

Future Harry and his family are transported back in time in where Lord Voldemort is alive.
