It's on FanFiction.net, set in GoF, and it involves him becoming "Lord Hogwarts" or something like that. I'm also pretty sure it starts with Harry being in the Hospital Wing.

Update: I found it myself, it's called "The New Mrs Potter"; it's written by 'Harry50' and has 22 chapters


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Four Founders by Darth Marrs) This fits the criteria. Darth Marrs has come a long way since then and this fic shows it's age.
