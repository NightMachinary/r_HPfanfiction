I'm new to writing fanfiction, and i'm stuck on my first fight scene, it's between two very experienced duelists.

I'm also going to write one between a very experienced duelist and a powerful but inexperienced duelist, please help!


** Generally speaking, for larger fights, you want to set things up so that you have several simultaneous engagements which are different from each other (terrain/location, skill levels, size, preferences, weapons and so on). That way you can swap between them at will to keep things spicy rather than repeat the same three scenes.

For the smaller picture, avoid too many technical terms. For example, rather than "Harry cast /Avada Kedavra/", "Harry cast a killing curse" flows a lot better (the same goes for weapons, use weapon names very rarely or it sounds too technical).

You don't have to describe every spell cast with name, describing their effect ("a chunk of the wall behind Harry exploded, showering him with dust and debris") or how they look ("green curses flew back and forth"). Describe the feelings of the combatants, and what they can and cannot sense ("Harry could barely see the tip of his nose", "the smell of dust and blood hung heavy in the stale air of the dungeon").

How would one keep the reader interested in just one battle?

**** Changing environments and stakes. The stakes need to be high but not meaningless (eg a tournament is not very interesting and most reasons to participate are either contrived or relatively meaningless) nor unbelievable because if they are too high (eg destruction of the planet), the readers will know that the MC won't lose. It also should not be forced, so random out-of-the-blue abductions are not really helpful in that regard. It works with Sirius in OotP because it has a solid back-up, but if Pettigrew randomly dropped a note that he abducted Hermione, that would feel forced.

As for environment, the easiest ways are for the combatants to change the terrain (transfiguration), force the fight into a different location (a chase) or have the surroundings change on their own (eg a slowly spreading fire or a building on the brink of collapse so that the damage from stray spells causes sections to break down wall by wall).

The effects of the battle (injuries), as well as collateral damage and casualties, can add flair. People screaming, bleeding out in agony and the like can be immersive, but unless you are going for the WWI vibe, remember to use that in moderation.

Also, interesting locations (caves, ruins, public places) make things more immersive if you can describe them well. If you want to use real-world places, Street View and photographs are the minimum, being there is much better. Travel guides are not sufficient, I'm talking from experience here.

A Song of Ice and Fire has this in spades: Harrenhal is a tournament told in remembrances and stories, but was arguably the catalyst for the civil war that drives the entire plot of the books, while being basically just a party for nobles. There's intrigue, backstabbing, broken hearts, forbidden love... and it's just off the periphery of the main characters' minds.

****** But the actual tournament had no high stakes. The winners got some gold and maybe a boost to personal prestige which enabled them to advance socially (similar to how Mormont got his wife a few years later). Yet the competition is of little relevance. Lyanna was not competing for the victory, she wanted to teach those knights and their squires a lesson.

Harrenhal got its stakes from the mad spectator king, not from the actual competition. The tournaments we see later on in the series also are more entertainment and the actual conflict comes from events surrounding them (eg Cleganebowl 1.0).

The trials by combat are a much better example of fights with high stakes.

******* Yeah, I think the better example in aSoIaF for a low stake tournament is the one of the King's Hand at the start of the series - and that gets brushed through mostly, mostly serving as a way to introduce characters/dynamics.

I think a tournament doesn't have to be high stakes to be interesting - but you're right that it's difficult to do so, and usually isn't worth it.

** I'm not an author, but I have many, many, many thoughts on action (and fight scenes) in media.

The most important thing to remember is that *fights are character development and character interactions*. Fights are situations in which two or more people will be interacting, under differing levels of stress. Two experienced wizards/witches dueling for sport will have their own styles they prefer. Perhaps one is straightforward, relying on shock and awe. Maybe another tries to be more subtle. How do these personalities mesh against each other? If it isn't a duel for sport, but for life, the characters should be more stressed, more frantic. A fight between an experience duelist and an inexperience but powerful duelist should show the difference between the two. The duelist may lack strength, but will be far more composed under pressure than the inexperienced duelist who may panic or freeze.

Let's look at two duels in canon. First would be the /GoF/ Harry v. Voldemort. Harry doesn't really get much magic done, but spends virtually the entirety of the fault moving around, diminishing Voldemort's attempts to aim. This shows his youthful energy, his panic and his inexperience. Voldemort, on the other hand, spends virtually the entire fight toying with Harry, showing us his sadism and arrogance. The second fight I want us to consider is Voldemort v. Dumbledore from /OotP/. I just read it and counted the distinct pieces of magic that Voldemort and Dumbledore cast.

1.  Voldemort casts the Killing Curse.
2.  Dumbledore apparates behind Voldemort, avoiding the Killing Curse (magic 1).
3.  Dumbledore animates fountain.
4.  Voldemort casts the Killing Curse. Interestingly, it hits a desk and the desk catches fire.
5.  Dumbledore casts a spell that causes Harry's hair stand on end as it passes by.
6.  Voldemort conjures a shining silver shield (note: a physical shield) to stop the spell (magic 5).
7.  Voldemort yet again casts the Killing Curse, which is blocked by one of the animated parts of the fountain (magic 3).
8.  Dumbledore casts a fire whip.
9.  Voldemort transfigures the fire whip (magic 8) into a serpent.
10. Voldemort apparates to the fountain.
11. While snake (magic 9) attacks Dumbledore, Voldemort casts the Killing Curse (blocked by a Fawkes intervention).
12. Dumbledore transforms snake (magic 9) into dark smoke.
13. Simultaneous to magic 12, Dumbledore causes water from the fountain to engulf Voldemort.
14. Voldemort posses Harry.

So what does this tell us about Dumbledore and Voldemort? Voldemort is far more aggressive and straight forward as shown by his repeated use of the Killing Curse. This doesn't mean that he won't use subterfuge (turning the fire whip into a snake as a distraction for the Killing Curse, and possessing Harry). On the other hand, Dumbledore is a bit more subtle. Animating the fountain creates protections for himself and Harry, as well as a means of restraining Bellatrix. He's less aggressive, as the animation was primarily defensive, the snake was transfigured into smoke and not something offensive and both the water and fire whip were both means of capturing/restraining Voldemort. However, Dumbledore is willing to fuck a bitch up (magic 5). Also, look at their demeanor while they talk during the fight. Dumbledore, while he is the one in danger is calm, but when Voldemort does his possession attempt on Harry, sounds frightened. This shows Dumbledore's greater concern for others than himself. Voldemort is angry (see the dialogue tags of spat and snarled)

As for character development, I honestly recommend watching this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiVtiVrXaBU][Rossatron video about the original Robocop movie]] for a discussion on how action can develop characters.

The next thing to keep in mind is that *fight scenes should have a point*. Why are the characters fighting? What does the scene add to the story? If there is no point to the fight, why have it?

Finally, *every magic fight in canon ends very quickly*. Both the battles during /HBP/ (when the Death Eaters are fleeing) and the Department of Mysteries are series of very short fights, the Dumbledore v. Voldemort involved 14 quickly done pieces of magic, Harry v. Draco 1 (/CoS/) was one spell ended by surprise Parseltongue and Harry v. Draco II (/HBP/) was 5 complete spells and one interrupted spell.

** Some good advice in this thread. One thing I would add, which I don't think has been covered: don't forget the combatants' objectives. Only very rarely will the fight itself be the reason for the people being there. Rather, each party is trying to achieve a goal and the fight occurs because their goals are mutually exclusive.

Throughout the fight, the combatants should still be trying to achieve that goal. If you remember this, it will give the fight a more dynamic feeling than a pure fight would. Further, the goal will invest the reader in the action - provided the reader also wants the goal to be achieved.

*** This is especially important in my opinion. In the Battle of The Department of Mysteries the goal of the Death Eaters was to get the prophecy while the goal of the students was to escape. It makes sense for the violent and unhinged to see their goal shift to fighting for violences sake on occassion, but shouldn't be relied on.

If the ministry fight had all played out in the hall of prophecies it wouldn't have made any sense, and it wouldn't have been interesting to read.

** This may seem limiting, but inexperienced vs experienced should result in a loss for the inexperienced. Curb stomp fights are certainly controversial, but they can serve a narrative purpose(see Hulk vs Thanos). Snape vs Harry at the end of HBP shows the difference between experience and inexperience where Snape just toys with Harry.

With Harry Potter's magic, a single spell can be the difference maker. Even hitting someone with a jelly legs jinx can cause them to fall over which any competent duellist can capitalize on.

*** I think it can be made to be a bit different, depending on how big a power gap the fic is using. In canon HP, you're right that experience would be the deciding factor - but one with more magical power/difference could have a reason to have the inexperienced one win a reasonable percentage of the time, even without other aspects like luck or being overconfident.

You're right as a rule of thumb, of course - but when writing it, I don't think some <25% chance victories are out of the question :P

**** If you want a closer fight between inexperienced vs experienced you can even the odds

Hypothetical example: the experienced combatant is an Auror who just finished taking down a terrorist cell after tracking them for two weeks. During that time, he's operated on limited sleep and his wand snapped and was forced to use another wand which is not a match. He's sustained a number of injuries and is recovering and is attacked by an inexperienced opponent while in his safehouse.

This evens the odds significantly. The Auror is hurt, sleep deprived and using a wand that's not suitable for sustained combat. Lets say he's forced to use a stolen Ash wand(which loses its power as it transfers between owners) or a Dogwood wand(incapable of non-verbal magic. Now its a much closer fight. The experienced Auror could lose in this case, or he's forced to outsmart his opponent who's got him reeling.

*** Completely agree. I am just in the middle writing my own [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][story]], where I needed two small fight scenes, and I wondered how to make a realistic scene.

1. Two students (Harry & Ginny) and one Disillusioned Auror (Tonks) defeat Antonin Dolohov & some unnamed young Death Eater in-training. The young Death Eater is too eager and he shoots the Stunning Curse towards Harry too early, so Harry (with his good reflexes, that's the only advanced quality I was willing to give him; I hate super!Harry) manages to avoid and shoots the Cutting Curse towards him and by chance hits him. Wounded DE looses concentration and he is immediately stunned by Tonks, so we have suddenly a way better situation: Dolohov suddenly fights against Harry & Tonks, and he completely ignores Ginny, who hesitates for a moment, but when she sees that she is overlooked and she remembers Harry teaching them in DA, that one should not be creative in a duel and just uses the curse which fits her best. So, she takes her time until she gets an opening and the shoots the biggest /Reducto/ curse she can manage towards the torso of Dolohov. He manages to jump to side a bit, so he is not hit in his chest, but the curse scratches his shoulder, which bursts and his wand hand falls to the side.

2. Harry with Tonks and Dudley walk from the post office (where Dudley called to Vernon, to let him know 4 Privet Drive was destroyed by fire, but they are safe). Dudley walks a bit faster so he is alone when he sees a man in the black long coat raising up his wand and pointing towards Harry & Tonks behind them. The man of course did not recognize Dudley as a man knowing what's going, so when the Death Eater was surprised by his unexpected opportunity, he started his attack while Dudley was just a few meters away from him (he expected to /Obliviate/ him later). We are in the summer post the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, so Dudley has one year in Smeltings when he trained boxing regularly. He manages to put the Death Eater down by two blows with his fists. The second man sees how his colleague is put down by an unknown person, turns to attack him, Dudley runs to close the distance between them, the Death Eater in shock manages just raise the /Protego/ shield, and Dudley is thrown away when he hits the shield. He hits the wall and breaks his hand. However, in meanwhile, Harry & Tonks have time to react and they /Stun/ the Death Eater.

Both skirmishes were training for me how to make a fight where David realistically defeats a Goliath.

** Fight scenes are all about action and are, by their nature, both short and fast paced. Try to choose your words to reflect this. If you have a choice between a short word and a long word, the short word will usually serve you better. For example:

She stabs him.

She impales him.

Both sentences mean the exact same thing, but the first one feels faster.

Leave out any extraneous adjectives. We know the knife is sharp. Knives are sharp. Calling it a sharp knife instead of a knife will not add anything to the story. If you do need an adjective, try to pick just one. You'll also want to leave out any wordy descriptions. There are only two times when the scenery is important: If your character is hiding behind it, or if your character is tripping over it.

Good fight description:

He trips on the worn rug. She draws her knife and stabs him.

Poor fight description:

There is a dirty old rug in the room that matches the blue couch. His feet tangle in it and he trips. She draws her sharp knife and impales him.

​

Now let's talk about dialogue. Sometimes, when people are fighting, they swear. Sometimes they insult their opponent. Sometimes they shout death threats at each other. Very rarely, they beg or crack jokes. What they never do is have long conversations about feelings or the power of friendship. They never monologue about their problems or their evil plans. They never try to talk their opponent down. When you are fighting, the time for long discussion is over.

Good fight description:

He trips on the worn rug. "Oh, Fuck."

She draws her knife and stabs him.

Poor fight description:

There is a dirty old rug in the room that matches the blue couch. His feet tangle in it and he trips.

"Don't do it, Mary Sue. I know that you still love me."

"I never loved you, Gary. I was just getting close to you, so that I could turn you over to the evil overlord! I'm going to take you in for questioning and when they're done with you, I'm going to kill you."

She draws her sharp knife and impales him.

There is an important consequence of this point: if you are going to have a fight scene in a location, make sure to visit that location earlier in the story to get your description done. That way when you have the fight later, the reader can imagine it vividly without you having to bog the fight scene down with pace-slowing description.

See:

1. Harry's trial at the start of OotP gave us a tour of the Ministry and a detailed description of the Atrium in which Dumbledore vs. Voldemort would occur.

2. In the Department of Mysteries, we got a good look around (in particular at the Veil of Death chamber) before the fight kicked off.

** One thing I'd recommend is to look at someone who wrote a fight scene that you enjoyed, and try to break down how it happened more mechanically. Where the focus is, how the description happens, etc.

Mechanically, one tool that I find very useful in those is sentence length. The shorter, more to the point a sentence is, the more tense and action packed it'll make the reader feel. So playing around with those as a way to show when the duel/fight is growing tense, and when they get a chance to breathe, certainly can help.

As a few examples of fics that 'did it right', here's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8yu1so/fics_centered_around_duelling/e2e2zkn/][one from newcomb]] that Taure copied into reddit, and that does an excellent job of showing a duel. The fight scenes in the Denarian Renegade series were always pretty great in my opinion, though they obviously draw from some of the non-Harry Potter aspects (since it's a crossover). There's also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/78mhz3/brandon_sanderson_lecture_three_rules_for_fight/][this lecture]] by Brandon Sanderson on fight scenes that may be of interest - he does an excellent job with them in his books.

Particularly for you, one way to show the difference between experience and lack of it might be in the repertoire of spells used, and more of the tactics.

** Firstly, you need to look at what makes action scenes in books / cinema / comics engaging:

1. The stakes: Everyone needs a horse in the race for an action scene to be engaging. Why are people fighting? What do they have to lose? If your stakes are clear, it's not just gratuitous action, it matters to the story. Make the consequences of /losing/ clear and "action" becomes much more interesting.
2. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8czFGUedDJU&t=241s][Geography]]: You need to know where the actors are in relation to their environment. This is part of setting up the stakes. A duel with students surrounding? A battle on the Hogwarts grounds? A fight in the Forbidden Forest? Set up the geography so we know what options the characters have and what the scene looks like. We need to know what tools these characters have at their disposal, and you can surprise us, but surprises need to be telegraphed.
3. Ask yourself how this advances plot, character, or setting (or preferably all 3). New spells are interesting, new revelations about magic, a revelation about a character in the heat of battle, or raising the stakes are key to an interesting fight scene.

** Try to get inside your POV character's head. Always ask yourself: What do they see? People dodging explosions and curses generally won't be able to focus on the "big picture", even if they were able to see it in the fog of war. Tunnel vision is a thing. Apart from the likes of Dumbledore and Voldemort, few wizards and witches will be able to fight and direct a battle at the same time. In the same vein, people without extensive experienec and talent will stick to a few spells and tactics - things they have drilled and trained until they can do it half-asleep.

Don't write a duels unless it's a duel. In a fight, people, especially trained combattants, gang up on others. Fights, especially in close quarters, are chaotic and confusing - and bloody.

Keep in mind that hitting a moving target, even a man-sized one, is hard. Doubly so with a wand instead of a proper sighted gun. Even Voldemort missed Harry when the later dived behind a gravestone.

Don't get lost in detail. Someone scrambling behind cover won't notice the intricate pattern of the bricks in the wall, or the lone flower pot on the other side of the room. If they do, it's usually because they're in shock, or otherwise "taken out" of the combat. Few people manage to fight and talk, or even plan, at the same time. If you need your character to notice something, give them a breather - have them be behidn cover, looking around for the next target or way to advance, then have them notice something. Don't have them notice a detail behidn them while they are trading spells with the enemy.

Keep tactics and morale in mind. Few people fight to the death if they can retreat instead. That means a side trying to kill someone will cast Anti-Apparition Jinxes all over the place. Initiative matters - if you surprise the enemy, you're at a great advantage.

Keep it simple. A Three-spell combo might look impressive, but if you need to hit the same enemy three times with a spell to take them out, it's rubbish since there are lots of spells who do that with a single hit. If you use combos, use them in a way that doesn't make the reader ask "why didn't he just use... instead?"

And, finally, don't overdo it. Fights don't last hours. Keep it simple, keep it short. Sooner rather than later, a fight will be decided, and the losing side will either break and run, retreat or attempt to retreat in an orderly fashion, or surrender. In rare cases, they'll fight to the death or capture, but either way, don't dwell on that.

** I think when it comes to actual words, rather than fight structure, the best fight scenes rely on a balance of three types of spell descriptions.

One is the actual incantations. "'Bomarda!' shouted Harry as he aimed his wand over the cluster of rubble."

The other is spell names. "Harry cast a blasting hex from behind the rubble"

The last is effect description. "Harry didn't look to see if his spell hit, but the fleks of shrapnel that flew over his cover meant that he had gotten the pillar they were hiding behind:

A good balance between all three keeps the reading interesting just as much as variable sentence length does for writing in general.
