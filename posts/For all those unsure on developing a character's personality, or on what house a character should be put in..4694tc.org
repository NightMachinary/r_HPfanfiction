** I personally got 52% on all of them bar Slytherin, which was 50%. It gave me some generic traits to give Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs in my characterizations, as there was little fleshing out of characters in the books; it was more about the world and story. This quiz is more thorough and less straightforward than Pottermore's, and allows you to think "how does this apply to this character?" It transformed one character in particular from an uncharacterized mess to someone with a personality.

** Took yhe test for myself and somehow I got Hufflepuff.

Am definitely not a Hufflepuff (no offense to those who are. I'm more introverted and my Gryffinclaw status from other tests makes a lot more sense).

*** Really? If I heard someone describe themselves as introverted I'd consider them either Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw.

**** Why? Hufflepuff is the people/friends house. I consider Raven claws to be introverts, and Gryffindor / Slytherin to be either. I wouldn't call Harry an extrovert. Or Hermione.

** This quiz seemed excessively long and asked the same question multiple times with only slight changes to the wording. Some of the questions also read like horoscope answers (so generic they are basically asking if you are human or not).

Have you ever actually been psychologically evaluated? That is standard practice.

***** I said nothing about medical diagnoses.

It is, quite obviously, a psych eval. Or what else would you call a test that attempts to judge your personality and put you in a [mental] category?

** Slytherin for me, same as Pottermore.

51% Ravenclaw, 38% Hufflepuff, 63% Slytherin and 48% Gryffindor! Interestingly, my 63% on Slytherin is "higher than 97% of your peers."

Also that website was really annoying.

** +FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF! The test broke on me on the last webpage.+

For a test that doesn't let you ignore some questions (giving it 0 score), it had too many that were either seemingly irrelevant in regards to HP House assignment (5; 21; 23; 24; 31; 55; 69 - WTF; 105) or simply poorly worded (e.g. #82 --- “hate” is a strong word). In the latter group there was also a large subcategory of questions that could've belonged to a fortune-teller's repertoire --- that is, they were too vague and would be true for pretty much anybody\no-one (12; 50; 70 --- yes, I'm not a spoon, hooray; 74; 91; 109)

Generally, it felt like they took the personality types discussed in their introductory psychology class and tried associating them with Hogwarts House descriptions, also sprinkling some headcanon into the mix.
