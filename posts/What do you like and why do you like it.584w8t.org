For those out there who tend to gravitate towards a specific genre of HP fanfiction, I was wondering *what do you like and why it is you prefer that genre?*

I like "after the battle" fics and Harry/Ginny stories, which generally overlap with each other.

I always believed there was way more story to tell after the final battle and was not satisfied we jumped straight to 19 years later. So I naturally found myself reading fics set after that time period.

I also really enjoyed the Harry/Ginny relationship since I could directly relate to it at the time. But I felt that Rowling didn't do the relationship justice (which I can't fault her for not focusing on it). There was a way better story out there involving how these two would interact, so I gravitated towards stories that had them either getting together or already together living their lives, particularly from Ginny's POV.


** I like canon-tone stories that tell an alternative X year of Harry's 7 years at Hogwarts, especially ones that focus on a year-specific mystery adventure plot rather than the war/Voldemort (though it's fine, good even, if that year-specific plot has a connection to Voldemort).

I also like stories that develop Harry as a talented wizard without making him super, by playing to his canonical strengths.

Basically PoA. Lots of cool Hogwarts stuff, an engaging mystery that is connected to Voldemort but doesn't directly involve him as the antagonist, and Harry advancing in magic in believable but impressive ways.

Why do I like these?

- PoA was by far my favourite HP book.

- It's a refreshing change from most fanfiction which goes very AU either in characterisation or world. You'd think there would be an abundance of fanfiction out there where main characters like Ron and Hermione are as they are in canon, with original takes on the characters in the minority. But no - it's a rare pleasure to find a version of Ron and Hermione who are as they are in the books.

- I love the HP canonical magic system and find that most authors who try to create original magical systems do worse than canon.

- I think constrained originality has a certain elegance to it that unfettered originality lacks. Anyone can be original by coming up with new ideas and shoe-horning them into HP. It takes a lot more thought to come up with original ideas that fit seamlessly into the canonical HP world.

- It corrects my only real disappointment with canon, which is that Harry was unnecessarily unremarkable. If he had continued making advances like he had done in PoA through the remainder of the series he would have finished the books as an impressive wizard, but still not one who was able to take Voldemort on by strength alone.

** I like canon-compliant fics.

I like the canon pairings. I feel like the main ones all make a lot more sense than the ones the fandom comes up with.

I absolutely cannot stand bashing, of any kind. I like when Dumbledore is a wise, caring, powerful, and yes, flawed, man, but ultimately is a champion of good. I like when Ron is a good friend who will put his life in harm's way for Harry and Hermione without a second thought, even if he does get jealous sometimes. I like when Ginny is confident, crafty, and determined, even if she's too quick to anger and resort to violence. I like when Molly Weasley is a ridiculously loving and caring figure who welcomes Harry into her home without a second thought, and treats him basically like another of her own children, even if she's overbearing and overprotective at times. I really don't even understand the thought process behind the love potion ideas for those last two.

In short, I like canon-compliant fics because the canon characters are incredibly complex, but good people, who I can easily empathize with and care about. They feel like real people, which, IMO, generally makes for much better stories.

Edit: I'm also a big fan of romance.

** I tend to gravitate toward mystery fics similar in tone to the first couple of books in the series, purely because I feel like they capture the spirit of HP more elegantly than others.

A lot of fics treat HP as a fantasy foremost, which is why there's such an emphasis on trying to create or logic out a functional magic system from canon, the reliance on fantasy tropes (like the main character being a scion of noble birth, i.e. "Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Whatever"), and the focus on worldbuilding over Harry's relationships. These can be great, but they're all sort of missing the point, imo.

At it's core, HP is closer to detective fiction than fantasy, because while it takes place at a magic school where everyone is capable of fantastical miracles, it's all flavour: the chief plot in practically every book in the series is a central mystery that evokes and mimics crime fiction, the characters are more important than this great big fantasy world, and Harry's miniature world-weary snark knight personality is probably what every film-noir protagonist was like as a bratty teenager. Because of this, it comes as little surprise that Jo's next series is outright [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormoran_Strike][crime fiction]], and not a more concerted fantasy effort.

Mysteries, therefore, tend to be my favourite fics. Because when they're done well, even if they're the most AU fic imaginable, they have something in spirit that connects them closer to canon than the most meticulously canon-compliant romance fic.

*** While I personally don't gravitate towards mystery, I think you are exactly right about what HP at its core was closer to. I find myself having a tough time reading fics that make the series more of a fantasy novel than it actual is. It takes me away from the original text a bit too much. But again this is a personal preference and I get why others might really like stories that are more fantasy-oriented.

** I don't think you've actually listed genres, but instead themes. Themes I like are

- Romances between Harry and Daphne, because the Griffindor-Slytherin rivalry makes for interesting courtship or development.
- A competent Voldermort, because a villain doesn't get infamous being dumber than a 15 year old.
- A Dumbledore that is not so invested in only Harry, Harry, Harry. Sooo many people write a Dumbledore that is obsessed with training Harry, making Harry miserable, or screwing Harry (ew). In my head canon (heck, even in the actual canon), Dumbledore is more worried about fixing things himself than getting Harry to do things for him.
- A more independent Ron. I don't think Rowling has any clue what being in a large family I like. I'm the oldest child in a family twice the size of the Wesealys. My youngest brother learned from me and the other older siblings, and is very independent and far more advanced in his thinking than his peers. It's a natural result of being around older siblings all the time. Ron should have been far more mature than he is written, because in a poor family he certainly wasn't babied like a more wealthy family might do.
- Hermione as a bookish character and good friend of Harry's, and not necessarily a beauty. I shudder whenever I read romances between Harry and Hermione. It's like reading an incest fic.

** I usually prefer non-romance centric stories.

My favorite genre perhaps time travel where Harry physically travels, not his memory/conscious/soul sends to younger body. I can't imagine someone with 30-40 years old mentally dating with a 15-16 year old or going through another 7 years with children.

Time/Dimension travel story where older Harry raises himself is perhaps my most favorite cliche. I also like MOD cliches. I like post-war canon divergence.

I like Marauder era stories. And I would love to read stories which happened in 60s. Unfortunately I never found a good one. I've been planning to write a 60s era story where Harry accidentally ended up.

I like stories with magical exploration, magical theory & logically written.

I usually prefer individualist Harry character or teaming with characters other than Hermione & Ron. Because I already have read that in canon. I have already built an image on them which I don't want to overwrite. And I have no wish for more canon rehearsals.

If romance, I prefer Harry/OC. JKR's portrayal to each character has already sketched an image for each of them. Unfortunately I don't find any of them to suitable match for Harry. Ginny's growth Mary-Sue esk. Hermione is more suitable for Ron. The only other female JKR romantically involved with Harry - Cho is undeveloped character. Luna's character is as such as not for romance material. So I tends to avoid Harry/Ginny(/Hermione) pairing & prefer to read Harry/OC in case for romance. And I consider canon characters Daphne, Susan etc mostly OC.

I usually don't read canon continuum. Because I already have built an image about how events happened in next 19 years. I don't to rebuild or ruin it.

I despise Dumbledore/James/Sirius bashing. Because I have too much respect to these characters. Snape is a curious case. I rather like canon-esk Snape or Alan Rickman's Snape. I don't like Ron's character in canon but I despise Weasley bashing too. I also tends to avoid slash. And I avoid any Hermione-Draco/Snape pairing even if its well written. How much he redeemed/redefined, I can't imagine a world where Draco can be in relationship with a muggle, especially given his childhood.

Edit: at the end, I think I ended up reading many of the previously avoided stories because I was lacking new stories of my preferences. This causes many changes in my preferences over the years. For example, 2-3 years ago, I was OK with Ron bashing but now I despise it. I somewhat liked lord craps but now I totally avoid it. I once prefer Mentor Snape but now I tends to avoid it.

** As a general rule, I tend to enjoy action/mistery fics that stray from canon, although my reason isn't the most elegant. I just get bored of reading similar scenarios play out over and over again, and to see something out of the ordinary--even if it means a tonal shift from canon HP--is always welcome.

I also give extra props to fics that play this out over time, so that instead of the fic being either canon or AU, it can be more like a dimmer switch that gradually diverges further and further as it progresses. Along the way you can introduce new characters, locations, spells & systems of magic etc. Good times.

** I read everything well-written where the characters are reasonably in character. I particularly enjoy:

- Post-Hogwarts fics that have a bit of originality to them. An antagonist who isn't related to Voldemort is rather refreshing. Ex: The Song of the Trees

- Adventure fics that have someone other than Harry as the protagonist. See: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2056512/1/Invisible-Circus][Invisible Circus]]

- A genuine redemption fic. Not like most Dramione and Drarry fics that "redeem" Draco, while in reality they just whitewash him and/or fit him in leather pants. Genuine ones, which acknowledge mistakes fully and have the character work hard to acheive redemption, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10202355/1/The-Malfoy-Case][The Malfoy Case]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]].

- Family fics, mainly with canon pairings. Well-written domestic fics - with kids and all - appeal to me. See: Strangers at Drakeshaugh, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4232042/1/The-Tales-of-Weasley-the-Father][The Tales of Weasley the Father]], Turn (to an extent)

- Large scale AUs like Prince of the Dark Kingdom and Harry Potter and the Greater Good.

- Dumbledore. You can fit him in so many different kinds of fics: he can be the eccentric grandfather in family fics, the one who gives out mysterious and whimsy dating advice in romance fics, the deeply flawed leader in war fics. Fics that explore Dumbledore and Grindelwald's history in greater detail are a particular favorite.

- Character pieces that go into detail about a particular character's mindset and feature character development. See: The Changeling, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10091292/1/Under-Pressure][Under Pressure]]

- Unusual settings and professions. See: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260][Curse Breaker: The Maya]], A Long Journey Home.

- Fics written in third person present tense. Yep. Sue me.

Dislikes: Character bashing, Heavy handed characterisations, Typical hate-to-love relationships, Close adherence to traditional gender roles. And probably a hundred more.

** I like snape/Hermione fics. They have to be long and angsty and intense. I usually go for Hermione meeting him after the war and falling in love or time Turner fics but I like basically anything of the pair (minus underage hermione. Because ew) there has to be a lot of drama (because, well, snape) and a lot of issues to work through before that happy ending. And snape has to stay true to his character (which makes finding those fics hard)

I like these pairings because snape is probably my favorite character from the book, I always thought there was so much more to him and I think that intellectually hermione would be a good match for him.

So I usually like genderswapped male characters (fem!Harry's are easiest to find), expanded roles for non!Hermione female characters, and female OC characters.

(1) On a side note, it is disgraceful that Fleur was the only female champion and was always the one taken out first. I could forgive her canon weaknesses in the second and third task if her Veela FIRE AND FLIGHT MAGICAL CREATURE HERITAGE explicitly gave her an advantage against the fucking (FLYING FLAMING MAGICAL CREATURE) DRAGON instead of just giving her the worthless superpower of BEAUTY but JKR clearly hadn't yet been given the 'your series is fucking sexist, get it together and stop acting like your self-insert character Hermione is the only female character who can transcend sexist stereotypes' talk before writing GOF.
