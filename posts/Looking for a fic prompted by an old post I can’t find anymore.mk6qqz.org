:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been trying to find this fic for so long and nothing I google turns anything up, it's driving me crazy so I'm hoping someone can help. It's based off an old tumblr post I believe, and it starts in the summer before Harry's second year when he ends up in knockturn alley because of the floo incident. When he's hiding in the cabinet, he hears Lucius yell at draco and realizes that's not how a loving family acts, and that draco is being abused, so he bursts out of the cabinet and grabs draco, pulling him towards diagon alley. Lucius chases them and throws killing curses at them, resulting in him being arrested and draco and Harry going back with the weasleys. I can't remember much of the rest except that draco is now friends with the whole trio, and stops acting so much like Lucius because previously that had been his only model for proper behavior, but that's how it starts.

Here's some extra info, however I'm not sure if this is the same fic or a different one. But Narcissa is good, and explains that draco has sensory issues and went nonverbal once as a little kid because of something Lucius did, so he knows sign language if he goes nonverbal again. She also handed off a specific muggle brand of purple shampoo, saying it's the only thing that doesn't aggravate dracos sensory issues, but that both he and Lucius believes it's a hard to get magical brand. The implications being draco is autistic or on the spectrum at least a little bit. If anyone knows what fic I'm talking about I'd be super grateful (and if it's more than one fic, info on either one would be appreciated)


** Ugh, I read the story described in the first paragraph within the last month, but now I cannot for the life of me find or remember it. If I do I'll come back and post here!

**** And the thing is, I'm fairly confident I originally got the link to that story from a post on this sub, though searching isn't bringing anything up. So maybe someone will pop up who can identify it.

**** That is it! Why was it so hard to find?! I remember now - I read the first 2 or 3 in the series and then stopped, bc I got bored with what seemed like a rehash of canon but with different characters, so I didn't bookmark or save it. But now I kind of feel like maybe giving it another chance!
