Some users have contacted me asking why the bot is taking so long to reply.

FFnet ratcheted up the anti-bot protections on their website again. I had to switch to a bypass mechanism that is significantly more complex and intensive than the previous one, so it may take a few minutes for the bot to reply.


** Thanks for keeping that up!

**** Not all. The bot has to be deployed somewhere. It's simple enough for them to create some type of token to include in the request. That token is then only specified in an environment variable stored on the server the bot runs on, and the code includes loading the variable and inserting the token into the request. Then the site checks to see if the token is included and matches what they provided. If either of those conditions is false, it's a random bot they can ignore; but if they're both true, it's authorized and can proceed.

**** Uh, no. I don't believe it is? Was at one point I think.

Iirc Tusing got a job that doesn't allow him to have open source side projects, or something like that.

****** Yeah, there's two versions. The one that actually runs is closed source, and any changes Tusing makes to it go directly there. The open source version is so the community can help him with bug fixing.

I'll link the thread where he talks about it in a minute.

** Huh. And I suppose FFN's staff would be disinclined to provide a key to circumvent the protections(especially since the bot's open source).

But then I don't really expect the staff to do anything beyond maintaining the site, most of the time. They never seem to respond to messages or reports. I've reported violations of the rules on the site literally YEARS ago, and still haven't received any response.
