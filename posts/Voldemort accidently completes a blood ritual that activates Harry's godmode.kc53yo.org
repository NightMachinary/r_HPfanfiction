So we all now because of the 'Power of love' that Harry killed Voldie the first time right? What if instead Lily and James had the foresight to start a blood ritual that upon their deaths will give Harry like, ULTIMATE POWER- or something of that nature. Not in a serious way, but like the most insane/impossible things happen around him, more than usual. Examples:

Harry being delivered to the Dursleys goes horribly wrong and he somehow ends up in America (Hagrids not good with directions)

At 3, Harry Potter somehow aquires a Phoenix and gets Sirius out of jail.

At 5, Harry meets Nicholas Flamel on a vacation to magical Britain and is given the philsophers stone to add to his rock collection.

At 9, Harry somehow get his hands on Tom Riddle's Diary and destroys it with a bout of accidental magic.

Hogwarts isn't ready for him.


** That would be a great crack fic

*** But if done the right way it could be a really great read!

Just look at linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot)

it goes in a similar direction even if it starts after OOTP instead of after 1981 but the general premise is sort of similar

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
