--------------

Really great read, interesting magical concepts and new ideas. /Extremely/ slow /time-wise/, but the story doesn't feel like it's dragging. I was surprised, upon reaching the end of the ~200,000 word story, that they weren't even a month into first year.

Unfortunately, the story seems to have been abandoned. It's a bit earlier to call that than I normally would, but the entire 200,000 thousand words were written in the space of 3 months and then the author stopped writing, and it's been nearly a year now.

Speaking of which - anyone happen to know what happened to the guy? He's only written the one story and has nothing in the way of a biography to explain his sudden absence. =/


** Looks good! I'll give it a read!

** I... thank you ever so much for recommending this. I'm only halfway through the first chapter and this.

Is.

*/GREAT./*

It's got exactly the same whimsical, immensely engaging tone as /Philosopher's Stone/, while doing its own thing at the same time. I love that paragraph about Goblins and inflation.

Thank you so much.

*** I KNOW RIGHT?!

Just a reminder that it /appears/ abandoned, though. It's really disappointing and the cut-off point is... well, it's not a cliffhanger, but it's at a really unfortunate spot.

**** Sorry to post on something so old, but I also just found this story and I absolutely love it. Are there any other stories which are similar that you've read?

I'm always looking for a good rec.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.
