  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, & Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Eventual Dark Harry/OC

** Grow Young With Me: linkffn(11111990)

The premise of this fic is that Ginny died sometime after Lily Luna was born, in a Quidditch match or training gone wrong (I don't remember exactly, if they explained it I must have skimmed over it).

Harry gets depressed, starts visiting a Muggle coffeeshop often to just get away from the Wizarding World. One of the waitresses takes an interest. Slow-burn.

EDIT: Got corrected on something - the fic does mention the exact circumstances of Ginny's death.

I don't think this is correct. Harpies were forced to use brand new untested brooms (some kind of promotion thing), and Ginny lost control over it and crashed head-first to the goal-post. Crashed skull and brain split is something even magical healers cannot fix.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** The only other Female Muggle OC fic I know is Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss. A sister (I think?) of Piers Polkiss gets mildly obsessed with Harry.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss]]

linkffn(5244417)

There are two Magical Female OC's that I know as well.

Madley in Love is the story of a tax woman meeting post-war Hermit Harry and getting to know him.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12696674/1/]]

linkffn(12696674)

Black Bond is the other, though I haven't yet read that because it's over a million words long and I haven't had the mindset/time to obsess over a fic for a full week. The female OC is a daughter of Sirius, IIRC.

Linkffn(harry potter and the elementals' power) it's bloody amazing and long too! The pairing starts later in the fic though but it has smut scenes which in my opinion is a good thing
