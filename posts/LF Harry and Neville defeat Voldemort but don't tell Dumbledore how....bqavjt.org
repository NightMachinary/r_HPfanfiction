All I remember is that Dumbledore keeps trying ridiculous ways to find out how they did it and they tell him lie after lie. Then it's revealed they transformed him into a snake and left him in the zoo...

#+begin_quote
  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.
