I remember a fic where on the train home hermione checks harry for curses with a new spell she found, and removes and unknown one, when harry gets home the dursleys then become nice to him. A dumbledore bashing fic if i remember correctly.

The second i remember to be novellenght, where harry enters the hospital wing under his invisibility cloak and overhears his friend betray him. Im prwtty sure its just after sirius death


** I think it was The Heir of the Founders. It's mentioned by Hermione in a letter to harry in the first chapter. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3326638/1/The-Heir-of-the-Founders]]

** A quick search in google led me to this one. No invisibility cloak, though.

  Revised version of my story. Post OOTP. Harry says he's had enough and escapes his betrayers. But his troubles are not over, as new information comes to light. Complete.

**** I've been trying to narrow this one down. He overhears them in the hospital wing doesn't he? Definitely got Hermione, Ron and Ginny saying they can't be friends any more. Not sure about Neville and Luna.

Was it a Daphne Greengrass fic? My gut feeling says it was but I can't find it among them.
