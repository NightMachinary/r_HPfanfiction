ie: Magical beings look different, breed differently, racial/gender dynamics are different... they are not just regular people who can make a pineapple dance.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

**** I'm working on something like this, but it's a crossover with another fandom and a bunch of really niche things that people probably won't be interested in.

I still want to do it, but I'm going to finish writing the story first before posting it.

******** Yeah 4kids was the best! I plan to cover the seasons 1-4 and the first movie folded in after Book 4. I have the plot mostly nailed down (gotta figure out how to end everything, my last firm plot point is that after an alien invasion, the Winx Club Universe and Muggles have been revealed to be working together for years and the Wizarding World was locked out of the loop, but that's another story) but I don't want to skimp on character development, especially with OCs in the mix.

*** That's because it's the structure of society that is the true antagonist of the series.

At first glance Tom appears to be fighting that system much like our perspective character Harry who is ostensibly the hero of the story.

But by the third book it's quite clear that Tom is only interested in his own aggrandizement and the subjugation of witches due to his pathological hatred of them.

The covens even admit to using the fear of dark Lords to maintain their stranglehold on power. Ultimately making Tom just another tool of oppression.
