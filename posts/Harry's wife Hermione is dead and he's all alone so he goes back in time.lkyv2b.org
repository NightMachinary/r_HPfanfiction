But he accidentally travels all the way back to his first year and Hermione's grown up mind is inside a Pheonix which he then transfers into her 11 year old body. They can overrule any house point deductions because they are "the rightful heir to each house".

Harry and Hermione also don't like Dumbledore (because he would put them in danger all the time) or Ron (because Ron ran away at one of the battles I think?).
