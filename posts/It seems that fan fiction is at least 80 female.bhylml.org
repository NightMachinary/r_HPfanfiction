This post is part of the AO3 census data analysis: [[https://centrumlumina.tumblr.com/post/62816996032/gender]]


** ...on AO3.

I doubt that percentage would hold on FFN, especially across all fandoms. AO3 is at its core a (very well supported and viewed) niche site.

I also think that if you polled SB or SV, their number would skew 80% male.

In short - confirmation bias exists, as does sample bias.

Edit: the fandoms thing. I am willing to bet 95% of Twilight ff is fem authored and read. I also bet that 90% of Worm fanfic is male authored (especially since Ack writes 2/3rds of it it seems), but read fairly evenly. It varies greatly, so much so that it would regress to the mean across all fandoms.

**** Well, that's from 2010. FF.net seems to have gotten a lot more male biased since - mostly for negative reasons, in that they seem to enforce their rules about explicit content much more harshly on non-hetero content (to the extent that I've seen some accuse the site of being homophobic). I think this is part of why I've read some people say FF.net is dying compared to Ao3, aside from the anime portion - which is the most male dominated, I suspect.

Sort HP by kudos on AO3 and it's almost entirely slash, sort by faves on FF.net and basically none is.

*** Not confirmation bias. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostFanficWritersAreGirls][Fanfiction is overwhelmingly female, and has been from basically the beginning.]] There's debate as to /why/ this is, but I'm betting that it's simply a matter of reading being easily accessible for women in the past. (And that the present state is just a continuation of those conditions.)

Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity are the big exceptions, but even if they're big as forums, they're small as fanfiction hubs. At the very least, it shows that 99% of fanfiction is gross and ineffectual regardless of the author's gender.

I don't understand this statement. Are you saying that reading was more accessible for women than it was for men? Are you saying that reading was more accessible to women in comparison to <insert other media type here>? How long ago is this "past" to which you refer?

***** Past referring to early fan-magazines, so late sixties to early seventies. "Easy" to get into, as in, unlike a whole bunch of other intellectually demanding hobbies, being a bookworm was more culturally accepted for women at the time. Not necessarily that it was easier for them than men, just that fanfiction might have presented an outlet for them to express themselves that didn't expose them to the scrutiny of professional authorship (which probably had an even worse bias against women than it does today).

***** I think that before, sciences books are for guy while reading romance novels and sewing were acceptable past time. Thus fiction geared towards women is more accessible that was until sci-fi and horror stories were made.

Another, when porn became popular in the internet, written fiction about vampire, werewolf, or doctor smut became popular for food around the same time.I'm not sure if you've read fem romance book but sometimes it's worse than most smut fic I've read.

So you can say that written mediums has more appeal to women to some degree. Gravitating towards fanfiction is normal. That's not even mentioning yaoi fan girls and the the tendency to ship people.

******* A lot of them do, but there are benefits to posting in a forum. The commenting system they use makes conversation a bit onesided, especially considering anonymous reviews. Also, it's very easy to be overlooked on FF at least. Add to that, Worm isn't the most popular fandom, so the fact that most congregate on these two sites is kind of handy.

** In my experience there aren't really any generalisations that hold about fanfiction in general, nor is there any real sense in which the "fanfiction world" is a single community. E.g. the Twilight fandom and the Star Wars fandom have about zero overlap.

So in so far as this community goes, I'd always trust a HP fanfiction specific survey over "general fanfiction" surveys.

** More of the population are women than men tend to assume or estimate**.

From how women are portrayed in media and shunted into neat boxes of specific interests, you'd be forgiven for thinking as an unknowing observer something like 25% of people are female.

Fact is fanfic (and lit crit, literary engagement with texts) has for a long time been a female dominated space, and there's nothing wrong with that, nor is there anything wrong with /being/ a male in that kind of space. If anything it's refreshing imo.

**** Wtf? As a male reader who has been in the fanfiction community for close to a decade and spoke to many writers, many of the slash fics are steamed from a girl who find the idea of the X couple of two attractive guys "cute" or "hot". I personally don't find it so, am I a homophone? nope. Do i feel pressured by the society nor to write or read about "fags"? Hell no. I just don't have any interest in it unlike many girls out there who have displayed such interest weather its guys from a boy band, guys from their fav series, movies etc..
