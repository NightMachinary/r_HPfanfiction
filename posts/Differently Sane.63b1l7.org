More than one story has tried to paint a picture of an 'insane' Harry, but most get *crazy* mixed up with /douchebag/. When I say 'insane' I mean something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of being Sysiphus]]. Fem!Harry (Lily) isn't 'crazy' or any such blather; rather she sees the world without any of those silly filters the normal people use. What sort of family keeps a child in a cupboard under the stairs? None of them, that's the /servants quarters/, obviously, so, logically, Lily is the Dursley's /servant/. Whenever she gets stuffed in the cupboard without food, she is being docked wages. After all, normal people wouldn't treat family like that, so if she is being treated in such a way, she must not be family.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4669348/1/Accidental-Hero-aka-The-Absentminded-Ravenclaw][Accidental Hero]] is basically Harry if he was born a Lovegood. He gets into quite a bit of trouble simply by virtue of being a little bit confused by all this 'magic' business going on. And why shouldn't the snake want pink polka-dots?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11826429/1/Worthy-of-Magic][Worthy of Magic]] edges pretty... edgy, but the author does a decent job of showing off an essentially feral!Harry who is genuinely /un-sane/, rather than merely 'dark'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is very cracky, but is also pretty good at portraying a main character who is simply incapable of thinking along the same lines as normal people.

Too many fics don't quite get what it means to be crazy, what it means to find the actions of normal people, not 'beneath you' or 'pathetic' or 'weak', but fundamentally incomprehensible. I think a line which best sums this idea up for me actually comes from another fandom entirely, but neatly encapsulates what it would mean to be a /genuine/ sociopath, which is one of the many delightful forms of crazy.

"Of course he knew what 'Die' meant, it meant the opposite of 'Kill'."

Give me Harry's that don't quite /get/ this whole 'no eating live food' thing people keep going on about. Give me Hermione's that wonder how brains work, and don't care to slow down to find out. Give me Luna's that /really/ believe in Crumpled-horned Snorkaks /which do not exist/.


** linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them by evansentranced) is a classic "differently sane"!Harry. Harry is an elf. No, not a house elf; he's a forest elf.

linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning by Lomonaaeren) has Harry and Neville swapping places (Neville's the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry's parents are in St. Mungo's). Harry quickly becomes consumed with finding a cure for his parent's condition through transfiguration, and [[/s][transfigures himself to the point where he's no longer fully human]].

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

I'm not sure why but this kind of reminded me of what you're talking about. It's not really a person who's truly insane, or a sociopath but it's someone who is differently sane by being so paranoid. The writing isn't the greatest but it's been updating consistently and there's something about it that feel unique. Unlikely so many Groundhog Day FICS the character doesn't know if it'll end and he has to die to repeat it.

*** Holy shit. This is my new favorite fic. I'm on the first attack in second year and I'm loving everything about it.

Edit: Darnit. I was thinking it would play up the horror aspect more. No longer my favorite fic. Good read, but not amazing.

**** Yeah, but it's surprisingly for a fic that's updated almost daily, and one that make Harry overpowered. I can see it getting played out, but still enjoy it.

*** Hmm...up to chapter 11 and I'm curious; is there actually a rule that the Gryffindor Quidditch Team has to recruit from their own house?

It'd be funny if someone discovered that that rule wasn't actually present, just a rule about it being students only. You could write a story about Harry being headhunted to be Seeker in every Quidditch match, regardless of team.

For fairness's sake, though, he'd probably play once each on each non-Gryffindor team during the year...

** I think that you mean dillusional and not insane. I may be wrong because I'm neither fluent in English or a psychologist. But Lily in Lily and AobS has schizophr√©nia. Trouble to read reality. On the other side, you have insanity like Bellatrix. Pure insanity with an absence of all morals. Which could be normal for Harry. You don't learn moral in a cupboard.

*** Insanity does not mean you cannot have morals. Loss of morals (or as in the case of Bellatrix, empathy) is generally considered to be a form of sociopathy or psychopathy. This is a form of mental illness, but most people with sociopathic tendencies don't engage in aberrant behavior, they don't become serial killers. Experiencing delusions/hallucinations or engaging in delusional behavior are also forms of insanity, but the key feature for most diagnosis of mental illness revolve around how you, the sufferer, respond to it. You might have something like synesthesia, which is comparable to mild-to-severe hallucinations, but since it doesn't come with aberrant behavior we would not call you 'insane', merely neuro-atypical.

I'm looking for stories where the mental state of the point-of-view character is severely abnormal, atypical, or otherwise unusual, and this mental state affects their behavior.

I don't think Lily would actually count as Schizophrenic, in a technical sense, even though she might get diagnosed that way, because she is actually responding to a truer version of reality than normal people. At any rate, Schizophrenia is a form of insanity.
