** Here you go. Harry's raised by the house elves and Peter's ghost, iirc.

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU

**** It's been a while, but... Little Harry transforms into a raven with accidental magic, and ends up with the ravens kept in the Tower of London, being raised by the ghosts of various notables who were executed there. He does eventually stop being a raven, and goes to Hogwarts iirc. It's a little dated now as it's very much an indy Harry, muggle armed forces fic, but it's still quite fun.

***** Thanks! I don't mind these things as long as Dumbledore is not evil and the Weasleys are not bashed. /Are/ they though?

****** Not as far as I recall. I think Dumbledore is a bit out of touch with reality, but not actually incompetent or evil. I must admit it's been a few years since I read the fic. It definitely has the ghosts you wanted, and I think there's some sub-plot with the Morrigan.
