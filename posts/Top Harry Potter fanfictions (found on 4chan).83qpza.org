** Hey, I remember that. And upon looking, it's [[/u/Lane_Anasazi][u/Lane_Anasazi]]'s list. It's on the sidebar thread for recs.

Still, thanks for reminding me of this one. There's a couple I want to read again.

(But really, no seventh horcrux?)

**** Oh no problem. With how many people who wouldn't have seen it, it'll be helpful anyway.

** I can't take anything seriously that rates Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.

*** i thought it was decent up until i read more seventh year fics

and then i actually read the sequels to DAYoD

what the fuck happened in that second one and why

i think people only really consider it good if they've never read much fanfic and like gore and edginess

** I haven't read any of these stories in their entireties and quite honestly, only Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them sounds remotely interesting. I read part of Knowledge is Power then dropped it halfway through. The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks I found incredibly boring. And this is after I heard great things from it. Again, dropped halfway through. Applied Cultural Anthropology started off amazing then fell off a cliff for me. I stopped at three-quarters the way through. I don't know. I guess my tastes as very singular and extremely particular. On a last thought, I'm surprised you didn't add Seventh Horcrux (or maybe I missed it?). It often gets recommended/mentioned on every discussion and such on this subreddit. Again, I've no idea why as, in my opinion, it's not very good, but many people think so.
