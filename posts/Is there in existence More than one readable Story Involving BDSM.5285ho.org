I thought that it is not possible but I encountered [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11647542/1/Safe-Word-is-Devil-s-Snare]] that to my surprise turned out to be readable. Is there anything more?

Complete OOC*, rape apology, statutory rape apology, student/teacher, "rape is love", "slavery is OK", "temporary hiatus" lasting decade are indicating that story is poor.

*Draco/Hermione and similar without massive amount of character development are OOC. And believable Draco/Hermione without replacing at least one of them by OC at start would be one of the best stories in fandom.


** In short, no.

** The [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/100820][It Started in the Shower series]] might be what you are looking for. IIRC starts during the beginning of the horcrux hunt 7th year and has a pretty fucked up BDSM Dom!Harry and Sub!Draco relationship because of a potion that reacts negatively with Harry being a Horcrux. But they slowly actually fall for eachother outside of the spell but Draco is forced to live in the RoR at hogwarts while Harry looks for the rest of the Horcruxes. And not to spoil too much, but at the end once they have the spell gone, they are able to have a healthy (not too OOC) BDSM relationship like youre looking for. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/series/100820]])

Another Drarry that miight fit the bill is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/388303][The Ties That Bind Us]] which might be my all time favorite Drarry PWP. It is not exactly BDSM, but what drives the plot is that Draco and Harry are literally tied up. linkao3(388303).

And lastly, a great newly written BDSM Drarry is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6668308][Higher and Higher]] is an Auror fic where Harry "accidentally" puts on a collar that gives him pleasure when he follows Draco's orders. linkao3(6668308)

  DomSeverus/SubHarry. Harry's been missing since he was 9 years old the wizarding world have been looking him for seven years to no avail. He's Seventeen when they find him, but they were in for a shock if they thought he'd do what they wanted. Turns out Harry has known Severus for years, he's a metamorphamagus. Dumbledore's manipulations are found out, the world is in for a shock.

** There's [[http://ficwad.com/story/105633][A Different Way of Looking At Things]] by radiofishlip which explores BDSM with magic added in, as written by someone quite informed about the real BDSM lifestyle... or at least I assume, since it tracks with what I've read elsewhere about it.

** By the way, if you like reading about the rougher side of sex, I suggest you to read the Kushiel trilogies (there are 2 of them + another one set in the same universe 100 years later) by Jacqueline Carey, it's one of my favourite fantasy sagas and I weep at how many fanfictions could be done, but sadly there are only a handful.

** have you read "for someone special?" by ladyofthemosque? it is hermoine/snape, but both agonize over that for plenty of length, and snape did it to save hermoine from deatheaters a bit angsty for my tastes and its only light BDSM, nothing extreme, lots of character growth.
