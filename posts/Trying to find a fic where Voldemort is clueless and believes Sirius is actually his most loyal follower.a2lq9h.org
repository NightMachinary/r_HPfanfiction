I read this quite a while ago now. I remember that harry was the main focus of the story and that the story itself was hilarious. If I'm remembering right Voldemort comes back and hears someone (from the paper or something) say that Sirius Black is his second in command and basically just rolls with it even though Bellatrix tries to tell him otherwise and he just keeps ignoring her and cutting her off. Towards the end of the Voldemort arc Sirius and Snape turn on him and he is genuinely surprised. I think that Voldemort was treated like a side story and that all the little blurbs of his plans were just absurd and funny.

** This isn't the one you're thinking of, but there's one where Sirius is broken out of prison alongside the Death Eaters and just sort of tags along with them to their hideout. He and the other Death Eaters are rather confused why he's there, but they all just sort of roll with it.

** It's not it, but linkffn(like a redheaded stepchild) has something similar, too. They even gaslight Voldemort into believing Sirius was his lover as a prank on Sirius...which is actually quite horrifying, especially when he turns into Yzma.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

**** Same for me lol. I tried looking through my history and I even tried googling (with quotes) some lines I think I remember but honestly I think your best shot if no one else answers is to look through recommendations in this sub of crack fics (because the story is definitely humorous if not full crack). That should narrow the scope a little I think.
