** Found it! At least I think it is the one you mean! The Witches of Gilford by pyjamapants

It is on the site The Petulant Poetess: [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=11338]]

I don't know if it is on other sites.

*** Awesome, thanks! This is exactly it. I was thinking it was on Ashwinder, but I couldn't find it on any of the usual suspects, and a google search wasn't coming up with it.

** I don't know about that one but there is one where they are unknowingly on a murder mystery weekend at the same time. It's a good one as I remember but it has been a few years
