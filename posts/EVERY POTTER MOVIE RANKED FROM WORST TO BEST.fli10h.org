** Philosopher's Stone at worst lmao opinion discarded. Also I don't quite understand why you posted that here as opposed to the main HP sub.

** 100% do not agree with this list. I'd put them like this:

1. Half blood prince
2. Deathly hallows part 2
3. Philosophers stone
4. Order of the Phoenix
5. Goblet of fire
6. Chamber of secrets
7. Deathly hallows part 1
8. Prisoner of Azkaban

This list is based off of loving the books and thinking none of the movies are great representations of the books. I wish Harry Potter came along 15 years later so it would of had a good chance of being made into a 5 or 6 season tv show instead of movies. I don't feel like the movies do the books justice and I feel like the order I place the movies are from best to worst interpretations from book to movie.

The Prisoner of Azkaban movie leaves so much out and just changes things to the point where if you had not of read the book I imagine some things just wouldn't make much sense.

** The fact that he put the Deathly Hallows part 1 so high up ruins any credibility he had. That movie felt as if they had to stretch 1.5 movies into 2 movies. And saying He says the Philosophers Stone is the worst because it feels like a children's movie? That's what it is. It's a movie meant for children.

IMO this is how they rank (just the movies, not taking any book comparisons into account)

1. Chamber of Secrets
2. Deathly Hallows 1 6.Philosopher's Stone 5.Order of the Phoenix 4.Deathly Hallows 2 3.Goblet of Fire 2.Prisoner of Azkaban 1.Half Blood Prince
