Hi As the title states i'm looking for fics where he mentors harry or them just having a good relationship but please no slash. Also i'd prefer good fics if you know of them


** Stories with good interactions between Harry and Dumbledore are my favorite type of HP fanfiction. The following are well-written, non-slash stories that I've found to be enjoyable.

linkffn(By the Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song; The Other Side of the Coin; The Prisoner's Cipher)

I also second Dagger and Rose by Perspicacity.

Have fun reading! ;)

Dumbledore isn't really a major character, but he is around a fair amount and he does have a good relationship with Harry. Not as close as in canon, since Harry doesn't come to Hogwarts until he's 16.

I can't even tell you about my favorite scene because it would spoil something. But it does include MacGonagall taking points from Gryffindor "for being a bloody Gryffindor". I can only presume she would have taken points from Dumbledore's House if he had one. Yes, Harry and Dumbledore were misbehaving together.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
