** I'm dying at the "Dumbledore is achieved through smoke and mirrors".

Now I'm picturing a green screen colored drone with a speaker attached, and a mile away a few techs in a command center with a "Dumbledore" soundboard trying to merge the words "my" and "boy" together whenever Harry comes up for a visit.

I supposed the random words at the end of the year 1 welcome dinner could have been a mistake. The tech had practiced the word combinations of his whole speech, but right at the end put his/her hands in the wrong part of said soundboard. The writers naturally freaked out, now they would have to write-in some more crazy Dumbledore bits.

Edit: oops just reread what u said, "mirrors and puppets"
