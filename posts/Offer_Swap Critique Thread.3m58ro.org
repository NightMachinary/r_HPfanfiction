This thread is for *offering* and *swapping* writing services. This came out of the writing threads where a lot of authors wanted in-depth help with their writing, and a swap seems like the most practical way to help two authors at once. /I recommend against simply requesting for help; there are always more people who need help than can give it./

*For example:*

- *Swapping reviews on published chapters*: Include a link to your chapter/story, the word count of the writing you want reviewed, and (optionally) preferred area of focus. Specify what you will /not/ read in return, if you have a strong preference.

- *Swapping beta services, i.e. proofing fic chapters before they are posted*: Include a description of your story, the word count of the writing you want reviewed, a preferred methods of communication, and your expected turnaround time. Specify what you will /not/ read in return, if you have a strong preference.

- *Requesting critique for a short section of writing (<500 words)*: Post the section in a comment or link to a doc, and specify your concerns.

- *Starting a writing group/chat*: Writing chats are great for brainstorming ideas and discussing daily writing with other writers. They should be mutually beneficial; it's ok to find different writing partners if they don't work out for you. Include preferred methods of communication (PMs, skype, email, etc) and timezone.


** I'd like to swap reviews with someone. My fic is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129999][Not From Others]], currently at 25,000 although I'm not expecting anyone to read all of it. I would like them to read at least two chapters though. It's DH from Ginny's POV, very canon compliant. I will read anything in return :)

** I would like to try that. Maybe it gives me some ideas as to how to progress.

I have three stories and will trade reviews for either one. One of it is already published on ffn. One has been published but was rewritten and one has yet to see its first rewrite, for it is a draft.

*The first one* I'd like to link here is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11346410/1/The-Bloodmoon-Rises]["The Bloodmoon Rises"]].

Its a Vampire!Hermione and Vampire!Harry story that starts with a focus on Hermione but eventually turned into a 2 protagonists story. I steer clear of the common vampire!Harry tropes that I often encounter in fanfiction (daywalkers, stupid outfits or /-shudder-/ Twilight references, to name just a few). The story is at 32.000 words and I would gladly swap for any story the same length +/-20.000 words, since I seek for someone to give me some general feedback of the entire story and some pointers as to how he would progress it. I have some troubles with the next chapter that I would love to have help with once my helper has read the first 5 chapters.

Summary is in the ffnbot description. Be warned: The story is gory and has lots of brutal scenes. Hermione is completely OOC in the first chapters (but will eventually come back to resemble her original character). Pairings: Not H/Hr, as much as you may doubt me in this point. I'm trying my hand here at Harry/Minerva McG, but nothings set in stone. Also Hermione/Bellatrix, but I wouldn't call it a pairing. More like a Mistress and her lapdog (a lot like the way Voldemort and Bellatrix interact).

*The second one* is called "A Soul to Fight for". You can find it in a Google Doc, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FVClLPTxNNtYiMkCvFM_jjLIlJyv5OZxqiDuAxr-S28/edit?usp=sharing][here]] 7,8k words.

Summary: Voldemorts daughter, Merope Riddle, is found in a orphanage in Glasgow. Many see her as the spawn of Evil and want her gone, but Hermione Granger remains true to herself. A child has no responsibility for the crimes of its father. So to protect her from the vengeful magical world, Hermione Granger adopts the child and tries to raise her as best as she can.

This story is supposed to be a bit of a "Slice of Life". Hermione's struggles to raise Merope while the magical world spits venom at her. The years until Hogwarts and then of course, the evil that is a pack of children. It will probably end with Meropes graduation, but thats far into the future for now.

Pairings: Merope/Ted Lupin (probably).

*The third one* is called "Hermione the Necromancer" (Working Title). You can find it [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1urg-FX2CTZKAO5XKHoMh50wSLtQXenmsuKnrIiBwMqE/edit?usp=sharing][here]] We're at 26k words there and the deals the same. Swap for any story with the same amount of words +/-20k.

Summary: Hermione Granger stumbles upon the Magic of Summoning and delves deep into the occult magicks of Necromancy, Blood and Soul magic. (/I suck at summaries/)

What I don't see myself reviewing: purely romance-fics, crack-fics, Book-rehearsals. I don't think I could give any good feedback to either one of those.

*** You don't need to swap for anything. Your second story just caught my eye and I gave it a quick read. I don't know if you want the critique in a PM, but here it goes for anyone else that wants to read it.

Pros:

- Premise is brilliant. The juxtaposition of having the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix attending a post-DH Hogwarts is something that should have already been written.
- Merope's conflicting character traits are established very well. Her introduction here was neither too small nor too big and set the right tone of what the reader and the fic-world should expect of her.
- Generally well written. You established a high level of competency in your writing and I found no fault with the climactic point of section you've posted

Cons:

- Clumsy exposition - A beta is always recommended, of course, and there are parts of your story that would benefit from simpler sentence structure as well as cutting back on dialogue tags. This is a suggestion that would improve your style more than any obvious grammar corrections.
- POV shifts - I would caution against shifting POVs without obvious page breaks or chapter designations. At one point, the POV shifted between Merope and Hermione without any break and such shifts do a lot to break the immersion of the story. A similar shift occurred in the Order meeting as the POV jumped from one character to the other. You should be more vigilant in holding your POV.

TBD:

- Establishing the conflict
- Secondary character progression (Hermione, Harry, etc)
- The narrative

**** Thank you for that feedback. Sentence structure and unnecessary dialogue extras are my big weakness. Grammar is, as always, just me being not a native english speaker and writer. I'm constantly improving, but its still a way to go for me.

I have not noticed the POV shifts at all. Now that you pointed it out, I can't understand how I missed them. But this is the draft one, so I would've rewritten anyway. Got lucky that you pointed it out before.

** Sounds like a good idea. I don't have anything specific in mind at the moment, but if you want me to give you a critique on a section of writing or just to talk over ideas, feel free to hit me up on IRC, either directly (same name as reddit) or on the sub's channel ##hpfanfiction on freenode.

If you're new to IRC, just click [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23hpfanfiction&uio=d4][here]] to get started. I'm usually active around 0800 to 1600 UTC (my timezone is +8) but feel free to try me whenever.

** I'd be interested in this idea. I release a chapter (10kish words) every one to two months depending on how creative I feel. I'd be whiling to swap beta for beta with someone who wants something similar.
