Looking for (mostly) canon compliment with canon pairing and mostly canon events. I'm fine with small "fix-it" details like Tonks or George living, stuff like that. But mainly looking for good Harry after war fics. No bashing, a good Ron would also be nice. I don't care about professions.


** These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo on Ffn.net is a pretty good post-war story.

They have a Year 8 sequel called Some Cuts Leave Scars.

Both stories are complete.

** - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian stories]] (start with “Tales of the Battle” and then go on; some pre-war stories are good as well, but he shines most in the post-war ones).
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Stories by Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter)

These two I consider classics in the canon post-war stories.

** I read the title as "Good Afternoon Fics" and was briefly confused.

  Wherein Ron is an irredeemable sap, Harry isn't much better, and Bill is so Over It all (but secretly pleased). Or how Ron's stag do goes the way most things do when Harry Potter is involved---a quick spiral into violence and heartwarming disaster.

#+begin_quote
  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

#+begin_quote
  Or were they something else entirely, this trio who was not golden? They were the unchosen three: the discarded Horcrux and the last Weasley; the brave, broken backup Boy Who Lived; the loony girl who lost her shoes and had more friends in thestrals than in her common room.Ginny rallied an army in the Room of Requirement with her mother's knack for raised voices, Riddle's smooth words, Harry's agitated passion, and wondered if she was the hero of this story.
