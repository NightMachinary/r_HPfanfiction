Recommendations for a fic where harry travels back in time, alone and gets with hermione. Ron, ginny bashing is good. Dumbledore bashing is appreciated. Have already read Champions Champion, so something similar would be awesome.


** You mean like the Reptillia28 Don't Fear the Reaper challenge?

If so then here's a couple

Linkffn(11922615) Harry Potter and the Last Chance

Linkffn(10766595) Three to Backstep (Daphne joins Harry and Hermione in this)

Plus there's this one where Harry & Hermione go back (Non challenge fic by Vance McGill)

Linkffn(11123742) The Vanishing Cabinet Of Time

*** I'm on chapter 11 of The Vanishingg Cabinet of Time and it is /definitely/ the exact sort of story you were looking for. (Compete with Dan and Emma for Hermione's parents lol, this type of story is my guiltiest of pleasures, so thanks for the post)

**** Just FYI, turns out The Vanishing Cabinet of Time is not complete - it was last updated in August 2015, and the author has posted other stories since. It's still a good read, but my own personal peeve is getting really into a story then realizing its not completed.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
