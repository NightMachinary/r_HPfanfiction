This isn't some kind of Yugioh thing where skill at this one game is for some reason critically important, it's just gobstones and is exactly as useful against dark lords as you would expect gobstones to be. Harry is a gobstones prodigy and wants nothing more than to compete in the Gobstones World Championship, but will he miss his finals match against his gobstones arch-rival Draco Malfoy because he's busy dealing with the current Voldemort-induced end-of-year crisis?


** Harry then proceeds to bet his entire fortune on himself, win, and become so rich that he just hires every powerful wizard out there and sends them after Voldemort (whose attacks keep distracting him from his games and are generally annoying).

***** 'Finally, my treasured rival you have appeared before me my entire life I have had one true passion and it was for gobstones. sadly I quickly found that no wizard nor witch could match my prodigies powers in the art of the gobstones and my dream of having a challenge match of gobstones was crushed. but how fitting that the one who was chosen to by prophecy to defeat me as lord Voldemort is also the one who shall face wits against Tom Marvolo Riddle at Gobstones.''

-hours later- "you have defeated me young potter, well done'' the now friendly looking voldemort replied. ''my lord, he must have cheated nobody could match your prodigious skill at anything''

"silence malfoy, how dare you insult the merlin of gobstones reborn''

Voldemort turns to harry 'I am sorry about that, his father was much the same, bunch of bloody kissarsers'
