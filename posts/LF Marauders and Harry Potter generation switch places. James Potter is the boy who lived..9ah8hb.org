I remember a story with that premise, but I can't find it anymore. I've hoped that the fic would have been finished by now. This are some extra things that I remember:

-The prophecy is the same, but the month is March instead of July, Harry and Ginny have the role of James and Lily,

-Ron goes to Azkaban, because everyone thinks he was the secret keeper (Just like Sirius),

-Speaking of Sirius, there is a chapter where he is a kid, looking at a motorbike, I think,

-Hermione is in there, but I don't know what's her character in the fic.

​

If anyone knows this fic, please send me a link and thank you.

** I have been trying helplessly to find this fic. Do you have any idea what site it was on? Ao3? FFN? That would help considerably to narrow the field a little bit!
