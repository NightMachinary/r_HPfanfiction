:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I know that at some point I have read a fic that has the gang spending a lot of time in the chamber of secrets, they turn it into a clubhouse and find a library down there. I thought it might have been Harry Potter and the Fifth Element, and while they do make use of the chamber, its not that one!

Knowing the type of fics that I gravitate to, its likely to have the following criteria M/E Rating 100k+ Hermione as part of the main pairing Complete Ao3/ffn

If anyone can help, I would be most grateful!

(Also if anyone would like to suggest other stories that follow my criteria, im up for it!)

  Harry's 16th Birthday is to be spent at Privet Drive. A visit from Tonks and then the Minister leads to some fireworks in Harry's usually quiet, peaceful life. HONKS.

** linkffn(Forging the Sword), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Pendant of Slytherin), and linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) all have the Chamber as massive plot elements, but none of them are H/Hr. Try these, but I don't think it's one of them.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM
