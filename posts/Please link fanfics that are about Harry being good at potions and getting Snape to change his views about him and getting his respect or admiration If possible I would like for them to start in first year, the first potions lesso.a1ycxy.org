Yes please see the title, because canon Harry read his books before Hogwarts and maybe he took an interest in potions and he actually knew some of the answers, or also worked hard over the year to get Snape's appreciation later. :)


** Sounds exactly like the premise of:

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste)

It does take a while for them to be on good terms with each other and Snape remains in character the entire time (so he never becomes a nice super supportive mentor that many fics portray him as). It is well written though and has lots of humour and entertaining interactions between the two of them.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

*** I completely fell in love with this story the other day. Right up until the last chapter and the sequel where the author brought Cursed Child stuff into it. That made me pretty much immediately nope out. Great story, fantastic premise; just leave the steaming retconned shit-pile that is Cursed Child out of it.

Harry decides to get a Mastery in Potions under Snape's tutelage. Interesting stuff.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** Exactly what happens in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-Year-1-New-Version][They Shook Hands]]. Harry comes prepared for his first potions lesson and answers all the questions that Snape asks him. From then Harry is one of the top students in potions. I think in fifth book Snape even suggests apprenticeship for Harry after Hogwarts, provided they both survive the war.
