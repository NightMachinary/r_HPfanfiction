I've read fics before where Harry through some convoluted plot or another becomes "Half Dementor" or "The King/Lord/Other Title of Dementors" and gains powers similar to a Dementor, but I've never read one where Harry ACTUALLY becomes a Dementor. Horrific appearance, emotional manipulation, weakness to patronus, appetite for souls and all.

NO ROMANCE AT ALL INVOLVING DEMENTOR!HARRY. How would that even work? Never-mind, I probably don't want to know...

EDIT: Oops, forgot to flair it, fixed that

***** Or the inverse. It inherited a Dementor's venom and ability to weave webs (i.e. none) and an acromantula's despair aura and flying skill (i.e. none). Just a sad, vaguely humanoid monstrosity running around on tiny spider legs, hiding from anyone who has a happy thought.

Poor thing. I'd cuddle it, but that would probably make it even sadder.

** What do you think would be the process by which someone becomes a Dementor? I tend to think they are just a separate species, which was implied when it was mentioned they were "breeding," but that could have just meant more people were turning into them, if you really wanted.

*** I can't really think of a way for someone to become a Dementor (mainly because I cannot think of a good enough way for that to happen without it falling into a metric ton of cliches and tropes), but I want to read a story in which it happens in some way. In canon, I agree with you, that they are some sort of separate magical species (although, if they do breed there, since they seem to be immortal, why aren't there a ludicrous amount of Dementors? If they are immortal you'd think there would be a lot of them.), but for the sake of this story I want Dementor!Harry, even though that contradicts what I think of Dementors.

I guess how Harry becomes a Dementor is up to the author, I personally cannot think of some way for this to happen, but that's why I made this post, to see if someone else had come up with this idea before and had any good stories on it.

...I think I wrote a bit too much...

**** This is how I'm going about it in one of my stories.

Every witch or wizard has a daemon - this is basically a part of your soul that lives outside your body and is represented by an animal (This is based on His Dark Materials).

Dementors are people who have lost their souls (daemons), so they will do anything to hunt down what they have lost (ie they are souless and fed on others peoples souls (daemons)).

Currently though, I've only hinted at this in the plot and I'm still a way off getting to any detail and how this will affect Harry.

**** Eh, it is super useful to change it for stories and stuff. My current idea is they are born of concentrated misery. That way, Kissed people can become Dementors given their conditions, Dementors can spontaneously appear, and necromancers who accidentally consign their souls to an unnatural torturous existence can count as well.

** This actually sounds pretty interesting.

Through some freak of magic during the dementor attack in Order of the Phoenix, Harry could develop a dementor's appetite for souls and when he's been without one for too long he might start emitting an aura of fear to those around him.

I like this because we'd have canon Harry whose whole identity is about self sacrifice and saving people, having to resort to "feeding" on unsuspecting muggles and hating himself for it.

I'd picture him holding out for too long until he would lose control and eat Dudley's soul, blaming it on a dementor and then having to go through his sixth year learning to control his new urges and dealing with his guilt for essentially killing Dudley.

** The closest thing i can think of is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/insatiable-worm-harry-potter.383009/][Insatiable]], which is a Worm crossover fic.

There's no appearance change but there is emotional manipulation (at least in a manner of speaking) and the hunger for souls.

There's hints of romance but it doesn't really go anywhere.

** linkffn(for love of magic)

Closest I can think of. Harry discovers how dementors came to be and has a close brush with becoming one himself. It continues to be a danger for him, but he has not yet become one. Closest he gets is giving off a dementor aura every once in a while.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
