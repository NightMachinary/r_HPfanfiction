Are there any good stories out there where Harry gets sent to Azkaban and instead of going insane or anything he learns how to talk about his problems? Like, he gets past the abuse from the Dursleys on a psychoemotional level and walks out of Azkaban a much healthier person (emotionally) saying things like "Dementors are really good listeners." and then it goes on to Harry dealing with his problems using healthy coping habits? So basically turning Harry into a Hufflepuff via Dementor Exposure. I'm sure that's gotta be a thing.


** I don't really get how that makes sense. The Dementors induce feelings of depression, fear, hopelessness, etc- I'm pretty sure they're actually supposed to be a metaphor for clinical depression. Saying your mental health issues were solved by being around Dementors is like saying you solved your mental health issues by taking a pill that induces your brain to have the chemical imbalance of clinical depression.

*** I mean, the idea would be that the Dementors would bring the memories to the forefront, preventing him from supressing them as he normally does. Harry would, instead of just going insane, decide to simply talk. Let it all out. Basically hand the Dementors his angst on a silver platter - easiest meal for them in ages. I know that it normally wouldn't work, but this is HARRY we're talking about. also, yeah, it'd be crack

** That... sounds brilliant actually. I know I've read some fics where Harry goes to Azkaban and becomes Lord of the island or whatever, but nothing like what you describe. I'd love to read a story like that.

  A letter causes Harry to learn some surprising things about his lineage, a different twist on the usual Harry in Azkaban story line.

**** Why does everyone forget about linkffn(5371934) ? It's one of my favorite fics. Also, just a note - while I was writing this my iPad attempted to autocorrect 'fics' to 'dicks'. Thanks, Apple. You've always got my back.

  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

** Well if you want friendly, cuddly dementors you've always got "The Birth of a Nightmare Man" and "The Nightmare Man". Nothing sweet, innocent or Hufflepuff-y there though.
