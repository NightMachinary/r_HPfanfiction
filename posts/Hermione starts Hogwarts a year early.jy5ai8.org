** We need more fics with this premise. It's an elegant way to decouple Hermione from Harry and Ron and let her have her own adventures, and she could probably benefit from skipping a grade, since she is quite mature and disciplined for her age.

I know of two that are readable, both quite flawed:

- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11568740/1/Brilliant-Magic):]] a slow-burn reverse-harem Slytherin!Hermione romance with the Gryffindor!Weasley twins. This is, unfortunately, one of those romance-focused fics in which the author isn't really paying attention to character interactions or plot outside of the main 'ship, and everything is driven by the need to create angst and drama. This results in not a small amount of Slytherin Persecution Complex and things like Draco bullying Hermione despite them being in different years---and actually winning a duel against her, even though she's been fighting off older students for years.

- There is a fic, that I can't find, in which Hermione ends up in Ravenclaw and is friends with Cho Chang and others. I recall being disappointed when one of the first scenes had a gaggle of Ravenclaw girls, including Hermione, running into Harry on Hogwarts Express during his 1st trip there and start teaching him spells, which he insta-learns, and that tell you who the fic is really about.

  WINNER: BEST HONORARY MARAUDER FIC in the MARAUDER MEDALS, 2016! "Someday . . . you'll do it your own way, not theirs!" Slytherin!Hermione, in which the brilliant witch catches the attention of creative twin wizards. It isn't easy, though. Not all Gryffindors are vastly brave, nor are all Slytherins loyal to their own. FW/HG/GW, AU from Hermione's 1st year. Cover art by windyshoes!

*** Thank you! Brilliant Magic is the one I was thinking of. It gets pretty trope-y at times, but that's what I'm craving right now so I don't mind haha. Would also love more fics that explored this idea!

** Not hard to do: her birthday is September 19. Just have her born three weeks earlier and she'd make the cutoff.

*** Oh sorry I was unclear! She has the same birthdate, so she starts Hogwarts at 10 (for a couple of weeks). Do not remember the justification for this

**** The justification is common enough to be mentioned [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/fanonvscanon.htm#Hermione_at_10][here]]
