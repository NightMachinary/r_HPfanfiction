** I'd be for the ability to opt out of that information, but not getting rid of the tagging system. For two reasons.

I occasionally get a hankering to read a specific pairing so I like the efficiency of the tagging system.

The other reason is that I actually really don't want to read specific things and if they aren't tagged then it's harder for me to avoid. I ended up having to take a break from reading fanfiction for a long while because I stumbled into a story featuring pre-teen Harry in a sexual relationship with Snape.

I like the ability to immediately NOPE out of something

** I wonder what your real problem is. I don't think it's seeing the pairing of the story beforehand because there are thousands of stories where the pairing is not specified. There are even more where only one main character is given, and no pairing at all.

I, for myself, don't want to be tricked into stories where the characters are too OOC, so I prefer to know about the pairing because the pairing, together with the summary, usually is a good indication if the main characters are in character or OC's labelled with canon names.

In the end, there is something for everyone. No one forces you to read stories where a pairing is specified, and I can read stories with my favourite pairings.
