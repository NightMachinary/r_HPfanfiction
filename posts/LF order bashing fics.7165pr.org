Im looking for fics where harry doesnt take beeing kept in the dark very well and bashes/messes with the order. (Summer before 5'th year hes being ignored by everyone if i remember corectly) Any fics where harry is doing his best to mess with/piss off the order?

Crack fics are welcome ^{^}


** There was this one that I forgot the name of. Harry becomes really indifferent to everything. He just stops giving a shit. It's Harry/Hermione in the end, after Hermione realizes she messed up by not communicating with Harry over the summer. I don't think it's on fanfiction.net though. It's on that website with the black background.

He also leaves Britain, I think, and sends Voldemort a letter saying he's done. I believe Voldemort also quits and ends up getting together with McGonagall after he's all remorseful and gets his good looks back.

Anyone know it?

***** Yeah, the same one I though you wanted but I didn't read it there. With the title though google took me to a site that is linked very often here.

How I wish I had that whole perfect memory so often seen in HP fics, with a mental index with everything I've read...

** Linkffn(dear order by silverwolf7007)

Three to Backstep had an amusing taunting letter from Harry to the Order with amusing plays on everyone's names. But it's a little long to rec for just that part.

  "I'm still alive, as you may surmise from this note. Of course, I could be dead and someone is faking the letter to fool you..." Harry is NOT happy about being left at Privet Drive all summer with no one to talk to.
