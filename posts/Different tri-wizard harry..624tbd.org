I'm looking for any stories with different reactions from harry regarding the tri-wizard tournament. The more au harry reacts to it the better. I'm sick on all these largly different harry in fanfiction yet his fourth year he acts almost exactly like canon. Where are all the he finds barty quick with the map or he doesn't give a crap what anyone thinks, i'm talking about a rebel harry.

Anything above would be appreciated.

Thanks.


** You made me immediately think of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press]]) . I think there's some more stories like this in which Harry just tells everyone to just shove-off.

While I take issue with many indie!Harry tropes, any story in which he doesn't cooperate in this insane tournament has a special place in my heart. You're being forced to fight in a deadly tournament against your will, the least you could do is not to obediently dance for your puppet masters when they tell you. "Oh, a weighing of the wands and taking pictures? How fancyful. How about, no?"

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/Harry-Potter-Unchampion][Harry Potter: Unchampion]], linkffn(3793741), is my favorite 'Harry screw the TWT' moment.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), has the most hilarious take on TWT. Harrymort organized a House-Elf paper airplane production line and got in as the sole Hogwarts champion...

*** The idea here is sound, I can completely buy Sirius Black buying Harry drugs and alcohol. When I got to the American witch with the Iphone in 1994 in chapter 7 I realized the story wasn't going to get any better.

**** The author said that he purposely ignores anachronism for humor reasons. This story is perfect if you only want to laugh, but you'll be really disappointed if you expected a serious story. I have to say this story has in my opinion some of the funniest scenes you will see in fanfic and i would advise anyone to give it a try at least to the second task

***** Changing the timeline is one of my pet peeves. It annoys me far more than it should, and I can't read a story that changes when the story takes place.

****** I agree. People need to warn up front. I will get really excited for a story and be a few chapters in and someone will take out an iPhone and text when Harry is 8!
