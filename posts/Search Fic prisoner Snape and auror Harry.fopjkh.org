:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Many years ago I read a post-books ff where Snape was alive but no one knew about his pact with Dumbledore, so he was in prison. Then he could go out on parole with Auror Harry as his guard. I remember a scene where he went out of Harry's home to take a smoke and the alarm called there many aurors. Harry took a look at Snape and he said (sarcastically): "Yeah, he wanted to escape bare feet, with only cigarettes and a [ TITLE of book of poetry], good choice Snape." Someone know the title of the fic? Snape was beated in prison but he was mentally sane enough, if a bit resigned. Harry was angry with him but not cruel.


** I would love to read that as well.

Any chance it could be "Painted in the worst light" by asecretchord ? (ao3) It has been a while since I read that.

*** Cool fic! But no, it isn't the one. In the one I was thinking Harry didn't see Snape's memories, he thinks him guilty. And that fic is from Snape's pov.
