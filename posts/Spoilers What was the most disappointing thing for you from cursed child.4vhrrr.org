** Personally I felt most betrayed when it turned out Cedric would turn Death Eater if he lost the tournament. It's like taking his character and throwing it in the trash completely. For one, it doesn't line up with anything he did in the books especially in the third task when he was ready to let Harry win. For two, it implies that he has to die for the sake of the rest of the world. Which is just depressing as he was a good, loyal, and strong person and his death was supposed to be a senseless, unexpected, and tragic murder. I don't even care what new characters they add, but the fact that poor Cedric has to be painted as a villain when he was everything but that in the books is contrary to the overall message.

**** I never understood the obsession of people to adhere to canon in fanfiction. If you as a fanfic author need them to work differently, change them in your story.

But Rowling taking her own rules - canon - and just ignoring it feels like she couldn't care less about this world and its fans. It also opens up the entirety of the book series to the question of "couldn't anybody be bothered with going back in time?". Why even let this all happen if there is this option?

Timetravel ruins any story that isn't specifically a Timetravel-story. And Rowling went ahead and fucked up her entire universe.

******** Probably,...

I'm just incredibly pissed off about this. Whenever I see some lines from the Cursed Child it feels like Rowling just mentally vomitted into a Word file, gave the thing a good stir and dropped this onto her own universe.

But then again, Pottermore also reads like she couldn't be bothered with Harry Potter anymore and only uploads because of contracts.

********* Anyone who was in this subs IRC the day the spoilers dropped will tell you just how incredibly pissed off I was. I honestly thought it would be the end of my participating in fandom. I felt so betrayed by the necessary retcons and sheer bloody-mindedness of it. I felt that JK had bought into herself as the voice of God in the HP universe and was saying 'I'm the boss, it's all mine - accept it as canon or be wrong."

I have felt for a long time that while she will always get the royalty cheques, the "work" has become far bigger than JK or her vision anymore. She built a playground where countless children play - and she doesn't get to tell us how and what games are the "right" ones anymore.

That is why I found a way to make peace with it. The play exists. Her insistence that it is canon will create another line of demarcation in the fandom between those who accept it and those who don't. It is what it is. I seriously doubt she cares what I think, so why on earth should I care what she thinks? I intend to engage with the material in a way that makes me happy.

*** I didn't read the book, I saw the spoilers and decided not to waste my money. If you like it fine, it not that's cool too. But one of my big questions is where the hell has Delphi been for twenty something years and why did Narcissa not warn anyone?

If someone says Narcissa didn't know she existed I'm calling bullshit. Bellatrix and Narcissa were ridiculously close as shown in Half Blood Prince. If Bellatrix got knocked up by Voldemort she would have told Narcissa. Even if Narcissa was trying to protect her sisters daughter she would have raised her herself or seen to it she was taken care of by a loving family. Having Delphi be evil doesn't make sense to me.

**** And why didn't Draco know? Delphi says she was born before the Battle of Hogwarts. There was a BABY in Malfoy Manor. Then Bellatrix and Voldemort both die in the battle, and the Malfoys return home (presumably. Where else would they go?) Did they notice that baby there? Who was watching that baby? Were there provisions in place to move her of V and B didn't return? I can't wrap my head around any of it. Narcissa would have known. Draco would have known.

***** A) Awesome username

B) Right!? Did Bellatrix pop this kid out and just dump the baby at an orphanage? Where was this kid? If Voldemort was convinced he was immortal why would he need a child? It goes against everything he stood for. People had to know this kid existed, especially the less moral Death Eaters. Facing life in Azkaban? Well what if I told you where you could find the child of the Dark Lord? Would that knock some time off my sentence?

** Hmm, Delphi and the Time Turners.

I was lucky enough to see the play. It was truly phenomenal, and I loved every minute of it. I sat on the edge of my seat the whole time. I gasped along with the crowd, l laughed, I screamed when the dementor flew overhead (they are terrifying - words cannot describe it), I cried at the end...I walked out of that play with the biggest smile on my face.

It was only when I woke up the next morning that I said, "What the fuck?"

** To save space, here are my things that other people haven't mentioned:

1) Out of character-ness: Incompetent!Ron, Jerk!Harry, and worst of all for me, McGonagall chewing out Harry and Hermione for things that mostly weren't their fault. (Not to mention the fact that JKR went back on her earlier statement that McGonagall had already retired.)

2) The entire fourth act. It felt like it was going to far, and it didn't seem that necessary in terms of character development. If Delphi had been good, and the play ended after Act III, I think it would have been a lot better.

3) James and Lily leaving the house that's under Fidelius with baby Harry. Biggest idiot ball in the play IMHO.

4) Dumbledore genuinely believing Harry had to die when it's pretty clear he knew he wouldn't in GoF.

5) Continued prejudice against Slytherin. I take great issue with JKR over "The Problem of Slytherin", and CC did very little to help that.

**** You can Google "The Problem of Slytherin" to find it, but the short version is, JKR pays lip service to the fact that not all Slytherins are bad, but the only unambiguously good and likable person we know was a Slytherin is Andromeda Tonks, who literally gets 2 lines in canon.

And she's passed over multiple opportunities to improve Slytherin's portrayal, like not having any Slytherins in the DA, not having any fight against Voldemort in the battle (she said some came back to fight in later interviews, but not in the text), and writing Dorea Black out of Harry's family tree on Pottermore.

***** I feel like Slytherin gets a lot of sympathy in the wrong way.

For starters, there's the emo kids sympathizing with Slytherin as the "Dark" house (e.g. My Immortal (I'm exaggerating)).

Second, there's the people who believe that Slytherin isn't inherently evil. However, the house as a whole has been corrupted. The sorting hat takes preference, right? Eliezer Yudkowsky takes a few digs at this in his monumental HPMOR. Because of Slytherin's bad name, good people stay away from Slytherin. Harry begged the hat not to be placed in Slytherin because of the bad name it had. Similarly, Slytherin becomes a nest of evil kids. So yes, Slytherin is not inherently evil, but it has become so due to bad influence.

***** I was hoping Slytherin!Albus would redeem Slytherin House. I have wanted Albus to be a Slytherin since DH came out. It makes sense to me to show that there are Slytherin traits that aren't inherently evil- cunning, shrewdness, leadership.

I kind of figured the point of the Books 1-7 was not to prejudge Slytherins. So many do brave, noble things in the end- Draco, Narcissa, Snape, and Regulus. CC had a chance to fully redeem Slytherin. To show a "good" character that also has Slytherin characteristics. CC failed.

Here's a chance to show the good side of the house. To show that they have a different set of skills, but they're not all evil. But CC instead has the Slytherins being dickwads to both Albus and Scorpius. And we don't grow to love the Slytherin cunning and guile in Albus. Does he even have it?

Hubby has joked that I'm on a Slytherin Lives Matter campaign. I am always sorted into Slytherin, and I definitely identify with them. It makes the most sense to me. But I'm not evil, and I don't think I've intentionally been mean in my life. If Slytherin is just Death Eater Sleep Away Camp, why is it still a house at Hogwarts? Why would that exist? Why divide the students at all?

I think a huge problem with books 1-7 is that we only see Slytherin through Harry's eyes. And the only reason he asks the hat not to put him in Slytherin is because Draco reminded him of Dudley (and a throwaway, prejudiced line by Hagrid.) Everything else about Slytherin is tainted by Harry's hatred of Snape and Draco. During the Battle of Hogwarts, the entire Slytherin House is sent to the dungeons? Really? And then the movies just made the problem worse by casting actors who looked Extra Super Evil for all the Slytherins.

- The obvious influence of (the worst of) fanfiction on it.

- The blatant disregard of established rules

- Delphi

- The character of Ron

- Harry Potter saying anything akin to "I wish you weren't my son".

- A million more things. I'm trying my best to ignore it less I get influenced by it.

But its all par for the course, really. I hoped for a new book series - I got a play. I hoped for new characters - I got fucking Delphi. I hoped for a interesting new HP story - I got The Cursed Child.

At this point I stopped hoping. Maybe Fantastic Beasts turns the constant let-down that is the canon HP universe nowadays, around.
