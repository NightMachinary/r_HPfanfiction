I just finished linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). Despite it not being the oldest incomplete fic in my favourites list, this is the first fic that made me sad knowing that it will most likely never be finished. I really wish that the writer would update with a rough frame of how it will end, since it was almost at the end anyways. What are your favourite abandoned fics?


** The longer you are in the fandom the more of these there are, and it never really gets any easier. I've got 3 big ones, and at least 30 others that I really want finished.

*** Seconding The Legacy, I just finished it up last week. For my money, it's one of the best pieces of fan fiction out there AND it has the best development of everyone's favorite Slytherin OC... that scene where Daphne opens up to Harry about her cousin. Hot damn that was some good writing

**** I agree. Its ridiculous long, almost too much so, but its such a nice contrast to 99% of the other fics where they just hop into bed instantly without any build up. The reluctance and the actual development of their relationship is untouched.

Definitely two of my favourite fics.

Absolutely loves the changes to the language and everything else the author did.

Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game.

** I found linkffn(Faster, Mudblood! Kill! Kill!) right before it's final update. I was obsessed. It was one of the first fics I read that wasn't set at Hogwarts. It was so quippy and wonderful.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ascension of Ra)

This is to be honest my guilty pleasure fic that I hate isn't finished. It's a Smallville crossover with an incredibly OOC Harry, but the interactions and the story lines are good enough to ignore that fact.

** Dead Man Walking, featuring Regulus Black who has been in a coma recovering for years, who upon waking wants to a. continue fucking over voldemort, and b. help out Harry, since his older brother who's job it's supposed to be is an irresponsible idiot.

I loved that story, even when it was just a handfull of chapters, I still checked back a few times a year to see if maybe the author felt like updating again. He deleted it instead, and I will never forgive him.

It's a series so at least the pre-Hogwarts up to the 5th year are done. The author seems to be busy raising their kid to have time to sit down and write fanfiction again.
