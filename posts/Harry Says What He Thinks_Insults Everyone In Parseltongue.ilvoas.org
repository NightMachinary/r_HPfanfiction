** Lol. It would be hilarious if by the time Harry met Voldemort it would be an ingrained habit and he insults Voldy in front of his face.

**** True. But I think Voldy would also somehow find out that Harry is a horcrux. He'd wonder how Harry got the ability, after all. Of course, he's pretty insane /because of/ all his horcruxes. So there's that.

***** Omg, now I'm imagining Nagini as Voldemort's therapist.

Nagini : What did we say about expectations My Lord?

Voldemort : /HHSSSSSS/

Harry, also speaking parseltongue : wot

** Okay, I'm not sure if it's the one you had in mind, but I know that Easy Fear by XxXxDarkVampirexXxX on AO3 does this for Harry's fourth year, when everyone turns on him after his name comes out of the Goblet. He kinda just snaps and goes "you know what, f*ck you, I'm gonna drive you all batty by insulting you in Parseltongue, because everyone's afraid of it".
