There's fics where harry is a dimension/time traveller who has lived through a war, and still 'shiveres' or 'gulps' when someone like molly weasley narrow their eyes at them and ask a pointed question or something.

It makes no sense. Why the hell should he be afraid? Or concerened?

It infuriates me so much because it throws me out of the immersion of an otherwise well build character.


** Post-War Molly Weasley is a comedy character past her sell-by date, is the thing.

Many of the flaws, or supposed flaws, of the canon novels come from an uneasy transition: things start out as largely whimsical, improbable tales taking place in a detailed but equally whimsical and improbable world --- one populated by whimsical and improbable characters. Not paper cutouts, not caricatures; but "larger-than-life" figures --- who have depth in the way Shakespeare characters have depths, not in a way that directly scales to human psychology.

Then at some point partway through, I think, writing Book 4, Rowling somehow got this notion that she was now writing Serious Dark Fantasy in a setting that had Things To Say about the state of the real world. So more worldbuilding was done to try and make the Wizarding World seem more like a real place, and the excesses of the characters were dialed back a little. But not all of them can escape the shadow of the narrative logic from which they were birthed; whether you make her say "b-tch" or not, Molly Weasley is first and foremost an over-the-top "matronly, forcefully affectionate mother figure" stereotype. And consequently, the characters must continue to treat her as such when she's directly on-page, or it would simply jar too much.

The flaw you describe just replicates the same disconnect already present in canon; refusal to continue harboring this dissonance is part of the root behind the Evil Weasleys trope, I think; it comes from trying to consider Molly Weasley, the Comedy Matron, as if she were literally a real person; and then of course you would find that she isn't "endearingly overbearing", she'd be downright unbearable.

The same problem plagues the likes of Snape or Dumbledore. Snape was a ridiculously over-the-top figure of a bitter old cynic who just hated the world and wasn't shy about letting the world know; but try to make us take him seriously as a tragic figure in a grim-and-gritty depiction of warfare, and blam, (part of) the audience snaps back into Real Life Mode and goes "uh, no, wait, he's still a selfish criminal bastard". Dumbledore was an author mouthpiece, dispenser of moral aphorisms and fantasy mentor; he was dismissive of practical questions because the plot said so, and within the confines of an unrealistic yarn, everybody bought it. But tell us this is a weary war leader with a tragic past, and, oops, real-world logic: facts in hand, one is forced to see him not as the grandfatherly genius he presents himself (and is presented) as, but rather as a foolish and vaguely despicable manipulator.

*** I wonder if you can track this evolution of style through characters, as sorted by their initial introduction. Umbridge, for instance, is introduced in book 5, solidly after the transition to Serious Dark Fantasy with Things To Say (as you put it), and is pretty universally loathed more than Voldemort, the actual main villain of the series. If she were present earlier, say in book 2 or 3 as part of either the Chamber or Sirius plotlines, would she still be the same character?

Slughorn is the only other major supporting character I can think of offhand that's introduced after this transition point. Maybe Bellatrix, sort of? (EDIT: Tonks too.)

**** Tonks? Shacklebolt? Aberforth Dumbledore? Phineas Black? Kreacher? There's a fair few. Depends on how you define "major", but then again, /why/ limit oneself to "major"? Supporting characters are substantial enough to draw conclusions from. And most of them, while they evidence /tendencies/ of Rowling's earlier style, /are/ markedly more subdued in behavior and storyline, as, for that matter, is Slughorn.

Lord Voldemort is interesting because his /genesis/ dates back to the comedy period, but he's introduced just as the turn for the darker is made; hence his character rests in the uneasy balance that his concept fits the aesthetic of the larger-than-life comedy side best, but the narrative persists in treating him like a grim, serious threat. He's the Dark Lord in flowing black robes with glowing red eyes and a pet snake... but he's written as, and everyone acts as though he is, somewhere between a wizard terrorist and a wizard Hitler.

Umbridge is a very interesting example because she kind of comes from yet a third narrative logic: satire. She has most of the excesses of the earlier books, but wouldn't /quite/ have fitted there, because she's not an accepted archetype; rather, she is a caricature of a type of person who actually exists, turned up to eleven. She would be just as hated if she'd been introduced earlier, I think; her garish unpleasantness would likely have been even more over-the-top (there /is/ something of Lockhart in her self-satisfiedness as is). But the thing is, she /wouldn't/ have been introduced earlier.

Bellatrix is, at any rate, the perfect example of a post-transition villain; inasmuch as she is funny and larger-than-life, she is so in the same manner that the Heath Ledger Joker is, so to speak. She's very much a "gritty" character in concept, and there is no disconnect in the narrative treating her as such.

***** I don't know if her /stories/ are all that gripping. They're pretty thin whodunnits papered over with old children's-lit tropes. What she does very well, I think, is churning out iconic characters, easily reducible to a few unique traits and quirks, yet who still haven't worn out their welcome seven books in (mostly). With that, I suppose, comes these characters' growth, and I suppose you could call that "story", but what I mean is that it is in the particulars and execution that she shines, not the plots.

Nor is Rowling that /bad/ a worldbuilder all things considered. The Wizarding World is improbable and self-contradictory, but being realistic wasn't the aim of that worldbuilding; it was meant to be /immersive/ and /attractive/. And that it is, or else people wouldn't be so crazy about wanting to go to Hogwarts. The worldbuilding of the first few books was successful beyond /belief/. What she completely screwed up was trying to turn a Roald Dahl world into Middle-Earth midway through... but can we really blame her? It's kind of trying to fit a round peg in a square hole. Even Tolkien didn't get it quite right when he retconned /The Hobbit/ into his Legendarium.

******* Oh, sure, they're gripping enough. I just don't think the /payoffs/ to these mysteries are reliably good enough to hail them as the main quality of Rowling's writing, because they usually hinge on new revelations about what magic can and can't do that the reader /couldn't/ have seen coming --- if they even explain everything at all. To take only the first book, raise your hand, anyone who could possibly have guessed that Voldemort /could/ be at the back of Quirrell's head and thereby explain the Turban... And, of course, one is reduced to more-or-less-reliable fan theories when it comes to figuring out what the devil the Mirror was doing in that classroom for Harry to stumble upon.

If she was so terrible, we wouldn't be here. For a million word series that got countless people to not only read the series but start reading in general, I'd say she did okay. I don't think people really realize how fucking difficult it is to write what she did. She's pretty mediocre when put up against the greats, but she's certainly not "terrible" compared to them, much less the average writer.

Take a look at Tolkien. Many consider him to be the greatest writer ever, yet he had to literally rewrite the Hobbit to better fit the Lord of the Rings. He also had a ton of retcons, probably more than JKR, and enough out-of-book additions to make Pottermore look like a scrap of paper. And he was a /fantastic/ writer.

This JKR sucks circlejerk is annoying. She's never been great, but this sub seriously exaggerates how bad the series was. I've honestly never seen a group of fans criticize their canon and author as much as Harry Potter fans do.

** Why was he afraid of asking a girl to the ball after dicking around with a dragon? I'd guess it's because he wasn't afraid the girl was going to kill him, but embarrass him. He can't just get on his firebolt or hit her with a stunner to get out of that one. Similarly, he is afraid from some reason that Molly is going to chew him out or make things really weird(I'm not defending the authors here- Molly never lectured Harry, she blamed her own children for everything). The point is you can be afraid of different things in different ways.

He then proceded to almost die of thirst and hunger and heatstroke because he apperently forgot about the watermaking charm (agumenti?) The summoning charm for food, and forgot he knew transfiguration and couldnt magick himself up some shade.. or a hat.. or a cooling charm.. it pissed me off so bad xD Why do authors feel the need to dumb down their hero?

** I think you are missing the point of a scene in which the battle hardened warrior gulps in fear of Molly Weasley.

The fact that it's incongruous is the whole point. It's supposed to illustrate how no matter how old he gets, no matter how many life or death situations he's in, he'll always do as his surrogate mum says.

It's not a ridiculous premise, actually. There are different types of fear and reasons to feel it. While the danger posed by an angry mother-in-law is not the same or as severe as the danger posed by an enemy, you have tools to fight an enemy that you can't use on Molly. It's a very different fear - fear of ostracisation and criticism by a loved one, a surrogate parent, vs fear of harm or death in a fight.

It's something of a trope, but still based in reality - gangster stories, both of the street and mafia style, often have characters where it is mentioned that despite being hardmen out on the street, they still say "yes mum" whenever told to do something. I mean, take the iconic 50 Cent tweet "can't believe my Grandmother is making me take out the garbage, I'm rich I don't need this shit" is an example of this sort of behaviour in real life. 50 has been shot multiple times and generally done many more dangerous things than argue with his Grandmother, but when she says take out the trash he does it. He can shoot back if a rival gangster attacks him, and he doesn't care what they think of him. But Grandma? He deeply cares about her opinion of him, has no legitimate recourse except verbal argument if she gets upset etc, and will have been conditioned since before he was a gun toting badass to follow her orders.

An entirely different fear, with an entirely different response.

There are vicious war criminals who've tortured people and been shot, who will still bow their heads and nod when their mums tell them off.

Or remember that rioter in the US whose mum came and beat him with a sandal and took him home? He would have turned and beaten the shit out of a stranger who tried to stop him, but you can't cold-cock your own mother even if she is embarrassing you and hitting you with a sandal, and since you stand to harm or lose a deeply important established familial relationship instead of a possible relationship with a stranger, that means your responses are limited.
