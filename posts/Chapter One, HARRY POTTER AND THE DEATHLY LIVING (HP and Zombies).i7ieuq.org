There was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and horrible things would soon be happening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione could only feel anxious for their upcoming class: double Potions with Slytherin. Their whole day so far had been taxing and exhausting, especially for Ron, who had accidentally turned himself into a mouse during Transfiguration. After a near-death experience with Crookshanks and a restless stay in a hamster wheel at the Hospital Wing, his front teeth were still longer than usual.

“How many points d'you reckon Snape'll take from Gryffindor this time?” Ron squeaked, his voice a little mouse-y.

“At least twice as much as he gives Slytherin,” mumbled Harry glumly. “If he's in a good mood.”

“So, even worse? We'll see Dumbledore tap-dance before we see Snape in a good mood.”

The trio brushed their way past a giggling group of first-year Ravenclaws, who had a book open to Uric the Oddball and the jellyfish he wore as a hat. The overcast weather brought a cool draft from the east, comfortably chilling the grounds as the wind rushed through the trees. The giant squid in the lake had surfaced to cool itself off, basking in the pleasant reprieve from the recent heat. It was October, and Halloween was nearly upon them.

“You two ought to have a better attitude if you want to learn anything,” remarked Hermione as the castle door swung open before them. “As for myself, I'm excited for today's lesson! I find Gregory the Smarmy quite fascinating.”

“That your new boyfriend?” teased Ron.

“Honestly, Ronald?” Some days, it was all Hermione could do to not smack him upside his freckled head with an 800-page book. “Gregory the Smarmy was a potioneer from the Middle Ages. In the 12th century AD, he crafted the Unctuous Unction, a potion that convinces the drinker that whoever gave it---”

“She knows enough about everything for all three of us,” Ron remarked to Harry.

“Then you'd better start taking your classes seriously!” Hermione scolded. “Our fifth year O.W.L.s won't be group exams, in case you were wondering!”

“Those aren't for another year,” Ron complained. “Stop making us worry for longer than---blimey, is that that time?!”

Harry's eyes darted to a grandfather clock in a nearby alcove. Rather than showing what time it was, this clock was enchanted to show how much time you had left until your next appointment. Its minute hand pointed to /10 minutes late, mustn't wait!/

They broke into a jog. How long had they been out on the grounds? How could they be so careless, especially with Snape's class? Here they were, joking about how harsh Snape would be on Gryffindor, and giving him an excuse to take more points away!

An agonized scream broke the silence in the narrow hallway. Witches and wizards in the enchanted portraits turned left and right, muttering as they tried to locate the source of the sound. Harry grasped Ron and Hermione by their shoulders, stopping them all dead in their tracks. He paused, listening for the sound again, not daring to move a muscle.

“I'd bet my new chess set Neville's finally cracked,” whispered Ron.

“Shhhh!” ordered Hermione, louder than Ron's whisper.

Harry took a hesitant step forward, peering around the corner to a staircase landing. The stairs wound further into the cold darkness of the dungeons, where Snape's potion class had already started. But as they listened again, it sounded as though someone---or something---had different plans for today's lesson.

There was another scream, more desperate and pleading than the first, then a rush of frantic footsteps. From up the stairs came Lavender Brown, her hair askew and her robes coated in blood. Her face was pale and streaked with tears. But even as she caught Harry's eye, she stumbled and fell flat on her face. Writhing in panic, she shrieked as something out of view dragged her back into the dungeons. Her fingernails left lines on the stone as she resisted the thing's pull. A final, tormented scream, a deep, gravelly moan, and there was nothing left to break the silence...
