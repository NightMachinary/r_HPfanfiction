I'm looking for stories with OC's/ next gen kids living their Hogwarts life. Just being a student in Hogwarts can be so incredible, so reading a well made story about kids~teens studying there and living their life can be great. Bonus points if it's about muggleborns.

For reference, I love Realmer06, and the story Hogwarts Houses Divided (which is so uncannon it's practically OC)


** Going to self-plug on this one: no OC/next-gen, but my fic Victoria Potter is (for now) focused on Hogwarts life.

*** Strongly recommend this fic. Probably Taure's best written work yet-- Victoria is quite distinct from Harry, kids are kids but still interesting, the bits of magic explored are done extremely well (as usual for a Taure fic) and make you want more worldbuilding not less, and the plot has diverged quite nicely from canon.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances.

** Have you read the Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom? It was a seven-year fic for Albus going through Hogwarts, though it is not exactly canon with regards to CC.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

*** I read the first a few years ago. As far as I can remember it felt a bit off, a bit too musch like the originals- a Slytherin evil potion master was there if I recall correctly. Maybe I'll try it again.

  Amidst a struggling Muggle economy, two children are delivered questionable letters by a woman with a pointy hat and broomstick. Is there really an entire Magical world, hidden just out of sight, offering a chance at another life? Or do the same mechanisms that steer the Muggle world remain, regardless of wherever you go?
