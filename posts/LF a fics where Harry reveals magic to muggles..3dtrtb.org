  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!

** linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) isn't /quite/ what you're looking for, but it has a really interesting portrayal of internet conspiracy forums slowly putting together the pieces from archived security cam footage of obliviated events, satellite photography of inhabited areas that don't show up on maps, etc., etc. It's heading towards a reveal (the story's still in progress) and as it gets closer it's become apparent that /at least/ two parties are trying to manipulate the reveal toward their own ends.

Notable for being a super-Harry fic but avoiding roflstompiness by using this conspiracy as a deliberately vague, amorphous, un-roflstomp-able threat. (Voldemort's still an issue, too. There are a lot of players in this game, and they all have their own ends which aren't necessarily related.)

** You can try The Perils of Innocence by Avidreader. It has Harry being left at an institute for children with behavioral problems by his relatives at the age of 5. Years later he meets not only Hermione, but Dean too. There not only discover their powers, but learn to control them. The institute staff are fully supportive of the children as well as the parents of Hermione and Dean. Kinda goes in the vein of how detrimental the waiting till 11 is and how behind the times the wizarding world is, but still utterly fascinating. The trio are intelligent, but not super powered.
