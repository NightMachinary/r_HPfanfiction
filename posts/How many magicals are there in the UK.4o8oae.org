If Hogwarts is the only magical school in the UK and it can educate 1,000 students, then there's about 150 students per year (even if some students drop out after OWLS, there still has to be fewer than 200 per class). There doesn't seem to be any evidence that witches and wizards live past their 120s, and if we assume a guesstimated simple modern population profile of flat until middle age then linear decline, then there's about 15,000 magicals in the UK (150 × 130 × 0.75 = 14,625).

What does that imply about magical society? For example, the (muggle) UK has only about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_number_of_police_officers][300 police officers per 100,000 population]], which would loosely suggest that a magical population of 15k would only need about 50 aurors for day-to-day law enforcement. A simple one hundred Death Eaters would be a serious threat (or even just 20 really), and a dozen or two aurors being killed by Death Eaters would be devastating.

I've seen fanfics which posited UK magical populations in the millions, which to me would have required Hogwarts be one of dozens of similarly-sized schools in the UK. What's your headcanon?


** The thing is, we see no evidence in canon that Hogwarts has 1000 students. It seems to be a lot less. For example there's only one teacher per subject. I would put the number at closer to 40-50 students per year, which means if people live to around 120 on average, there'd be 4800-6000 magical people in Britain. This fits quite nicely with the small town "everyone knows everyone else" feel of magical Britain.

Also, remember that Aurors aren't really police. They don't do day to day law enforcement, rather they're dark wizard hunters and do some VIP bodyguard duties too. Most law enforcement seems to be done directly by civil servants (e.g. Arthur Weasley both writes legislation and enforces it by going on raids), and "beat cops" are the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol.

My headcanon for Auror numbers is around 10-15.

*** I can buy 40-50 students per class. That's what we actually see in the books and JKR is pretty upfront about being bad at maths which makes the "1000 students at Hogwarts" and "1000:1" viol8r mentions below as suspect even if author statements. 5-6k would be a very personal community.

** I've seen numbers from 3000 UK human magicals to 100,000, all attributed to JKR in some fashion.

It's an interesting area to speculate on. I've tried to work out what level of population would be required to have an extensive government sector, a publishing sector, 2 shopping districts (Diagon and Hogsmeade), a daily paper and so on. It would certainly need a population larger than 3000 if there was no magic.. but there is.

iirc Arthur said there were (100 or was it 500?) wizards building the World Cup stadium over the course of months? a stadium seated 100,000 and was filled..

whatever the figure anyone is comfortable with, 'magical world 'isn't really possible, at least to me.. magical cult/ magical subculture/ hidden magical tribe but not world..

**** Indeed. And when the population is perfectly mobile (able to transport instantly across the globe for free via arranged Portkeys) there really is no significant barrier to having a very large proportion of the wizarding world attend a single event.

******* /shrug/ We're dealing with magic here. Maybe there's more magical energy in the air? Maybe inbreeding causes magic to die out, so countries with less prejudice against muggle/wizard unions don't produce as many squibs? Or maybe is the exact opposite and more conservative countries do have more wizards being born?

Could be a variety of things considering we don't /actually/ know how magic comes about. It seems to be genetic, two wizards are not certain to porduce a wizard. And two muggles can. So we can just make up our own scenario, really

******** I noticed on the wikia that [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mahoutokoro_School_of_Magic][Mahoutokoro]] is described as having the smallest student body of all the schools (apparently, only eleven in the world?) -- which struck me as odd because Japan has about twice the population as the UK. Maybe a lot of Japanese magicals go to the Chinese magical school (which isn't on the wikia, but there /must/ be one, right?).

You'd think so, wouldn't you? If you consider that China has a population of over 20 times that of the UK, the number of Chinese Muggleborns (assuming uniform probability) would make up a significant number of students on its own.

********** Of the 40-ish names we know of in Harry's class at Hogwarts, I believe only three of them are first-generation magicals (Hermione, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Kevin Entwhistle) which suggests the British ratio is about 5-10%. If the Chinese ratio is the same then Chinese muggleborns /alone/ might be double that of the entire British magical population.

My headcanon, I imagine that China still has an imperial magical court, despite no longer having an emperor (that we know of, at least). I wonder how the CCCP deals with their magicals -- they might see them as a regressive† threat, but I imagine the Indian government has a much better relationship with their magical population which would be an incentive for China not to risk a poor relationship with their own (let alone "conquering" their magicals).

† That's not quite the right word. What word am I looking for here?

** 1:1000 mage to muggle is soft canon(What JKR has stated, not written in the books) I believe. Using the enrollment of a school coming out of a war is a poor choice of population estimation due to the many, many factors that would be ignored.

** I know I've linked [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][this]] before, but it's a very thorough examination of Harry Potter by the numbers. The conclusions drawn are essentially:

- At least, but not much more than, 10,000 wizards in Britain.
- Around 2,000 of them live in Hogsmeade.
- The population of Hogwarts is around 600. Harry's year is irregularly small -- Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin each have about ten students, and Ravenclaw has about twenty -- so 50 students as opposed to around 80 in other years.
- The Ministry of Magic has around 1,000 workers.

The logic is very thorough, but relies on the numbers Harry, Ron, Arthur, Lupin and the like to be close to accurate. (Which I think is pretty reasonable to assume)

** I think JKR would freely admit that numbers are not her strong suit. A great world-builder. yes, but a maths person she is not. Any attempt at trying to figure our the numbers of the wizarding world, whether it be the economy or population, is going produce conflicting or unsatisfying results.

I would personally put the population of wizarding Britain at around 10-15k (because it feels right), and would say that Britain has a larger proportion of the world's magical population than the muggle population, if only because I think British magicals are more likely to have stayed at home when their muggle counterparts emmigrated throughout the British Empire.

** My headcanon is that half of the world's magical population (from China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan & Bangladesh) decided to handle the Statute of Secrecy by migrating to a hidden land. A few stayed behind, always looking for muggleborns in order to quickly spirit them away. Some call it Xanadu, or Nirvana, or the Celestial Bureaucracy or freakin' Hotel California, but the essence of the matter is, if you're East Asian and not directly descended from European colonial wizards (or part of the ever-defiant Japanese-Korean peninsula holdouts), you go there.

So around 10k UK magicals, <1 million non-Asian worldwide.

** I always worked on the assumption that they're around the size of Iceland in population. Why? Because Iceland is one of the smallest societies in the world that has been big enough to prevent extensive inbreeding. Also, 300.000 is a nice sweetspot where economies and social structures get interesting. Its big enough for a few artists to make a living, have the funds for soldiers, and so on and so forth.

That also means that I assume that there are other schools of magic in Britain, or at least other ways of education. I created the Dartmoor School of Magic, the St.Helena Academy of Magic and the North Rona Academy of Witchcraft as well as a structure for apprenticeships in magic.

For Law Enforcement I always assumed 200 Aurors and 300 Hit-Wizards and another 500, Officers (like Mr. Weasley) and Officials (secretaries, archivers, prosecuters) in the bureaus.
