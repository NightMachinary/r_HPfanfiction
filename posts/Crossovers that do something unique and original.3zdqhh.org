So I just finished reading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Master's Ball) and I thought the way in which the author linked together the two universes was brilliant. Are there any other crossovers that are well-written like this and do something that makes them noticeable in the cesspit that is crossover?

I'm now moving on to reading the sequels. Hope they're good.


** Other than the obvious linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) I've avoided crossovers because the lack of quality is particularly obvious in that area.

You should give that a shot, its well written and complete which is very rare is crossovers. Also a universe you almost certainly know.

** The only crossover i've read that's held my attention is linkffn(Wand and Shield) , however it's not complete and has weird irregular updates. The best part about this story is how harry still seems in character yet blends into the world of the avengers perfectly.

Now if only the author would update it already, i end up having to reread half the fic again because of his random resurrections of the it.

** Though it's a bit light and not the highest quality of writing, I enjoyed how the crossing of universes was handled in linkffn(The Best Seven Years by Blu Taiger), a Calvin & Hobbes/Harry Potter crossover. In particular, I thought the way the author worked in Hobbes was nicely done.

** linkffn(7748339) is a fave for how it avoided all the normal cliches. Pyro/Brotherhood/X-Men have little contact with the wizarding world. Instead, John and Harry meet and build a relationship in the mundane Privet Drive after HBP. The first part of the story happens during that summer where their respective roles are temporarily on hold. The next part takes place after the wizarding war ends.

Again, nothing overpowered. People are in character. There's abusive!Vernon, but the violence is a new development and it's done in a way that makes sense. It doesn't bash Harry's other relationships either. It's just really well done when many crossovers of this type go completely off the rails.

** linkffn(8616362) - Harry Potter: The Last Avatar.

It's a great story which is more a fusion of the HP world with elemental manipulation instead of magic. One of my favourites.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4044086/1/Strength-of-Brothers][Strength of Brothers]] In which Naruto and Harry Potter have shared dreams, and share what they know with eachother, Harry being a year older for some reason and taking the role of the older brother.

The excuse of this is Luna's mother, who is so often an Unspeakable, attempts some experiment to establish a link to a distant reality at the same time a giant fox demon gets sealed by a deathgod and Harry get's zapped by a curse that should kill; and that fucks shit up in the best possible way, though then the author ruins that explanation a tiny bit by revealing Luna has been linked with dozens of people in dreams including a giant tree, and reveals to Harry that his link is far stronger as they consider themselves brothers, and sooner or later, when they use too much power the link will break, snapping one of them into the other's dimension. Though it has an unexpected consequence when it does happen.

Still, a fantastic fanfiction, the only downside is it ends just before the shippuden timeskip for Naruto and at the end of the triwizard tournament for harry, it's complete, but there should be a sequel and isnt and likely won't be one.

Still well worth the read however, and I don't think I've seen any other fic where the majority of it being a cross over is shared dreams with another person in another reality. If you read naruto harry crossovers, you'll know there's a few pen pals type fics out there, and this fic takes that to it's logical extreme without plopping the elemental nations on Earth.
