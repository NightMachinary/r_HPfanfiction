Got a really lovely and nice guest review today.

So I did. Thankfully I live on the first floor of a one floor high house. I got up after jumping off the roof, dusted myself off, and had a lovely walk in the park before going home.


** I always get a chuckle out of these types of reviews and, assuming I can, I will reply with a smiley face.

Gets them every time.

*** Oooh. I like that. They're posting this to get a reaction out of people, so not giving them a reaction is the best thing to do. You got a nice way of dealing with it.

Now if only I could reply to guest reviews . . .

** Honestly, if you have someone to check for actual errors in punctuation, grammar, and sentence structure then ignore reviews entirely. The ratio of vitriol to useful feedback is too damn large.

While I am on the topic, has the usage of beta's fallen? I feel as time goes on the lesser known fics have no credit for one or have obvious issues that weren't once as prevalent.

*** Hopping onto soapbox.

I hope this isn't an attempt to blame an author for the doucherie of an antisocial little pissant who left a review attempting to goad said author into suicide. It doesn't matter what kind of story it was it didn't deserve this.

Hops off of soapbox.

**** I am not blaming anybody. I just wanted to know what kind of story would cause someone to write something like that. Now that I know what was written I kann safely assume the reviewer is a jerk

***** A story written using words. Those people don't need anything to be unpleasant, that's just what they do because they have no actual lives.
