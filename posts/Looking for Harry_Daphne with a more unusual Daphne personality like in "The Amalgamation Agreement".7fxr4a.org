For those of you who have read The Amalgamation Agreement linkffn(11487772) you will likely understand what I mean. For those who have not...

Basically I am looking for Harry/Daphne pairings where Daphne is not represented in a typical "pureblood princess", or "ice queen" style, or any similar style. I want unusual. Think Daphne being more like Luna or perhaps acting more like a muggleborn, or maybe shes simply "a hot mess" lol. Basically without spoiling the Amalgamation Agreement, in the story she is an unknown to Harry, but shes most definitely not your typical pureblood princess type, and is quite rebellious towards her family, knows a lot about the muggle world that she often escapes to (for example she reads comic books) and has quite a dirty (curseword) mouth and propensity to be a bit out there or spacey.

I would really prefer more mature rated fics, so in all likelyhood its going to have to be an older Harry/Daphne situation, and smut/lemons are welcome but plot first if possible. Also I dont mind a multi but would prefer just a Harry/Daphne (but no male slash pls).

  A slightly more vindictive, studious Harry. A slightly more stubborn Hermione. A complete destruction of fanon!Daphne.

  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person in the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG
