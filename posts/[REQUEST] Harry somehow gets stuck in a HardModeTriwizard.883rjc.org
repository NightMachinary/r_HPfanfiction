So the idea is that, due to some fluke or the rules governing the Goblet, Harry is forced to participate in a super-difficult, literally-designed-to-be-the-actual-deadliest-thing, the-Triwizard-is-the-toned-down-version-we-let-schoolkids-compete-in , gladiator tournament thing. It essentially becomes Harry vs The Goblet with Delacour vs Krum vs Diggory as backup dancers


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Potter Grimoire) Harry willingly enters the Triwizard, which is declared to be a Grand Triwizard Tournament by the black flames of the Goblet, and the first task involves the deadliest dragons in the world. Cedric fills in as a mentor for Harry.

*** Wow um does the writing get better? I'm on chapter 2 I think and the whole Hermione Harry Weasley interaction feels so wrong. The part about family magics

***** Probably spoilers ahead:

Ok I'm really not trying to be too mean or anything. I think this is genuinely the worst fanfic I've read so far. Maybe it's because I generally only read recommendations, which doesn't mean that all fics that I've read were great. I mean the writing, the wide gaping plotholes, the characters, the plot itself, the weird grimoire, Hermione bashing, Harry with the whole "would my parents want it?", The family magics thing (if you let anyone know, your soul will get sucked out of your family), just all of it.

But worst of all is the whole black grandtriwizard thing. Snape makes it clear that he wouldn't want anyone entering since death is guaranteed and it's worse than war. Harry asks McGonagall and flitwick if they think his parents would want him to enter and the both of them, in addition to Harry's friends, say: yeah sure your parents would be proud of you!!! Honor and glory!!!!

And every once in a while there is a sentence in here that is so weird that I suspect that the bad quality is done on purpose.

I will try to read on, just like someone who watches a bad movie to watch a bad movie. Again im sorry if I offended anyone but I'm speechless. Again I've read many bad fics but this is below my immortal if you ask me.

******* To be honest I'm sure there are lots of people who are better at this. Especially since I, myself struggle with creative writing a lot. But if you make a thread here then I'm sure that you'd get a lot of constructive criticism
