I was thinking something along the lines of Craig, from the giant hamster/peruvian flute band episode of South Park, but I'll take anything that fits.

Alternatively, another character playing this role while the trio keep biting all the plot hooks they can find works too.

Any recommendations?


** Have you read Harry Potter and the Natural 20?

The genre saavy one is the character from dnd 3.5 and it gets weird but fun. (Things like having Harry make a list of everything that might be relevant to the plot)

** I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for but I thought I would recommend it anyway. Humorous fic and very well-written. Summary is Harry decides if he's fated to die he might as well try to escape all the bs and live. But when is anything Harry ever does easy?

** I recommend this one, it's one of my favourites. Harry is /kind/ of like what you described, sometimes getting dragged into it / because he has to do the right thing. It's a recurring theme.

The fic has got good action - - grit, humour, adventure, plot, and light romance. I really like the fighting scenes and use of magic without making Harry op at all.

Edit: getting dragged into it is a recurring joke/theme but Harry is also definitely a prankster and too investigative for his own good.

** The curse of the protagonist, huh? I have a pure crack rec, not exactly the same as what you were looking for, but follows a similar gist.

*** Harry's comic ability seems to be an Informed Ability in this one. Not as good as a crack fic is expected to be, if I'm being honest.
