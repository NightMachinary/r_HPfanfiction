I would like to read fanfiction similar to self preservation from coffeeonthepatio. I loved Harry's innocence, and how that father / son relationship developed. So I would like to be able to read something that fills my heart with tenderness like this fanfic.

Please keep them long, finished or updated often and not Slash.

Thank you.

** Only one I ever liked was the R trilogy by greengecko. Has a lot of cool magic in it, and the only thing I didn't really like was the severitus relationship itself.

** Linkffn(A New Place to Stay by Debstheslytherinsnapefan)

This story is by far my favorite. I re-read it a lot because it is amazing. Also completed, so no need to worry about new chapters, etc.

Edit: Not sure if it has the tenderness you are looking for but it does stay in character with their canon selves for the most part

  Harry is called up to Dumbledore's office at the end of his fourth year and told he is to go and live with Severus Snape. Severus does what no one else bothered to do― he takes care of Harry. Watch as Harry flourishes to all that he was meant to be: A Slytherin with a heart of a lion. No slash. Will Harry be able to beat Voldemort and save the people he loves? Read and find out.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** Hey, I've got a ton I can give you, do you have a Reading site preference? The majority of The ones I read are on FF.net although I think some of them are reposted on AO3 I can't seem to find the fic you speak about in your post though, I haven't read it and would love to read it.

*** Oh thank you very much! Any site is fine, I read on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] or Ao3, it's the same for me.

​

As for the Fic I'm talking about, it was on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] for a while, but they deleted it. Although you can download it from this [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=coffeeonthepatio&sort=title][link]]

**** Dam, that website has huge access ability issues as I'm blind and I can't download it, I love on the corner I read it on FF.net, so I bet that one is amazing. Do you know if you have to download it on laptop or should it work on a phone? It's just not working for me. Give me a few and I'll get a whole list written out for you, would you prefer every link to the thick that I recommend? Or would the author and title be okay? They will all be on FF.net

***** Well you can download it both on your computer and on your cell phone, since you can use an Epub application, such as cool reader, which I think is one of the most complete.

For the fanfics I would like some where Harry was less than 11 years old, that is, before he entered Hogwarts. Since I think he can get on better with Snape that way, at least that's how it was in Self Preservation. Severus had to adopt little Harry, and it turned into a beautiful Father / Son relationship. And so far I have not found another fanfiction that fills my heart like that. And be fine just with the title and the author.

​

Thank you!

****** Obscura Nox Animae, by Heatherlly. It is finished, incredibly long and well written, although it might not be everybody's cup of tea. It's a Snily but not cliche, it's hard to explain so I think you best look this one up if you are interested. Always in your shadow, by Arinus. A very good and well written Snape's daughter fanfic, it works, I usually don't like things like this but it was great. It's completed too.

Harry Potter and the battle of wills, by Jocelyn. Harry Potter and the enemy within, by Theowyn of HPG. What's Owed, by ruth7019. Moment of impact, by Suite Sambo. Visions of sugarplums danced in their heads, by fawkesfeathers. O Mine Enemy, by Kirby Lane. A very long ongoing, steady updates every two weeks. Incredibly well written, quite slow, Snape mentors Harry and there's a lot on mind magic which is great. I love it. Unfortunately Harry is about 15 here, but it's still really great.

crime and punishment, by mlocatis. Another Snape mentors Harry, very very well written and well structured, not finished, updates are sporadical, but recent so it's not officially abandoned or anything like that. It's definitely worth a read if it's your type of thing. This author writes a lot of Snape mentors Harry, I am reading one at the moment that will probably be up your street by the same author called Snape's promise.

Have you heard of an author called Snapegirlkmf, there are a lot of her fics that have young Harry raised by Snape, although I do feel that he is a little bit more out of character, Snape that is. There is also a great one called bond by Crystal Cove too. Hope this helps.

******* Wow, thank you very much. I'm going to trust your tastes then and feast on all these fanfictions. Snily's I had already recommended it to my brother, but Lily is my least favorite character in the whole saga, however I think I should give it a try.

P.S. You really have to look for a way that you can read "self preservation", it really is quite good and one of those few fanfiction that really manages to reach your heart. And if the problem is the format, you could also change it to pdf.

******** I'm quite hard to please and they were all absolutely brilliant. I'm quite new to this platform so not sure how private messaging works on here but I'd love to know what you think, although don't feel pressured to let me know or anything I'm just curious about other peoples opinions. Luckily I've managed to get in touch with one of my friends who is very technology savvy and I started reading it tonight, I'm on the seventh chapter already and it's so brilliant. I'm loving it.
