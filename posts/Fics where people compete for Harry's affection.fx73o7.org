Got me wondering - I know I've read something like this before, and I'm sure there are fics out there, but fics (probably comedic fics) where a bunch of people are all out there competing over Harry sound fun. I'm personally not a fan of slash, but if anything comes to mind please still post it so others who do enjoy it are included.
