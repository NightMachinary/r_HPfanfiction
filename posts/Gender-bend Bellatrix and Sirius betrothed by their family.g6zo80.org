As the title says. That day it occurred to me that in a universe where Sirius is female and Bellatrix is male it would be very likely for their parents to want for them to marry. Walburga and Orion are cousins themselves, and marrying two eldest-borns would unite the two branches and keep the family line pure. In canon, it doesn't work so well because Bella is 8 years older than Sirius, and the Blacks, being terribly conservative, would not think it possible. But if the gender is reversed here it might actually work (the age difference is still large but less of the problem for the Blacks). I always think of them as very similar individuals, equally intense and passionate for their very different values, loyal to loved ones, prone to obsession, and both have a streak of ruthlessness when provoked. It's also my headcanon that they look almost the same. Knowing that they are to eventually marry while growing up would bring an altogether another dimension into their otherwise mutually hateful relationship. They might still hate each other's guts but also feel some strange and irresistible attraction to one another, in a sort of Cathy-and-Heathcliff fashion. It has the potential to be very dark and is a good place to explore some erotic tension if one wants to go in that direction.

Edit: I think as names Bellerophon and Séraphine would work. Bellerophon is a hero in Greek mythology that tried to ride his flying horse Pegasus to Olympus to join the gods and was struck down by Zeus for his arrogance. Séraphine is a French name from the biblical seraphim and means "fiery one".

Edit 2: Alternatively this could start a crackfic where Séraphine fake dates and fake sleeps with and fake run-away with an increasing number of unlikely people just to ruin her own reputation and get out of the engagement.


** This sounds awesome.
