As the title says. I was reading a Harmione fic that I normally like (Champions Champion), but had to stop when the sickening sweetness between Harry and Hermione began. So now I wanted to know which ships have the best fics in your opinion. By best, I mean fleshed out, understandable(as in no spontaneous romance) and preferably no marriage contracts, although it's fine if they do have marriage contracts. TIA


** Harry/Bellatrix fics are few, but large percentage of them are really good and popular here:

Interestingly, all 4 of them are time travels and deal with pre Death Eater Bellatrix.

*** TBF, it's probably difficult to ship Harry with psycho DE Bellatrix, even if that hasn't stopped Snarry, Tomarry, and Drarry fans

** I'm sure every ship has some good fics, but I only read Harry-centric, and different ships typically offer different types of stories.

Like Harmony usually has some sort of muggle wank, Haphne pureblood politics, H/Luna comedy, H/Susan effective govt, etc etc.

There have been some good posts on this sub that have solid recs for all those, better than I could come up with on the spot right now, so I'll just leave you a link for my fav crack fic, in honor of you reading The Champion's Champion.

  My first ever challenge response, from the Thank God You're Here thread on DLP. Just a little crack!fic oneshot. Reasonably good response for it on there, so please enjoy. The premise: 'A confused Ron finds Hermione's Dildo'

** I am not really into romance stuff but I think the Harry/Ginny and the Harry/Hermione ones are least likely to be attached to a specific repetitive trope (even though Harry/Hermione tends to also occur a lot in Lord Hadrian Potter or Harry accidentally ending up at Grangers before Hogwarts or Weasley/Dumbledore bashings, but if you skip those... some are really cool) and most likely to see original ideas.

** Harry/Luna is generally very cute IMO, and Harry/Hermione is a close second. Harry/Luna isn't very common, but the fics I've found with the pairing are very much gems.

For slashers--- well, overall, I'd have to stick with Drarry because I've never seen a good Tomarry or Snarry fic (both of the ships are way too out of my comfort zone), and the sheer volume of Drarry fics makes it so that the pairing with the most high-quality fics is this pairing. That said, the best slash fic I've read to date has been the annoyingly-rare Harry/Cedric pairing.

****** LullabyKnell's Harry/Cedric fic is also really good I think the title is something about â€˜he strayed across the path' or something. Still incomplete, I think but it's great

*** I don't think it's fleshed out. I don't think its a great fic, but I read it because I'm immature and like fart jokes. I just can't read it anymore because I can't deal with the sickening Harmione parts.

Also, I feel like it's not really a crackfic, but more a Weasley and Dumbledore bash fic

** Every ship has some good and bad stories. Yes, [[https://angua9.livejournal.com/204545.html][Harmony stories]] tend to be too sweet and their relationships too boring, which is the reason [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/anti-harmony-or-notebooks-and-letters.html][I generally prefer]] Hinny (which tend to be usually much more dynamic and dramatic), but yes there are some over-sweetened Hinny stories as well, and yes Hinny (or more specifically [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][the canon Ginny]]) has some problems as well.

** I honestly think that people measure quality really differently but I find there are really high quality Harry/Theo and Hermione/Regulus or Hermione/multi fics. But I think that's just a numbers game. The thing with rair pairs is that the percentage of quality fics is sometimes higher because there aren't many fics and you want to do a good job with them. But also it tends to mean there is less repetition.

That said some of the best fics I've read in this fandom were Harry/Draco. It's just there is a lot more trash in that tag too

eta: I just realised you said The best rather than the most good fics. In that sense I would still go for the ones above because they're the ones with my favourite fics in them

** I actually really enjoy Harry x Bellatrix as a ship. It's mostly time travel and I can actually see some of it happen. Sadly, there aren't that many completed fics.
