No Weasley Bashing where the Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune.

I don't want perfect characters. I want characters with flaws, maybe they try to overcome the flaws or maybe they keep them.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash etc. Doesn't have to be focused on pairings.

Stories where girls are friends with other girls and we're shown that. Or stories where they help out with whatever is happening with the plot, etc. We seemed to have male/female interaction or male/male interaction in the books way more than we did female/female interaction.

*** In Harry Potter? It's cause there's not many actually developed female characters (my sister reads these books religiously. She can't tell me the main thing about more than like 5 female characters cause that's really all there is lol. Obviously I'm exaggerating a bit, but you get the point).

In the greater fandom universe, I think it's probably because stereotypically, it's guys writing stuff. Like, not trying to be sexist here, but from my experience, most writers are men, and have been for a very long time. Societal pressure being what it is, is imagine it's a lot harder for a woman to be a writer as well, which just compounds he problem.

And since most writers are men, unless it's a self absorbant guy writing F/F interactions (which almost exclusively happens in harem stories from my experience) it seems like a logical jump

That being said, these are theory's. I have no proof for anything except Harry Potter specifically. Just some guesses I took based on my logic.

**** This sort of came up last week re: redeeming Bellatrix vs Snape and this sub's general take on why it's okay to write a redeemed Bellatrix, but not a redeemed Snape.

So, since the inception of the modern version of fanfiction with the Star Trek TOS fanzines in the 1960s, roughly 80% of fic writers have been female.

The only reason it appears otherwise /here/ is because reddit is roughly 70% male, and based on a 2016 poll, this subreddit is like 58% male. The reason you don't see as much femslash is because straight women don't tend to fetishize it while they do fetishize m/m slash, much like straight men don't fetishize gay porn but will watch f/f scenes. There certainly /is/ femslash written by lesbians, but much like the existence of f/f porn that's obviously more for male viewers than female, a lot of femslash is weird and fetish-y.

Also: The claim that it's harder for women to be writers is very sexist. Unless, you mean that there is a long-standing tradition of ignoring or laughing women writers out of publishing offices, so women find it much more difficult to become /published/ authors. Many women writers historically have had to go by masculine pennames to even get published. Rowling was published only 24 years ago and had to go by initials because the publishing house was certain that no one was going to read a coming-of-age story about a boy written by a middle aged woman named Joanne.

** I would say most stories, but I realize that might be most stories I read.

Obviously anything with a female main character. For example, Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire or Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass linkffn(12188150). HGatGoF has some good McGonagal/Hermione interaction.

HGatGoF: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

You have characters like Amelia Bones in Petrification Proliferation linkffn(11265467).

Stages of Hope has their main quad group of characters... broken. Very broken. Lily tries to help. Keyword tries. linkffn(6892925)

(oh wait, you want F/F interaction not just prominent female characters. I don't recall if LGoSitH or Petrification Proliferation has that, but HGatGof and Stages of Hope all do).

Special other fandom callout: Don't Look Back by acuteneurosis, a fic where Princess Leia travels back to the clone wars. The primary relationship in the fic is between Leia and Padme and Leia and Shmi. Warning: 320K words make sure to be well fed and watered before entering.

** linkao3(coven by naidhe) it's written mostly from Hermione's perspective and has her becoming friends with Pansy Parkinson when they accidentally rediscover covens by inadvertently swapping blood and boosting their power. Originally they just want to replicate the effects but over time they become friends. They both have flaws: Hermione and rigid black and white thinking, Pansy and her ruthlessness/selfishness but they balance each other out well. It focuses on their friendship and the friendship with 5 other girls that they bring into the coven one by one, including an incredibly accurate portrayal of an OC with OCD. Incredible read but unfortunately unfinished.
