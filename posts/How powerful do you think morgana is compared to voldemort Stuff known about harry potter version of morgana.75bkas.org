People say voldemort is the most powerful dark wizard to ever live but I think morgana would annihilate him

What is known in universe about morgana ?


** That depends on Voldemort's AP ratio, how much CC he has in his kit, and the cooldown on his ultimate. Plus, I bet he cant go both support and mid like Morgana can :)

*** Yeah, Voldemort's pure glass cannon. Cruciatas DOT, AK skillshot, and Imperious stun is short term, if Harry is anything to go by. Assuming the Rift has an Anti App jinx set up, the only mobility he has is his flight, and that wouldn't kick in until he gets out of combat. Easy prey for Morgana's root.

Though I bet he and Annie would get along well. One's got a demon bear and the other has a fiendfyre snake.

You misunderstand how Horcruxes work. They are anchors, not "spare lives" like in a video game. As long as they all exist, he can keep coming back from the dead indefinitely, they aren't "used up" every time he comes back to life.

Er, no? His trademark Killing Curse is literally the only known unblockable curse.

****** Basically nothing. She's considered a powerful Dark Witch of history, she was a bird animagus, and she was presumably connected to the HP Merlin too but even that's unclear. Assuming it is the case, then it's likely she went to Hogwarts in the same general period as him, meaning she would likely have been taught directly by the Founders rather than their successors.

** There is not much on her in canon. You could maybe assume that some of the Arthurian myths are true about her, but as far as actual HP canon goes, she was famous enough to get on a chocolate card. That's it.

Compared to Voldemort? Well, I am a believer of the opinion that in the HP universe magical theory and practice is getting developed to be better over time; that there is research being done. So, if you put 20th century Voldemort against Morgana, he'd just wipe the floor with her. A lot of wizards and witches would wipe the floor with her, because they know modern magic.

Comparison. Its like setting the greatest medieval swordfighter there ever was against an soldier with an SMG. Were they on equal footing equipment-wise, the swordfighter would win every time. But like this the soldier is just gonna blast the swordfighter full of bullets and be done with it. Voldemort has 800 (?) years of magical research over Morgana. She is simply out-equipped in a fight.

But even all this is just bla bla. We know nothing about her. For all we know she could've just been a really revolutionary magizoologist in HP canon.

*** In contrast HP actually seems to follow a pattern of losing magic over the centuries...otherwise Hogwarts (a 1000 year old building) wouldn't be the greatest magical structure to ever exist. Nor would the most powerful magics be from century old books or myths (horcruxes and the Deathly Hallows)

**** I'm not sure why you're downvoted for this, it does seem to be the case that the powerful artifacts (founder's items, deathly hallows, the Veil, mirror of erised) are old and that most powerful spells were also invented some time ago (Unforgivables, Patronus, Fiendfyre, Fidelius, even Wolfsbane [Edit: Wolfsbane is a recent one] and Felix felicis for potions). We don't see any newly created powerful artifacts that I'm aware of.

Seems like the only things that have improved over time are the brooms

***** It's possible some magical artifacts like Hogwarts may have grown in power over time as they absorb magic from their surroundings or simply have layer after layer of new enchantments added over the centuries.

Another factor to account for is survivorship bias. This is where the powerful artifacts are the ones that have survived all this time while all the weak ones broke and got forgotten.

Maybe there are plenty of powerful modern artifacts around but you can't tell cause they don't stand out due to not having accumulated any fame and the weak ones not having been weeded out yet.

Also, we know new spells and potions get developed all the time. Wolfsbane potion is actually a fairly modern invention created in the 1970's. Riddle is known to have invented the unassisted flight spell. Snape invented the powerful sectumsempra and several other spells.

****** My mistake with the Wolfsbane and that's true for Hogwarts, but my point is that there isn't really evidence enough to suggest that wizarding Britain is advancing significantly in magical study, indeed you can make a respectable argument for the opposite.

** Morgana would have existed around the time of the Arthurian Cycle which is actually around the 8th century(Norse invasion of Britain). Hogwarts was built ~1000 years ago at the start of canon. Both Merlin and Morgana pre-date Hogwarts by at least a century. That is not to say that HP is compliant to the Arthurian Cycle however. But given the lack of contradictory evidence we can assume Morgana can do anything she did in her original myths, which is basically anything Merlin can do because they were considered equals in magic. Personally I'm of the opinion that Morgana would curbstomp Voldemort for having the temerity to claim any sort of dominion over Britain, magical or mundane.

Do we actually have anything that suggests that Merlin was so obscenely great?

It seems like it's just as possible that he was a talented wizard whose reputation got overblown over time.

Edit: I mean, people were afraid to say Voldemort's name over ten years /after he died/. 1000 years later, Voldemort could easily be considered the Dark God of Magic.
