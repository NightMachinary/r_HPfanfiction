**** Linkffn(Harry Potter and Prince of Slytherin) made it work. In the first Pettigrew-centric chapter, he is constantly humming some song, that Lily recognizes as Rolling Stones, but cannot quite put a name to it. At the end of the chapter, after Peter made final step in his plan to destroy Jim Potter and furthered the schism in Potter family, he comes home, puts the song on and sings along to the first couple of lines.

The song is "Sympathy for the Devil".

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

******** The only thing the story convinced me of if that Harry and Hermione are bigoted murderers that should be put down as soon as possible. Especially when Hermione explicitly advocates genocide:

#+begin_quote
  She wanted to crush and destroy Magical Britain's bigotry - even if she had to wipe out the purebloods to accomplish that.
#+end_quote

Yeah, no.

Just repeating "but the purebloods were rapists, muderers and <insert suitably vile thing here>" isn't going to convince me of it. For one, the idea of the Shacklebolt led Government passing "rape laws" and supporting murder, rape etc is absolutely ridiculous, and Shackebolt being executed for supporting said rape laws even more so. Secondly, the story doesn't even show that in any meaningful way. What it does show (in the very first chapter) is Hermione and her ilk advocating genocide, and then proceeding to murder a large segment of the population. Unlike the supposedly all-evil "purebloods", Hermione and Harry actually feel evil. No where did I see the "being hunted, tortured, and see dozens of friends die right in front of you" part, so I have no empathy for them. "Show, don't Tell" is an important writing axiom for a reason; this story doesn't even tell properly, let alone show.

The antagonists are such dry card board cut-outs that none of it is remotely believable anyway. The second and third chapters are entirely Mary Sue Hermione overwhelming Minerva and Dumbledore with the power of Superior Muggle Logic, while Minerva just sits there gaping at the power of author tract, unable to muster a single coherent reply. Complex characters reduced to caricatures to be smacked down to make the "protagonists" look good: the very textbook definition of bashing.

I read only four chapters of this story (chapter four, of course, bashes Draco and makes him a rapist too. Because why not?), but the concentrated awfulness in these four chapters is almost impressive.

********* You never saw where Harry and Hermione and Ron were tortured, hunted, and saw their friends die? I guess you haven't read the books then. Well, in OotP, Harry gets tortured regularly, and sees his godfather die. Hermione almost dies. Ron ends up in the infirmary as well. In HBP, Ron almost dies. Harry sees Dumbledore die. In DH, Hermione gets tortured in Malfoy Manor. The trio and all muggleborns are hunted like animals. Fred, Remus, Tonks die in the final battle. Ted Tonks died before that. Dobby dies in their arms. They see the Ministry sending muggleborns to Azkaban.

If you think that such experiences won't change people...

With regards to McGonagall and Dumbledore getting overwhelmed: The "Dumbledore" there is a portrait. An enchanted piece of canvas. Not a real person. Doesn't take much to overwhelm that. McGonagall? Canon doesn't leave her with much of a leg to stand on. She didn't resist Umbridge's "reforms", so why would she resist the Minister for Magic and the Chief Warlock together? Why would she suddenly find a backbone she hasn't shown in canon? Complex character? Whenever she would have been called upon to defend Harry in canon, she failed, but for one scene with Umbridge about his future job prospects. Otherwise she left him hanging each and every time.

With regards to the purebloods, the story shows that not all purebloods are evil - the Weasleys are the best example, with Ron ending up /the/ hero of the story, and Percy playing the long game, knowing that Hermione and Harry will not hold out that long, and that the "Muggle Fad" will burn out soon, and that those who jump on that bandwagon will be disappointed. He even states clearly that Hermione is wrong and you can't just take over muggle laws and expect them to work in the Magical World. There's Neville as well, and Viktor Krum, the Delacours, Luna... the list goes on. And yes, Harry and Hermione do realise, though at the end, that there's somethign wrong with them and they need help because their first reaction to a problem is "who do I kill to solve this".

But all that doesn't change the fact that the purebloods executed in the story willingly supported mass murder and rape, and said so under Veritaserum. Anyone who didn't help Voldemort willingly wasn't executed. That was stated clearly, but ignored by people who prefer to rant about how evil it is to try and execute rapists and mass-murderers. (There's also a prologue which details just how Shacklebolt's government "dealt" with Voldemort's willing helpers among the Snatchers and Ministry.)

With regards to Shacklebolt never passing a rape law: In canon it took Hermione years to get House Elf slavery abandoned. A government that fought so long to keep slaves is rotten and evil; that law should have been rubberstamped in a week.

Wait, wait, wait. So you're saying all these psychopaths here are actually the same characters from the end of DH. Because PTSD... wut? You take a complete 180 from canon characterisation -- we /know/ that Harry is relatively well adjusted after the war; his entire character arc is about understanding death and learning to pity Riddle than hate him, for fuck's sake -- and you don't even try to justify it with extra-canon events.

Even if you wanted to make Harry and Hermione to... whatever they are in this fic, then you went about it in a completely wrong way. You don't take a character from point A to point E without going to through points B, C and D. I'm sure it wouldn't have been believable anyway, but it would have given the situation at least some context. Much better than two relatively well adjusted, mature people in canon presented as remorseless killers with no transition.

What you have here isn't AU or PTSD, it is character assassination.

As for McGonagall... really? McGonagall had no spine? McGonagall couldn't win, but every single interaction with Umbridge, she comes off as superior and makes Umbridge know that she wouldn't put up with her shit. This is her completely owning Umbridge, even though she is powerless:

#+begin_quote
  “Excellent,” whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. “Let's see Umbridge get what she deserves.”

  Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that sheknew Professor Umbridge was there.

  “That will do,” she said and silence fell immediately. “Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework - Miss Brown, please take this box of mice - don't be silly, girl, they won't hurt you - and hand one to each student -”

  “Hem, hem,” said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Harry's essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that hehad managed an A.

  “Right then, everyone, listen closely - Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall putyou in detention - most of you have now successfully Vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell. Today, we shall be -”

  “Hem, hem,” said Professor Umbridge.

  “Yes?” said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line.

  “I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec---”

  “Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,” said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. “As I was saying: today, we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult Vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell -”

  “Hem, hem.”

  “I wonder,” said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, “how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.” Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously.

  Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.
#+end_quote

Note Ron's opening line and the students' glee: they /knew/ what was going to happen. /You do not beat Minerva McGonagall in a war of words/. It is simply not done. There are many, many times in canon where Minerva is powerless, yet she invariably has the upper hand in all verbal interactions. This is doubly true for Albus Dumbledore.

You McGonagall is pathetic. She cannot get in a single word in edgewise and Hermione squashes her using the power of Muggle Logic. This is your McGonagall:

#+begin_quote
  Minerva paled, ashamed as she remembered that moment. In hindsight she couldn't understand why she had acted that way, it had run counter to all Gryffindor stood for. He simply scoffed at her while she sat back down again.

  [..]

  Minerva gaped. What was Miss Granger saying? "Hogwarts is the finest Magical School..." she started to say, but once again she was interrupted.

  [..]

  Minerva was left gaping - she hadn't expected this. Where was this coming from? Miss Granger had been so happy during her time at Hogwarts! For a moment she had even forgotten the Tribunals, only the last sentence, when the Minister mentioned staff being arrested, brought that threat back.

  "But tradition..." Minerva tried to interrupt, desperate to stop this torrent of unimaginable changes - new school uniforms, not robes? No more parchment? - but her attempt only triggered another scathing remark.

  [..]

  That left Minerva shocked into silence. To replace Hogwarts was... unthinkable!
#+end_quote

This is your Minerva, and this is from a single scene of your fanfic. Every single line is Minerva left gaping, gasping, being interrupted, being shocked to silence etc, always overwhelmed by Hermione's author given superiority. Never once does she provide a well reasoned argument, or does she ever get anywhere close to getting the upper hand on Hermione. This is not Minerva McGonagall in any way, shape or form, merely a bashed caricature to make Hermione look impressive.

Same for Dumbledore. That damned portrait ran the entire war, advising Snape on what to do all the time. Canon shows the portrait Dumbledore as significantly similar to the the original version. To be reduced to a Minerva-ish caricature is inexcusable.

#+begin_quote
  That was stated clearly, but ignored by people who prefer to rant about how evil it is to try and execute rapists and mass-murderers.
#+end_quote

That may be because (1) You included Shacklebolt among those who were executed, the man who gave the most pro-muggle speech in the entire book series; and (2) Given that everything from the end of DH, the canon epilogue and Word of God indicates the Shacklebolt to be generally fair, it is utterly unbelievable that there would be "rape supporters" in such importance.

#+begin_quote

Really? /Really?/ Now you accept Word of God? Whatever happened to all that WoG regarding Shacklebolt's Government being a fair one, and Harry being generally happy with it? But of course, like the rest of this story, any bits of canon that don't fit with your wizard bashing agenda are ignored, and you conveniently cherry-pick canon information, take them completely out of context, and twist them to fit your twisted story.

And no, they're not equivalent. The greatest challenge to elf reform wouldn't have been wizards, but elves themselves. They are perfectly happy with their place in society, so any reform without re-education would be met with protest from the elves. The Elves would fight freedom harder than any Government possibly could.

#+begin_quote
  “Though that's a topic for later. We're here to inform you about the changes Hogwarts will be undergoing.”

  “Changes? Hogwarts is independent, the Ministry has no say here!” Minerva stood up and had some trouble getting a hold on her anger. She would defend her school, consequences be damned!

  Before she could get going though, Mister Potter raised his hand - the one with the scars left by Umbridge's blood quill - and showed it to her. “Remember this? Remember telling me to keep my head down? And now you claim the Ministry has no say here?”

  Minerva paled, ashamed as she remembered that moment. In hindsight she couldn't understand why she had acted that way, it had run counter to all Gryffindor stood for. He simply scoffed at her while she sat back down again.

  The girl - the Minister for Magic! Minerva reminded herself - continued: “Even if you had not submitted to the authority of the Ministry back then, the history of Hogwarts in the last few years clearly shows that the school cannot be left to govern itself. Laws to that effect will be passed soon enough.”

  Minerva gaped. What was Miss Granger saying? “Hogwarts is the finest Magical School...” she started to say, but once again she was interrupted.

  “That may be the case - I hope not, since it would mean the magical world is even more stupid than I thought - but it certainly is not a fine school by any objective standard.” The girl glared at McGonagall, passion anyone who had seen her rant about studying or injustice when she was younger would recognize at once seeping into her voice. “Hogwarts is an embarrassment. With a few exceptions the teachers are inept, the courses offered are far too limited, and the material often outdated or plain wrong. The infrastructure is primitive, and the school grounds are not safe. If this was a normal school, it would have been closed long ago, half the staff would have been fired and the rest would have been arrested.”

  Minerva was left gaping - she hadn't expected this. Where was this coming from? Miss Granger had been so happy during her time at Hogwarts! For a moment she had even forgotten the Tribunals, only the last sentence, when the Minister mentioned staff being arrested, brought that threat back.

  And Minister Granger was just picking up steam. “Hogwarts will be brought up to the standards of the 20th century. No longer shall normal children feel like they are thrown back into the Dark Ages when entering the school! Quills and parchment? I guess we should be glad you don't carve up stone plates still! In the future, students will be allowed to use pens and paper and even typewriters to write their assignments. We'll also update the school uniforms.”

  “But tradition...” Minerva tried to interrupt, desperate to stop this torrent of unimaginable changes - new school uniforms, not robes? No more parchment? - but her attempt only triggered another scathing remark.

  “Tradition is no reason to keep something outdated if better alternatives are around. Pens are better than quills, period. There is no reason at all to use quills, magic doesn't care how ink is used. Making students use quills means wasting time and effort during their education. That will no longer be tolerated.” Her eyes were blazing, and Minerva felt afraid for just a second. “If any purebloods want to keep using inferior tools, they can do so. It's their loss. But the uniform will change.”

  The witch narrowed her eyes at Minerva. “And you will install a public announcement system. Wizarding Wireless works at Hogwarts, so you cannot claim it's impossible. The next time a troll is roaming the school all inside will be warned at once! Especially the house-elves, who can then locate any missing students!”

  Apparently Miss Granger hadn't forgotten her near-death experience during the Halloween feast in 1991. Not one of Minerva's finer moments, truth be told, but it had seen the formation of the ‘Golden Trio' responsible for Voldemort's downfall, so she used to think of the event rather fondly. Apparently, Miss Granger didn't share that view.

  Her voice cut off Minerva's thoughts. “Speaking of security, the Forbidden Forest will be made safe. I am sure both the centaurs and the unicorns would like to be safe from acromantulas and other threats too. You will update the castle's infrastructure. The times of prefects having a luxury bath and the rest having to make do with old, dingy showers are over. Furthermore, the moving stairs will be controlled. How anyone could think randomly moving stairs are acceptable is beyond me!”

  “But they are controlled by Hogwarts itself! You cannot change the school like this!” Minerva exclaimed. It had been tried before, by other Headmasters, and it had not worked! The founders had created the castle, and installed all the marvels of magic students and staff still enjoyed to this day, but those as well as their less than inspired legacies were both protected by the enchantments of the castle!

  The Minister scoffed. “Rubbish! Hogwarts is a castle and a school, not some god whose whims we have to follow. If we really cannot control it then we'll replace it.”

  That left Minerva shocked into silence. To replace Hogwarts was... unthinkable!

Yes, McGonagall has not much of a leg to stand on, seeing what kind of things she tolerated. Most people would be ashamed if reminded like that of their failures. Especially those that endangered children. What rational argument could she make to explain how she sent children into the Forbidden Forest when a unicorn-killing creature was on the loose there? Where was her courage when Harry was tortured? When the school wore those insulting buttons? When Hermione was receiving hate mail and Snape "saw no difference" when she was hit with a densaugo? If you take canon seriously, McGonagall is not a good person. And even if she was, Hermione and Harry steamrolled her because a) they have the power as Minister and Chief Warlock and b) they stood up to Voldemort; standing up to a teacher is no big deal and c) they have prepared for this; McGonagall had no idea what was coming and finally d) this Hermone is smarter than McGonagall. Add to that that this Minerva is not really flexible, but quite set in her ways, and she's not the best opponent for H&H. Slughorn, on the other hand, would have been quite a different case. Or the actual Dumbledore. Both were politicians, and well-versed in maipulating people.

And yet, for all their rage in this scene, Harry and Hermione are not "right". As I mentioned before, Percy has already realised that Harry and Hermione can't keep their campaign going and will be bogged down by reality soon enough, at which point they'll have to acknowledge that there are generally reasons for why things were as they were.

Do you honestly think the war against Voldemort was run intelligently? It was a debacle. I know some people think Dumbledore was a great strategist, but in canon, he was a plot device so Harry could win through contrived and convoluted coincidences. Citing the canon war as proof that DUmbledore's portrait was somehow smart is not convincing.

As far as Word of God goes, if JKR honestly thinks that she can keep slavery going and claim it's a good system, then she is wrong. The "elves want to be enslaved" argument is worthless. If elves have the ability to leave a bad master, then that doesn't harm them, and effectively sets them free. They can still be servants as much as they want, but whenever another abuse happens, they are free to leave. It gives them the freedom to decide their lives. Something slavery takes away from them.

Just because JKR said that Harry was well-adjusted after the war doesn't mean a fanfiction has to use that as well. Taking canon events, and having them have different consequences is not exactly a new thing.

With regards to Shacklebolt, I made him a politician making deals and compromises. And yes, I honestly believe that a man who accepts slavery is not a good man, and just one step away from enslaving or oppressing others.

Four of the Merlins came from Ron, three from Arthur, two from Fudge, two from Slughorn, and one from Hermione, Hagrid, Dumbleodre, Amos Diggory, Crouch!Moody, and Aunt Muriel.

*** I think Muffliato was from the Half Blood Prince's textbook, which would explain why most authors won't have their characters use it (because they logically wouldn't know it yet).

I think the problem is when someone casts that spell with no way of learning it.

** I find it mildly annoying when authors spell out the entire backstory before beginning for no real reason. Often it's basically a poorly written rehash of canon which adds nothing to the story in the long run. I don't mind when it's done as part of the story, but frequently it seems as if it has simply been tacked on beforehand as an afterthought as if someone who is reading fanfiction has no idea of the plot of Harry Potter.

** One very common one is insisting on revisiting Stations of Canon, even if they changed the characters and the settings to the point where visiting a given Station makes no sense whatsoever. (Paying homage to them is a different matter, but it has to be done thoughtfully and with care.)

A less common practice that annoys me is when in a slow-burn romance fic that takes place over years during which important, life-and-death stuff happens, often with the romantic protagonists in the middle of it, the author just doesn't seem to be putting any thought into any aspect of the fic not related to the romance. Their protagonists characterization in the context of their romantic relationships are well-written and consistent, but once they, say, get in a fight with an enemy, the author seems to forget what skills and capabilities the characters are supposed to have --- i.e., who would actually win the fight and how? Similarly, any non-romantic relationships and general social dynamics are very poorly thought-out.

A good example, without naming the fic, has Snape and Hermione (aged up via time-turner overuse) both working in the Order of the Phoenix, and engaged in a slow-burn romance. Both are, by this point, hardened veterans with blood on their hands and a lot of not-nice skills. For obvious reasons, they keep their relationship secret. Then, when they are getting it on in one of their safe houses, Cedric (who survived in this AU) walks in. (No, he doesn't join them. It's not /that/ kind of fic.)

Now, an author who paid attention to the non-romantic aspects of the story would just have them Obliviate Cedric. Instead, IIRC, Snape spends a few minutes yelling at Cedric to tell no one, which makes for nice drama, but it doesn't make sense given what the characters are supposed to be able to do.

** I used to abuse synonyms for "said". Worse yet, I'd add adjectives. "He stated firmly" or "he yelled fearfully" instead of just "he said".

I've been trying to break this habit, but the problem is that I started noticing this in others' writing. I read Hail Odysseus recently, and it's not a bad story, but it's full of stuff like "asked gruffly", "replied unemotionally", and "interrupted urgently". My eyes used to just sort of skip over this stuff, but now I can't help but notice and it's jarring. Worst part is, I did this to myself!

*** Just repeating said said said said is not exactly good writing either. "Yelled" is not a synonym for "said". "State" has a slightly different meaning than "say". "He loudly said" is perfectly fine, for example since that is an objective statement.

** Everyone "stated" everything they say. It makes them seem stilted and awkward. Use another word.

That and bashing. Nobody seems to think Dumbledore is allowed to be a flawed character without also being literally Satan.

The worst has to be casual homophobia. I'm gay and sometimes I read a story and suddenly James goes "aha at least you ain't a fuckin /fag/ like SNIVELLUS huh harry???" and I just close it. I don't want to read this garbage. Waste of 20 chapters. Other stories feature Harry being bro-like hugely afraid of being within 20 feet of a man or Rita Skeeter making a hullabaloo about Dumbledore being gay or a variety of other things that make me feel like the author is inserting their views into their story and their views are pretty awful to boot. Even fucking slash is written like one of them has to be the girl, because only twelve year old girls write slash, and there's precisely zero non-slash gay content.

Throwaway is because I'm ashamed of reading fanfiction not because I'm gay.

** Overuse/misuse of 'said' to mean 'previously mentioned' - as in 'He picked up the said goblet'

Firstly, you don't add an article when using said. Secondly, it's really not that commonly used anywhere except fanfic and non-fiction writing. The sentence flows a lot better if you leave it out; there's no need to try and sound clever by adding it in.

It just bugs me, though I acknowledge it's a fairly minor thing on the grand scheme.

**** most reviews given are never about the writing style, grammar, plot line improvement, character development - whether the character is static or dynamic.

Most reviews are of people gushing of how a certain chapter has made them feel.

Then there are authors that don't like that because it might contain a spoiler for their other readers...some authors don't like critic either...

I personally am the type that doesn't leave a review until the end of the story.\\
I will review a chapter if it contains something that struck me...otherwise I don't think it is ungrateful of me to not want to leave a review for every single chapter. I only have so many things that I can say.
