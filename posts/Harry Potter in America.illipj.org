:END:
Hello, obligatory posting on phone apologies for that. I'm looking for a fan fiction I read a long, long time ago. It had Harry finding out that he had family in America (like the title states) and that man was willing to take him in. I remember the man who took him in was a were-creature of sort and there were vampires as well. Harry ended up making new friends and port-keying to a new school every day. I think he also had a pet snake but I don't remember much more than that. If anyone knows which story this is I'd be grateful for a link.
