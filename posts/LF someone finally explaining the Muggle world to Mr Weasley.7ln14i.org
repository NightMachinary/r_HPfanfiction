Mr Weasley is just the nicest cinnamon roll and I want someone to finally answer his questions.


** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging]]

This came to mind for some reason. It gives me a silly idea for a fic, one where wizards trying to learn muggle technology from first principles call Mr. Weasley (the 'muggle expert') and explain what they know to him, inadvertently realising what they're doing wrong halfway through their explanation. Docendo Discimus, as it were.

This is totally something you could do in real life, actually. Get some Harry Potter fans you're teaching to explain what they know of so-and-so physics/mathematics/etc subject so far by trying to explain it to a hypothetical Arthur Weasley.

*** *Rubber duck debugging*

In software engineering, rubber duck debugging or rubber ducking is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects.

Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a programming problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem.
