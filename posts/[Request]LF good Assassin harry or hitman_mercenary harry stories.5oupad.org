** Linkffn(4655545) Harry is an international dark wizard assassin and keeps it up after being sent back in time to his child self. Notable for Harry receiving his Hogwarts letter- addressed to Mr. Harry Potter, Grungy Romanian Flophouse- while he's preparing to murder drug dealers. No actual pairings though it implies a Harry/Luna/Hermione/Susan Bones ending.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

** This one is sort of in the title linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary]]) and its sequel is more of what youre looking for i think linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6568694/1/Harry-Potter-Hit-Wizard]]). There are a couple others but the neurons cannot think of them yet this morning.

Harry is a hardened killer with his own code, hired to guard Fleur during the TWT. H/F, ends abruptly IMO.
