Hi ya'll!

I'm currently stuck on a chapter that I've been struggling with for days. I usually write about 2k per day (all of my chapters are roughly that long and posted daily), but I just can't seen to get through it. Anyone else suddenly had an acute sense of writer's block? It's a good thing I already fleshed out the entire story from back to front so I know how to continue...but damn this sucks. T_T Anyone got any tips to push through?


** The standard answer is to write anyways. The second answer is that this is a discussion thread not a request.

My own answer is that you shouldn't force yourself to write. I personally write only when I feel like I can do my best. Do other things. Plan the story more, doodle out the characters, listen to YouTube, play BotW for the 300th hour, or pet a cat. To quote a quote I use to justify this, "If you're not enjoying it, then your readers aren't."

** I got stuck on my HP/SW story in a chapter where Harry was telling Ahsoka about magic... hard to write that kind of thing without coming off cringey.

*** Thank you for the advice. Like you said, I don't want to stay away from my story for too long, as it has happened before, and I'll end up abandoning it all together. I've written over 455k so far and gained quite a few loyal readers, so it would be a shame if I left it catching dust.\\
I'm going to let it go for the next couple of days and continue writing again on the weekend.

** My method of pushing through a block is to put the story down and try to write something else. Not much, a page or two to get the juices flowing. And that builds up an inventory of stories you can use later.

** Try writing a future chapter, while leaving the current one blank. Once you have an idea of where you want to go, maybe you'll think of how to get there along the way.
