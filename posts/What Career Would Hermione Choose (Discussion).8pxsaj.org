Another installment of "Help me write my HP/Avengers crossover", I need some input. So I intend to set it up so that Hermione worked at the DMLE and after 8 years or so got significant changes made to legislation regarding rights of house elves and whatever else.

But since in my headcanon it never seemed like the trio would have any interest in the Ministry (for obvious reasons, I think), what could you see Hermione doing as a career once she'd gotten that goal out of the way?


** Hermione's righteousness is one of her more fundamental character traits. We see it in her adherence to the rules very early in the first book, and it's always an element of her bravery and later decisions to break rules. I think her dislike of the ministry probably also stems from it. That said, I don't think it's likely that she would want to be a ministry functionary her entire life - even in a just ministry, she's eventually going to feel like she could be making more progress elsewhere.

For later-years careers for her, I think it's really important to keep the element of righteousness, and to consider that Hermione, without major character development would be nervous about making any major upheavals in her own life. We see her send her parents to Australia and camp in a tent for a year in canon, but only after muggleborns are being targeted and she has no safer option for fighting against Voldemort. So, she's not very likely to move to Romania/New York/France/Los Angeles/Egypt/etc. without a very compelling reason. This could change with her characterization in your story, but starting with her canon characterization, I think it's important to have her really build up to any upheavals like a cross-the-world move.

Stuff Hermione would probably be involved with now based on her righteousness is going to be human-rights, news headlines kind of stuff. Migration and immigration are probably issues she'd have a strong stance on, and while a 'magic-less' Hermione might be involved in refugee rights, an equivalent wizarding career idea might deal with the transition of muggleborns to the wizarding world. Other potential new pet issues for Hermione include climate change and women's rights, but personally I find refugee rights the most likely path for her.

Another option is to characterize her as having done the lobbying on behalf of house elves as a part-time job or side project, and possibly leveraged her main career to help achieve this goal, similar to Emma Watson's use of acting to get involved in the fashion world, which she then used to highlight to sustainable materials and fair-trade practices. One career that would really help Hermione lobby on behalf of the house elves while building a second skill set is journalism, although I can't say I view Hermione as much of a full-time journalist, especially given that she wouldn't have a positive view of the Daily Prophet, and we don't see it 'reform' in the same way the ministry does by electing Shacklebolt. She really enjoyed arithmancy in school, although we don't know much about it. The wiki says arithmancy is required for a cursebreaker's position, and involves numerology and predicting the future with numbers. Fanon often includes spell creation under arithmancy, and arithmancy could be explained into any career that heavily involves making and understanding magical items, although it's harder to see how Hermione might leverage this career to help establish house elf rights.

Edit: I just saw a mention of aurology in another thread, as it came up in the Fantastic Beasts movie. It's tracking traces of dark magic, which could easily involve Hermione's favorite subject, arithmancy, and would be a good career for her either starting out, or easy to transition into after working in some other DMLE branch more related to house elf rights. I can easily see this as an ongoing career for her, the only disadvantage is that it would likely leave her in the ministry, which is inconsistent with your headcanon.

*** Wow, that's some great insight! The point about the righteous aspect of her character was particularly nice. As I plan for Hermione and Harry to move to New York after a sort of world tour (traditional for European wizards), I guess I'll have to do as you said about finding a good reason to move there. The refugee rights suggestion is very believable as well. If you can think of anything else (especially with the fact that it's mixed with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Dr. Strange), let me know.

I'll definitely keep in mind what you said, it's really helpful. Thanks!

*** Saw your edit about Aurology (I too saw this on another thread). It's definitely something to consider, though since I'm trying to keep the characterization pretty canon, I'm not sure who Aurology would be good for outside Aurors, a career Hermione didn't seem all that into.

Hmm, maybe she could be a consultant of some sort for the Aurors before she gets a high ranking position. Since the back story is supposed to involve Harry spending a few years in the Aurors helping track down the remainder of Voldemort's army, her having skills in Aurology (making use of your/the fanon use of Arithmancy in spell creation) could make her vital in finding them. Might be the impetus for her own promotion to get a more influential job in DMLE. Thanks again!

*** At the same time, many righteous people who hold revolutionary ideals become more moderate as they grow up, get experience of the world and begin to appreciate the complexity of the issues they face.

Young people, and Hermione is no exception, often feel like you can legislate yourself to the society you want. But as they get older, they realise that you can't change people or culture just by telling people what they should think or outlawing ideas you dislike.

Unfortunately, you cannot create a just society by outlawing injustice, because no government has the resources to effectively enforce a rule that none of the population agrees with (moreover, to try to do so would verge on dictatorial). Any police force able to enforce the law is tiny compared to the size of the population -- just look at the effectiveness of laws implementing speed limits. In reality, the only way to create a just society is to get people to act justly of their own accord. This is doubly true in a democracy. That takes a lot more than legislation. This is the sad lesson that America has leant in trying to introduce democracy to societies where it has not developed naturally out of a strong civil society.

I see Hermione keeping her reforming impetus but also becoming rather more moderate, seeking to enact change within the systems which currently exist rather than overturning them all.

** I think the question is, what things was Hermione passionate enough about to potentially pursue as a career? And there are a couple of ways I can see her going. First, would she be an activist for muggle-born and creature rights? Absolutely. But in a community as small as wizarding Britain, how many paying jobs will there be for a full-time activist? She might well decide that she has to choose between going into the Ministry and working to change the system from the inside, or taking an unrelated job and being an activist on the side.

As for what that unrelated job would be, it's possible that she would go into the family business. (In canon, she married Ron, of course, and Ron became co-manager of Weasleys Wizard Wheezes.) But more likely, she would follow her academic passion: Arithmancy. It's ironic that Hermione's favorite class in canon is the one we know the absolute least about. From the two lines we heard about it, canon!Arithmancy seems to be mostly numerology and prognostication. If she went this route, she'd probably wind up being the magical equivalent of a statistician or a data analyst for her day job.

*** Yes, taking over the government to push through their agenda seems like a no-brainer for the Trio.

The Ministry was only an institution. It might have wronged them in the past, but they turned the table on their enemies at the Battle of Hogwarts, so they now had this once in a lifetime opportunity to cleanse the Ministry and populate it with their own allies, followers, and sycophants.

For Hermione, her dream job would certainly be to lead the Department of Mysteries. She might even do that after her stint as the Minister. But barring that, running the DMLE to enforce her strong sense of justice was a reasonable compromise.

For Harry, DADA teacher might suit him better, but he knew he needed to control Magical Britain's security forces to push through whatever agenda or mission they had. Also, he was a top target for dark wizards regardless of what he would be doing, having a loyal private army actually improved his and his loved ones' personal security.

**** I'm already working on the assumption that they worked at the Ministry for some time. Hermione's interest seemed to be overwhelming focused on extension of rights to other beings (in a substantial sense). I could see her continuing on issues relating to Muggle-borns. But otherwise? As Minister? It never really meshed for me. She doesn't seem like the politician type.

Now Harry I think is much easier. His interest in combating dark forces was entirely personal. The best example of Prisoner of Azkaban. Arthur tells Harry not to go seeking Sirius out, to which Harry (who knows Sirius is a Death Eater) says, "Mr. Weasley, why would I try to find someone who wants to kill me?" In general he's definitely against such people and would stop them if he had to, but without that personal element, I could never see him as a career Auror. At best up until the remainder of Voldemort's forces were apprehended or killed. I ended up going with him settling as a DADA professor, and maybe funding an orphanage.

***** I don't think this is a correct characterisation of Harry.

Yes, he has a personal vendetta against Voldemort and the Death Eaters, such that he not only wants them defeated but also deeply wants to be personally involved in that defeat.

However, another important part of his character is his inability to walk away from evil. If he sees bad things happening, he will be unable to stop himself from intervening. Half the adventures he went on, he had no idea that they were connected to Voldemort at the outset. He just saw the potential for evil and took it upon himself to stop it.

When Harry and Co. investigated the Chamber of Secrets with the intention of uncovering the Heir of Slytherin, all they knew was that people were being attacked. Harry had no personal stake in the matter at that time. When they investigated the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone, all they knew was that there was an object under guard which someone had attempted to steal from Gringotts. Again, no personal stake, just curiosity and a desire to prevent bad things from happening.

Harry is simply not able to stand back and allow other people to fight, even where the battle has no connection to him. He feels responsible to the point where omitting to act would be morally wrong, despite there being no reason to think he is obliged to get involved.

It wasn't half the adventures they were on, it was quite literally one of the adventures: Chamber of Secrets. In Philosopher's Stone, he says to Hermione:

#+begin_quote
  "But Harry - what if You-Know-Who's with him?"

  "Well - I was lucky once, wasn't I?" said Harry, pointing at his scar. "I might get lucky again."
#+end_quote

He had earlier said that he wasn't going to stand around and let Voldemort return and turn Hogwarts into a dark arts school, so the motivation in book 1 seems clear to me.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is simply not able to stand back and allow other people to fight, even where the battle has no connection to him.
#+end_quote

Then I can't imagine how you explain Prisoner of Azkaban, where Harry makes clear that despite knowing Sirius was a Death Eater and was after him personally (the Arthur Weasley scene), he had no interest in finding him until the godfather-betrayed-my-parents reveal. I'm not saying he wouldn't have ended up doing it without that,.but it's not presented as something he felt dedicated to inherently. It's the same with Voldemort, his stated reason for desiring to end him personally, even if there weren't a prophecy, was predominantly that he'd killed people Harry cared about.

I can understand him going after the remaining Death Eaters given they just had a battle with Voldemort and after a war. But being an Auror means going after any Dark Wizard, irrespective of if they put his friends in danger, and doing so under the auspices of the Ministry no less (not exactly their biggest fan). And it just doesn't seem like him.

***** I disagree with the notion that Hermione can't become a master politician.

People change and learn. Many people become very different as they grow older, and without going through traumatic experiences like our heroes. Twenty years is a long time.

Minister of Magic might not be the best job for Hermione, but it would certainly be better than sitting on the sideline and watching some soulless Ministry bureaucrats betraying their hard won victory.

******* Hermione is someone who can force herself to do things she may not find enjoyable, but thinks it's necessary. For example, revising for exams is boring and tedious, but she will put in her utmost effort, because she thinks it's important to have good grades.

Now 20+ years later, the stakes are much higher, and she certainly has much more important agenda to push. Besides, at this point in time, she has been in the establishment for decades, she's no longer the outsider, the disadvantaged minority, and most importantly, no longer an innocent student.

Besides, every job will have its downsides. There are no perfect jobs in the world.

Also, I'm not writing 20 years later, more like 5-8.

Sure but it's more that she's not limited to any particular job due to her wide range of talents, so there's less incentive to (assuming her main goals have been accomplished) pursue a career in a single workplace, which is a big reason why most people do so.

I'm actually planning this in one of my stories. First semester, first years take flying lessons, and then in the second semester they have to take Muggle Studies. After that it becomes an elective.

I'd also say that a key criteria for a good Muggle Studies teacher would be charisma and approachability and Hermione is not the most outgoing character. While I can see her being a well respected teacher in a more academic subject (similar to McGonagall) I simply can't imagine her really engaging a bunch of kids in this particular class.

**** Honestly I see her as Headmistress (education is /very/ important to Hermione) but she'd need teaching experience for it first. Charms could be a class that she taught, but it doesn't have that /crusading/ aspect that's essential to her character. My timeline has her working in the Ministry until 2008, then teaching until 2013, and taking over as Headmistress in 2014. This stays true to the original canon, too, since JKR originally had McGonagall retiring before the Potter kids reached Hogwarts.

*** I'm not sure that Hermione would make the best Muggle studies teacher... she joyfully abandons the Muggle world and immerses herself in the wizarding one. By GoF she considers technology a "replacement for magic" and by DH she's happy to memory charm her parents. Every summer she spends as little time back in the Muggle world as possible.

So I doubt that she has kept up with changes in the Muggle world, post graduation. If she taught Muggle studies, she'd probably end up like all the other wizards, teaching outdated stuff based on her recollection of how the Muggle world used to be.
