I just finished re-reading After the End by Arabella and Zsenya for the first time since I was a kid (thanks to you guys helping me track it down!) and I am loving being immersed in the ff world again.

There are so many aspects of that story that I think I almost prefer over canon, and it was interested to realize that having now read it post series. I first read it before OotP so so much was up for imagination.

For anyone out there who has read it, what were your favorite parts that you wish were part of the canon? For me it was:

1) The trio/Harry not taking Auror ministry jobs, but rather Harry pursuing more positive passions (even though it was derailed for a bit in this story...)\\
2) The characterization of Lupin and his role as an educator\\
3) Sirius being alive :(((((\\
4) Ginny having a more central role in the group and being so close to Hermione.

In addition to all that, I just love Ron's characterization throughout the entire thing. So spot on. I wish Arabella and Zsenya were still writing/would write another novel length fic like this. They created a beautiful world within the world.
