Back when I was just beginning, I could read just about every cliche-infested trope-ridden fics that were grammatically and plotwise shit and still want to read more. Nowadays I can barely find the motivation to start a new fic, let alone finish it. And when I do start it, I nope out immediately when I see even a trace of the common cliches like bashing, goblin-wanks or muggle-wanks. Is this normal?


** Yea, I'd say it's pretty normal. Everyone goes through that to some extent. The saying goes, 90% of everything on the internet is crap. We just get better at realising something is crap.

You say you have been able to read these tropey stories a lot when you started out but can't now. That's because back when you started out, the cliches weren't really that obvious. What makes a trope a cliche is its repetitiveness, but you can't really judge the repetitiveness of a trope when you're just starting out, even if they seem blindingly obvious in hindsight.

I'd recommend taking it slow. You may not be able to churn through a dozen different fanfics every week, but forcing yourself to do that is just going to leave a bad taste later on.

** I went through the same process. I think this is because when you started, everything was new and exciting. That one story where Harry was sorted in Slytherin? Cool idea, you've never seen that before and you want to know what this fic does differently. A Marauder-era fic? We never see much of them in canon besides a few flashbacks, so it's interesting to see a fic with a focus on them.

Over time, two things happen: you get a feel for what fics you like more, causing you to disregard most content from outside that area of interest, and all the novelty for everything wears off. So you end up reading less as a result.

A couple of months ago, I wanted to re-read the very first Marauder-era fic I read, so I asked the subreddit if they knew what fic it was, and someone delivered. However, I couldn't stand reading more than a couple of chapters of it -- the fic just didn't do it for me at all.

*** Too add to that: back when I was reading fanfics originally, all the HP books hadn't even come out yet. There were limited number of fics and being frank, lots of ff authors were not good writers, but you'd read them anyway because you had little choice.

Now that the series has been done for almost 15 years, there have been so many fanfics written about every single trope/ship/situation, and naturally there have been actual good writers who have completed stories for each one. Once you read a story like that, it becomes really hard to read something of lesser quality again.

** I've always been picky about grammar, but when I first started reading fanfic I wasn't aware of all the cliches and bad tropes that I eventually came to hate. The first time I read one of the "Hadrian Peverell Black Slytherin Potter outmaneuvers every adult at the age of eleven and is beloved by all magical creatures and is too special to be sorted into any house so the hat just goes up in flames the moment it touches his head" I was like, cool, nice to see Harry with confidence, fun fun fun. Not as fun after reading 50 variations of that same fic.

** It's a common phenomenon and not just with fics. The more you consume something the more defined are your tastes and the less tolerant you become to things that annoy you.

For exemple, fanfic-wise, when I just enter a fandom, I'm pretty much open-minded to most kinds of that fandom-specific tropes. The longer I read tho, the pickier I get because I learn what I like and dislike.

** Yep.

It's just at this point most of the new ones that are coming are along the lines of "already seen it".

It's usually the same things repeated over and over again.

It's probably exciting for people getting in, but after time, not so much.

But fanfic did help with speed reading though.

** Of course. Despite the amazing number of fanfics out there (especially for the HP fandom), there are only so many stories an author can tell and soon, quality play a bigger part in our taste because no idea is new anymore.

I have seem Harry being a Wizard, a Muggle, a Squibb or even the second coming of Merlin. I have seen him being a hero, the true "Leader of the Light" (hugh) or joining the Dark Side, becoming a Death Eater or even Voldemort's heir. I have seen him being raised by his parents, his godfather, some Grey family (erk) or even the Goblins (double erk). I have also seen him bed pretty much every named character in the series, plus some OC. Hell, I even read "My Immortal".

At this point, no trope is good enough anymore for me to ignore the other failing of a fic (grammar, formating, spelling . . .), and if I see anything I dislike (the usual things you mentionned), I just drop the fic. Which means that I almost don't read any fanfic anymore, but that's better than wasting my time on something I would not enjoy.

** You can find some better quality by searching a random thing you like in the subreddits search bar and you will usually find a bunch of recommendations that fit that. They aren't all great but it streamlined the process of sifting through shit for me.

** I got to that point, too. And not just in HP fandom, but many other fandoms as well. I tend to save in my bookmarks fanfics that I really like, and when I check what I saved a few years ago... I can barely read any of it.

Is it normal? I think it happens to everyone who reads fanfics at least somewhat regularly at some point. You said when you started reading fics, you were fine reading every cliche-ridden fic you found and liked it. But now you realise just how bad some of those fics are. Again, it was the same for me. The thing is, when we get into a fandom, we aren't really aware that what we are reading is a horrible cliche, something that got old by the time Jesus was still alive. We are, after all, just getting into the fandom. But as we read more and more, we discover just how repetitive it all is. The same concept applied thousand times over.

I also reread the books after a few years which didn't help matters. I saw the quality of Rowling's writing, and it's hard to find a fanfic that comes even close to it.

It is a shame, though, isn't it?. It happens all too often that I see a fic that has a really cool concept, something I genuinely would like to read, but then I see that the author somehow managed to fuck it up. Maybe it's full of bashing, or the grammar is just too bad for me to ignore it, or the plot just... doesn't really make any sense. It could've been great, but...

** Of course it's normal, you are investing your time into somethings, you should be discerning about where you spend your time.

When I was reading fanfics when I was in highschool, way back when, I'm with you, I'd read all sorts of garbage. Now that I'm older and just recently got back into reading some fanfics after stumbling upon The Changeling, I only want to read fics that I think are exceptionally well written.

I recently went back through my favourites on my ffn account, and it was honestly embarrassing how many crappy fics were favourites there.

** Used to be the same: enjoyed reading every cliched piece of crap under the sun.

Now, years later? I can't stand cliches -- most HP fanfics are just rehashed shit with very little originality. It's why I try to come up with unique prompts on here.

If a fic has cliches but is still recommend, it honestly has to be something special to be even worth my attention/time to continue reading.

Do I sound elitist? Yeah. But, again, most HP fanfics are rehashed crap.

A pinnacle of it is Cursed Child: I'm convinced that the writers behind it started in the HP fanfic community, but even through and graduating from colleges/universities and achieving degrees/qualifications, it's plain to see they never moved past that crap and made a lot of them technically canon.

** After reading an Internet worth of fanfictions, I've come to realize that the sentence structure and grammar of the first chapter is far more indicative of a fics' quality than the tropes used within.

After all, there's only so many ways to describe orbs that are the color of the killing curse, but there's plenty of ways to screw up poor writing.

** Yeah, I think that is pretty common. It's likely a combination of growing familiar with the fandom and growing older and becoming more discerning.

I tried to go back and read a fic that I had really enjoyed when I first started reading fic, probably about 15 years ago (actually, probably closer to 20 now) and I couldn't make it through it was just that bad. Over the years I've discovered I have very specific types of things I want to read and I'm picky about SPAG, so I open a lot of things but only make it past the first chapter on a few.

** Yeah, it sucks. In the past few months I've started so many fics and noped out after two or so chapters. Sometimes I'll even skip to later chapters in hopes that it gets better so I can convince myself to keep reading it, but generally I think I quit more fics than I stick through to the end.

Agree, been reading Harry Potter fanfiction since I was a teen, it has been over 15 years and I am burnt out, and also, it rare to see a HP fic get completed, most go abandoned. HP fanfiction doesn't fo it for me anymore, maybe because I read all I can and bored.

Now I hardly ever read romance. I can't stand the tropes I mentioned earlier anymore. These days, I read mostly gen fics, stick only to one or two tropes and rarely read any others. And even /that/ was heavily filtered.
