We're all loosely familiar with the dizzying nature of portkey travel. What doesn't seem to have been discussed is the medium that portkeys travel through. Here are some ideas:

- The local astral plane (more of a subplane in M:tG parlance, though)
- Hyperspace
- Potterverse equivalent of the [[http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Immaterium][Warp]]
- The border between the Potterverse and the [[https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Blind_Eternities][Blind Eternities]]

I'm going to argue it can't be the /actual Blind Eternities/ that portkeys travel through. If Potterverse wizards had the ability to shield mortals against the full-on chaos of the Blind Eternities, /every/ Planeswalker would come by and study portkeys.

(In case it isn't obvious, this is to support a multicross that involves a Planeswalker visiting the Potterverse and learning about portkeys, eventually duplicating their effects with chromatic magic.)


** I believe they travel through magic, doing magicky stuff.

** I'd hazard they fold space. Probably what any travel magic does, though apparating relying on ones concentration rather than a set effect has the chance of splinching and you could say that part of a body is cut off in the folding.

** Canon provides no explanation. I'm gonna keep it simple and say it travels through space, this way, there's nothing to add and magic simply bends space locally, and makes two distant points share the same location for a time.

The appeal is that this you don't need any astral plane, hyperspace or anything of the sort.

Of course, any theory works since there's no evidence in Canon, but this doesn't require to add outside elements to work.

** I'm in favor of interpreting portkeys as local, short distance wormholes, so hyperspace would be my choice.

*** hyperspace and wormholes are used for astronomical distances.

when using a portkey they stay in the white tunnel for many seconds to travel a distance of not even half a continent.

of OPs suggestions I think astral plane is the most likely if they are actually traveling through something.

i like to think that portkeys use spatial warping to bridge two points so they don't actually pass through any intervening space in any dimension. the tunnel that is seen is a false memory that results from witnessing something that the human brain isn't capable of comprehending.

**** Joke's on you, portkey wormholes cover billions of lightyears to the far reaches of the universe and the same distance right back to Earth to get you from your living room to the one next door.
