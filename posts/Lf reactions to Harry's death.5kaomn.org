  “Why would Harry ask me to kill the snake?” Ron's stomach dropped. He heard Hermione release a soft gasp and he didn't have to turn to know there was a look of horror dawning on her face. Harry wouldn't. He promised he wouldn't. Merlin, when had he even left? (The moment that we missed in the Deathly Hallows, when everyone realises that Harry's sacrificed himself for them. Because I wasn't satisfied by the version we got in the movie.)
