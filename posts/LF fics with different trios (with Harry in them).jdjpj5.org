Just finished a fic where the main trio was Harry/Hermione/Luna (although it was still just H/Hr pairing), so now I'm interested in different friends for Harry. I welcome all trios, I also realize that some of them will be more than friends (a thruple if you will) and I'm good with that too as long as Harry is there. OCs are welcome too.


** Linkao3(The Boy Who Lived, the Brightest Witch and the Boy Who Wasn't) is a Harry/Hermione fic with Neville replacing Ron after Harry's entry in the Triwizard.

  A single conversation between Hermione and Neville in November of their fourth year changed the course of Harry's friendships forever. Eventual HHr.

** Try Raolin's The Fires of Magic. It has Harry being friends with Daphne, Tracy, and fem!Blaise and only later becoming friends with Hermione. There were several times that I couldn't help laughing about the imagery he created. Regrettably the story is starting to move into abandoned territory (eg last updated Dec 2018). Author is still updating some of his other stories so hopefully his muse will bring him back to this one.

Linkffa(1928)

  The curse Voldemort cast on baby Harry had far-reaching effects on Harry's magic. Harry must now explore those effects, and magic itself, all while battling killer teachers, giant beasts, and more in a school that really needs a safety board. Luckily for Harry, he doesn't have to do this all alone. Harry/multi. Contains AU, OC characters, and more. Book One will cover first year and the events of the Philosopher's Stone.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
