I enjoyed the alternative take on some normal year 2 events with the smattering of lore expansion that this series has become known for. Certainly a pleasant surprise this morning!


** Thanks for the heads up. Fanfiction failed to notify me, despite me following it. Ignore those moaning about this kind of post being unnecessary.

** The latest chapters continue to be amazing, not that I'm expecting anything else at this point.

I really appreciate how the author takes all these tropes that I'm super sick of (magically talented independent Slytherin Fem!Harry with politics) but keeps using them in a way that feels super genuine and realistic and not at all like the typical mary-sue-treatise that you'd expect from that description.

I also really enjoy the whimsicalness. Despite not really following canon super closely this ironically makes the fic feel more like an actual HP story, because HP isn't really HP if you already understand everything about the world from the start.

*** Yeah, it's a bit of a combo of recommendation for new folks and wanting to discuss the new chapter with folks. Feel free to downvote or lobby for a rule change...to my knowledge they aren't prohibited.

** Okay? You do realise that fanfiction.net has a follow function that automatically emails you when a story updates, right? Oh, and the best female Harry is from "The Pureblood Pretense".

*** Another commenter already said that, so I guess you're generally approving of duplicative efforts for visibility?

VP is definitely better than purebred pretense. The depth of canon compliant lore and expansion is second to none.

**** I do like VP for the in-depthness, but I think I have a better appreciation and love for Pureblood Pretense because of the amount of expanding they do regarding how Potions work and what's beyond diagon and knockturn alley. Also I like the fact that it's not quite so compliant to canon, it's a fanfic, and it drips with originality. The reworking of each year to have new, but similar encounters is refreshing and it really keeps you engaged.

Where? I don't bother reading all the comments every time. If they did they were right as well.

Well, that's simply not true. The Pureblood Pretense is better.
