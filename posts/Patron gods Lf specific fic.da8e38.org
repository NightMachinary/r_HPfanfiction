All I can remember is wizards worshipped specific gods and had a statue they put in a place behind their bed in the dorms. I think harry was still in Gryffindor because I remember someone asking Harry about his statue and Neville being offended on his behalf because it is private.

  Very AU In their time, the Marauders went a bit further in their bid to be the best pranksters they could, invoking the power of myths and legends before their brotherhood was betrayed. Now, as Harry enters his 3rd year, those powers are rising again.

**** It would have been a good fic, had the author had actually fulfilled the premise's potential and integrated patron deities into the setting, rather than use them as a cheap power-up for Sirius and later Harry (and only them, as far as I can tell). :(

***** Ugh I hate it when authors do that, it just seems do pointless to introduce a great concept and not fully explore it in the story.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341291/1/Harveste]]) and sequels is an Addams Family crossover. It has patron deities, but I am pretty sure Harry is in Slytherin. Still, it's a fun read.

  He's done it. He's just five years old, but he's finally done it. The Dursleys are gone. And now he's with a new family who seems just as twisted as he is. How strange.
