So I have this newfound obsession with bartender!lily fics.

Preferably in-canon but artistic fine is brilliant so long as it makes sense. Not a muggle-au. I've read a few and it generally seems to be that Lily's parents have died and she needs money so works during the school holidays. I don't mind whether she works at the leaky cauldron or hogshead or three broomsticks or some random muggle pub. I just love this really underwritten idea. I really love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12619083/1/Glowing][Glowing]] by natalie.ana on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and I'm hoping you can recommend some more.


** Have you tried [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7026042/1/Love-and-Other-Tragedies][Love and other tragedies]]? It's only in the first couple of chapters but it's still got Lily working in the leaky cauldron and is a really good fic.

** There's Castle On the Hill on Ao3, I just completely forgot who the author was. Also, Every Other Midnight but it's...not good.
