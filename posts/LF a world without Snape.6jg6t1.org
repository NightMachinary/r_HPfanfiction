Although I usually like him I'm feeling curious about how would be the life of Harry, his friends and the rest of Wizarding UK if Snape had died (or moved very far away and he wouldn't come back to Britain, ever).

So do you know any fics where he's gone for good (early if possible), I accept Maraunder era fics as well as long as Snape is gone and won't come back .


** If I remember correctly there is one fic similar to It's a wonderful life, linkffn(it's a wonderful life) I guess. As for Snape straight up leaving during Marauder era linkffn(Breaking the Mold by Komodo Butterfly) is my favorite. There's also linkffn(A prince's tale) where he goes to America and girls go crazy over his accent.

*** A prince Rising is a wonderful fic. It literally covers everything. The others are ok as well, Breaking rje Mold is interesting enough for me that I'll read it even if it's a slash fic (I usually avoid them like the plague). Thanks for the recomendations.

  Everyone knew Severus' future. Everyone knew he'd become a death eater, maybe get his mastery in potions and eventually die at his master's hand. But what if they didn't know Severus as well as they thought they did? Rather than conform to the role people expected him to play, Severus takes action. During 6th year he leaves Hogwarts, leaving everyone to seek happiness. SSMarauders

  Sixteen-year-old Severus leaves Hogwarts to attend school in the U.S., and possibly pursue a new life. But what of the growing darkness back home that threatens Lily and all he's ever known? (This story is an AU and does not follow HP canon!)

** Snape joining the French Foreign Legion (or wizarding equivalent) over Lilly dating or marrying James would be awesome. He seems excessive enough to do just that.
