:END:
In that one, Harry is also friends with Blaise and other Characters than only Hermione and Ron. After they all went to save Hermione on the first Halloween they encounter the Cerberus and run away again. The only catch, they either didn't manage to close the door probably or they forgot.

Anyway, they run with the dog on their heels. The Cerberus meets the troll, eats it and chased after the kids again. They hide in an armour room until help comes only to fall asleep and get discovered in the next morning.


** Linkffn(trouble) Hopefully that works if not i should be able to find the fic pretty easy

  Harry Potter is a thief and a lawbreaker long before he gets his letter. Upon discovering he's a wizard, he sets out for the wizarding world - but he's doing things his way. Dumbledore has no idea what his decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys has wrought. Harry/Multi, darkish, some Dumbledore bashing, rating may go up later.
