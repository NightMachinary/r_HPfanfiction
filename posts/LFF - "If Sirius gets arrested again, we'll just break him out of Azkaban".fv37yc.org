:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, there's a fic where Harry (I strongly suspect an Indy!Harry) is discussing getting Sirius a trial and someone brings up the probability of him just being sent back to Azkaban - Harry essentially just shrugs and says "If they do, we'll just break him out and go on the run. Shit'll be aight."

I can't remember anything else about it, but I very distinctly remember that one scene. Please help find it. :)

Also, I can't find the request thread this other fic came up in, so I'm going to post a link here just on the off chance whomever asked about it sees it (and it's also slightly related to the LFF, so... eh?) - it's where Sirius is responsible for signing some of Harry's paperwork and ends up being the one to name him due to bureaucratic weirdness. The fic is called Registration.
