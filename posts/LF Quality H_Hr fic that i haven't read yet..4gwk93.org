Currently experiencing a craving for a good H/Hr fic as it's been too long since i've actually enjoyed one, but i can't seem to find /anything/ worth while that i haven't read. So here's a comprehensive list of the quality(how much i enjoyed it and quality writing) H/Hr fics i've had the pleasure of reading:

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1][Forever Knight]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Sword of Gryffindor]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3461008/1/Survivor][Survivor]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermoine granger and the marriage law revolution]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2022439/1/Hermione-s-Secret-Diary][Hermoine's secret diary]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5141159/1/Breakfast-In-New-York][Breakfast in New york]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us]]

Taking the list into consideration, i kindly ask for any other quality/good enough H/Hr fics(the last couple fics in my list are more guilty pleasure than anything else). Even H/Hr fics that you very much liked and enjoyed are welcomed. Preferably M or above rating and No Soul bonds/Dimension/time-travel fics, I can tolerate any amount of bashing but if Harry starts to act like Daenerys every time she has to introduce herself...i draw the line there. If you have any recommendations that falls into any of those tropes(or a story below M rating), convince me as to why i should read them. Lastly, i've read plenty of H/multi fics where hermoine is the "1st lady" so use that however you will if you're planning on recommending a harem fic.

If you haven't read any of Lorien's work, you now have a bounty of H/Hr to explore. If you have and don't think of it as high quality, we may need to have /words/...

*** Seconded. Lorien829's work is excellent. I'll add links for three others that I've enjoyed over the years.

linkffn(8693743; 8541644; 6092362)

Senses may be one of the best canon compliant H/Hr fics. I /love/ the development of themes in each chapter regarding the various senses.

** Sunset/Sunrise. very readable. there is a house elf called 'Feeder' who's job is to feed the squirrels.. which terrorize him.

there is a pitched battled between the HMS Victory and several tanks that takes place in and around Harry's pool.. all shrunken by Weasleys who have been assigned the task of saving muggle historical/cultural artifacts and get right to it in twin fashion.

Hermione's reaction to a completely repaired Rossetta Stone, all missing pieces in place/all cracks gone.. good as new..

besides, Bobmin died just very recently.. so read and leave a nice review.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Title says it all, this covers summer 5th year through 6th and does contain adult themes though not much of an adult nature is written. The story is complete and will be posted as time and attitude permits. The focus is on Harry and Hermione with appearances by others more by accident than intent.
