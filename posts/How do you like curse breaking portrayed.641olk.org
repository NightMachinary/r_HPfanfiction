I will admit that I don't quite know what to think when it comes to this job. Bill Weasley does it and we know he is employed by goblins. He also used to work in Egypt. That's about it.

Fanon often has curse breakers be required to have studied Ancient Runes and Arithmancy. I have no clue about canon. Charms and Defense Against the Dark Arts seem important. Then again, the job seems rather vague other than the name.

How do you like curse breaking portrayed? Feel free to mention how you use it in your own writing or fics that contain your favorite versions.


** Frankly, the only cursebreaking I've ever liked was in linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure).

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** Curse breaking is interesting because of the gap between Canon and Fanon. Fanon has made curse breaking essentially the destruction of wards, yet in canon wards don't exist, so naturally it must mean something else right?

As a community we've pigeonholed curse breaking into the destruction of magical barriers (wards) yet we ignore cursed objects, medical healing of the dark arts, using potions and all sorts of other types of magic.

For me I imagine curse breaking as the discipline of removing magic. Whether it's removing a curse from an object, a wound or a building, a curse breaker can do it all. It's why in my head I've always had such respect for Bill Weasley. Curse breakers should have the knowledge to combat all kinds of magicks across all kinds of objects, I can't imagine of a more knowledge and skill intensive discipline. The only wizards shown to have any aptitude for the subject are Dumbledore, Bill and Riddle which goes to show just how skilled you have to be. The other notable mention would be Severus as his knowledge of the dark arts makes him the go to healer when Dark Arts are interfering with healing, be it Dumbledore's hand or during the war. I view that as curse breaking as well.

As for the actual physical act of curse breaking I prefer the mystical over the logical. I much prefer the curse breaker having to magically sense the magic they're trying to remove than using plans and mathematical equations. Magic is a mystical force that defies logic and understanding by it's very nature, I disapprove of attempts to make it solvable using equations. Dumbledore, Riddle and Harry view magic as an art driven by emotions and feeling and they're known to be the most powerful wizards of their age. Compare that to Hermione who views everything with logic and whilst being exceptionally bright, she is never on the same level.

Sorry went on a bit of a tangent there, but the point remains - curse breaking to me is an art, and any fic that expresses it in that way is fine with me. As mentioned here already, [[/u/Taure]] does a great job of that in his fic The One He Feared. As does canon I think when Dumbledore inspects the wards around the cave in Book 6. He doesn't use a plan with arithmetic expressions and calculate the counter, no he sense the magic and realizes what it wants.

*** Fanon wards are so popular because in a world where anyone can kill you or rob you using an everyday object(wand), it makes sense that there exist protections other than just hope/luck and the fidelius.

I fully agree with your view on magic. Magic by definition is the opposite of logic. While it may have guidelines and maybe some ironclad impossibilities, reducing it to a huge list of spells and recipes able to be read and mastered by anyone with an eidetic memory is just sad. That would make it a science.

**** Sure I'm not saying there's anything wrong with wards as a branch of magic, but when trying to define a canon meaning for curse breaking it was worth discussing.

Kinda Nonjon's a black comedy

In my story darkness ascendant harry uses cursepicks and a sneaky pete(yew wand with lunar hyena whisker core) to disassemble cursed sheets of parchment from bill. The cursepicks allow him to 'move' spells while the wand is more attuned to shattering other's spells than a regular wand would be. The moved spells can then be ignored while the spells underneath can then be broken.

According to canon they at least need Arithmancy:

#+begin_quote
  He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking. 'Listen to this: /Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which are currently recruiting Curse breakers for thrilling opportunties abroad/...They want Arithmacy, though; you could do it, Hermione!'
#+end_quote

Based on this description the common fanon depiction seems pretty accurate. I imagine that Bill is essentially Indiana Jones.

** Basically, in my /White Squirrel/-tainted headcanon, a curse-breaker is a specialist of charms-weaving who observes the (usually Dark) enchantments on an object or location, and try to figure out how to unravel them.

They are hired by Gringotts because, somehow, the Goblins can claim ownership of ancient cursed treasures if they manage to get their hands on it; and, therefore, they need wizards (who can use wands) to break the curses on the ancient Egyptian tombs and get them the loot.

Curse-breakers can also be hired independantly, either for the same purpose of researching treasure, or to break individual curses (like the one on the DADA teaching position).

Finally, curse-breakers work at Saint-Mungo's to break the Darkest of curses on humans. I imagine a high-flying Cursbreaker would have been able to reverse-engineer a counterspell to Sectumsempra, for instance.
