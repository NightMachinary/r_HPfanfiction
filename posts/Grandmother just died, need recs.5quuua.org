Looking for fics where Harry works with the queen or somewhere along the line a royal has been magical and gone to Hogwarts (any time period) Preferably very long.

Alternatively, any long fics about the beginnings of the statute of secrecy and how both sides reacted to the split. My grandmother just died and fics are nice and easy to read.


** Long Live The Queen is the first one that came to mind.

2. Harry Potter and the Four Heirs - involves a powerful, political Harry and the Queen who has power in the magical government. linkffn(9048823)

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.
