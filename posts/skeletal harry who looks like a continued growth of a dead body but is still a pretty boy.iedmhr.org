i find the idea of a gaunt skeletal like harry trudging into Hogwarts first day - everyone ignores him for 1 reason or another usually bouncing around the idea of being afraid or disgusted at his look that is bordering worse than a homeless man of 30 years experience in the field but everyone admits there is a strange quality to him that he somehow makes look attractive even though he looks like hes on deaths door and by all means should has passed through it like he was family friends with no need to knock.

then the sorting happens and harry is called already drawing attention because of his appearance but when he steps up to the hat all the boys start protesting that it is a false person as there is no way there savoir could look like that and then some of the girls are whispering to each other about is strange attractiveness and otherworldly appearance making him seem like he belongs in a mausoleum.

the dichotomy between between the the 2 qualities is amusing to me in a way i cant really describe other than it is.

and then there is a secondary link for me which is between that of harry and Voldemort - harry has the horkrux, Voldemort is the original instigator deranging his appearance with the scar like Voldemort did to himself, harry has the deranged appearance similar to Voldemort but the attractiveness and charm of tom riddle.

and a tertiary link is that harry has a GAUNT appearance, keyword being gaunt - the same name that Voldemort's northers lineage possessed

iv'e been questioning my sanity recently and this has only proved my points further - if you can name any fics please do if not could you share your thoughts on the matter?
