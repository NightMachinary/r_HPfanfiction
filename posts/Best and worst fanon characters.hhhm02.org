Characters that fanon usually writes pretty good and and characters that fanon usually writes pretty bad. For me...

*The Best:*

Sirius: Almost always pretty close to canon. Fun, energetic, caring, prankster. All around good.

Remus: Also usually written pretty close to canon.

Daphne: Yes, I know she's practically an OC. But damm it if 'The Ice Princess' isn't fun to read.

*The Worst:*

Besides the obvious bashing...

Luna: My god, is she a cringe in fanon. And then they go on and make it worse by making the nonsense she utters real. Ugh.

Neville: Fanon usually just wanks him. He was not some secretly super awesome wizard. He had confidence issues, and I feel bad writing this, but he was not that great of a student. Sorry. And I know he used his father's wand instead of his own. But we all know J.K. really screwed with wandlore. It has no consistency. Yes, I remember in OotP, he learns a spell quickest after Hermione. However, that happened ONCE. At that time, he was focused like never before, he was giving his all. He definitely grew, but it doesn't suddenly make him a top class wizard. I can confidently say that canon Ron would beat canon Neville in a straight duel. And I'm pretty sure Ron was better academically than Neville.


** I have to disagree on Sirius being written well in fanon. I think people write him way more happier and carefree and, as you say, fun than he really was. From what we do see of his teenage years he was surly and moody back then, and he was certainly troubled in regards to his family. I also don't see where he is particularly energetic in canon? I also find fanon often has him being very sickly sweet and calling Harry cub/pup/prongslet a lot which I just... don't think fits Sirius or many men that grew up in 1970s Britain.

*** I agree with this. I love Sirius as a character and I agree he wants the best for Harry and really cares about him.

But in canon he is not a happy go lucky older version of the twins. He's deeply damaged and disturbed, even before Azkaban.

**** If you want a good fic with realistic Sirius, I'd suggest the Bond Of Family series by Daily-Chan of ffn.

*** Ugghhh I absolutely HATE nicknames such as prongslet, pup or cub ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜  I mean, why the fandom use them? Do people really understand Sirius' pshyche? Sirius isn't a happy man, he's quite depressed and moody. He loves Harry, though.

I think people like too much what the marauders are so they think the marauder Sirius is Harry's Sirius

** Sirius is sometimes way too immature in fanfiction though. He didn't spend all day cracking 'Serious Sirius' jokes. This thread explains it quite well-

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/anvuxx/fanon_sirius_vs_canon_sirius/]]

Remus is bashed a lot as well for not visiting Harry for 11 years, for being Dumbledore's loyal stooge and in Daddy!Snape stories.

Even in fics which portray them well, there's the ridiculous cub/pup routine.

*** The cub and pup things annoy me; but they annoy me for different reasons.

Cub annoys the /shit/ out of me. Remus's arguably most defining characteristic is the shame and fear he feels about being a werewolf. Why in the name of Dumbledore's purple underpants would he give Harry a nickname that links to, and validates, his wolf status? It's one of the most OOC things I've ever seen and yet it's universally accepted in most fanons.

Pup annoys me less than cub, because Sirius is more comfortable with the fact he can become a dog than Remus is about the fact he becomes a wolf. BUT. Sirius does not base his whole personality around the fact he can turn into a dog. He doesn't seem to think about it, other than when he needs or wants to use his animagus form. He doesn't see himself as a dog. He's a human wizard. I also think /Harry/ means more to him than "small child of dog man therefore puppy".

I think the fanon nickname of "Pronglet" or "mini-Prongs" is more realistic, because that's giving them all a connection to James via the relationship they are developing. And Harry loves being compared to his dad, and Sirus (and to a lesser extent, Remus) love reminiscing about James.

**** Those nicknames annoy me because 1) they are overused. Adults dont call kids by their nickname everytime they talk to them. Or at least normally functioning adults dont. And 2) because they are unrealistic. They could come up with a far better nicknames than pup or cub, plus do you really see remus calling harry anything other than harry? And the whole pronglet thing implies that harry is just a mini version of his father. Or that they see him as a mini version of his dad.

** Sirius being fun and /energetic/? Are you sure you're talking about the same person here?

The man is depressed and frustrated as fuck whenever we see him. His life is the embodiment of a nightmare. Sure, he does care about Harry, but calling him energetic or fun is just not true.

** i usually struggle to find fics where Remus is pretty close to canon. I guess you have more freedom if you write about his teenage years, but still. I will never believe he was all confident and dashing the moment he came to that school. His characterisation is usually awful in my opinion. Sirius in canon is also very moody and hauty. He wasn't a nice person even as a teen. Fanon wants him to be. And the only thing he seemed to care about were pranks, the only person he showed consideration to was James. Fanon Sirius is far more charming than what we see of him in canon. Unless he's hiding his charm.

**** I can't say I read enough fics to be an expert on the characterisations of these two, but if this is another way they are written, I might continue avoiding new fics. Sirius and Remus are both complex characters, and we get only glimpses of their different character traits, so I guess that's why people fail at this. And the way they write Remus's werewolf condition still is one of the most horrible and nonsensical things I ever read.

******* It's hard to pick the worst as they're generally pretty similar, but I think it was in an independant!Harry fic where he was moping about being a werewolf every single time he appeared. The "Harry I'm a monster" sort of moping. Refusing aid, refusing jobs, just sorta moping without any real purpose to it.

** Agree with Daphne being pretty rad in fanon. I don't enjoy Sirius though, usually don't think he's written very well. There's good and bad obviously mind, but I think he tends to be written as if he's still a schoolboy. Feel like Sirius should be a little more aged than he is portrayed.

If well written, it could be argued that after 12 years of wrongful imprisonment, Sirius would be craving to make up for the time lost, even if that means acting like a teenager. But I get your point, sometimes it feels like it's mandatory in fics for Sirius to make jokes like he was a student.

** My favourite fanon characters are Lucius (in slytherin!Harry fics, the actual master politician), Tonks and Sirius

My least favourite fanon characters are, in that exact order, Remus, Luna (I'm-so-random-and-quirky) and, with a huge gap between her and the rest, Daphne Greengrass. I don't even have words to explain how much I hate that character. Like I've genuinely dropped fics when she was brought in as a side character.

*** You do know that in many good fics, Daphne can vary wildly right?

I honestly don't see any problem if they are well written, fanon Daphne is in a perfect place to give Harry an intro in politics or more of the Wizarding World, since Ron seems to only talk about basic stuff when they come up.
