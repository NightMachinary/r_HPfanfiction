I read a fic with a mad scientist Lily training her son to be like her a while ago, unfortunately it was incomplete. (Last updated 6 years ago I think)

I recently remember it and now I'm looking for mad scientist!Harry fics.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8551180/][in the mind of a scientist]]

One of my favorite mad scientist fics ever (not that I've found many) where Harry turns into Stein from Soul Eater, and it even has a sequel that has him working at star gate command!

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

** It's been a few years since I've read it but I remember finding Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to be interesting. I know they talked about the scientific method and saying some science-y stuff at least.

*** Controversial. Some people like MoR, but many of us think it's the definition of /shit on a stick/. I'd say it isn't worth reading, then again, /someone/ could, maybe, actually like it. Who knows.
