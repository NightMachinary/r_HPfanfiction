For the most part in the fics I read there is very little magic in it and when they is it's just your average stupifie or expeliarmus.


** The Northern Magics fic by one of the Starfox variants has a pretty damn big focus on Magic.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Hermione is really good at math and calculates how to cast new spells that she invents all the time. For example she modifies the basic Lumos into a laser beam and then turns that into a very deadly laser spell.
