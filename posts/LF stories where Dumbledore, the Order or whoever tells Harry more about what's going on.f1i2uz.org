Going on with Voldemort and the Death Eaters, what's going on with the Ministry, maybe even training Harry on the side, et cetra.

Can be on ANY Site

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

NO Character bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash on a character is usually a no go

Harry can be smarter or more powerful than in canon, but I'd like for it to be believable as well. So nothing like Dumbledore levels of powerful, or even smarter than Hermione or anything.

No characters who are perfect, I'd like them to make mistakes and have flaws.


** I mean... it starts in first year, but sounds like it fits. The smarter than Hermione part is debatable but to be honest, I don't view her as being as prodigious as others think, so Harry isn't unrealistically powerful, per se.

#+begin_quote
  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.
