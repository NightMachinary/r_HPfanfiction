** Clarification: are you looking for a fic where people are looking for a missing Hermione or one where we're following while she is missing?

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12340905][Death's Gambit]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/MagdaTheMagpie/pseuds/MagdaTheMagpie][MagdaTheMagpie]] has Hermione be essentially kidnapped by Death to do his bidding. It is a crossover with the Avengers and has no Tony Stark in it. (It's sequel does though, but it's still a pretty minor role.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9558284][Hiding Alone in the Shadows]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SeeEmRunning/pseuds/SeeEmRunning][SeeEmRunning]] has Hermione get abducted by a terrorist group. Snape goes looking for her. No romance. It's part of a larger AU though, so you might need to read the previous stories to understand how they got there.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/800094][Inquiry and Retrieval]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/arioso_dolente/pseuds/arioso_dolente][arioso_dolente]] is also a crossover, but you don't need to know anything about the crossover to follow the story. Hermione gets abducted by a sort of dragon. It happens midway through the story though and is only a minor plot point.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29484642][Tempus Anima]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/notahotlibrarian/pseuds/notahotlibrarian][notahotlibrarian]] has Hermione get abducted by an alternate dimension Cassiopeia Black supposedly because she is one of her kid's soulmate. The focus is on the abduction and nothing romantic happens at all. Short one-shot.

  Hermione strikes a deal with Death: she collects his Hallows for him and he puts her back with the living, where she belongs. If she'd known it meant a whole lot of time-travel, robbery, lies and fights with Grindelwald himself, she might have reconsidered his offer.

#+begin_quote
  Cassiopeia Black is concerned about the future of her House. Her great-nephew is the Patriarch, and his adopted son is the Heir. While both are fine wizards, she knows that the House of Black will need a true Matriarch in the future to come. Cassiopeia Black is many things: clever, cunning, vicious, family-oriented. What she most definitely is not is patient. So instead of waiting for Harry Potter to find a wife, she decides to summon one instead. Along with one for the other Black Heir, because she's a generous witch, too. She gets both less - and more - than she bargained for when Hermione Granger appears.

** In most of these, the main action doesn't involve looking for Hermione. It involves what happens after she's either found or returns on her own.

linkffn(Full Circle by Crazy Mishka). When Hermione is attacked at home, she invokes magic that sends her into the past.

linkffn(The Granger Rescue by broomstick flyer). Hermione is missing at the start, and the rescue occurs early.

linkffn(The Next Great Adventure by marietsy2). After the war, Hermione left (not quite alone). Years later, Harry comes to her.

linkffn(Where is Hermione? by losthpfanficwriter). Hermione disappeared after the Battle of Hogwarts. Years later, she returns.

linkffn(Can't Get There From Here by Lisbeth Lou Who). Just a start, and probably abandoned by now. Hermione's parents withdraw her from Hogwarts.

linkffn(Mick's Cafe by silverbirch). Hermione left after the war. Years later, Harry finds her.

linkffn(You Only Live Thrice: The Tale of Elsa Jones by pstibbons). Hermione was framed into Azkaban. She didn't stay there.

linkao3(Seven Names by angelholme). Hermione was banished after the war. Seventy-three years later, she returns.

linkffn(Silly Ruler Waving by Horace Nihil). Hermione was obliviated and her magic bound.

linkffn(Semper Fidelis by Untold Harmony). Hermione left the Wizarding World, and didn't expect to go back. Then her son got his Hogwarts letter.

linkao3(Beware of Goblins Bearing Gifts by Dareispirika). Crossover with Labyrinth. The Ministry plans to perform an old ritual to provide magic to squib children. Unspeakable Hermione thinks it's too dangerous, and leaves. Later, she returns.

linkffn(Running and Hiding by RiverWriter). Hermione left after the war. Harry decided to track her down.
