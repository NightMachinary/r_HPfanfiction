I know, there is the "How Fleur Delacour seduced me" fic, but are there yet other Fics? I would like him to be not as immune to her charme as in Canon. Or he is, but if she really wants to (which she does), she gets him to be attracted to her. It can be during Hogwarts Years, but mostly i would like to know Post Hogwarts Fics.

Whether she use her attractivity (physical or her Veela charm or both) just for fun and tease him so she can rejoice in his Behavior (she would do this only, if they are alone, so he wouldnt be blamed) or because she really wants to laid him or even with selfish interest ...means, she is a Dark or Evil Character and he had the Order to catch her or whatever (" *The Master Bedroom of Delacour Manor"* has this element, although as much as the Fic tells, she is more of a criminal, than evil).

/Maybe she is the "softer Version" of a Succubus, so she needs the male Juice to keep her Beauty and the more Magical Potent/powerful the Wizard is, the more Beautiful and attractive she becomes or the longer she can last untill she needs another Session/. But this mentioned passage is just optional.

I would even accept (and be curious) if Fleur isnt just a Veela but also a Mermaid...or she use magic to transform into one.

"Veela Nature" from Archive of our own is also good, despite it has rape elements. that being said, Infidelity Fics are fine too.

I hope, the Fics that i named arent the only ones about what i ask. Let me know.


** In Hogwarts Battle School, Harry isn't immune to her veela powers, even in spite of some training in occlumency, and the main focus isn't about ships. It takes awhile for the fic to introduce her since it starts in his third year. It's a pretty good read if you're into action and mystery in your fics.
