****** Yes, but it depends on how it is written. From some point of view Severus (and Petunia) are the most interesting persona for fanfic authors, because they are obviously negative characters and there is obvious plot of them finding the way towards redemption, conversion, etc. Unfortunately, too often authors are lazy and instead of the conversion story, they skip over all drama and make them too nice. And suddenly you have Severus Snape, who just somehow forgot he was a horrible teacher who made a boggart for his student, and he is just that wise joke-cracking suave dark thinker. I hate those, but it doesn't mean it couldn't be written well. This story is on the better side, because it doesn't try to make Snape nice cheaply. (The same with Petunia who somehow forgots she was beating Harry with a frying pan).

  Exodus 22:18: “Do not allow a sorceress to live.”
#+end_quote

First of all there is a long discussion what exactly “sorceress” means in this verse (there is a long line of Jewish and Christian authors including some really famous ones who actually did not believe there is such thing as magic, so they interpret as meaning something else; actually, I don't believe magic in the HP universe meaning of the word really exists either, so reading HP fanfiction is not different from reading fairy tales).

Second of all there is a discussion, what this verse (and all other prohibition against occult) means for today's life. And even more interesting is question, what does this verse means in the HP universe. There are obviously Christian wizards (I guess, even if most wizards abandoned Christianity during the times of inquisition, many muggleborn/muggle Christians married into wizarding families, and brought faith back into wizarding world), for example both Potters and Dumbledore's graves have quotations from Bible, not mentioning all those godfathers and godmothers everywhere (it was traditionally hard to have a godfather without baptism; Sirius Black standing as a godfather in the church? Lilly Potter praying for the strength to stand against Voldemort? Interesting ideas, without much evidence of course).

I would think, that even if we accept for the sake of argument existence of real magic, this verse would probably mean, that it should be limited to those, to whom the magical power is given, and that occultism is when people who are not magical try to do it (Mr. Filch and his Kwikspell? Or us, muggles, trying to somehow illicitly achieve magical power).

************* I don't know, but it's not my religion. Also with how the world is this day, and age, why are you christian? I grew up christian, but left it after being disillusioned on how God is portrayed to how he acts(which is pretty bad when you think about it), and just the general state of our society, and the sciences that we have.

Getting back to my question, based on all the above, why are you still such a devout follower? I can understand, and still follow most of the principles, but i'm really curious on why you(a christian) are still a christian?

************** Well, I grew up in atheist family (or agnostic) in the atheist Communist Czechoslovakia, so I had to Christianity as part of my childhood. I found Christ only as an adult in the university, and for me it is truly the experience of meeting with Christ (no vision, not anything so sugar-sweet as that), which led to my conversion. Stupid portrayals of God, stupid Christians (there is plenty of those), change nothing about the reality of the real God. With regards to the state of our society, well, it would lead me more towards faith, because I really don't see any other hope that true spiritual conversion of hears for most citizens, if we want to have any meaningful change in society. So far by leaving faith we got Lenin, Hitler, and Donald Trump (no, they are not in the same level of badness), I think that's pretty good argument to change direction back towards God.

********** I have been thinking about this thread for the last couple of days, and I am sorry I let myself to be side-tracked into a stupid argument about the Christianity and religion and stuff. Right now I read linkffn(9203082) and that made me into thinking about forgiveness and anger again (BTW, I am just in the seventh chapter, but it looks quite good).

There is that thing about being angry. First of all, let me make it clear, that I have no idea what your mother did to you, and certainly I have not experienced like that personally, so I have no way to even comprehend what you feel. Nevertheless, I know a bit about being angry for other reasons.

One very smart lady told me once (and she without doubt read it somewhere herself), that anger is the public show of our fear. I am not sure whether it is true physiologically (I am not a doctor, brain physiologist, psychiatrist, or anything of that sort), but I found out repeatedly that it is very helpful thinking about my anger in this way. When I get to the argument with my wife, it is usually very interesting to think what actually made me angry with her (and unfortunately, I am thinking that only later, too often too much later). There may be some justified anger, but mostly I found that there is truly some fear underneath. I am afraid (of course, we are afraid of those who are closest to us, because they can hurt us most), that for example she won't get my point, she won't change her behaviour, and she will therefore eventually hurt me (or our children; even worse!) again. By being angry I am trying to generate enough force to persuade her she is wrong, and I am right. Unfortunately, after twenty-three years of marriage, I have exhaustively tested it doesn't work, and the only change of hearts happens when she herself is persuaded about the need of change.

I haven't experienced true child abuse, but I went through share of anger in my life. I grew up in the Communist Czechoslovakia and whenever I think how much my life (and life of my parents!) was screwed up by Them, I go out of control how much angry I am. How much opportunity I lost because I couldn't grow up in the normal country, how much hurt and debilitated my parents were (my father got his heart attack during the interrogation of the false accusation of rape by the secret police). And I may perfectly know it is completely irrational (well, now less than five years ago; oh well), but there is still fear they will return again, or that I may never recover what I've lost.

Of course, my receipts on what to do with such fear are useless to you (giving my trust in the God's Providence, etc.), but still I think it is better to understand our fears (and yes, as Seneca wrote, if we didn't control our fear, it controlled ourselves), then to think there is something good about it.

Just a thought.
