I've recently started writing down a hp fanfic that I've been playing in my head for the last few years. I've written a couple fanfics before but I definitely need a beta this time. Only trouble is when I look on fanfiction.com there are 10,000+ harry potter betas to choose from and I have no idea where to start?

My story has a slytherin OC, Harry Potter is not in the story though everyone else is. And it starts when they are 11 so no slash or pairings really. If any of that helps?


** Could you elaborate on the story?

I might be interested, but only if I know whats up.

*** Of course though I'm not sure what to add. I'm not great at short summaries. The main character is raised in the wizarding world so he'll be in the opposite position to what Harry was. It will generally follow the main points of the books. But from the perspective of a slytherin. It starts before the sorting. And has some main character in all four houses.

If you want to know anything more specific please ask. Or PM.

**** Ok, first question gotta be: how are events going to unfold if Harry isn't in the story?

Also, what are you focusing on? Given that for the rest of the students most adventures of the trio didn't have too much influence on their daily lives, there are between one and 4 interesting events per year for a normal student.

What is your OC doing that makes reading anout him interesting?

***** Harry died as a baby. So while main points in the story still happen they happen to other people. I will admit that not all the main things in the first book have my OC involved but some of them do and from the 2nd book onwards pretty much all of them do.

Apart from the action, a lot of it will be friendship and house dynamics. Following someone who is having to tread the line between all of the different factions, as the years go on (like Harry) he gets more and more intwined with what's happening.

My main character is a pureblood who knows that when Lord v comes back he won't be able to sit on the side lines so he has an active part in the whole thing. His family was involved with the last war and everyone knows it.

******* I've been bedbound for the last four years and this story in my head is what's kept me sane. I'm actually writing it down for a friend of mine who is sicker than me. And while I'd love people to read and like it, a large readership isn't why I'm doing this one. I understand what your saying though. Thanks for the input anyway.
