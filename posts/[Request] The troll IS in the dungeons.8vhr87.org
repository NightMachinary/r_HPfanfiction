Do people have fics where the troll in PS /is/ in the dungeons and the Slytherins are slaughtered after being sent back to their dorm?


** This could be a really interesting premise since you'd wipe out pretty much all of the next generation Death Eaters in one go and also put a serious dent into the "pureblood culture". And to make things even more interesting, Voldemort was the one responsible for that purge.

*** Assuming none of the upper years could take it out (there were a lot of them too).

I guess that means all the Slytherins that year received a "T" for their Defense scores too.

**** It is supposedly magically resistant... Then again, I'd be surprised if there weren't a few future Death Eaters who already knew the killing curse or dark magic of similar effectivity.

And it might just charge the group and splatter the firsties before anyone can react with sufficient force.

Much like Rowling's romances or her redemption arcs, there is a difference between what the narrator says and what the text shows. Slytherin is supposed to be the house of cunning, but in canon it ends up the dump for kids who want to purge a racial minority because their most decisive trait is the ambition to genocide.

******** I'd think their intelligence, ambition and self-preservation would add up to either not going into the dungeons after being warned that a troll is there or running away at the first sign of it.

The first would mean that none of the top tier members of Slytherin are there when it comes upon the rest.

The latter would be even worse: starting a panic, students getting trampled by each other, ending in a big mess of students tightly packed up, perfect for a good few swings of the trolls club before someone has the wherewithal to start throwing curses about.

********* Agreed. Now that I think about it, not even their head of house or any of the other teachers considered that sending them to the dungeons with the troll might be a bad idea, so much for Slytherin intelligence. Or maybe they just wanted them dead ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I mean... 1st year Ron took it out, it can't be /that/ dangerous.

But it certainly would be enough if it killed Draco, Pansy, Nott, Grabbe and Goyle before the upper years rallied and take it down. It's not like Slytherins would jump into danger to rescue classmates at the drop of a hat. It's plausible that it would take them a minute to gather their forces to assure victory.

  Harry Potter, Lone Traveler, has accepted his role as the Multiverse's fix-it man. A figure of legend in many universes, he makes his way as directed by Creation to worlds where they could use a nudge here and there. Maybe he can prevent the multiverse from destroying itself in apocalyptic fire. Sequel to Stories of the Lone Traveler.
