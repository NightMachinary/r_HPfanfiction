  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

#+begin_quote
  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** If you don't mind slash, check out Fate is a four letter word by Philo on ao3. I know I am recommending this fic over and over. But after finishing it, I could not read fanfiction or other published paperbacks for weeks bc the story is just that good.

It is about a 40+ Harry with almost adult kids. He is a carpenter, Ron is an Auror and Hermione is a public prosecutor. James, Al and Rose have graduated, but Lily and Hugo are still at Hogwarts.

To outsiders Harry and Ginny are happily married. Then Ginny gets murdered and things start crashing down. It soon becomes clear that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life. To the ministry it looks like an open and shut case of a love gone wrong, but Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives. They must now work to catch Ginny's killer and prevent the uprising of another pureblood supremacist movement, all while not knowing who is friend or foe.

It is an awesome who-dun-it with plenty of plot twists that keeps you on the edge until the end. But more important is the portrayal of Harry as a real adult with real adult problems, juggling the demands and needs of his moody teenage kids (especially James') vs his own needs for love and affection and his self-imposed responsibilities to the wizarding world as a whole.
