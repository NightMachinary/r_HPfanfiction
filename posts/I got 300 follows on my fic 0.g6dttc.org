I uploaded my fic late last july and i woke up to 300 follows today! It's surprising because I don't really consider my fic to be as good compared to others but I'm grateful all the same. Honestly i kinda love my readers


** Link your fic so we can check it out also. Please and thank you.

  Harry Potter is, like most children, incredibly curious and imaginative. But thats where the similarities end. So like the curious child that he is, Harry strives to find out exactly what it is that makes him so different. He just didn't think that a talking tree would be the one to help him along the way. AU Elemental!Harry

** I had a fic that hasn't been updated since 2016, mostly because the laptop I was writing it on died. I happened to see how many follows that thing has today...and know I'm trying to write it again.

It just seems rude to leave 1800 people hanging, you know?

** I just found out I have 500 people following my story. I should really put some effort back into it.

Also your story looks interesting, I'll give it a read
