That's pretty much it, really - I love the setting of Harry Potter, especially Hogwarts, and so I enjoy fics using it as a setting vastly more than crossovers that send Harry somewhere else.

Bonus points if there's a lot of interaction between the crossed series and side characters like the Weasley family and McGonagall.


** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-1912/DonSample+Harry+Potter+and+the+Key+of+Dagon.htm][Harry Potter and the Key of Dagon by Don Sample]] Long, good read.

There's a lot more on TTH, but this one came to mind first.

**** Really?

That's interesting, because I always thought TTH did most of the things right a fanfic archive needs, both on the author side and on the reader side.

What's so awful about it?

** I liked Potter's Protector. BuffyXPotter cross. not literature but a fun read.

linkffn(Potter's Protector)

there's one currently being updated, Linkffn(All You Need Is Faith) another Buffy Potter cross.. Faith is the DADA teacher. try Twisting the Hellmouth for more stuff, some of which isn't on ffn. [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/]]

here's another place to look: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Ranma-and-Harry-Potter-Crossovers/93/224/]]

  In desperation, with the threat of Dolores Umbridge hanging over his head, Dumbledore reaches out to find a new DADA Professor. What he gets is a survivor, a warrior and a rebel... who can't do magic. But maybe this Dark Slayer is exactly what Hogwarts needs. Chapter 5 up.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

  George has no children of his own - so he holds his students as tight as he can, and helps them through the unimaginable. (It's the Year of the Carrows, and nobody in Hogwarts is safe.)

** Sorry but could someone explain what LF means? And any other commonly used acronyms?

Edit: Figured out what LF meant a second after I posted this, but anything else would still help :)
