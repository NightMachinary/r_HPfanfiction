Fairly simple request, a story in which Harry is turned into a vampire (Not born it or something, like that heir of dracula story) and the story revolves around the consequences of this. Bonus points if the story is 1. Complete and 2. Harry is not turned into a "True" vampire or any of that nonsense, he burns in sunlight just like the rest with no way of avoiding this. I don't want any charm to block sunlight's effects.

As stated in the title, I don't want there to be any romance/pairings/sex involving Harry, at all. No Drarry, no Harmony, no nothing. I think he'd have more things to worry about then who he's going to fuck when he's just been turned...

Thanks for any replies.


** Sadly, there is a distinct lack of fics like this.

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.

  Niall Horan is lucky by nature, a man who's gotten to live his dream in a way that few do. His luck takes a turn for the worse one night when two men, two monsters, show up, and steal him away from the lie that is his life. A new world, hidden beside this one, is revealed to him as he finds himself at the center of a war being waged for the very fate of the world, one that's been raging for a millennium, and he may very well be the most powerful weapon on Earth. Aka: The Supernatural-Creatures!AU that nobody asked for, where Harry is the King of the Lycans (aka werewolves on steroids), Liam is his servant and only friend left, and Niall is a very cruel joke by mother nature who gets kidnapped and might just fall for the gorgeous, dangerous lycan holding him captive. Vampires vs. Lycans, because I'm that cliche. Pulls inspiration from True Blood, Underworld, and lots of other things. Warnings for gratuitous Twilight references and dog jokes, because Niall thinks making fun of werewolves is the funniest thing ever.

  Harry, during one of his semi-regular tussles with the Dark Lord, is bitten by a vampire. He ...does not adjust that well.

** Blood Bound: A Vampire Story just about fits. The summary calls it a HHr story but it's not really until the end. I'm not normally into this kind of thing but I really liked this story. linkffn(3705709)

  Harry Potter becomes a vampire. Which struggle will be the most difficult? The war with Voldemort, or the struggle to hold onto his own failing humanity? Takes place right after HBP and makes an immediate detour into the Twilight Zone. Beware a HHr story.
