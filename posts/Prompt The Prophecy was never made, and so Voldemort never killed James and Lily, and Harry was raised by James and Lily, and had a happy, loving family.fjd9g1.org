It'd be nice to read an AU like this, of course things wouldn't be 100% great, Voldemort would still have Horcruxes that isn't Harry, Death Eaters wouldn't go into hiding when Voldemort disappeared so it'd be nonstop fighting, et cetra.

Edit: Either the Prophecy was never made, or someone never heard it to tell Voldemort.


** Voldemort would put a hit on Dumbledore and would try to recruit students to assassinate him. Probably the smartest plan would be to give his diary to a student so that they could open the chamber of secrets and have the basilisk attack Dumbledore while he's on the toilet.

Now with Dumbledore out of the way the Order would be left in chaos and all the known members would have target on their backs. Voldemort's other potential targets would be minister Millicent Bagnold and Barty Crouch Sr. As his influence within the Ministry is growing he could potentially find an opening to kill/imperius them and then rig the elections to make Yaxley/Rookwood/Malfoy/whoever a puppet minister.

He'd then start the Mudblood Registration Commission and have Lily sent to Azkaban, but Snape would rescue her. She'd then use her influence on Snape to spy on the Death Eaters. The Order would regroup under Moody's leadership and start committing acts of terrorism against Voldemort's crew.

Meanwhile Voldemort, still maintaining a rather mystic/legendary figure would travel and start recruiting supporters in other countries in order to take over other governments. The Order, by now would have fully recovered from Dumbledore's loss and would have recruited an army big enough to march against the Ministry of Magic. Here they would be greeted by Voldemort's full force and though they'd put up a good fight, they wouldn't know that Voldemort is not only a mighty wizard but also immortal. Even if the Death Eaters would suffer large casualties, Voldemort would be able to capture the Order members. Then he'd go for their families.

Then he'd flay the Order members and their family members (including little Harry) and hang them in the Diagon Alley and in the central square of Hogsmeade as a warning sign.

The puppet minister would act appalled by such actions and summon all the other ministers of magic (or whatever their leaders are called) for a summit to discuss how to deal with this terrorist called Voldemort. When they'd arrive, the Death Eaters would place them under imperius and thus Voldemort would become the de facto leader of the international magical community. He'd start to impose his policies of purging any opposition. Then the magical community would break the statute of secrecy and enslave the Muggles, hence building the world that both Dumbledore and Grindelwald dreamed of.
