:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find this fic where there was some kind of force field that kept the dragons from hurting the audience, but since a trap was set while Harry was still in the arena, it was just him vs a bunch of loose dragons. I'm pretty sure he later had to fight Karkaroff in some kind of honor duel where he ended up using fiendfyre to fight fiendfyre.

Thanks in advance!

**** Anyone know if this guy is around and writing? He's got a few stories and never actually managed to finish any of them. His last update was last August..

***** From the last update we got from him. He says he's rewriting a lot of the stories before he moves onto further chapters. I thinks this is true since I found a line in one of the chapters in Green in the Grey edited out months after I read it.
