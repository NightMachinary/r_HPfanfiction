I trust we're all familiar with /Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash/, its hilarious insanity, and its innumerable dramatic readings and animatics on YouTube. That may be.

But I think it's about time someone wrote a fanfanfic of it. I mean, this is only Chapter 13 of the supposed book, what are Chapters 1 through 12 like? Doesn't anyone else wonder? Or perhaps it might be interesting to rewrite the whole thing "seriously" --- try to find logical reasons why the password would be "Beef Women", why Harry tore out his eyes, etc. I don't know. There's /something/ there somewhere.

The closest I know is, well, myself, who, in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), featured a couple of heavy nods to /Ash/. But that's not enough!


** i have been reading fanfictions for 10 years now and i have never heard abou that ?

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.
