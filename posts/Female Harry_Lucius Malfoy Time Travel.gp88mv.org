:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am almost positive that it is a female Harry fic. It was almost based on Outlander. So after the war and Narcissa dies female Harry marries Lucius. Female Harry wants Lucius to love her. They are staying in a guest place in a small town somewhere to get to know each other. Lucius had stayed there when he was younger. Harry leaves in the middle of the night and falls through something and ends up in the past like the late 60 or early 70s. She finds Lucius and they have sex and he falls in love with her. When she goes back to the future he is so happy to see her and have her back. She was pregnant but I am not sure if it was before she went to the past or she conceived while she was in the past. Does anyone know this fic? Thank you!


** Is it the one where Harry is actually Narcissa? When Harry was sent back in past he becomes her.
