** There is a stickied mega thread on [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]] which has top tier fics listed by category, that would be my recommendation to check out :)

** I have [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f67nlv/exploding_snap_from_the_cursed_child/][one more to add]]:

#+begin_quote
  GINNY: [...] You know, after I'd opened the Chamber of Secrets --- after Voldemort had bewitched me with that terrible diary and I'd almost destroyed everything

  HARRY: I remember.

  GINNY: After I came out of hospital --- everyone ignored me, shut me out --- other than, that is, the boy who had everything --- who came across the Gryffindor common room and challenged me to a game of Exploding Snap. People think they know all there is to know about you, but the best bits of you are --- have always been --- heroic in really quiet ways. My point is --- after this is over, just remember if you could that sometimes people --- but particularly children --- just want someone to play Exploding Snap with.

  HARRY: You think that's what we're missing --- Exploding Snap?

It's from the cursed Cursed Child, and it is probably the only good idea there, which I would love to read expanded upon.

** I tend to have qualms about Kinsfire's stories, but linkffn(Like A Phoenix From The Ashes by Kinsfire) mostly meets your scenario #3. It's not the Weasleys as a family who initially have problems, just Bill and Charlie, but they take actions that snowball.
