:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Once he gets to Hogwarts he starts to question whether he is a boy or not and Madam Pomfrey does a test on his magical core to find out. The test comes out positive and he decides to transition to be a girl. I read this fic last year but I forgot to bookmark it and now want to recommend it to a friend. Please help me find it!


** Was it on AO3 or FFN? If it was the former, it might be in your history, and if it was the latter, and you left a review, it's definitely in your history.

*** I think it was FFN but I don't think I had made an account at the time. Or do you mean in my browser history?

**** It won't help you if you didn't have an account at the time, but FFN keeps track of all your reviews with links to the fics they're reviews of, and AO3 keeps a record of every fic you've clicked on while signed in. I hope that helps.
