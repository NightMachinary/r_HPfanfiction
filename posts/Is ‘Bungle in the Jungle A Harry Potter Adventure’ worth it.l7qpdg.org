linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure)

I hate the summary so I wanted to know before I read it.


** It's dated and tropey, for sure, as others said, it was written in 2006.

But, for my taste, it's a fun read.

- Things happen. Story's full of action and the plot moves steadily.

- Little angst.

- Full of cool fights, demons, ancients ruins, runic magic tomfoolery, animagus shenanigans.

- Some great OCs.

- Harry doing stuff out of Hogwarts, for the first story. This is actually a lot rarer than you think and something I enjoy a lot.

- The Luna subplot is awful. I skip all of it every time. Avoid every letter written by Luna.

Realistically it's 2/5 with today's standards, but I love what happens in the story, so it goes to 4/5 for me. I re-read it every couple of years cause it's so fun.

**** Sure, np.

So basically, in this story, Luna is a normal-ish girl. All the things that make her character (vulnerability, zen-like state, kindness, intuition, oddness, earnestness) are hand-waved away. "Looney" is explained to be just a persona that Luna puts on to 1) Fuck with her bullies, 2) Not show anyone how hurt she is, 3) Get away with saying w/e weird shit goes through her head or do w/e crazy shit she wants.

Now the base idea is solid. It was (and still is) a somewhat novel interpretation of her character. It just doesn't read well. Luna comes across as a damaged girl (which is fair, if you deconstruct her character actually), that is awkward, can be mean, can make the wrong assumptions and thinks the worst of people (i.e a bullied teenage girl). Harry treatment of her is at times kind and at times shitty and she responds with acid to both.

Now as I said, the idea is good, but the execution does not deliver. Reading Luna's letters (they mainly communicate through letters in the first story) should make you feel sympathy for her, right? Well it just makes me irritated. I'm guessing it might be the fact she was written by a middle-aged dude, but there is no nuance to her character. She plays more of a role as a plot device to be news from Hogwarts and Harry's clumsy attempt at a pen-pal friendship with someone he thought he knew.

To close off: ultimately this story is an adventure romp through the jungle, the written equivalent of a double bacon cheeseburger. It feels great when you eat it, but its not going to change your life (well maybe a little bit for the worse, lol). The Luna stuff hamfists a glutten free kale flavored subplot on my burger. I don't particularly enjoy that.

**** I think the beginning was terrible. I'm pretty sure I only managed to read it because I'd read something else by the same author that I'd really liked. But if you can get through the very tropey and poorly written start, the story gets really good.

** Bonus general question: Is it worth reading a fic if the author wasn't capable of writing a compelling summary?

*** No. I'm militant like that - there's so much content out there, why should I bother reading a fic if the author can't be bothered to try to even write a summary.

Nothing annoys me more than this.

**** Honestly, I'm the same way. Another big red flag is "I'm bad at summaries". It usually precludes a story that is so long winded it becomes impossible to read or a story that's just one big run-on sentence.

***** Arg, if you're bad at summaries then you're definitely not going to be able to write a compelling fic! I completely agree.

I once read a fic and the summary was ‘a generic Harry/Fleur fourth year fic' and once I finished I realised that described it perfectly... generic and boring. Wish I'd paid more attention to my misgivings in the summary and not bothered reading it at all.

*** To be fair, the summary on FanFicauthors is:

#+begin_quote
  Get into the mind of Harry Potter as he experiences betrayals and self discovery.   Told from the second person perspective.   A look at cursebreaking and animagery like you haven't seen before.

**** And that's not a bad summary, honestly.

It's clear, concise, and to the point, and it doesn't spoil anything.

"Get into the mind of ... betrayals and self discovery"

= the story is a character-focused story.

"second person perspective"

= the narrator talks to the reader

"a look at cursebreaking and animagery you haven't seen before"

= it explores these two in an uncommon way

*** In the sequel Harry was kind of a rude jerk to everyone except Luna and his friends from Bungle in the Jungle.

It feels like one of those stories where being strong and "independent" means mouthing off to authority figures.
