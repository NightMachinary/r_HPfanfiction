Dumbledore being the behind the scenes mastermind and manipulating things, but it's entirely for Harry's benefit, rather than being FOR THE GREATER GOOD lame excuse at evil that most fics that have that tag are.

How much havoc can a genuinely good and on Harry's side manipulative Dumbledore cause in the Wizarding World? Everything has to be for Harry's benefit, and Harry has to be informed, and the manipulation behind the scenes is against the badguys.


** "DUMBLEDORE! How dare you! You've stolen from my vault and placed me with those vicious muggles! You've tricked me into fighting Voldemort as a First Year, and now again as only a Second Year! What's next, you're going to hire my dad's old friend to manipulate me too?" Harry's magic raged and broke rare magical devices in the Headmaster's office.

"Harry my boy! Here are your stock portfolios, you've become immeasurably richer. The Dursely's? That was for numerous reasons, 1. an impenetrable blood ward. 2. If you didn't go to them you'd be awarded to Death Eaters by the courts, to the Blacks via your grandmother and from there to Narcissa Malfoy who's husband would no doubt kill you. 3. I didn't realize quite how bad it would be, but now that I'm reading your mind, let us go and brainwash them, they should be treating you better. And yes, Mr. Lupin will be hired on next year and I've enlisted his help to give you private lessons on advanced magics. I even have a Triwizard tournament arranged for the year after that, do you want to be our Champion?" Dumbledore asked calmly.

Edit: I think everyone's getting the parody, but I really just want to say my favorite part is the "Dumbledore asked calmly" and if you missed that joke look it up, it's worth it in every way

** This is grandpa!dumbles escalated to a 10 I love it

I'd imagine he'd eventually get a reputation for it, though. Over the course of Harry's school career, people begin to notice that... things... happen to people who don't like him. Lots of Slytherins are punished, but their families somehow get slandered in the papers and many others get revealed as ex-death eaters. Though they cant be convicted, they will never be the same in the eyes of the public. Rita Skeeter is twitchy whenever someone brings up a scoop about the Potters to her, and makes sure to religiously say good things about Harry only.

Things escalate physically and personally. Fudge's personal life and secrets are released to the papers- politicians and their skeletons are leaked to the public. It's a wonder how many things you could get away with if noone knew about it... scummy, gross things. His image is ruined. He steps down.

Umbridge doesnt get away with punishing Harry mid-year. The act is leaked, of course, but other things happen. It's a wonder how much you can do to someone when your house historically has multiple master pranksters originating from it- hair dyed, items wrecked, house flooded, cats de-haired.

It culminates into her disappearing and a school mascot appearing the next day. A toad is a strange animal to represent Hogwarts, but no one complains.

*** While I like this premise, this suffers from what a lot of smart!character stories suffer from. Instead of Dumbledore taking sensible actions based on his experiences and observations, he just does what the writer would with advanced knowledge of the HP series.

In addition to that, for some reason, all other characters get stupider. For example, Krum is suddenly not imaginative enough to turn into a shark in the Triwizard Second Task... I just don't get that.

**** I think the point with Krum (and the other champions), is that because this Dumbledore is much more aware and careful, he changed the rules to be taking wands instead of hostages. In canon, the older champions all use their wands as a solution to the 2nd task (Cedric and Fleur the bubblehead charm, and Krum uses partial transfiguration) whereas Harry, uses gillyweed. Take their wands unexpectedly, and only Harry's plan survives.

  "I cared about you too much," said Dumbledore simply. (OotP, ch37) What if Dumbledore chose a more reasonable way to express his care and went unreasonably out of his way to ensure that Harry enjoyed his childhood? Oneshot from 1982 to wrap up after fourth year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]]: A great aspect of this fic is the back and forth chess moves between him and Voldemort. This Dumbledore does not shy away from doing some really dirty work himself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: This Dumbledore is scarily manipulative, and does not shy away from developing super (alchemical) weapons. On the other hand, Voldemort is a tactical genius too.

******** Unlike Snape in canon, in my stories, Hermione doesn't fill a book with new and improved spells and potions whle she's a teenager.

Generally, I aim to balance her with Harry and Ron - all three are competent, but Hermione is usually more academically inclined while Harry and Ron beat her in Defence, flying etc. In "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", all three are Curse-Breakers, and while she's the best for analysing old magic, Harry and Ron can and do that as well, so they often work in shifts. Harry shines there in improvising during danger while Ron tends to be the most socially active, for good and ill, but all three can handle themselves in either combat or curse-breaking.

In Divided and Entwined, Hermione starts and runs a guerilla force and shines when she can plan in advance, but generally performs not quite as well when she has to improvise while Harry and Ron are trained by Moody and are generally better at magical combat than she is. The strategic and political part of the war, however, is run by Dumbledore.

In the same vein, in "Patron"; Hermione's "magnum opus" is adapting a spell Dubmledore handed her, under his guidance - meaning, he checks her work and advices and teaches her. And, again, politics is handled by Dumbledore and other adults.

In "The Dark Lord Never Died", Hermione's working as a sort of Auror - a good one, but Ron's got similar training and works as a spy, and Harry has been groomed by Dumbledore to kill Voldemort, and not by using the power of love or wand shenanigans. All three are more or less equal in a battle, but, once again, Dumbledore handles the planning, strategy and politics.

******** Not that bad, in The Dark Lord Never Died, the main story starts when Hermione is already an adult, her role is actually quite small in the bigger picture (that's mostly done in the background by ruthless Dumbledore and a far better trained Harry) though the story does focus on her, she made some useful suggestion due to her unique position and some characters (enemy & friends) mention her better than average knowledge, but otherwise, she's what you'd expect from a smart Muggleborn having a successful Auror career.

Bonus if Harry just rolls with it because why the fuck not? Hermione, however, thinks it's all one evil, giant conspiracy, and has misguided loyalty in trying to "free her friend from Dumbledore's machinations".

Dumbledore thinks Hermione's easy to discern attempts are cute, foils them without putting any effort into them, and is happy that Harry has such a devoted and loyal friend.
