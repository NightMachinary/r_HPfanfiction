** The Last Enemy by Rayndeon/Luolang is a oneshot centering around Harry dealing with this concept. One of the best one-shots I've read recently, highly recommended.

** linkffn(10629488) - This is a great story, but hasn't been updated in a little while. I think there will be more eventually, but even if not... what there is right now is /very/ worth it.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** linkffn(11446957)

Harry gets pretty powerful in this story thanks to blood magic and is definitely a darker Harry who's not afraid of killing his foes. It's pretty long and most people agree the author did a bad job with the last two chapters as they are written totally different than the rest of the fic. But overall if you are looking for a powerful and dark Harry this is a pretty good one.

Note: It's pretty heavy on the Harry/Fleur pairing, but it does it well imo.

*** I vehemently disagree with the sentiment that it does Harry/Fleur well. While it I did not particularly like the fic, I did find it refreshing that the Author actually kept his/her schedule and that the fic came to a conclusion.

In my opinion the fic is neither yay or nay. Read only if you can't find anything else.

Also: [[/spoiler][I do not understand why people thought it'd end any other way. It is literally in the title...]]
