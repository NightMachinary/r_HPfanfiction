Personally, I'd make Slytherin have a different doorway in the dungeons every few weeks, and you have to be clever and cunning enough to find out where it is located, using different solutions to enter the common room, while Gryffindor to be honest I'd keep the same, mainly because I haven't thought much about it.

How would you change the entrances to both these common rooms however?


** Slytherin has multiple doorways, each of which are always able to be opened by their guardian. They're all behind portraits, much like Gryffindor's in canon. However, the portraits have a complex social heirarchy, and getting in with one group might mean alienating another.

There are no passwords. You only get in if the people in the portraits like you and choose to let you in. Slytherins who can't manage to inspire fear, loyalty, or love from the portraits wind up bribing them, or simply being left out in the hallway until someone else lets them in. This is why Crabbe and Goyle hang around Malfoy so much - they're too dumb for the wizards who were famous and prestigious enough to get portraits hung up in Hogwarts.

And if Snape happens to remove the most racist of the past wizards every so often... well, they're important historical works of art, of course. Much better to be in a museum, where they can be properly appreciated. Don't worry, this half-blood portrait will do all of that nasty dirty work of opening the doors in your place.

**** You don't /have/ to stick to one 'clique' of portraits. In fact, what happens if they leave, or if another student sets them against you to curry favor ("I shouldn't be telling you this, I know you don't like me, but I felt it was only right to let you know that Nott was saying some /awful/ things about your lineage... erm, on your mother's side, if you catch my meaning.")? You should remain maneuverable, with a fallback option if possible.

Remember, this is Slytherin. You're here to use people to get what you want.

** Alternate regarding Hufflepuff, the house associated with Loyalty: You need another person to be with you to get in, its impossible to get in alone.

I imagine Gryffindor could have a corridor that is a combination of the Room of Requirement and a Boggart, its not the persons greatest fear but something that always tests their courage(hmm could it be instanced so that you are always forced to pass through alone?).

***** But the point is they are sneaking out and in alone because they are trying to keep it secret. Or what if a puff is suffering from depression and doesn't want to deal with people today? Or if they're an introvert and have used up their daily amount of people interaction energy? There are many reasons why a puff might need to get in aone.

********** Being able to interact socially with other people without a structured event is really really important. Probably more important for Hogwarts to teach young witches and wizards than how to fly and brew potions. Interacting socially helps develop your ability to empathize and tends to result in a better morality as a whole. The fact that Hogwarts doesnt once have even a discussion on the moral use of magic is abhorrent. To the point that it sounds like a class that would have been covertly removed in a Dumbledore bash fic.(this is a tangent)

** Honestly, there shouldn't need to be any sort of conventional security measures- I mean it's /magic./ Surely there's some way of just quickly confirming a student's house that students couldn't easily circumvent? Like, if you learn the password for Gryffindor or Slytherin, or solve the riddle for Ravenclaw (and you don't even necessarily need to "solve" it: the guard seems as interested in your thought process as your final answer), then you could get into their common rooms no matter what your house, and if you forget the password or can't solve the riddle, then fuck you, I guess, you're arbitrarily barred from entering. Like, what purpose does that even serve?

Like, in HBP, after Harry gets the memory from Slughorn, the Fat Lady clearly knows who he is, but won't let him in, anyways, because the password's changed overnight. (Except it didn't, even, that was just her fucking with him for waking her up.) Surely, in that scenario it would make more sense for her to let him in, but inform McGonagall that he was out after curfew?

** I always see the Hufflepuff one as just tap any of the barrels in any order 4 times and it will open... As long as your a Hufflepuff (or wearing Puff Colors). The secrecy is just that secrecy to trick non puffs from trying to get in.

The Slytherin one I would have the castle shift the doorway around the Dungeons but leaves small clues like snake heads on the candle holders pointing the way

Gryffindor I would have the Fat Lady and everything remain the same after they came up on the outside of the tower, like the only staircase anyone not a Explorer knows up to Gryffindor tower is one that leads you outside and up around the outer wall of the tower. The staircase has no visible/nonmagical guard to falling off thus Only the Brave can make their way to the Tower that holds the Brave
