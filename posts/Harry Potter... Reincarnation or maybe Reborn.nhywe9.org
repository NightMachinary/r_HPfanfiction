:END:
Are there any fanfics where harry is either reincarnated or reborn into the past as Sirius black or something similar because I think I remember reading this one fic where he was reincarnated as Sirius?(not really sure) and did some type of ritual and was all quiet and and not really doing pranks, and the Blacks as a whole were kind of worried or something like that and he started acting like a true heir and was able to put him acting all reckless and etc. off on Dumbledore(maybe?) using some type of mind web on him and I know for a fact that they found one on Andromeda and fingers were (kind of)really pointing towards Dumbledore.

But like I said I can't remember it all that well and I would like to reread it again but I don't know the author or the names of the fanfic. So if you know some help would really be appreciated.


** There was a story kinda similar, where he is reborn as Sirius' older brother, I think it's "put your galleons where your mouth is" or something.
