In his first year, after he lost Gryffindor a crap ton of points for helping out Hagrid, everyone shunned Harry (and Hermione, I believe) and were nasty to him. And then in his second year, everyone shunned and hated him for thinking that he was attacking the Muggleborn. And then in his fourth year, Ron betrayed Harry by not believing that he didn't put his name in the Goblet. And then in fifth, nobody believed that Voldemort was alive and thought that he was an attention-seeking liar.

Every single time he either ignored everyone's behavior after it was all said and done and forgave them. Why the hell would he do that? And I thought that Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs were supposed to be loyal! Did no one take into account that they were shunning a child for something as measly as house points? I know that they hadn't had the House Cup in over a decade, but honestly! All they get out of it is bloody bragging rights. Did no one realize that their behavior toward him could have any lasting effects such as depression and suicidal thoughts? Honestly, if /I/ was shunned and hated by either my House (who is supposed to be my /family/ while I'm away from my real family) and then by the whole school, I would end up becoming so depressed that I'd probably jump off the Astronomy Tower just to get away from the behavior! It would have broken me.

And I know that Harry was affected by it somewhat but why the hell didn't he end up lashing out at anyone? And why did he just accept their apologies?!

Because if he didn't know how to forgive friends, he would have none left and become easy prey for Voldemort.

One's of Harry's strength in dealing with people is his ability to overlook minor transgressions and see their true characters. For example Ron in GOF, he got into this fight with Harry. But what did Ron do for him in previous three years? Just a few examples:

- Sacrificed himself on the chessboard so Harry and Hermione could continue
- Went with him to face Aragog despite having arachnophobia
- Stood up before Sirius Black despite a broken leg

Ron was a brave and loyal friend to the core. He is also fun to be around and a Quidditch fanatic like Harry. And you want to break up this friendship over one misunderstanding? One?! Fortunately, Harry knew better than you.

*** For true enemies and traitors, like Marietta Edgecomb who sold them out despite knowing the ghastly consequences, he was utterly unforgiving.

For child torturers like Amycus Carrow, one spit on his respected teacher, Crucio awaits!

I think overall, canon Harry strikes the right balance with forgiveness and mercilessness

**** Malfoy nearly killed two of his friends, had no qualms about murder as long as he didn't have to do it with his own hand (and carried out a long list of war crimes along the way), clearly enjoyed the suffering he inflicted upon Hagrid in year 3, called for genocide since age 12, led a bunch of death eaters into Hogwarts and tried to crucio him.

At that point, Harry's reaction to Malfoy in the RoR should have been "Wait, I want to make sure that the fucker is dead" and not "let's save him".

And before anyone points out that Malfoy helped him at the manor, Malfoy was scared shitless of the consequences a false alert would have on his family's life expectancy, not a sudden change of heart. Malfoy never rejected pureblood supremacy, he simply didn't have the balls to do his dirty work himself.

*** I really wish he had had a proper talk with Ron.

On thinking about it carefully, Ron was never jealous of Harry, or at least that wasn't the source of the fight and was never that big a deal to him, but was worried that Harry wasn't as invested in the friendship as he was and was going to leave him behind. Quite a lot of negative opinions of Ron in the fandom come from this misconception and Harry thinks of Ron as much more jealous than he is.

Harry was definitely right to forgive Ron but he did it so fast he didn't really appreciate what he was forgiving him for, exactly.

*** I understand your points. I don't think their friendship would have been destroyed. However... I do think it would have taken a hit. After all they'd been together, it would have hurt more than anyone else, and I don't think an apology would get them back where they used to be. I don't know. I know that I could never have done that... but I'm not the Hero of a book series.

** You mean aside from being the Main Character of a book series written specifically for kids?

There's his upbringing with the Dursleys. He could have just as easily gone the "I hate everything and everyone" route. Which he kind of did for a bit there in OoTP, but that turned out to not be popular so back to forgiving he went. Again, MC, he goes wherever the Author needs him to be.

** I feel so weird seeing posts like these when I know for certain that people kind of hated Harry in the fifth book, even thought he had the most genuine reasons to be upset and lash out that year. And somehow people didn't like him like that.

Anyway, he crucio-ed Carrow. He does not forgive everyone.

And to the main point, yes, Harry is remarkably selfless and forgiving(Dumbledore has told him this). The reason is... well there really isn't any. Nor there needs to be one. Sometimes people just are that good. Yes, people like those do exist in real life. They are hard to find, but they do exist.

** Because JK wanted to make a forgiving protagonist and worked her hardest to make it work.

There are good literary arguments for why both in the books and in the comments, but overall its because JK wanted him to be so she made him be a forgiving person. She wanted a good nature protagonist for her books, so her readers can emulate and learn from. If she made Harry jump off the Astronomy tower then it wouldn't have been a very good story. It would have been a different story and not the one we would all know and love. She wanted an underdog to overcome each challenge that life threw at em, and becomes a better person because of it.

And to give my literary answer to your question I could counter that Harry isn't so much as forgiving per se, but he will forgive people if they either ask for it or deserve it (ie, Snape, Kreacher, Malfoy (to a degree and if you count cursed child) and Dudley). Its the lesson he learned from his parents (specifically his mother but James was honorable as well), Dumbledore, Sirus, Remus, and all of the people he loved in his life. And overall, its cliche but its true, he is just a forgiving and kind person at heart. Because it was a part of the story that JK wanted to tell.
