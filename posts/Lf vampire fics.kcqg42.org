I was wondering if there are any vampire fics where Harry just goes ham on death eaters instead of what seems to be the common nice and soft vampire fics. So preferably M rated but I might settle for T


** I haven't found anything really decent there either. Most readers / writers today unfortunately have the twilight (vomiting) influence.\\
I think it would be a good idea to design vampires like i the Ann Rice cycle or vampires the masquerade.\\
But that this is a bit too gloomy for many explains a lot.\\
The best Vampires in a Harry Potter fic can be found in A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold

And the following story's only Harry is not a vampire but he is op enough ;).\\
The description says Slash, which had kept me from the story for a long time, but is only hinted at and not in connection with Harry.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

**** Ive added it to my list, but at the same it doesnt seem like a fic I will enjoy (just based on the description of it and the sequels). But idk it could be good.

***** What concerns do you have from the description? I've read all of them and can answer questions, I try without spoiling.\\
Miranda stories really have the best world building I've seen in all fanfic's and in quite a few books. The last of the stories (Fic3) is unfortunately not finished but the main HP story is finished with Fic2.
