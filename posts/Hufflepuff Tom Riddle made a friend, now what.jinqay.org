I'm stuck in one of my current projects and would appreciate suggestions.

I'm writing a one-shot where Tom Riddle is sorted into Hufflepuff rather than Slytherin, because the Hat finds "a deep yearning" for something unspecified when reading his mind. I'm going for a distrustful, self-sufficient, ambitious and slightly narcissist eleven-year-old Tom. He's driven more by the need to become invulnerable rather than the desire for revenge, so he's not gratuitously cruel.

He's extremely disgruntled to be sorted in Hufflepuff, looks down on his housemates, despises the idea of friendship... His Head of House forces him to take part in study groups and she keeps pushing him to make friends but he socialise as little as he can get away with. She ends up having a Mind Healer come weekly for him and while they make no visible headway their sessions have one big consequence: the Mind Healer realises that the orphanage is far from ideal and the Head of House organises for Tom to spend his Christmas Holidays with the family of one of his dormmates.

Of course, Tom complains then resigns himself to being the third wheel for three weeks. Except he actually comes to enjoy his time with his hosts and kind of befriend his dormmate.

Now they are back at Hogwarts and Tom blurts out to his Mind Healer that he made a friend, but that he's quite upset because it goes against his plan to become powerful. Their discussion then leads Tom to start to acknowledge that there are different types of power and that having friends might be okay.

That's where I'm stumped. I don't want to drag this story on for much longer. Neither do I want a black-and-white conclusion where Tom Riddle is Redeemed by discovering the True Power Of Friendship. I'm trying to find a way to tie things up plot-wise but leave things open as far as Tom's chosen path to power goes.

Any ideas? :)


** Well, you've got lots of good things so far, but what is the whole idea? What's the theme?

Perhaps you could have him meet some other Hufflepuff's who are willing to become his friends, but he continually pushes them away because he believes that one is enough? But then the question would be, “What do you want this Tom Riddle to be?”

Do you want him to learn to be nicer? Maybe his new Hufflepuff friends have to pull him away from the temptations of the Dark Arts?

Also, please send me the link to your story when you finish it, it sounds like a great read!

*** To be honest, I didn't give it that much thought before I started to write. I just wanted to write a grumbling Hufflepuff Tom who's quite frustrated with all the good will floating around :p Then it evolved into Tom learning about friendship. That's probably why I'm not sure where to go from there.

I think I want to keep the suspense on whether he's actually going to become a Nice Hufflepuff, or still become a twisted Dark Lord, or maybe manage to combine his thirst for power with his new friendships in the way [[/u/bgottfried91][u/bgottfried91]] is proposing.

Maybe I could have him experiment with what this new friendship can bring him, status wise? That would bring charismatic Head Boy Tom to mind, but since in my story he's only eleven and surronded by well-meaning Hufflepuff, he might feel a bit bad about it later? Only, not bad enough to stop.

Going to keep thinking about it, thanks for pointing out that I was missing the big picture! :)

** Tom is, fundamentally, someone who does things because they benefit him. He could view this friendship as something valuable to him that he's willing to protect at all costs and continue his pursuit of power, but this time to protect his self-interest by protecting this friend. You could arguably have the blood purity unrest still come to a head, but this time he's on the other side of it because he and his friend are both half-bloods. Tom ends up on the "Good" side but they don't really trust him because he's only in it to protect what's valuable to him and not for the wider cause.

*** I think that would be a very fitting way for him to react to this budding friendship, indeed!

I did introduce the conflict around blood purity, in passing, so I could use that.

Now I've got this picture of a dragon Tom Riddle being terribly protective of his friends and Hufflepuff in general, because they are HIS, to the point of mass destruction. It might be because I've just read a fantastic not-so-crack WIP about a dragon Harry Potter going to Hogwarts... linkffn(13230340)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Have Tom realize that having friends can be a form of power. Friends in high places come with connections, connections he can exploit to his benefit.

It's be nice for Tom to slowly develop the mentality of ‘me and mine,' where he only cares about the few people he calls friends and would burn the world for their sake.

*** So he would start with making friends because it benefits him, but unexpectedly get truly attached to them? That'd be a cool sequel, but I don't feel like writing this story over such a long time-span. Maybe I could add a bunch of alternative epilogues 25 years into the future, though. /A la/ JKR, expect not writing the epilogue before the books itself...

I could have the "realize that having friends can be a form of power" happen has the end of the plot though. I like the idea of using the blood purity conflict, as suggested by [[/u/bgottfried91][u/bgottfried91]] Not sure of the details yet.

**** You could play the self-serving angle up even more for a longer time : Tom is still a messed-up kid and potentially budding sociopath / psychopath. He could develop his few close friendships with the long-term excuse for the mentioned connections and such and like they're not totally annoying and its oddly nice to feel appreciation and admiration and because obviously hufflepuffs aren't gonna admire him for his cruelty so its logical to be nice to them and so on.

And then one of them gets hurt and Tom is just FURIOUS that someone dared to touch his, HIS, friends. In a way, I suspect he would still view them as his treasures and possessions, just from a different angle. The HIS would be much more important than the friends as words here and he could be absolutely immoral to keep them to him, no matter what the truth may be. He could plot later to have them be dependent on him should he risk losing their closeness due to a job or who knows what.

Tom has an aspect of obsession and ownership after all that seeks craving. Here, he might have just filled that need with a few fellow students his own age from young and the get go, rather than his death eaters who were always just servants for his different needs and objects of founders.

****** Thinking further on this, the key difference could be that these few hufflepuffs CHOSE him rather than the other way around.

Tom didn't choose them out of usefulness. They didn't choose him out of key players to gain power. They chose him, and he got their genuine loyalty and admiration and I imagine that this could still make a grand difference for him at eleven rather than having to claw his way up on the slytherin ladder.

And as such, he could be positively obsessed with this self-chosen "pure" loyalty that he is worthy of and keeping it no matter the cost. Of course, he has no concept of being a healthy friend so mental wise, this might not end very happy for those loyal hufflepuffs.

I imagine he'd just be the same old voldemort to servants who chose to serve him for their own needs. And Canon-wise, Bellatrix is also his favored out of this loyal obsession, no?

It could be an extremely selfish and draining form of friendship, where Tom takes all he can but is always far more cautious about crossing the line of risking their loss. An abusive relationship, in a sense.

... And as his greatest enemy and example years later, doesn't Dumbledore effectively control wizarding Brittain with this deitified loyalty of the greater mass?

To which the end of his obsessions tie in neatly : of course he's not going to accept ever losing them to something as death and this frightens him, and so begins his quest for immortality - just not only for himself.

He's not just out for his own throne in this life. His 'friends' very much ARE the throne itself.

Okay, I'll stop rambling.

** It sounds good and you good go two ways with this: either Tom becomes what he should have been if he discovered empathy (maybe equivalent to Dumbledore) or he could go the regular way by killing his friend and rallying muggle-borns to his cause by saying that they are mistreated by the current government.

*** I think a Dumbledore-like path would be feasible at this point. He would probably be different because he dislikes Muggles and thinks himself superior to almost everyone, but I could see him aiming to become Headmaster of Hogwarts or Minister of Magic because he believes he knows better and wants to slowly mould the Wizarding World into his ideals.

I think there'd need to be a huge change for him to kill his friend. But that gives me the idea that if his friend dies in an accident, one that could be blamed on another student, Tom would probably go apeshit. Either he'd decide that love is indeed a foolish mistake or embark on a quest to avenge his friend, but in any case case it would result in quite a lot of deaths and misery...

** Maybe Tom makes a few more friends (by few i mean few, i can't see him being very social) and they push him towards a political career to eventually become Minister. Or they could push him towards Dept. of Mysteries. Or even Headmaster of his own school (magical college?).

*** Oooh, I like the idea of a magical college!

I like the idea of his friends pushing him toward a peaceful way of becoming powerful and influential. I'm just not sure it'd be in character with eleven-year-old kids. I mean, Slytherin kids might do it just because they have this ambition-oriented culture, but would others realise that Tom's path to power might result in bloodshed and think of this alternative? Would they be able to sell it to him? If that was happening later on, in fifth year for example, definitively, but they are still quite young in my story.

**** I see them less noticing he is headed towards bloodshed, more coming up with ideas that make magic/society better. Maybe one friend is a bit older, pureblood, Ravenclaw(ish), and complains about the normal apprenticeship system since they already know what they want as a job when graduated.
