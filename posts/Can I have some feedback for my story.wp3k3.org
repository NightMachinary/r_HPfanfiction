** I made it through the first chapter, as that's all the time I have at the moment. It is looking pretty good so far, and I enjoyed the chapter. There were definitely interesting (and I think more realistic) changes to the story. So far all I would critique is using a few less direct quotes. We read the books and know what happened in them. I have to say a good start so far.

Sidenote : How long are you planning on making it?

*** My plan is to go through all seven books. And while there are a good number of nearly-direct quotes for a while, it's all pretty much all original writing from chapter six on.

**** Kind of along that same note- the direct quotes tend to bore me but the original writing is when I pay attention. I just finished Chapter 3 and it's pretty interesting so far. I arleady find myself hoping it goes a certain way.
