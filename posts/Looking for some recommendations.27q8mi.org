Looking for some fics that fall into any of these categories:

Marauders Era (I have read and enjoyed Against the Moon, Casting Moonshadows and Shoebox Project)

Time Travel

What would happen if... (eg what would happen if X character was put into a different house)

I don't mind slash or mature scenes providing it's well written and I'd prefer complete stories

** The story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices]] has Harry's daughter Lily travel back in time and meet Sirius Black. It's one of my favorite time-travel stories.

A story that has one of the most unique premises that I have ever read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8706050/1/The-Lost-Lupin][The Lost Lupin.]] Hermione is actually Remus Lupin's little sister, sent through time by their parents.

Both have mature scenes but are very well written and are complete. Time travel is one of my favorite fanfic genres, so I have more recs if you want more.

  Sirius Black never expected to fall in love. That was James's thing. It wasn't that he wasn't interested in finding the right girl, he just didn't think she existed. The problem is that she does exist, just in the wrong time.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

It's an eventual Sirius/Remus slash but god damn if it isn't a great story. There are some smutty scenes later on but I don't remember if they are graphic or not.
