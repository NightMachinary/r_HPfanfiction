Synopsis: When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

This story updated some hours back. A day or so before it updated, I found out this story is a rec on this sub, and decided it was worth a read. I caught up with it in no time yesterday, realized that it was on hiatus for six months or so, followed it and got a notification today morning. Lucky me.

--------------

The story has Adult Auror Ron from the canon ending being reincarnated. While it seems like canon from the start, there are a few differences with some characters and events leading to canon which makes it clear this is a AU world.

It is revealed fairly early that Ron isn't the first reincarnator and his status as a reincarnator has already made him enemies. The Sorting Hat specifically sends him to Slytherin so that his enemies can't quickly act against him. Slytherin is a cool house, there is politicking but not on the level of GoT (characters who are 11 years old act like it and those who aren't try their hardest to blend in) and there isn't any discrimination against Ron (Malfoy still hates him but he is Malfoy so duh).

There are magical cores but those, along with his reincarnation into a smaller body are used as mechanisms to explain Ron's decrease in skill level. There are many female characters but there is no harem. Ron is smooth as hell and uses loads of innuendos in speech, but since he is communicating to 11 year olds, they don't get shit.

There is a really nice sense of mystery in the story, as Ron tries to figure out who the other reincarnators are while hiding his status, learns about his enemies and uses his knowledge of the future cautiously to avoid alarming the other reincarnators.

On the whole, if you don't mind Ron as the MC, like AU worlds with the whole same-but-different theme and like a non-OP MC who knows he is lacking and trains hard to catch up along with mysteries and investigation, you'll like this.

Sorry for being vague but I didn't want to spoil some stuff for prospective readers. This is my first recommendation here, sorry if I overhyped/ underplayed something.


** I have to second this. Its a pretty decent fic. especially if you want to show Ron some love. He gets bashed way to frequently, imho.

** Well written, especially with regards to the mystery elements. The author does a good job of drip feeding clues to the reader without giving everything away too early. It's a rare example of a fanfic which actually has a plot.

The early chapters have a somewhat detached feel to them due to a strange PoV - it's third person limited, so the reader should know what Ron knows, but certain things are kept from the reader (such as what he does and doesn't remember). However, once you get to the Hogwarts Express and after, this detachment goes away as the narrative becomes more candid about Ron comparing his present to the previous world.

Unfortunately a few chapters after arrival at Hogwarts I just lost interest. I'm not invested enough in Ron as a protagonist (or any character other than Harry, Voldemort, and Dumbledore) to care about what was happening. I found myself longing for the moments of the "real story", i.e. the scenes in which Violet appeared, and skimming over all of Ron's solo scenes/time spent with Slytherins.

*** She's a time-traveler as well, and was raped by an alternate Ron I think.

The story is good, but I got sick of the way Ron pals around with immature little Slytherin girls. I would have preferred it if he joined Harry and Hermione. The whole Hermione hates him plot seemed forced to make that impossible, and I can only take so much 11 year old Daphne Greengrass interacting with Ron.

Yeah, his whole innuendo laden speech while talking to 11 yr olds is a bit too much. I don't know if you've caught up, but I kinda don't like how outmatched he is while interacting with those of his (or above) mental age.

Sounds pretty accurate to canon.

****** But this isn't canon, this is a do-over story with Ron as the protagonist! I understand not having him be all OP in magic, but having him outmatched in speech with anyone older than 11 is... infuriating.

******* Sounds... great!

You're currently doing a great job of convincing me to actually give this fic a shot. I usually avoid these kinds of stories because praise-the-Ron is always completely OOC.

******** As a dimensional travel story, I really like it. The whole plot of having other (more OP) reincarnators is done well.

DLP has another opinion of this story tho.

**** Yeah the whole pinching thing or whatever was super annoying. I also got super bored by the Daphne sublot and stopped reading during the winter break when that was the entirely of what was going on for several chapters. Might pick it up again at some point though.
