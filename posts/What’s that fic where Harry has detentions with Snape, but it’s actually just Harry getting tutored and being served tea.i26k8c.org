:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember very vividly that the house elves bring up peanut-butter biscuits that Harry liked so much. They also had a fallout in their relationship at one point because Snape overheard Harry and Ron calling him a git. This causes Snape to start serving Harry some stale biscuits while he does his homework.


** I'm going to read the one you were talking about, but there's also this one. Snape tries to get to know Harry (and later the other kids) with tea and biscuits, and each one gets their favorite flavor. When they're in detention, there are no biscuits.

  AU - What if Severus had been able to overcome Harry's resemblance to James? What if Harry weren't the only Griffyndor with Slytherin traits? ...Snape ends up mentoring the Golden Trio. Contains corporal punishment, not abuse. Several sequels now posted.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
