:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm sure that it's a fem!harry fic, the one plot point i can remember is Ron dies somehow ( fem!Harry accidentally kills him, i think) and fem!harry is a necromancer, after a day he's been dead, she brings him back. But this is a Dumbledore bashing fic, so he kills Ron because he believes the dead should stay dead. I know fem!harry and Ron aren't on bff terms, I think fem!harry isn't in Gryffindor. I don't know if it's a time travel fic. thanks for helping

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.
