This seems to be a pretty common elements in many Fics that feature her, especially those with a H/Hr romance:

At some point of the story Hermione does something presumptuous, because she thinks she knows best, which has bad or fatal consequences for all involved. She then often cries a lot, apologizes profusely and grovels for Harry's (or everyone else's) forgiveness. Of course she is forgiven (sometimes begrudgingly) and she promises to never ever do that again.

From this point onwards her character is completely ruined: She becomes a demure, walking encyclopaedia, who is completely submissive to the whims of the author or the protagonists.

Another variant of this trope often involves house elves and how horribly wrong she supposedly is about them and how she has to learn about things before casting judgement. Often this point is driven home to a ludicrous degree by making, what she was supposed to know, common knowledge and her "stupid" book-learning is to blame for not knowing this.

Ignoring the horrible mistake of destroying a strong female character it also makes her much less interesting. It's something that seems very typical in such stories: Removing nuance, by not allowing characters to have flaws and growing naturally into overcoming such flaws. It's done to other characters as well (Neville: Some big event happens [worst incidents involve removal of some kind of magic compulsion on him] => suddenly he isn't shy anymore).

Of course Hermione's "know-it-all" attitude can sometimes lead to problems, but it is also one of her biggest virtues: She has strong convictions and is willing to stand behind those. When she is right about something she is fantastically right and of course that can equally swing in the opposite direction if she is wrong. Part of her journey should be to balance these characteristics, not abandon them. People seem to forget that she was almost entirely correct about the whole Firebolt incident, just that her approach was maybe ... less than optimal, but that is something that should be used as a starting point for natural character growth.

Similarly, having been wrong about the situation with Sirius and the Department of Mysteries doesn't make Harry's actions that day any less heroic or require him to drop his heroic attitudes because he has to "learn a lesson" from that.

Just had to get this off my chest after seeing it for the umpteenth time.


** Yes this trope is usually handled with all the subtlety of a shovel to the face. It can probably trace its origins to the Firebolt incident and this scene in book 5:

#+begin_quote
  /“Whoops,” he said softly. “Another zero, then, Potter . . .” Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished. “I'm sorry!” said Hermione with her hands over her mouth. “I'm really sorry, Harry, I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up!” Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him about using Umbridge's office again./
#+end_quote

I find it's usually Dark!Harry fics that use this trope and I've yet to be impressed by a single one of those save "The Lesser Sadness" but that's all of three chapters. It's used as a way to destroy the 'Golden Trio' so Harry can move on to his new friends.

I remember reading an article that was defending R/Hr that tied into some of my issues with this trope. Basically both Ron and Hermione are combative in their beliefs. Ron because he's the youngest boy in a family of nice and being heard in that mess means having to yell. The author argued that Hermione was much the same, no doubt learning it from her parents. Harry on the other hand detested that kind of conflict, JK mentions it again and again through out the years. He struggles when Ron isn't there because Hermione has no one but Harry with which to spare. To Ron and Hermione arguing and being forceful means family, something you'd only do with people you trust. To Harry it brings up all the abuse and neglect of his childhood.

But no one using this trope seems to understand the above and what a dynamic shift in character it would be for Harry to be as domineering as he is in these stories.

**** No the arguing isn't an expression of their affection for each other. It's the fact that neither of them take it personally. That's the distinction so few people seem to make. Ron and Hermione feel safe communicating with each other on any level and /that's/ why they fall for each other. They can be themselves and feel accepted, something neither of them find in anyone else in their time at Hogwarts.

Not all of us "argue" with others just because we dislike them or think they're stupid or whatever.

"Knowledge without wisdom can never become truth, Hermione."

I agree completely. This trope often makes her into this walking quest-log/lexicon with hanging head. I'm not sure about the fics, but there are some where Hermione accepts her being wrong, but doesn't end up sacrificing her character.

** The typical being-wrong-about-house-elves trope is so overused and exaggerated when considering the books. The way I see it is that house elves may be naturally subservient, with exceptions like Dobby. This may be due to their nature or social behavior. But this obviously isn't a reason to mistreat elves and unnecessarily punish them. I think Hermione was shocked to see that there were elves who basically acted as slaves, and considering her Muggle upbringing, she was horrified by the parallels.

**** Kreacher definitely acted strangely, but this may be due to Regulus's order to destroy the locket, and the fact that he never liked Sirius and (probably) grudgingly accepted him as his master.

Taking this from Hermione's perspective, if Sirius was nicer to Kreacher, he would never have been ordered to "get out," preventing Kreacher's role in his death.

I brought up the slave comparison because iirc Hermione did so in GOF (correct me if I'm wrong) and technically the elves are bound to do the bidding of their masters.

For example, the trio almost unanimously dislike Snape - and Hermione has good reason to when he humiliates her for the teeth incident - and yet she insists they show him respect by referring to him as "Professor Snape."

I see that same logic playing out with Draco. If someone deserves condemnation, she needs solid proof, not instinct.

When she's portrayed in fiction of having the authority complex (where she instantly respects anyone in authority) it annoys me. As children, yes, we're taught to respect authority, but we're never taught not to question it. We just don't question it to their faces and it seems like canon Hermione never quite made that connection. I think some authors take it way to far to the next level and then demoralize and trash her character after the fact. It could instead be used for much better character building, I think.

** I like the trope. I mean, not the one where the character is subservient to her partner for the rest of the story, but the one where a character's flaws lead to a big mistake and there are consequences for it.

This is why my favorite characters in the books are Ron and Dumbledore. Both fuck up in a big way, there are consequences and both of them have to work hard to redeem themselves. It is also why I don't particularly like canon Hermione; out of the trio she has the most significant strengths, and yet she is the least flawed of the three. Morever, the magnitude of her failures don't come close to those of the other main characters. Ron leaves in the midst of the horcrux hunt, Harry's issues lead to Sirius's death, Hermione... fails at spew, I guess? I would have liked Hermione a lot more had she fucked up more and had to make up for it.

*** I agree I feel like if Hermione had that one big fuck up it would have brought her more whole as a character. Im not saying she is a bad character though just that she would have look more human I guess. The way i saw Hermione in the books is a smart but socially stupid character and also sometimes bossy or pushy person. When reading the books i always thought she would get a little to much for Harry with his closed off self and him hiding his emotions. Because we can all assume that he was punished for showing jealousy or sadness to a situation at the Dursleys. So you couple this with her while good hearted but overbearing need to help him with his issues. I feel this would cause a rift between them and it would give both character but mostly Hermione a chance to reflect on themselves. With Harry realizing that she was just trying to help and Hermione realizing that she could back off a bit and be more gentle with her approach to these things.

** I too have seen this annoying trope, it simplifies Hermione's character and reduces her to a stereotype. I think Hermione is victim to this more than any other character because she's the female protagonist in a fandom with predominantly female fan fiction writers. Canon Hermione's knowledge comes realistically, but fanon Hermione is a walking encyclopedia out of no where.

When I reread the books I notice that when Hermione and Harry/Ron disagree over something and she was right (Firebolt, Sirius, Half-Blood Prince), it was in an unexpected way.

** She had it wrong often enough in canon:

- She was wrong about Lockhart

- She was wrong (or at least misguided) about house-elves

- She was wrong about how to handle Harry in year 5

- She was wrong about Draco in year 6

- She was wrong about the Deathly Hallows

- She was wrong about the horcrux in Hogwarts

Despite all that, her self-confidence never wavered, which means she kept believing in her logic and rejecting esoteric ways of thinking, for both good and bad.

Lockhart fooled absolutely everyone. No person figured him out. Even Harry still believed he actually did those things until the very end. (he disliked Lockhart because he was a pompous prat who went on and on about fame, not because he "saw through him")

There is zero evidence to suggest this. As far as canon is concerned she was right about them (though naive in how to act)

Harry was completely unmanageable in year 5. There was no way to "handle" him.

Shouldn't she have at least given him a sliver of benefit of doubt? He had just spent weeks and weeks the previous school year learning about Voldemort's history and his motivations. Harry was the closest thing to an expert that there was after Dumbledore died.

***** Godric's Hollow turned out to be a trap, after Harry wanted to go there and look for Horcruxes. Voldemort also lured Harry to the Ministry in OotP. Harry was right that Draco was a Death Eater, but didn't expect the invasion any more than Hermione did in HBP. Overall, Harry's hunches have a less than stellar track record, so while an argument can be made that she should have given him the benefit of the doubt, you could equally say that she shouldn't trust his hunches due to how that turned out last time.

** Well, I agree with you that she's a strong female character, but defending the fact that she's unable to admit that she's wrong or has been wrong in the past (I mean come on: She was one of the Lockhart fangirls for example, not to mention that she follows the headmaster like he's a god (cutting contact with Harry for 2 holidays in a row whe he's just seen someone die for fuck's sake!) and did go behind Harry's back (the Firebolt incident!)) is WRONG, too!

Sure you shouldn't go over board with this, but her learning her lesson IMHO is necessary for Harry/Hermione to work (note: I think she wouldn't turn into a Yes-Girl - which is good! - but she might change her approach to things (she's intelligent enough to learn what works and what doesn't after all!)) because Harry hates being bossed around (he would sooner or later put his foot down) and he doesn't trust authority figures just because (I mean he's been treated badly by most authority figures in his life: From the Dursleys to Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall!)

Yes, she was right about the Firebolt, but that doesn't mean her approach to it was right (going to McGonagall was NOT the right thing to do - convincing Harry to turn it in himself would have been the right thing to do...or: Use it herself first (and take the bullet for her friend, if the broom had been cursed!)...but not go behind a friend's back, that's never right and never will be right! It's one of the few instances where I think Ron was right, even if it was only because he wanted to try the broom out himself!)

I think that "she's got to learn her lesson"-trope (which I think is a good thing, as long as you don't go over board and chance her character totally!) exists because in canon she never does learn her lesson! In fact people tend to worship her in the fandom (even her bad qualities like believing she's always right and that she's better than anybody else! Come on she tries to sour Ron's relationship with Lavender, despite it being her fault for not making a move first (she's a modern, strong woman so why doesn't she approach Ron if she wants to be together with him?)...not that I think her and Ron would work in the long run (I really question her judgement here, as Ron is her polar opposite and while that might be nice at the start of a relationship, it will soon get old and lead to more and more fights!)
