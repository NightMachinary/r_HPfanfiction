*** The author you are mentioning is a known and proud neo-nazi who constantly defends the most extreme ultra-rightwing behaviour in his characters

I read your rant about him and you are either purposefully defending him and are yourself a neo-nazi

Or you are so deluded and arrogant that you refuse to belive that an author that wrote something you liked is a massive piece of shit.

Some parts of the stories he writes are good, most of it is politically racially motivated garbage.

**** Honestly it would be more accurate to say that I'm ignorant, I knew he was kinda bad, but not nearly as bad as you are describing, and I also know jack shit bout politics, I may have missed the majority of nazi shit, and only noticed what he directly states as political views, like the part about women and voting. Also if he is hated for his ultra-rightwing behavior, then why isn't Less Wrong (writer of HPMoR) hated for his ultra-(what's it called? Utilitarian? I'm talking about the political mindset that is about sacrificing the individual, for the good of the many) behavior, I have already mentioned this and gotten no response but he has said things like "I would rather have a single person be tortured for 50 years than have all of humanity for the next trillion years have a single fleck of dust/sand in their eyes forever" or something very similar to that.

Or the literal essays he crams in about how women exist to reproduce, are naturally manipulative, and should never be put in leadership positions? Or the one about how people who are visibly different from each other will always be fundamentally opposed and must be separated and never permitted to mingle or intermarry?

You can still read his work, you know. I enjoy HP Lovecraft, and he was the kind of racist who made other racists say "Woah, man. Chill out" even in the /20s./ Bending over backwards to defend him only makes it look like you agree with him. You don't have to agree with an author's perspectives to enjoy their stories, but it's important to be aware of them.

#+begin_quote
  but because he's /notorious/
#+end_quote

The author is infamous for saying things like "I would rather have a single person be tortured for 50 years, than have all of humanity for the next trillion years have a single fleck of dust/sand in their eyes forever" or something very similar to that, if the guy was an HP fanfiction trope he would be Evil!GreaterGood!Dumbledore

#+begin_quote
  the ones whose names literally always start drama
#+end_quote

The mere mention of HPMoR starts flamewars in the comments section that are miles wide, and include every single insult in the history of insults, it literally goes from "I like HPMoR" to "I hope you die in a brutal car crash you satanic piece of scum" in under 10 minutes, and the HPMoR subreddit and it's users are toxic AF.
