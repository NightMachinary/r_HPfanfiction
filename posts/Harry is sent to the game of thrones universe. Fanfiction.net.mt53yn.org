First time I've used this subreddit so unsure if asking for someone to write stories is allowed but I guess I'll find out, anyway, the story I'm looking for/want to read if anyone decides to write one is where Harry is sent to the game of thrones universe, either by going through the veil, hit by a "mysterious" spell, or making a new potion.

- Overused master of death/Immortal Harry.
- Prefer that Harry appears in front of the house of black and white If the author chooses Master of death.
- Preferred pairing is Harry/danaerys but will read Harry/Sansa. Plz don't make Harry gay, I have no issue with gays, but I'd rather not read it.
- The author chooses how effective Harry's magic is on white walkers and/or the knight king
- The author decides If Harry has an animagus form and what it is if so.
- And of course it's Game of Thrones Soo...
- Anything not listed the author has free reign to choose

Thanks for reading ðŸ™‚

Afterthought: you can also make him Immortal by using a combination of Phoenix tears and basilisk venom in his blood, or the prophecy, specifically the line: Either MUST die at the hand of the other, or even a mixture of both. If you choose to not use the Master of death route.


** What you're asking for is pretty much the common ingredients for most non-slash ASoIaF fanfics, like how the ingredients for bread make bread.

Just go browse the crossover section on FFn.

*** I used to ask what color is that brown cow. But now my mind has been permanently altered to note that ingredients for bread make bread.
