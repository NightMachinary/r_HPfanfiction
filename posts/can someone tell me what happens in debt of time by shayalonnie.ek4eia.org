so i know everyone's just gonna tell me to go read it but 1) its 700k and i dont have the energy to read that much right now and if i stop reading for even a bit i forget literally everything. there are so many fic that get mashed into one because i forgot certain bits and mix and match them with others in my brain lol.

and 2) i read up to the end of what i believe the author calls book 1 - so the present day stuff - and i wasnt hugely keen with the bonding thing and the way sirius treats her when shes still a teenager, i get that due to the time travel they were already together and i like the ship fine when its equal but a 35 yr old kissing a 17 yr old? uncomfortable. and the fact that they remember her and everyone is still dead means she must not have changed anything much which is my biggest pet peeve in time travel fic. fuck preserving the timeline.

so i got a bit in but never got to how she actually goes back in time or what happens there and despite the pet peeves i still want to know how it happens and what goes down, its such a long fic so clearly there's a lot of content and one thing i love about time travel fic are the interactions between characters that never met/had very little interaction. i read one where hermione became a potter and i loved her and james' sibling relationship more than the actual ship lol. same with that one where she becomes lucius' malfoys sister and all the lily evans twin ones. i love siblings so much!

so anyway if anyone could give me a rundown of it and how she goes back and what happens, who she befriends and what the thing with remus is (they date? inch her resting) and does she go back to her own time and does she change literally anything and how it ends and anything else i'd be very grateful.

I dropped the story when Dumbledore made her vow to not fuck with the timeline. What is the goddamn point of time travelling then?

** Hermione goes back in time, where she can't change anything important, but she can have sex with Remus and Sirius back when they were young and cute. The whole thing seemed pretty pointless to me. I mean, hurray for sex, but this was an unnecessarily complicated way to get it.

** I actually liked parts of this story. Book One is the essentially DH but with Sirius. Book Two is Hermione transported back in time to be Mia Potter and grow up with the Marauders. Book Three is the in between after Mia “disappears”. Book Four is when Hermione and Mia essentially merge and it's a bunch of wish fulfillment (torturing Dursley's, blackmailing the Wizengamot, etc.)

Things I enjoyed: I actually LOVED Lily/James in this story. I found their love story compelling and makes sense with canon. I found some chapters genuinely funny and enjoyable to read. I got emotional at a couple as well which is hard for me in fanfic. I liked the Potter family in general, and yes she and James have a sweet relationship which was cute. The overall writing quality was consistent for the 700k+ words which is impressive.

Things I disliked: Mia is essentially an OOC but perfect at everything and loved by two men blah blah blah, that got a bit old. Also the soul bond weirded me out a bit, but I'm also not into them in fanfic. Also personally disliked the werewolf/animal form hyper-senses. No you can't “smell” embarrassment. I also thought a Harry was kind of an idiot and I get that it's not his story but there's no reason to change him the way he was.

Overall, I found it to be worth the time involved mainly for Book Two because there's a lack of quality Marauder era fics out there and I enjoyed this part. Book One was my least favorite to be honest. And the guilty pleasure part of me enjoyed Book Four because who doesn't love Umbridge getting fed to the giant squid?

** In the scene where Sirius and Hermione kiss in present day, it's the Battle of Hogwarts.

Hermione is the oldest of the trio and was born on September 19th 1979.

The Battle of Hogwarts took place on 2nd May 1998.

Hermione would have been 18 and would turn 19 around 4 months later, (if that makes you feel any better. The age of becoming an adult in the wizarding world is 17 though.)

I love the story and I totally cried. Amazing! You def should read it if you ever feel up to reading a lot!

One of my favorite things was the relationship between James and Hermione. They are such adorable siblings and they had such a cute bond, I love it!

** I don't have a through enough recall to summarize it with the accuracy it deserves.. but a few things- 1: the changes to the timeline are so well thought out that it really is worth the read. 2: the Sirius/Hermione things starts out a bit odd but it adjusts pretty quickly(and she is /technically/ 18 in the beginning.. also.. time travel.) 3: there is currently a podcast being produced that might be a better way for you to get through it? It's called firewhisky & honey ... they just wrapped up the first season/book! Good luck!
