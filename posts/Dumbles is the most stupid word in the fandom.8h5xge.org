******** My first thought is the scene in Twilight where Cendric tells 'plain jane' to "Say it. Say it...out loud" in regards to him being a vampire. It made me chuckle thinking about Voldemort replacing him in Twilight. Him being all brooding at a high school while he's obviously an adult with no nose and horrible pale/transparent but sparkley skin, and the glowing red eyes. People just think he's an albino with 'Benjamin Button's disease' who had a botched nose job. Sounds like a funny crack fiction.

I requested Deaf Farters once, but it wasn't well-received for some reason.

*** Meh, I don't think so. I don't find it very funny myself, but given who Umbridge is, I think it's quite plausible that the werewolf community or similar might make up that nickname for her.

** I'm divided on this one. It's incredibly stupid within a story, unless it's a a total crackfic. But I'm rather fond of it as a word that we, the fans, use just throwing around a sub or message board or whatever.

** I don't normally like fics that use them, but I think that's because they belong in fics that maintain the same whimsical/absurdist nature that cannon has.

They are definitely too common in fannon, but they have their place. For example, it is not out of character for Fred, George, of Peeves to use terms like Dumbles, Umbitch, dark tosser, or Moldyshorts.
