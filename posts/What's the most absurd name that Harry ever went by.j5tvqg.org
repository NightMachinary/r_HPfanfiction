You know how some fanfics call Harry "Hadrian"? Well what are some others?

I once read a fic were he was called "Harold" qnd another where he was called "Henry"


** 'Harry' is at least a legitimate nickname for Harold and Henry, Hadrian is the one that usually pisses me off the most. But that's just leftover from the days before we found out his grandfather was named Fleamont, back when it seemed like the Potters gave their kids normal fucking names.

**** Charlus, technically, but that got retconned/adjusted later. Fleamont and Euphemia - though personally I think it makes sense that James' parents had particularly odd names. After all, if anyone is going to be very, very, very sure to give their child a typical name it's people named 'Fleamont and Euphemia'. :D

***** Why does everyone consider Euphemia such a weird name? Like sure, it is a bit old fashioned but it was common enough that it reached top 200 for female names in Britain multiple times during the late 19th century. So to me it seems more like naming a kid Gladys in the 80s than naming a kid, I don't know, Banjo?

****** It's partly because it's accompanied by Fleamont, and any name accompanied by 'Fleamont' will always sound weirder than it would alone. And partly judging by modern standards. And partly because it sounds like the name for some prim Steampunk Schoolmarm who murders enemies of the Empire on weekends with a clockwork tuba rocket-launcher.

Probably also a dash of priming in there too. We hear 'Severus' and 'Albus' a lot, so we kind of unconsciously think of and accept them as 'normal' names by wizarding standards - not a lot of people talk about Euphemia or even know about her, so the name doesn't get used as often and we're less primed to accept it like we do the names of the main cast.

**** There was a guy named Charlus Potter on the Black family tree in OotP that too many people immediately assumed must be James' father despite clearly not being the right age, and then later Rowling put out that James' parents were named Fleamont and Euphemia.

I'm fine with Henry, since it's actually what Harry is a diminutive of.

Hawthorne is from Deadly Nightshade, where he's Poison Ivy's son. So it makes sense, even if its a stupid name. linkffn(13003733)

  Lily and James weren't Harry's parents. They were his aunt and uncle. Petunia decides she shouldn't have to raise her nephew when his mother is perfectly capable of doing it herself. She tracks down her wayward sister who enjoys attacking people with giant plants, and quickly washes her hands of the entire situation. Now, Gotham and Batman have a new young villain to deal with.

** Turning this question on its head a bit: 'Harry' for Fem!Harry.

Usually the character will be called Harriet, but go by Harry pretty much all the time. Perhaps it's not especially far fetched, but it just breaks my brain. When I'm reading a Harry Potter fanfic, I expect Harry when I see 'Harry', and to have it then followed by female pronouns and such just constantly triggers my 'oops, that's a typo' response to the point where I can't stay immersed in the story.

I admit this is pretty much entirely on me though. I have experimented with search/replacing Harry with any other name (including unisex names like Alex) and the issue goes away.

** Prince Harry, the guy second in line for the throne of the UK, is legally named Henry. Never understood that nickname, but it's a big thing for the Brits. Harry for Harold is as common as Jerry/Gerry for Gerald. Which is to say, very.

Last time this came up the big winner seemed to be Hieronymus. I'm a bit of a Harry Bosch fan, so i kind of dig it.

I think if I'm writing something where Harry considers Sirius his dad instead of James, Harry would go for Procyon Black. Although I'm sure a lot of people would complain about that one.
