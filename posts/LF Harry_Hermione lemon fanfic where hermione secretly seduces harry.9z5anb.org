I read this fanfic a year back but I forgot its title name, and can't seem to find it no matter how much I search. Can someone help me out here please ? :)

​

The story goes like this:

​

Harry gets note/letter at hogwarts from an unknown girl and she tells him to meet at whomping willow and she says that she will kiss him but he cannot see her face...harry goes to the willow and she uses body bind and some other charm to ensure she cant see him and they kiss. Later, he gets another note to come to a cupboard and harry goes into the cupboard where the girl is hiding and its dark so he cannot see her, but that girl gives him a handjob there.

​

Later, harry realizes its Hermione who is sending these notes and she is the unknown admirer who has a crush on him. I think he finds that because the girl has same scent as Hermione. I left that fanfic midway, and never completed it.

​

Can someone please help me find it ??? please!


** I'm legit cracking up right now at the handjob scenario. What an image. I can just picture Hermione with a cloak and hood to hide her face so that Harry doesn't recognize her, dragging him surreptitiously into a small, dark cupboard whereupon she immediately whips his cock out of his robes and starts jerking him off. Because, as everyone knows, it's every teenaged girl's dream to give a dry, frenetic handjob to her crush inside of a pitch black, musty old cupboard. No words are exchanged, obviously, because she can't let Harry know who it actually is underneath the totally unsuspicious full cowl and cloak.

I know, I know, it's a smut fanfic and it doesn't have to make sense, but the absurdity of the scene is absolutely hilarious.

This made my day better, so thanks. Sorry I couldn't help you find it though because I now want to read it just to see how it actually played out.
