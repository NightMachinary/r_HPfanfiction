So I've been writing for a fair amount of time, however not in the HP fandom. I've been pretty content to sit back and read what others have to offer but I've recently started my own HP fic and I've noticed some comments saying that a reader won't even touch a story if it's below a specific word count (usually under 100k).

Even if the story is complete and the story is under (or far below) 100k with writing that is far better than stories with a 200k word count... does the word count really matter?

Are we just not giving enough attention to stories with less than a 100k word count?


** It depends on the person. Some never read fics over 100k words, some only read those with at least 300k words.

** It's personal taste. Some people prefer epics rivalling ASOIAF in length, others oneshots. And it is even down to mood. Sometimes you just want something quick to read in twenty minutes without having to keep track of twelve plot lines and twenty OCs, sometimes you want something to waste a weekend on.

Personally I'd say that chapter length is much more important. I won't even touch a story with less than 1000 words per chapter.

** Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone : 76,944 words. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets : 85,141 words. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban : 107,253 words. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire : 190,637 words.

100k is fine for a year in detail. Its a bit on the short side for a multiyear story. This is fanfiction so you can often cut out background and detail in places where we already know. Often if we get descriptions of things its because they've been changed, otherwise we can assume its same as in canon. Longer stories often have issues with pacing and excessive detail, shorter stories can feel rushed. If you're happy with what you've written, if you can justify all your choices then its probably fine.

** If its incomplete and abandoned, I only read 80k+

If its complete, I only read 20k+

If its ongoing, I read any size, for as long as the person updates, or until it completes.

Always assuming that I liked the premise of the fic.

** One of the rules I used to have, when I was much newer to fanfiction, was that longer word counts usually meant better fic quality. This isn't really true, but it was a pretty generic way to root out some of the higher effort stories, although I have since found many short fics or oneshots that are good.

I would say it's a matter of preference from the reader, but I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't really worry too much on it, if the fic is high quality then it doesn't matter.

**** As [[/u/her0_wraith][u/her0_wraith]] and [[/u/Hellstrike][u/Hellstrike]] point out. Longer fics usually cover longer time spans, as an example Years 4-7 or so. So the word count going over 100K is not that hard to believe when most of those books went over that by themselves.

For myself I just check if the average chapter-wordcount is good and go from there. Good for me is between 5k and 12K. As soon as a chapter tips over that it tends to have a sludgy middle that gets nasty to drag yourself trough. On the other hand shorter chapters means that you'll hardly see any progress inside of the individual chapters.

** Word count does matter but not as much as some would say. Word count is important when considered in conjunction with the number of chapters. Generally shorter chapters are of lesser quality so if a story has say 60 chapters with 100k words than the average chapter length is just below 2k words and probably not as good as a story with 30 chapters and 100k words. The chapters should have more substance that way and contain more than just a simplistic plot point.

** No matter how long (or short) your story may turn out to be, trust that there'll always be an audience for it. That's one of the many positives with the HP fandom being that it's so large.

Personally, I like fics that stay between 100K - 250K though I'm not opposed to reading stories that are longer. However, I normally draw the line at fics that are complete (or continually updating) that are past 500K. The longest story I read on FanFiction was Vox Corporis that had 323K words. (Just for fun, the longest book I ever read was Stephen King's The Stand which clocked in at 1,320 pages on my Kindle.)

** Good fic usually reach at least 70 000 words easily. On the other hand there are absurdly long fics like the lightening arc series where the fourth year contains 500k words, the fifth year almost 800k ! I also dislike really long chapters

** Personally I get frustrated if a fic is too short. I love reading and read really quickly. When I get into a world I want to be able to immerse myself in the story for several hours. My go to number is 40k, I read shorter fics but much less often. It's just annoying to fall in love with a world and characters and suddenly there is no more.

** From my experience, wordcount only seems to matter slightly when people are finding your story at random in the world. My most popular story (at nearly 2 million views) only has 66k words, so I would figure that it's from people just recommending the story to others through a variety of mediums, whether its in communities or just through a favorites list.

** I tend to use stories as escapism so the longer the story the longer I can keep the immersion going. I prefer long fics and because of that I miss out on many short fics that have many sequels. But longer fics still tend to have a better quality than rooting through hundreds of short fics that are not long enough to get immersed in.

In another note I absolutely detest when a story is just over 100K and most of it ends up being inane rambling from the author at the start and end of every chapter. 100k story you say, well it's actually only 60k if you ignore the author notes.

** Depends on what the story sets out to do. If it spans a lot of time it will likely need a bigger word count unless your narration makes clear a lot of time has passed, in which case you can make it shorter. Narration let's you skip more time, but delving into the dramatics requires you to slow things down to progress through scenes, meaning it becomes lengthened, so you'll need more page length to cover the intended material.

** depends on if its complete or not. for example, an incomplete story with only five chapters and 20 something thousand words is almost guaranteed to frustratingly end before the plot arc has even developed. Biggest pet peeve is a great plot summary, but a story that is abandoned before it addresses what the summary promises. Anyways, if the story is complete and has an intriguing/unique plot summary, i'd be willing to look at it. But i tend to sort fanfiction.net to only show stories that are 80K+ words so i might not even see the short stories in the first place to give them a chance
