  “Of course you'd measure the value of a human being by their ability to get some fake approval points designed to turn children into obedient, unthinking citizens,” James said.\\
  Lyra frowned. “What else would I measure a person by?”\\
  “There are more important things,” said James. “Like their personal wealth, their talent at tax evasion, and their faith in God.”\\
  “What God in particular, James?”\\
  “Satan.”

Hey, folks. This fic is a double SI starring myself and my friend, AutumnSouls. Mostly light wish-fulfillment, but it will have a plot and won't go into the realm of crack. Lyra Malfoy and Muggleborn James Stark take on the magical world together with... variable results.

It'll be written in third person, mostly from other characters' POV. I think we've managed to avoid most of the tropes so far, except for the few that have been played up for laughs.

Hope you enjoy!
