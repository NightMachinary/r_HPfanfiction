History of magic is such a wasted opportunity. It should be an awesome class and an amazing tool for world building and I'd like to see a story where this is utilised.

I've read fics where this plays a part, usually as a side note in a long list of fix it tropes.

But I would like to read a fic where there is some debt to it with a fleshed out character for the teacher and maybe some interesting lore and projects/ discussions/ debates.

It could be a character from the books, an oc or si, a time travelling Voldemort or Harry, or whatever.


** Me: *Does a lot of exposition and world-building by medium of having a main character that observes things around him and is not from wizarding Britain and has an interest in history*

My readers: You really do a lot of exposition.

Me: *Planning for Binns to get sacked during PS and him being replaced by an actually good and interesting teacher* YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY FINAL FORM YET!

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** The only fics I've really seen (that I remember) that do anything with the history position at all are Racke's The Archeologist (globetrotting fem!Harry becomes the History Teacher) and Robst's Harry Crow (the Veela[?] becomes a history teacher).

I'm sure there are more, and better, but those are the only things I'm aware of that meet your requirement of the History Teacher making some impact.

** Theres one where Lockheart is made the History teacher instead of DADA. I think its a Fate Stay Night crossover (Shinji Mouto and the ...?). Anyways, he does the classic "most of what you hear is propaganda" at the beginning of the yesr. I remember those chapters with him being great.

*** Someone could get rid of him legally or magically, there could be a magical reason like passing on or fading too much to function as a teacher, maybe Dumbledore changes his class to an elective called 'History of the goblin wars ', or he could get sick of brats sleeping in his classroom and quit.

** I'm not going to call the bot to link the fic because it would be a reasonably large spoiler, but in the fic spoiler-hidden below, Chamber of Secrets goes quite differently and at the end of the year, a character sets Lockhart up to take over History and he does surprisingly well because he's actually very good at storytelling and making history engaging and accessible when he's not fucking it up by pretending he did it. I have high hopes for this to continue being a plot point, but the story is still in progress so we haven't had much time with him yet.
