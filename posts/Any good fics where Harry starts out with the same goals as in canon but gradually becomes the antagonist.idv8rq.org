It can be a Powerful!Harry or Dark!Harry or even a Harry corrupted by the Elder Wand. The only requests I have is that Harry and Voldemort are still on the same sides as in canon (i.e. Harry is good at first and has to face Voldemort) and the other is that Harry is not treated as a self-insert but it really focuses on how toxic and dangerous he becomes.

Otherwise, I don't really care about ships but if romance is not the primary plot (unless a corrupting toxic relation) I will be even more grateful. Also it can be any character's POV and it can end either with the good or the evil triumphing.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

** Not to be a nitpicker, but you mean he becomes a villain/evil right?

Because him becoming an Antagonist would mean he wouldn't be a Protagonist anymore.

And those are different.

*** This has nothing to do with Harry Potter, but I once read a novel called Souls in the Great Machine that goes through a complete role reversal with two of the main characters. The primary protagonist becomes a clear antagonist, and one of the early antagonists becomes the main protagonist. Made for a very interesting read.

**** Exactly, and this does happen on longer works.

Take Star Wars, Anakin goes from protagonist to antagonist in the movies. But in Darth Vader comics he is the Protagonist, despite being a villain.

Protagonist just mean they are the main character, Antagonist is someone who wants to hinder the Protagonist or go against them.
