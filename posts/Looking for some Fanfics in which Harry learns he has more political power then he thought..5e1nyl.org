It can be any type of Fic so long as Harry suddenly gains quite a lot of political power, it doesn't matter how so.


** Essentially nine out of ten Lord Potter/Super!OP Harry fics fit your criteria.

*** I'm looking for fics where politics is sort of more important, not just a cliff note in a bigger fic.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2449031][Appallingly Wrong and Irreparably Broken]] is a Drarry that fits this well, although I didn't love the writing. This fic is pretty good. The premise is that after Ginny and Harry's divorce, Harry has to sort out all of his finances as the head of the Black estate. The Black family is one of the "consul" families and their involvement in the economy is essential to prevent a crash. Draco, also the head of his consol family helps Harry learn the ropes while trying to convince Harry that a marriage alliance between the two of them would be the best political move. Neville is also the head of a consul family and helps Harry. Linkao3(2449031).

  Everything in Harry's life is pretty terrible, all things considered. His ex-wife won't stop sleeping around, the government is broken, and his life is an endless cycle of crippling self-hatred and bitter sarcasm. So when Draco Malfoy comes sauntering back into it, sharp as a tack and twice as fit as he has any right to be, the only comfort Harry can find is that he can't possibly make it any worse. You know, probably.
