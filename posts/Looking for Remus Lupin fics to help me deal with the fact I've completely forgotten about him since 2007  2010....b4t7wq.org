tl;dr After realising that I still love Remus Lupin after 12 years of not even giving him a thought, I am in high need of some fan fictions!

Since the final HP film came out back in 2010/2011 (sorry, can't quite remember) I've not really paid much attention to the universe... Almost 10 years later, here I am on a HP fan fiction subreddit so obviously some things have changed, haha!

A couple days ago my dorm wifi went down and I was bored out of my mind so I went into my Apple Movies and looked for something to watch. I only have 3 things bought: Rocky Horror Picture Show, Labyrinth, and Prisoner of Azkaban. I had watched the first two movies often enough where I can quote it word for word and explain exactly what's happening in the scenes, so I decided to instead give PoA a shot after not watching since 2007.

I realise now why I bought it in the first place - I love Remus Lupin. Little 6 year old me was head over heels for this dorky werewolf guy, which is totally fine and obviously true to this day, I suppose.

With my newly ignited love for Lupin, I'd love any fan fiction recommendations to help me get through this sudden obsession. It's been a crazy couple of days, haha!

Thank you all in advance and sorry about the formatting, I'm on mobile.

** I love this one. It's canon as far as I'm concerned. Everything by this author is great.

If I may also recommend a few of my own, canon-compatible stories, here he is spying on Greyback's pack during the First Wizarding War. I should post the next chapter of this in a few days.

And here he is just after the end of the First Wizarding War. This is complete.

Here, he and Tonks meet cute:

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

**** Thanks! I do have plans to get back to that one, don't worry. I have too many works in progress. It's canon-compatible, so at least you know where it's going. I'm just filling in the details Rowling left out. (Well, one possible version of those details.)

When you said “devastatingly frustrating” I thought for a moment you were taking about Employee of the Month. That's complete, at least, although the ending does devastate everyone.

** This is the first time I'm recommending a fic, so hopefully this works.

linkao3(Pluto by bikelock28)

It's a series of one shots centered around canon Lupin/Tonks. It's nice and wholesome. Still being updated.

** There's always against the moon by stoplightdelight, though it's not finished yet. It's a marauder era story. Well, and shifts by fernwithy, if you want to see Remus as a teacher. But he isn't like Remus from the movies there, so I'm not sure. It has Remus Tonks as a main ship, but the romance is very mild. In my opinion, it's the best Remus Tonks romance because it focuses a lot on their friendship and not on that instant attraction as other stories do. But it depends on what you want to read. i'd also suggest checking starfishstar's Remus recs list, there are quite a few wolfstar stories there if that's your cup of tea.
