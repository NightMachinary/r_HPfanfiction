I just googled her for fic-reasons and, apparently, she is half-blood? At least according to the HP fandom Wiki, but I am wary of the trustworthiness of that site, with all due respect. So, is there any confirmation or is it just some kind of fanon that made it into the Wiki?


** It's in Rowling's personal notes on Harry's classmates

**** This helps! Encircled star for pureblood, just a star for halfblood and N for muggleborn.üëçüèª so, in this early draft of hers, JKR had Tracey Davis envisioned as a halfblood.

*** Quick question: below Goyle, Gregory I see the surname Greengrass, but I'm pretty sure the name doesn't say Daphne. It looks more like Queenie... I could be completely wrong but... I mean, am I crazy??

** Ya know, I wonder what the relationship with her housemates would be.

What /type/ of half-blood is she? One muggle, one magical? Two magicals, but one's a pureblood and another a half-blood or muggleborn? Two muggleborns? Two half-bloods?

I mean, you can be a half-blood so long as one of your parents is magical, be it pure, half themselves, or pure, or if two parents are half-bloods themselves, et cetera.

Harry, for example, has a muggleborn mother and a pureblood father -- both magicals, and he's a half-blood.

Hypothetically, would some Slytherins, if he weren't the Boy-Who-Lived but a regular student in Slytherin or another House, be perfectly fine with him because both his parents were magical, but others would hate him for just having a muggleborn mother?

Would having magical parents, even a muggleborn one, be 'acceptable' to other Slytherins? Or some of them? Would others not care?

This sort of depth is, sadly, rarely touched on in fanfics in other characters' beliefs, actions, and interactions.

*** Apparently your a pure blood as long as at least all your grandparents are magical. This doesn't make you part of Malfoy's ilk unless you can't find where in your family tree the no-majes were.

Example:

Albus Severus Potter is a pure blood. Even if his father and grandmother aren't pureblooded.

Rose Weasley-Granger is a halfblood because her grandparents were non-magical.

As long as at least her parents and grandparents have any magic, she is pureblooded, even if all her grandparents were muggleborns and her parents halfbloods, she would still be a pureblood.

*** According to Pottermore, someone need to have at least 3 generations of Magical ancestor to be considered a Pure Blood.

If we take the Potters as an example, it would mean that Harry's children (James II, Albus and Lily II) are still considered Half Blood because of their Great Grandparents (Lily's I parents), but that as long as their marry a Pureblood, their own children would be PureBlood.

That being said, the rule about Blood Purity is not really set in stone, and the "Blood Status" of a wizard may change depending of his own attitude and who he is talking to. Some of the worst Blood Purist may consider that 3 generations is not enough to wash the "Muggle stains", while a wizard being too openly in favor of Muggles may not be considered a Half Blood despite having several generations of Magical Ancestors (though a "Pure Blood" pro Muggle is also considered a Blood Traitor, like the Weasleys).

Now, concerning Tracey Davis and her life in Slytherin. How she is treated would mainly depend of her own attitude.

It's important to note that the Blood Purist are, by nature, a bunch of hypocrite. All of them are looking down on Muggles, ignoring the fact that all of their family trees are showing the same Muggles, if you look back far enough. Blood Purist also showed that, as long as someone was usefull for their cause, his parentage could be ignored.\\
Despite being a Half Blood, Voldemort could still lead the Blood Purist, Snape was welcomed into the Death Eaters, and Umbridge could thrive into the Dark Lord rule. As long as Tracey Davis was usefull enough and "knew her place" (listening to what the Pureblood say and look down on the Muggleborns), she could probably fit easily into Slytherin.

I also want to point out that, even if they don't really show up in Canon, Slytherins has other students that the Junior Death Eater. Somes of the snake are just average student who seemed cunning or ambitiout to the Sorting Hat, and who could not care less about Blood Purity. If she could not fit with the kids of her year, Tracey could still find some people to hang out with. Draco "ruling" the Snake Pit thanks to his father is fanon, he may have some authority (mainly thanks to his place in the Quidditch team that he bought), but not every student are at his beck and call.

**** Since she's a girl, I think the issue would be more Pansy than Draco. There is a reference to "Pansy Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls" in GoF, so her spot at Queen Bee is actually more established than Draco's.

I suppose Tracey's life depends also on her views -- if she buys into the whole pureblood stuff, either genuinely or as a pretense, she might have a quiet enough life. Every Queen Bee needs followers, and Tracey could be one.

I would love to think that would be the case. We'll never know, of course, but find it charming to consider that there is a disagreement about what is a "pureblood". On the one hand, you have the bureaucratic definition with "all-magical grandparents", on the other, you have the extremists where you have to have had married other purebloods for the last 30 generations, and then maybe there are traditionalists, who look at your family name, and if /that/ has been around for a few hundred years (and, perhaps, you behave the part), then you are a pureblood, regardless of whether you married Muggleborns into the family.

So if Harry cared about his family, he might be considered a pureblood by some and not by others. And the same might be true for Tracey.

But as you say, that kind of nuance is usually missing -- and not just in FF, but also in the books, for that matter.
