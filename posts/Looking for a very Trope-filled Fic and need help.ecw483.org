:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fanfic that I know used to be on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. I cannot remember the title or author of the fic. It was a manipulative Dumbledore fic with Harry, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, and Neville Longbottom as the main characters. They end up building a town of their own (around a lake if I am remembering correctly) and eventually build their own markets and school. I believe that the fic was novel-length. Any help would be greatly appreciated.


** With that cast of characters, the first one that came to mind was *Partners, by muggledad*

It's been a /reeeeeeeally/ long since I've read it so I can't remember about the "building their own town" part. But it's definitely has those four characters as main. And I'm pretty sure it's got a solid Indy!Animagus!Lord!Harry.

*** Thank you. I'll definitely look into it. I read the description from the bot, and it sounds like it might be possible that this is the one. I'll get back to you on if it is or not.
