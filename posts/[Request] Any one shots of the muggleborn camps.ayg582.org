** I get the impression that there weren't any camps in canon. Muggle-borns came to the Ministry to register, a few lucky ones were kicked back out on the street after their wands had been snapped, the rest were sent to Azkaban or Kissed by Dementors.

**** ...Fair enough, even if by virtue of being a great, big, single, stone building, Azkaban isn't technically a "camp".

Less pedantically, I'd argue that calling it "functionally a concentration camp" is sort of misleading, since that comes with a lot of heavy baggage of how such things are run and organized which I don't think would apply to Azkaban. We have no reason to imagine the Dementors treated the prisoners who were brought in for being Muggle-borns much differently than they would any other prisoners. Stick the prisoners in grimy one-person cells, occasionally bring them untasty food, feed on them whenever they get peckish.

(Heck, stray thought: since a lot of Dementors are frolicking on the mainland at this point, you could make an argument the Muggle-born prisoners from the Registration Committee are probably slightly /better off/ than regular peace-time prisoners were. Though that might arguably be outweighed by the increased foodstock leading the Dementors to breed a lot.)

***** You are aware that the Nazis threw a lot of people into Concentration Camps, including political prisoners, common criminals and homosexuals, right? Not just Jews, Slavs and Roma. Azkaban pretty much fits the KZ analogy to a T.

Yes, I am, and you're missing my point.

The point is that Nazi concentration camps were run nothing like Azkaban normally is as a regular hellhole prison; and that if the Muggle-borns were just sent to Azkaban without any alterations to how Azkaban was run, as it seems they did, it follows that Umbridge-era Azkaban wouldn't look very much like a Nazi concentration camp either. It would fulfill the function of one in the Death Eaters' dictatorship, sure. But in terms of a story being set there, where the hook would be "a concentration camp drama in the HP universe", as the OP is suggesting... nah.

******* A number of concentration camps were run like Azkaban, actually. Especially at the start, before the gas chambers and the extermination camps started.

The point isn't some "but it's got walls, not barbed wire, it's not a camp" sophistry but that people were thrown into a hellhole and left to slowly die just for having the wrong ancestry. Azkaban is the HP version of a concentration camp in book 7.

As I said, I agree that it /functions/ as one, but the way OP phrased their question implies that the same sort of story could play out in Muggle-born-filled Azkaban as could in a Muggle concentration camp. And to my mind, no, it couldn't. Some of the key features that come with the idea of "concentration camp" that I feel Azkaban lacks are interaction between the prisoners, and cruel, dehumanizing guards. Azkaban has neither --- prisoners are locked in cells and their minds int too poor a state to have any sort of social interaction beyond shrieking at each other, and the guards are lifeless, silent demons with no other interested in the prisoners than occasionally feeding on their emotions.

**** I mean, considering Azkaban is basically a mixture of Alcatraz and Auschwitz guarded by eldritch horrors, that's not too unbelievable.

**** Azkaban has individual cells and the dementors keep prisoners from ever doing much thinking or talking.\\
You couldn't really tell much of a story with that.\\
Each prisoner just lies in a cell with their worst memories for company.
