I like DC, Marvel, Star Wars, ASOISF, Buffy, Worm but I'll take whatever. Basically any fandom except anime. Anything new in the last year or so.

Bonus points for Fem!Harry.

(Does anyone know any good Fem!Harry/Thor or Fem!Harry/Steve Rogers at all? Almost all of the Fem!Harry marvel crossovers pair her with Bucky or Tony, sometimes Loki)


** for your second request there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11537017/1/One-Soldier-Two]] this fem!harry/steve, but for the first one....any fem!harry of not anime.....well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/912889/sakurademonalchemist]] has alot of fem!harry, but it's mostly anime crossovers, the best in the last year is Angels and Demons, HP/ff7 crossover but other good non-anime ones are A Deal Made in Good Faith hp/supernatural and Memories of Nobody hp/kh
