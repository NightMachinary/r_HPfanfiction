** Colin, same year, doesn't know much about the magical world, and is obviously a guy who seeks leadership. I could totally see him meeting Luna and believing anything she says, maybe even treat her like he did with Harry.

** Well, from a purely academic perspective I would say that the best Harley to Luna's Joker would be Ron Weasley who has had enough chances to get in contact with Luna, can get more than a bit smitten and a weird kind of follower and has had encounters with brain-tentacles.

This is all purely hypothetical, of course?

Also brain-tentacles.

** Dennis Creevey. Colin's got his face stuck to his Camera, Dennis has his face stuck to Luna's ass.

*** Only if Luna had been the one to save her from the Diary and Basilisk. Perfect time for Luna to manipulate her mind.

** Isn't this kind of backwards? Wouldn't Luna be the Harley to the Joker instead?

Not just because of her sex, but because from the brief exposure I've had to that character, Harley was rather innocent until coopted by the joker...

I know I'd love to see a crazy Luna that's like Harley-crazy, sounds really cool
