A lot of people ask for long multi-chapter fics, but I'm looking for something a bit more manageable but also well written. Do you have any suggestions? I'd really appreciate it! Bonus points for epic snark, Hermione who is actively a part of the story with her own desires and needs (not just perfect self-insertion Hermione), Severus who is both reluctant and also incredibly devoted, possibly other side characters that feel true-to-character, minimal Ron bashing (or none at all), and possibly a mystery or two.

Smut is welcome if it's well-written (or so bad that it makes you laugh).

Thanks in advance!


** I don't think that you'll find anything that specific. Especially not when you're looking for 'high quality' stuff. You'll probably find a few on hpfanficarchive, but fair warning, that website has been infested with bad smut since 1998, when Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and fartblasted his way 16 ft down into the announcer's table.

** linkffn(2405482; 6342684; 8293010) are one shots I had flagged as favorites in FFN.

SSHG fics tend to be long and drawn out so that the characters can get to know each other and slowly get together. For this reason, good one shots are hard to find for this ship.

*** As someone who's read a number of very long Snamione stories (and written one or two of them), I find that many long Snamione stories are only slow burns because they're full of really cliche romance tropes and really easily solvable miscommunication errors. Though I see Snape as being a very internally self conscious guy and prone to subterfuge, I know that Hermione is usually almost painfully direct, so when I read stories where Hermione is constantly clutching her bosom and being like "HE CAN'T LOVE ME BUT I SHALL DARE NOT ASK HIM" I get really bored really quickly.

A lot of the one-shots avoid this sort of nonsense, or if it's present, it's only used a bit, so it's manageable. That's why I like them. Also, as someone with only a bit of time on breaks and such at work to read, it's nice to have a short story to read instead of a behemoth where nothing happens for chapters and chapters.

Thanks for the suggestions- I did read all of Aurette's stuff (it's really good) so I'm a big fan of hers but I'm going to check out the other ones you mentioned.

**** I find the cliches and miscommunications to be a trait of most romantic fics involving Snape.

Off-topic: Is Snamoine the widely accepted portmanteau? I really feel like Sermoine would fit better, but that's obviously just me.

***** I really hate the following Snape tropes:

1) Snape is a rapist

2) Snape is a lothario who fucks everything that moves and this is supposedly somehow a positive trait in these stories

3) Snape spends a lot of time with prostitutes because no one will sleep with him

4) Snape is aggressively sexual with his love interest all the time from the beginning in an entirely serious way.

All of these tropes turn me the hell off of the story.

Also, as my OTP, I've heard the ship referred to as such:

- HG/SS
- Snamione
- Snanger
- Sevmione

The top three are the most common.

****** I desperately dislike the assumption of dominance for Snape on personality alone. Other than that, if it fills my fic itch ( at that time ) and doesn't squick me, I either nope out ir tolerate it. Not worth more effort than that. But I do see it a lot particularly in this pairing.

******* A lot of the older Severus/Hermione stories have Dominant!Snape, which is annoying, but I think that it's largely because it was written before we really knew much about the character's background, perhaps? Or because Snape appears to become less comically villainous as the books go on? I'm not exactly sure, but in general, I've found that there's a lot of "Snape is a Dom and likes to spank/do BDSM with his partner" fics that are from the early/mid 2000's on fanfiction.net. I, a person who thinks that BDSM is really not nearly as cool and edgy as a lot of people on the internet, find it pretty boring and it ruins the characterization.

Like..there was this story I read awhile back that I liked a lot except for the whole "Hermione enjoys being spanked" part, which seemed to show up in every. Single. Sex scene. It was like the story was fine but when the person wrote the sex part they threw out the character's personalities (which were pretty spot on otherwise) and went straight to stereotypes.

As someone who cannot fathom why spanking would be fun on a regular basis (perhaps because I was hit a lot as a kid for things that I had little control over or were very minor infractions and it was scary and painful and I hated it?) this kind of thing made me eventually abandon the fic.

****** I hate all of those tropes too. I also don't like the trope that Snape is a virgin because Lily. I prefer calling the ship SSHG. The names seem awkward to me.

Goblet of Fire era fics have a more Gothic Snape, due to his increased presence and portrayal in the book. A lot of the fics assumed that he was pureblood and wealthy because he was a Death Eater but that was obviously not the case.

A lot of the long stories are prone to the flaws you listed. I usually like the fics that have a war plot (Pet Project, Pride of Time, Chasing the Sun) because it keeps the focus off just the romance. Snape and Hermione don't strike me as the most overly romantic people so any sugary sappiness turns me off.

******* I can deal with Snape being a virgin because he hates himself and suffers from crushing depression, but I don't like the whole "I CAN'T HAVE LILY SO I SHALL HAVE NO ONE" trope.

I really like a lot of Aurette's fics because they're post-war but have some other plot that's really fascinating. One of the problems that many of the war fics run into is that they tend to reiterate canon at length. One of my longer fics I used canon to figure out where people were at any given time in the story to tell the story that was happening OUTSIDE of Harry's POV, so it works fairly seamlessly by integrating things that would have happened offscreen in the books into the timeline of the books.
