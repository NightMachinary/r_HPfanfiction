:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't have a proper format for this, but this fic, which name has escaped my mind, has in it:

-Harry in this fic has a twin sister, and later has a younger sister. Both Lily and James are alive

-It has a scene where when Harry and his twin sister were just born, his sister was crying and nothing the adults in the room worked to stop her from crying, but when set down next to harry, he comforted her and she stopped crying. Then when Sirius was poking harry, harry opened his eyes and grabbed sirius finger and moved it.

- Harry was I think declared by Dumbledore a squib, but when Dumbledore tried to see his mind, he was blocked, and Harry glared at him.

- When Peter tried to hold, he started crying as if he knew that Peter had betrayed them.

- He goes into a coma for sometime time.

- He also was considered slow and needed a walking stick, but when lily and james tried to enroll him into a regular school, he got into an argument with a principle and he seemed mature beyond his years. When they got home, James tried to test his magic again with a practice wand.

- when he got his wand he transformed it into a walking stick/staff.

Yes I know that its ridiculous i can remember details about this fic, but can't remember the name. Thank you in advance.
