To get into the detail, I'm looking for a fic where Voldie and death munchers stop being a problem early into the fic and Harry get out of the wizarding world. Please, no pairing with anybody from Hogwarts. No Ginny, Hermoine or Daphne or any other girl from Hogwarts. Prefer to be a crossover but not a must. I especially like Stargate ccrossovers.


** You would love Stargatesg1fan1, he has a HP crossover with SG
