***** Hmmmm, Filch throwing a temper tantrum complete with fist pounding and kicking.

No, no, Filch running around screaming, waving his hands in the air.

No, no, wait--Filch barricading himself in his office, clutching his mop and Mrs. Norris.

This /Is/ fun.

**** Oooh. Yes. Forge fits on several levels, because he is made, and therefore forged, and he is a copy, and therefore also forged.

** There has been several prompts lately that I've enjoyed on here.

I'd like the triplet to be not perfect though- either he comes out kind of slow, like when Michael Keaton's clone makes a copy, and like a "copy of a copy", he is not exactly a perfect clone. You could also do the clone as evil- maybe he gets enrolled in Hogwarts and is sorted into Slytherin. The twins are borderline bad with their pranks as is, imagine if they had that Slytherin cunning ambition to motivate them.

Edit: Or you could also have the clone start out very similar to the twins, initially freaks out Percy, but slowly morphs into a straight-laced no-nonsense Weasley like Percy.

I see two possible reactions from Fred and George Prime.

One, they go back to the drawing board to get a new triplet.

Two, they try to clone Percy and see if the personality morphing works both ways.
