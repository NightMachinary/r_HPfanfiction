:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I cannot remember the name of the fic but basically Harry traveled to a different dimension where James and Lily and Harry are alive and our Harry posses(?) the body of Rose Potter (who is dead in this universe). And then he goes to this town, or a city that's infested with some kind of eldritch monsters(?), and like defeats a lot of them and tries to solve the question why there are these monsters in the first place. And I remember that he was like SERIOUSLY OP, but didnt realise it, and was basically like "yeah I'm powerful, BUT theres this one person who is better than me at this one specific thing. So u see I'm not that powerful after all"

I'm pretty sure someone was asking for this fic already some time ago, but for the life of me, I cannot find it :((
