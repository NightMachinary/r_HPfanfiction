Hey guys, im looking for some AUs where Harry and Draco are friends, i have some preferences on some aspects for the history.

-NO SLASH (srry but it's not what i'm looking for)\\
-No Dubledore bashing. I really don't like this and for me it does't fit in the character.

-If there's pairings, needs to be someone different for Harry (NO HERMIONE OR GINNY) for Draco could be anyone.

-Draco and Harry cannot be just friends, they has to be best buddies (Something like Sirius and James).

-There is't necessity of being a Slytherin harry fanfic. Harry can be sorted in Gryffindor or any other house (I wouldn't like Hufflepuff but it's ok).

-Draco and Harry can become friends after their twisted beggining or be friends from the start, anything is worth for me.

Extra: I doubt that the fics that you guys will send me will have this characteristic but i would like if Harry and Draco become animagi at some point, i know that is difficult to find something like this but i would love, that's why this is not obligatory.

Extra II: Another thing difficult to find so it's just an extra, i would like Harry's personality to be more self confident and a bit cocky, due to his relationship with Draco.

Thanks for the help guys !\\
And srry about any errors in this post, english is't my natural language.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/335653][The They Shook Hands series]] by Dethryl, it strongly follows the Stations of Canon, but it hits pretty much all your points(even he animagi form and Harry being cocky), it was abandoned at sixth year though.

*** I've already read all of this series, it's a pity that was abandoned.\\
I'm searching something on the same vibe as TSH, but as I said, it does't have to be a Slytherin harry fanfic.

** How about linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble by Chilord)

It's post Hogwarts/Battle of Hogwarts to where everything was cannon up until then I believe.

I usually hate Draco/Harry friendship but this was surprisingly ok to me.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.
