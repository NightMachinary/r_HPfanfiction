I usually avoid Snape stories because they often involve all of the worst [[http://zorm.deviantart.com/art/Canon-Vs-Fanon-Snape-34384180][cliches]] of fanfiction. Snape is one of the most interesting characters in canon, but the task of wading through all the Fics that try to turn him into some kind of amazing hero (or other kind of OOC) after one chapter is incredibly daunting. And no - I'm not looking for stories where he's evil either.

Can someone point me to the good stuff (no one-shots please)?

I'm not even opposed to Snape/Hermione stories (there's seem to be way too many of those though) as long as the author invests a lot of time and effort into pulling that off convincingly. There's certainly some potential for that pairing (considering Snape's background), but there needs to be some serious and well written character growth (letting go of Snapes past and his obsessions) before that makes any sense at all.

Just looking for stories that don't miss the point of his character (as in: a deeply flawed character that wants to do good, but fails more often than not, is ... misguided, desperate, obsessive, kind of a git, doesn't try hard enough to overcome his flaws, but ultimately good at his core - tragic that he never got a chance in canon to really crawl out of his dark hole).


** Getting the Hang of Thursdays:

- Snape centric, with some SS/HG but its very slow and develops mainly due to the extreme situation

** Oh, this is difficult! I really want to rec /Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels/, but the truth is it has a level of negative Snapeishness that is a turn off to many (he is at times outright abusive to Hermione), and a lot of people would argue until they're blue in the face that this kind of behavior from Snape would never be in-character. I respectfully disagree (I think the fic explained his behavior rather well), but it makes it a difficult rec, because I can understand why it'd be unappealing. The ending is kind of meh, and I definitely do not see this Hermione as in-character. But I did love it for the author's unapologetic ruthlessness of depicting Snape as a total almost-nonredeemable asshole.

linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels)

ETA: I also really like Harry in this one, as well as a lot of the other supporting characters. It's not often I read a SS/HG fic that doesn't have an unbearable depiction of Harry and the others.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

** linkffn(Post Tenebras, Lux)

Very long story (313k words!) by Loten, and one of my favorites. IS SS/HG, but set ten years after the end of DH. Lots of character building, explanations of canon asshattery, etc. S/He even made a couple one-shots on the side showing Snape's point of view, which definitely shows his personality, caring and ultimately trying, but really insecure and mean-spirited, even if that's what he's trying to overcome.

Rated M, there is sex from chapter 13 on.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

SS/HG is my OTP and I really hate the woobification of Snape in fanfic.

I also recommend Aurette's writing. She's one of my favorite fanfiction writers and she doesn't pull any punches when it comes to Snape. You can search for her username on ff.net. Her Dark Ages fic is very dark but very well written.

linkffn(Blood Magic)

The first is SS/LE (glacial pacing, fair warning) but nails characterization, while being a rather excellent Marauders' era AU.

The second, I was surprised to like because the premise is one that is difficult to pull off believably, but has a fair amount of world-building and character development besides. No real pairings, a few shipteases, but that's pretty much it.
