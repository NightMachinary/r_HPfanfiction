So according to Gamp's Laws, it's impossible to transfigure food. But food isn't any different from any other items. You can transfigure or conjure a bird, and birds are edible, so presumably, you could do the same for meat. So why does the Law work?

​

My interpretation is the "durability" of a transfiguration. If you try to digest a transfigured or conjured food item, it'll revert to its old state. So eating a conjured food item gives you no nutrients (it reverts to nothing), and eating a transfigured object is just a more appetizing way of eating the original object.

​

Additionally, this would relate to how "permanent" transfiguration works - it just creates more durable results (though ones that still fail if broken down completely such as during digestion). This ruling also gives an explanation for why food can be increased in size if you already have some - the food already exists, so it doesn't revert the same way (and I know this explanation is shady since wouldn't it revert to the small size, but magic makes no sense).

​

However, as an interesting effect of this interpretation of Gamp's Laws, transfigured or conjured food is actually still quite useful:

- Transfigure a salad into a chocolate bar, and you can experience the joy of eating a chocolate bar and receive the nutrients of a salad.
- Transfigure something dangerous (like a knife or vial of poison) into something edible and it can kill the consumer
- Conjured food contains zero calories, and thus you can snack to your heart's content without worrying about weight gain

​

Oh also as a minor plot detail you could use: if you want to have an enterprising main character, you could have them be the first person to think of the idea of selling this sort of stuff as a health option.

​

***

​

Or of course, you could go an alternative path where the law is completely false and was fabricated as propaganda to make sure people keep buying food (and thus giving money to whatever group is selling said food).


** My interpretation is that conjured foods don't have the essential amino acids, vitamins, or calories necessary to be considered nourishing.

Kind of like the unreleased Mythbusters experiment where they tested whether cereal was as nourishing as the cardboard it came in.

They used lab mice for it and they started with many mice. They compressed the cardboard into food pellets to feed the mice, left for the weekend, and came back to several mice skeletons and one fat mouse.

*** My headcanon says that conjured things are really just transfigured air and that Transfiguration doesn't change the molecular structure of things, it just uses magic to alter the appearance.

Which is why transfiguring a cardboard box into food is a bad idea.

** You need to reread the section where Hermione talked about that law. Food can't be conjured, as in brought into being out of thin air, but she explicitly states you can change its form, quantity, and quality if you already have some. I.e. No conjugation, yes transfiguration.

****** Exactly. Hence, it's not "food".

Anyway, everyone always raises this point, even though it's so easily countered. The /far more interesting/ question would be whether you can conjure -- a fruit salad -- a ripe apple -- an apple tree with ripe apples --, in that order. I couldn't tell you where Gamp kicks in there.

This is what food is defined as, so a bird is certainly considered food since you do not have to make any chemical changes before you can consume it.

******** No, I just now defined food as something else. I defined food as something you can eat right away, a ready-made dish. You asked how a bird could not be food -- that is how.

Beyond semantics, I think this is a fair definition too, since in everyday life we don't call birds "food" but birds. When I buy food, I buy things like steaks or bread. Not a live pig or bird. And given the conceptual way HP magic works, and /in particular/ Hermione's full quote (can't conjure *good* food), I personally also think it's the better and more fitting definition, but again, YMMV.

********* Okay, it's a fair way to interpret it.

I do still think that the trio were being really dumb to not summon birds and other animals (I imagine that it's not only birds and snakes they can summon) and cook something with that. Or use a summoning charm and summon fish from the lake (something they see dean and ted do).

********** To be honest, when I first read it, and still when I do now, my takeaway was that they are just terrible cooks.

Don't forget, they /did/ catch fish. I love eating fish, it can taste great, with almost nothing else to go with it. And yet, they still produced only food they hated. Why was that? I can only conclude none of them can cook (and isn't /that/ the most funny inversion of the "Harry loves cooking"-trope I've encountered).

But if that is so, then all the conjured, summoned, or otherwise magically acquired fish (or even worse, other animals -- fish is /easy/ to prepare) wouldn't help -- because they're still terrible cooks XD

And Gamp then prevents them from magically whipping up a three star meal.

*********** I guess yeah, but I'd rather eat poorly cooked fish and birds then poorly cooked plants and fungi which seems to be their primary source of sustenance.

The thing that annoys me the most is that one time it says they steal eggs and bread, and was able to have a nice meal and I simply just do not understand why they didn't just keep a little bit of that and just make more of it when they needed it. I understand eating the same thing constantly can be bland, but int heir situations...

************ Eh, don't take it as me defending DH. I think it had the dumbest plot decisions in the series. I can think of a dozen ways to improve their time on the run, and regularly getting food from Muggles (stolen, bought, or -- revolutionary concept, you three -- canned, as in, "provisions", like what any reasonable person does when outdoors ...) is just the start. With how broken the Fidelius in DH is, they probably wouldn't even have needed to go camping in the first place, just pick an empty Muggle home in central England, and apparate wherever you need to.

Just the Gamp bit, that's not my problem.

** Gamp's Law doesn't say it's impossible to "transfigure" food. Gamp's Law says you cannot create "good food" out of "nothing."

We can't have a discussion about the laws until you at least get the laws right.

Here's what you can't do:

- Just make food out of nothing. Conjure food. You can't wave your wand and make a loaf of bread.

Here's what you CAN do:

- You can transform things into edible food. I.e. turn a stone into a loaf of bread via transfiguration.
- You can summon or call food to you if you know where some is located.
- You can duplicate food if you already have some. Anyone who knows the Doubling Charm/Gemini Charm can turn one piece of cooked fish into two pieces of cooked fish, or one cup of milk into two cups of milk.

For reasons that are not explained, certain substances are explicitly excepted from the making food out of nothing rule. Here are exceptions to the rule of what you can't do:

- Water: you can conjure an infinite amount of fresh, clean, potable water.
- Alcohol: wine and various other alcoholic beverages can be produced in much the same way water can be.
- Gravies and sauces: for some reason you can make sauces and gravies out of nothing.

There are some questions we don't have answers to. This is a brief list:

- We don't know if you can conjure the substances to create food, such as flour and salt and yeast, and then make it yourself.
- We don't know if conjured animals can be killed, cleaned, and used for food.

The limitation seems to be that you cannot create "good food," or to put it another way, a real substantial meal, out of nothing. You can use magic to create beverages and even trimmings, you can transform other objects and substances into good food, and if you have a small amount of food you have an effectively infinite amount if you know how to double it. But you cannot simply make good/edible food out of nothing. You must have something to start with.

This is, for the record, yet */another/* reason that Deathly Hallows is an awful trainwreck that honestly shouldn't even be considered canon. Rowling introduced these rules and explained how they work in DH, and then elaborated on them some more afterwards in Pottermore. And yet, according to these rules, the only reason Harry, Ron, and Hermione were starving while on the road is because they were all incompetents. One single edible berry or a single sandwich can become infinite berries and infinite sandwiches with a single charm. Likewise, you can literally pick pebbles up off the ground and turn them into loaves of bread or transform sticks into roast chickens if you know the spell to do so. Even if Hermione was the only one who could cast the Gemini Charm, or who would know these transfigurations, she's the only one who needs to. It only takes one person to know how to do this, and they could take care of a huge group of other people.

So the conflict that existed during the camping in the woods segments of DH was only a problem because they were stupid. Harry or Hermione could have, if all else failed, stolen or purchased a very small amount of non-perishable food from somewhere in the muggle world, like an energy bar, then duplicated it out over and over again. Boring, but practical and perfectly serviceable. Problem solved. They now have infinite food and infinite clean water.

Do keep in mind, these are Rowling's rules. She made them up, so she could have made them be anything she wanted them to be. She's actively choosing to joss her own plots and make her characters look like idiots.

**** The worst part about the canon Gamp Laws is that the fanfiction trope of "getting a massive power-up from reading a book on household charms" is now literally true.

Any witch or wizard who memorized some basic householdy/survival charms and transfigurations becomes a hundred times more competent, more dangerous, and more difficult to track down or control. Even if you only know how to turn rocks into potatoes and how to summon chicken gravy with your wand, that's still enough.

** I like the idea of it being about durability. It's a good spin on the old 'permanent-impermanent' limitation dispute.

I always went with 'Transfiguration is Magical Change, and Magic overwrites Mundane always.'

Thus, a transfigured wooden plank can be burned with incendio, but not with matches.

This would mean that magical food could be magically digested, but not mundanely. So, a magical creature with 'magic stomach acid' might be able to digest transfigured food, but a human with 'mundane stomach acid' would not.

**** As I don't remember the full story, I would guess it was all part of some plan. There have been plenty of stories where Harry comes to some accomodation with the Dursleys and this was probably part of it. All I can tell you is that it fit the story--proper set up and explanation for the plot.

... ... ...

Ok, checked with my husband. It was a story he had read, although he can't remember which one. Dobby was there, helping Harry (so he may have been doing the Transfiguration), and part of it was possibly to show magic has its plusses. But one or the other was changing the salads into pizza and pub food for Dudley and Vernon, while slipping Petunia her favorite dishes (french radishes and crostini, for example). According to him, she was the only one acknowledging Dobby; the others didn't want to see any active magic or magical beings. My husband does not remember any more than that.

** I headcanon it as no transfiguration is permanent. How much magic you put in determines the extent of the change and the duration, but ultimately it is still the original object under the magic.

An object transfigured into food may look and taste like it, if you are good enough, but you can't pull the calories out of thin air, because that would be creating energy.
