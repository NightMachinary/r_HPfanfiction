I recently finished writing a novel-length HP/Call of Cthulhu crossover, "Descent Into Madness," and am currently posting it chapter by chapter on [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]]. One of my readers, Hagbard Celine, suggested that I promote the story on Reddit, so here I am!

/Former Death Eaters are being found brutally murdered. A new friend leads to a quest with far-reaching ramifications for the magical world and beyond. A tale of intrigue, betrayal, and friendship set against the backdrop of the Triwizard Tournament. H/Hr, with a different take on Lunar Harmony. Rated M for language and graphic violence./

Hope to see you, and I look forward to any comments!


** This seems like a really awesome fic, do I have to have knowledge of “call of Cthulhu”? I've never heard of it.

*** Not really, but it helps. A little bit of research into the Cthulhu mythos, H.P. Lovecraft (the original author), and the Necronomicon may be useful, but I think it's fairly self-explanatory. Basically imagine all sorts of eldritch horrors and beings of unimaginable comprehension intersecting with the Potterverse. Hope you enjoy!
