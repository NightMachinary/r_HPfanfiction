I read LadyLilyMalfloys' [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1133537][The Other Side Of The War]] series a few months back, and loved it (it has sadly been discontinued).

I enjoyed the development of Draco and Harry's friendship too, and have been craving more good quality content that showcases it.

Any recs?

  "The stars incline us, they do not bind us." For Harry, it's something he learned long ago on the battlefield. But for his son, James, it will be a painful lesson in the form of a friendship with a boy named Scorpius Malfoy.
