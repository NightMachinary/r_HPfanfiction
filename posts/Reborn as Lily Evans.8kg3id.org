*** I'd just say fuck the timeline and go lesbian. Well, all authors should say fuck the timeline when it comes to time travel.

***** I thought about writing a not too long piece where Harry gets reborn (after the Killing Curse in the forest) as his mother after she took Voldemort's Killing Curse, raising himself, and quickly finishing off the Horcruxes. Only problem I had was feeling like there wouldn't be enough conflict. Unless I had an antagonist Dumbledore, which I didn't feel like doing.

****** Just import a foreign dark lord from elsewhere. Or you could have other people reborn, not just Harry. Bellatrix comes back after being killed by Molly, amirite?

******* Bellatrix comes back as one of Neville's parents? Or Molly's brothers? God, that'd be fucked up.

That's a good idea. Thanks!

*** I have a plot penciled out somewhere where Harry gets thrown back in time and inhabits his father's body. He has to marry his mother and impregnate her to make sure of his being born.

***** The whole idea was a comedy where harry!james has to woo his mom, marry, consummate, and so on, all while trying not to sick up due to the squick of banging his mom. Lots of aphrodisiacs and the like and then lily finds them and is all "do you think maybe james is gay?" with her friends "and i'm just a way to get an heir or something?"

** I have an idea for a story where everyone is the sAme soul. Just born at different points on that soul's timeline. Deja vu is memory fragments of prior lives.
