personally, i become suicidal whenever the slightest thing goes wrong in my life, so it's honestly kind of weird that i've never read a fic where Harry or another character just chooses to end it. has anyone read something like that?

** Digging For The Bones linkffn(6782408) involves suicide attempts. It's severitis, has a whole laundry list of trigger warnings and while I'm not a fan of a certain storyline (resulting from one of the attempts) it's a rather good story even if I'm a lot more fond of the author's 'Memories' series (which, while it has some similar themes, doesn't touch on suicide).

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

** Do you want the suicide in the fic, or is characters reacting to it okay?

The only Harry Potter fic I've read that's focused on suicide is linkffn(Giving Notice by dontgiveahoot) and it's about people reacting to a suicide that isn't shown.

**** Yes this fic. Omg it tore me up back in the day. Just goes to show how suicide devestates more than one life. And personally, having a family member do it, it is truamatising and has lifelong repercussions. Simple things like the phone ringing late at night makes me tense, 21 years after the event.

** I get that too. I tend to focus on crack-fics now, but a few years ago, I used to search on FFN for things like "suicide", "abuse", "neglect", etc to find fics like that quite regularly, to the point where they all began to sound the same. They helped exhaust the angst. I can't remember any specific stories, though; it was about five years ago, and like I said already, everything kind of melded together. But in my experience, you tend to go through a lot of these fics once you've developed an urge to read them, so I'll pass on some advice on how to find them. You might already be aware of this stuff or are looking for specific recommendations though, in which case, feel free to move on to someone else's comment.

Most fics on FFN with suicide attempts in specifically mention it in the description as a warning, so performing a search for that generally yields good results. You can sort the search results by popularity for a degree of quality control. Same for AO3, except on there the warning would be in the tags.

You can also do a fancy google search. For example, searching *site:[[https://www.fanfiction.net/]]* *"Harry Potter" "suicide"* will give results for pages on FFN that mention both "Harry Potter" and suicide. Make sure Harry's whole name is in the same quotation marks so that google doesn't give you unrelated fics with Harrys and potters in. You can only do one website at a time afaik, but at least you'll have another to go to once you've exhausted the first, I guess?

And just to clarify, for anyone getting ready to harp at me: I'm not passing on this info to encourage taking your own life. Reading fics where characters are struggling with thoughts that plague yourself can help you get out of funks.

** I remember reading in a plot bunny farm about a Harry who never was told about what truly happened to his parents.

Hagrid, who was meant to tell it, was stopped by Harry who said he didn't want to talk about it, he already knew - He was ashamed about how his parents supposedly died in a drunken accident - And Harry was trapped and scared when people treated him like he was famous. He felt incredibly guilty, and snape was worse this time wrong due to a misunderstanding/mistake between them. Everything combined, snape, guiltiness, dursleys, famousness, and bullying got to him and he commited suicide.

  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.
