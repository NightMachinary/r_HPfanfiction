I'm really in a slash mood lately, and since my phone now has a data plan, I want to download a bunch of fanfictions from my computer so I have things to read. I don't care how old they are, how popular, as long as you personally think they are some of the best of the fandom/pairing/whatever. I'd appreciate fics that are either complete or at least 200k words, to make them worth my effort. Other than that I'll take absolutely anything. But if that's too vague and you want something to go on...

I love things like super!harry, bonding/creature fics, time travel, and basically anything that really changes up canon. I'm not usually a fan of post-hogwarts stuff unless canon is drastically changed (slice of life stuff is bleh).

I'm particularly fond of Harry paired with most Slytherins or a Weasley.

Recommend me your favorites?


** Sounds like you would like the Sacrifices Arc: long, super!Harry, Drarry, very AU.

It starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]. If you don't like it at first I recommend sticking with it at least up through the second book. All is not as it seems in Saving Connor.

** Shoebox Project - Slash, however it isn't the focus (maybe except for the last 3-4 chapters). Mostly just Marauder era 6th-7th year Slice of Life, some mention of the coming war (however, the author abandoned the fic right after they left school, so it remains at mentioned). The ending is terrific(ly dark) though, the point that the author left it was perfect. R/S

** I suggest reading [[http://fuckyeah-drarry.tumblr.com/post/40443518591/the-complete-works-of-maya][Maya]].

Sadly, I've almost completed faded out of the fan-fic world... But her work I still read. Her work is the only stuff I re-read. Her work is the only stuff I've re-read 4 times. If they published her fanfiction, I would buy it hardbound and wait in line for 8 hours for a signing.

She's gone pro and writes extremely good YA fantasy as well, but her Drarry fan-fiction is the best slash, if not the best fan-fiction I have *ever* read. She started writing right after the 4th book was published and stopped writing in 2008, so she only has one story written completely post DH (and her work is only available as a compiled pdf of everything she wrote).

Her approaches to the characters are extremely fresh. She makes my re-readings of the canon richer and more complex. She's made me think really hard about the characters and reconsider why I like or dislike them and what their motivations and values are. Her romance is the most heart twingey romance too (I have cried), that manages to feel realistic.

She's also incredibly funny. Her fan-fiction doesn't just make me giggle, I roll over laughing and snorting over the dialogue, which is witty and sharp and intelligent. She writes in a sort of faux-crack tone: it's ridiculous, but the way she writes it, everything make perfect sense.

Her work offers a lot to bite into. Her one shots are in the 30-40 page range and her multi-chapter works are well over 100 pages, the longest being about 500 pages.

My favorites (the PDF download I linked too has bookmarks for all the stories):

1. *Drop Dead Gorgeous*: A post Hogwarts, drarry fic, DDG is a satire of common tropes in Drarry fanfiction. Harry and Malfoy are auror partners and it is revealed that Harry is part veela. Harry is in love with Malfoy, but is terrified that Malfoy will figore out how he feels, as it will destroy their hard won friendship. Also features Harry/Richie Coots, Malfoy/Katie Bell, Ron/Pansy, Harry/Wood, (hilariously) Crabbe/Goyle, and veela Blaise Zabini. Is canon through HBP

2. *If You've A Ready Mind*: AU hogwarts drarry fic, it is the first 6 books from Malfoy's perspective if he had been sorted into Ravenclaw instead of slytherin. Also features Malfoy/Terry Boot, Malfoy/Cho, Ron/Hermione, and Terry/Smith. Is canon through HBP (but I think it sticks to DH canon as well).

3. *Underwater Light*: Without a doubt her most popular fic, this is an angsty hogwarts fic written post GoF (though parts overlap with OotP, which was published while she was writing it). It takes place in the 7th year and is about Hogwarts dealing with the war. An event throws Malfoy and Harry together and they end up having to reconcile their differences to defeat evil (basically).

(/The Way We Get By/ is the prologue to DDG and is a mild drarry slash. The two are very good to read together, both are very funny and well written, though the order doesn't really matter)

*** Thanks for the links buddy, I'll have to take a look at 'em. Haven't read slash in forever, maybe I'll end up liking this.

That said, can someone please explain why it seems like every goddamn tumblr blog has terrible formatting and tiny text? Like, [[http://i.imgur.com/F59mKUU.png][what the fuck is this shit?]], a link for ants?

** Aye my friend! I'm not a big slash fan anymore, but about 5+ years ago I read it constantly. In my opinion like 99.99% of slash is terrible, but there are a few gems out there. My absolute all time favorite slash fic has to be

  Yet another one of those Harry And Draco Are Forced To Be Together By Something Beyond Their Control And Then Stuff Happens Leading To Twoo Wuv stories. Because every HD writer has to write at least one. [Finished]

The author is self aware, and she expertly navigates the cliche filled waters that the fic lies in.

**** Yay! You wouldn't happen to know of any other Drarry fics where they meet through online dating, would you? I really like that theme but haven't found anything else as good as Must Love Quidditch.
