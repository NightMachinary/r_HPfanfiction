I recently read a very well written fic abou the hogwarts founders. Anybody knows decent fics with this plot? i'd take any suggestions especially if there is a hint of slytherin/hufflepuff

The 2nd fic in the series was actually written first. Both are decently written but unfortunately it is now abandoned which is why im craving for more hogwarts founders fanfics lol.

** The Five Winters by Anubis Ankh has some cool founders lore, mostly about helga hufflepuff, but it is a small prt of a very long hgss story. You might have to dig a bit to find the fic, if you're interested pm me
