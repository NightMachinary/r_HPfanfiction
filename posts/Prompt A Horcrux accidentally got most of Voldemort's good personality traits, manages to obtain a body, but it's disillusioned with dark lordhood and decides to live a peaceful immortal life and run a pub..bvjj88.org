And that's the story of friendly leaky cauldrom Tom.


** Tom saw a young man enter his bar, look around, and finally collapse on the seat at one of the tables. It took him a moment to realise the face of Killian Potter, an Auror after the latest recruitment process. Even with Occlumency it was sometimes hard remembering faces with names, four centuries would do that to anyone.

He went to the young wizard.

"Auror Potter."

"Leave me alone."

Tom made a show of looking around. "I don't think I will." He smirked.

"Fine. Cheep Firewhiskey. Whatever you got."

Tom simply nodded and went back to get the drink. He knew people were more prone to opening up after a few drinks, so it was futile trying right then.

Killian gulped down two bottles, then started sipping the third. Excellent. The business was suffering at the time, the attacks had scared the people away, and so he had time to kill.

He sat down at the chair next to Killian and said nothing.

"Those bloody bastards killed Frenca."

Ah.

"I will slaughter every last one of them. I'll... I'll... they killed Frenca."

Tom just waited.

"I was the one s'posed to be dead. I was s'posed to die. Frenca... she jumped in. She did."

Internally, Tom smiled. He couldn't ever forget Harry Potter. And right then, Tom saw Harry Potter in the young Killian Potter. He never kept track of the generations. Who married who, and birthed whom? It was too much effort. But he would recognise a Harry Potter any day of any week in any century.

The next bottle he brought for Killian was much more expensive.

Potters weren't as rich as they used to be. Too many spoiled brats had drained the family wealth recently. Tom thought he could give a little gift to the young man, maybe it would help some.

The clock struck 12 on his wall, it was time.

"Don't ever change, Tom, please," young Killian slurred as he was led outside the door and the Knight bus was called.

"I don't think I will."

He /could/ end the war if he wanted. Tom knew that. He had studied magic so deep that even Voldemort back in that day would have been impressed. He knew spells and rituals that would make the skin crawl, literally.

But he knew it was futile anyway. Every decade or so, a new wizard popped up who wanted to rule the world. By now Tom could some times predict down to the month of the year when a new threat would make itself known.

And Tom knew that the "good" people would win anyway. He had been astonished, when after Voldemort, the next three so call Dark Lords had perished in a matter of weeks.

Tom knew that this war would end as well. Maybe it would take one or two decades, but the history would repeat itself sooner or later.

And if the Dark Lord somehow won?

Tom shrugged. He had no need to worry. He was just a bartender in a tiny little bar at the end of Diagon Alley, anyway.

** voldemorts good personaility traits

charming, intelligent, ambition is a neutral trait and so is cunning

I guess he becomes a charming intelligent, well liked barkeeper

voldemort has alot of neutral traits but few good ones

he does not show concern for his underlings he does not lead from the front he does belive his plans for the future are noble

***** This shit always pissed me off. Terrible villain. Grindelwald is a much better example of what the series should have ended with instead of crazy Voldemort. Imagine if he escaped in book 5/6 and either Voldemort had to work with Harry to defeat him, or everything just went to shit.

***** Yeah, violence is never the answer but as far I've seen a lot of wizards as in general are intolerant of "outsiders" be it creatures, werewolf, muggleborn, squibs, and all that. So I think it is less about death of wizarding culture and more 'cleansing' with regards to Death Eater propaganda. Anyone willing to follow a terrorist, Voldemort, in the murder spree is a red flag. I care about the environment but I won't go as far as blowing up fishing vessels.

werewolfs kinda make sense, from what we see people like lupin are the exception but it could be because warewolfs lack choices so they all go the greyback path

******* Yeah, that's the point. People blinded by hate and prejudice are not rational people. That's why eco activist do not equate to eco terrorist. Sometimes all we can do is wait for the old farts who hate on people to die out until open minded people will out weigh the negativity.

But the problem beyond wizards living a long life is that the kids are being indoctrinated and no one teaches otherwise, the houses have effectively works as a vehicle for segregation. The system is like a sieve, it's full of holes.

Death eaters could have been revolutionaries but subjugation does not equate promotion of tradition. Supremacy is so far off, it's not about the culture anymore. What it is, is captured by the statue at the ministry of magic, the "magic is might".

***** It still seems somewhat low-effort to create thread after thread with the same prompt instead of at least trying to write something themselves. It might not be good, but isn't an earnest attempt better than nothing at all? I think it could inspire more discussion versus another thread repost.

Just saying this because I remembered seeing this same thread before, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b5273e/prompt_one_of_voldemorts_early_horcruxes_manages/][here]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b4ovm7/prompt_after_trying_to_take_over_the_world_turned/][here]].
