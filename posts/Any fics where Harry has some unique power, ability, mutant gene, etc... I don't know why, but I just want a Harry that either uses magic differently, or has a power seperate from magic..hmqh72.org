I don't mind crossovers, but would prefer little impact from other worlds. I'll still enjoy the crossovers, but I prefer the power being the only crossover element. Feel free to suggest otherwise since I want this post to give something to everyone, but that's just my preference.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** The first several of these are crossovers. The HP without crossover links are later.

linkffn(Mutant Storm by Bobmin356). X-Men crossover. Hearing the prophecy after the battle in the Department of Mysteries causes Harry's mutant gene to activate.

linkffn(Missing Magic by SeverAllTies). Avatar: The Last Airbender cross. Harry has no magic after Voldemort, but he can bend.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elder Sect by Clell65619). Bewitched cross. Harry is descended from Samantha's Aunt Clara, has their kind of magic.

linkffn(Reinforced Magic by Lupine Horror). Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha cross. Reinforce tries to die to save Hayate, but ends up with Harry. He starts learning that kind of magic (Mid-Childan or Belkan; I don't remember which). Has two sequels.

linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter). Cross with Ranma 1/2 and Sailor Moon. Stressed, Harry accidentally apparates to Jusenkyou, where he falls in the Pool of Drowned Sailor Moon.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Source by Clell65619). Cross with Remo Williams: The Destroyer. Harry was brought up by Chiun, knows Sinanju as well as magic.

linkffn(The Last Mage of Krypton by TheBeardedOne). Superman cross. Lily's child was stillborn. Luckily, a small spaceship landed at the Potter home just then. Has sequels.

linkffn(No Need for Harry by Pheonix Dawn). Tenchi Muyou cross. Harry manifests Light Hawk Wings during the battle in the graveyard.

I can only come up with a couple of Star Wars crossovers that /don't/ have Harry become a Jedi (or, occasionally, a Sith).

linkffn(Harry Potter: Air Elemental by kb0). Harry discovers a new power after the battle at the Department of Mysteries.

linkffn(L'Heritier de le Fay by n1ght3lf). Harry's magic changes when Malfoy turns him female.

linkffn(The Closer You Look by Tony Samuels). Young Harry acquires a deck of cards, and uses them as a magical focus.

linkffn(Monstrous by The Mad Mad Reviewer). There's a new creature in the Forbidden Forest, and Harry never arrived at Hogwarts.

linkffn(The Power The Dark Lord Knows Of by Finbar). Crack. What happens if Voldemort learns of The Power He Knows Not?

In [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/][Blue Steel]] and [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/][White Knight, Grey Queen]], both by Jeconais, Harry learns house elf magic.
