I've run out of fanfiction and can't find anymore. I can't think of new topics to look for, i've re-read everything I can think of at least twice. So yeah.

What do you do when you run out of fanfiction and can't find any more?

But really, I have the same issue. I haven't read fanfiction in ages because I can't find any more that appeal to me. :(

** Video games, library, book store. Crossovers or different fandoms, as viol8er said. If you're just wanting more fanfiction, then go to FFN and filter by favorites and "updated within the last 24 hours". Usually yields a new fic or two.

  Very extreme AU, myriad crossovers, many new characters, very super Super!Harry, majorly altered timeline. Entering Hogwarts, sixteen-year-old Hermione Granger is about to find herself thrown in at the deep end of one helluva mean old galaxy...

Seriously: I read actual books, watch movies, sit and contemplate my place in the universe, if my laptop wasn't in the shop I'd be playing games, solving my Rubik's Cube(s), and so on and so forth.

Or google a pairing and "list." I tend to find LJ posts linking to different websites that I didn't know existed.

[[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/Supportedsites][This website]] lists fanfiction websites that are supported by FanFicFare, to download fics to Calibre. I don't know how many on that list have HPfanfiction but you could always check each out and browse what they've got.

*** It's actually not a bad series. There's two five book "sets" in the main series, not including short story books (with a third that just started), and also a few other series that are tangentially involved with the PJ books and dealing with the Egyptian and Norse gods. The Egyptian series has 3 short stories where it crosses over with PJ, and the Norse series has the main character as a cousin of one of the main characters in the PJ series.
