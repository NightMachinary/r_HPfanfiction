So im looking for a fic where Harry travels back in time and he realizes the mistakes he made and he does something or hates something he did before that makes him either a Death Eater or Voldemort's Protege. Only if the story is completed and if it has a sequel then the sequel can't be abandoned please. Edit: OR a time travel Harry/Fleur fic that is completed etc. etc. like above.

****** Ick. vBulletin is a terrible platform for publishing stories, and forcing people to sign in before reading is just twisting the knife.

*** I've just read the description of that fic and what i meant was Harry hoes back and time and joins the death eaters or voldemort. And I've read wastelands of time but it wasn't my cup of tea. Thanks for the suggestions though.
