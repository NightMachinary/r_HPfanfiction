What the title says. I'm just looking for Riddle era fiction set at Hogwarts that explores little Voldy's relationships with the parents of his future death eaters.

Bonus points for historical accuracy, especially if the author corrects ahistorical canonical stuff.


** linkffn(The Evil Overlord list)

It's not complete unfortunately, but it is one of the best Tom Riddle at Hogwarts fics I've read. Poor Lestrange.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
