** I think using Harry Potter terms makes the program tag you as "like JKR" - I ran my latest two chapters through, one from "Patron", one from "Richard Castle, Watcher", and it gave two different results.

*** That's what I figured at first, so I then used my reviews from non-HP fics (Worm, ASoIaF, FSN, MCU) and got the same result.

*** Yeah, I stuck some of my Sherlock fan fiction in there, and sure enough, I got Arthur Conan Doyle. Without any Sherlock terms, apparently I write like Stephen King. Huh.

** Interesting twist- when I removed any references to magic and changed the names from Hermione to Jane, Harry to Dennis and Holly to Haley, the same text that originally was like 'J. K. Rowling' comes up as 'David Foster Wallace'. I suspect a cheat is in play looking for specialized words.

*** When I copypasted some chapters, I changed every name to Bob and deleted last names (except when it was something like Mr. [Name], in which case, I entered Jackson). I didn't remove any references to plot points (such as magic, or ki, or spaceships, or superpowers, etc.) since it would be super tedious and may dilute the style (for example not having fantasy elements in a fantasy fic would make it just about a trip to someone else's country for something like LotR).

** My HP Fanfiction is JK Rowling (go figure, but nice to know I nailed it)

My Buffy fanfiction is Ursula K. Le Guin (earthsea, etc) which surprised me since I don't remember actually reading anything by her..

My current project is barely 3k words long, but apparently it reads like Edger Allen Poe... I'm not sure what to feel about that since it is my first truely original fic in a long time... interesting I guess...

** I keep getting different results with each piece I put in. either its randomized, or I'm a writing chameleon. lol

Edit: the most common ones have been Chuck Paluhnuik and Kurt Vonnegut.

*** I got a lot of different ones too. (Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, David Foster Wallace, J. K. Rowling, and H. P. Lovecraft) For me, at least, I can tell that there's definitely a stylistic difference between all of them. It does seem like there's a slight similarity between what I wrote and what it's saying it's like (at least for the authors I've read) but I'm probably stretching it.

** Well, firstly this is going to end up pretty flattering whatever crap gets entered. I tried chapter one of My Immortal and it said JK Rowling. Probably because it uses the names used in the Harry Potter books. Or an approximation of them, anyway.

That said I was still rather happy with my results. For the most part my stories are meant to read fairly similarly to JKs work. And, for the most part, this says they do, but that's probably down to the shared characters. Much more pleasing is the fact that my LotR crossovers are similar to Tolkien, my original sci-fi ideas read like Douglas Adams and Arthur C Clarke, and my Dickensian London story reads like Dickens.

So that's nice.

** I threw in two paragraphs of descriptive text without any mention of HP terms and got Stephen King then I put in a dialogue scene between Harry and Sirius and got JK Rowling. If that's even slightly true I would gladly take the middle ground between King and Rowling.
