Read a cute story over a year ago with Harry traveling dimensions/time and I think tries to buy the vanishing cabinet from B&B's as what he thinks to be a fictional character, Gomez Addams. Really yams it up portraying Mr. Addams around wizarding Britain until he finds Borgin and Burks HAS AN ADDAMS ACCOUNT and that the Addams are real in that universe. Harry spends much of the rest of the tale running from an ever closing inquisitive family darker then Black while also trying to save the world. Anyone read and remember the title of this story?


** You described the Addams thing in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695419/1/My-Gilded-Life][My Gilded Life]] pretty much word for word, but it's a Gilderoy Lockhart self-insert rather than a time travel story.
