Recently found an unfinished Harry Potter-ish story from a few years ago. Thought I'd share it.

--

“Oy Blimey with ya cronker willit!?” screamed or gingerly whispered Moby Dornkle, the butterball patriarch of the Dornkles. Moby waited a half second, craning his neck to hear any signs of movement. Nothing. Not even a fart. He decided to fill that void with his own fart before proceeding. A big old chubby fuck-face, Moby Dornkle always seemed to perfectly position himself next to his adopted son Harry's ear when squealing, or farting, for his family to come down for supper. In case you were wondering, that first line of dialogue in this book translates (from stupid British-speak to SUPERIOR CANADIAN/AMERICAN English) to: “Hark! I call upon God's angel, my wife, and the fruit of my loins to join me for a exquisitely prepared cooked meal!” The fart roughly translates to the same thing.

Harry caught both the fart and scream in his mouth.

“Uncle Moby?” started Harry before he was interrupted by yet another scream coupled with a mighty gravy-fart right in the mouth halfway through.

“I sed oi you knocker blum-platter gombys bettah rib in the cassle!” screamed Moby.

“Uncle Mondy?”

“It's Moby you little frog bonker” corrected Moby.

“Right, I was just wondering-”

“That's et, you're getting a right shoving!” Moby unbuckled (or “unclogged” as he called it) his belt, pulled his pants down and attempted to shove Harry. This, however, proved surprisingly difficult for Moby. For starters, he was standing like, a fucking foot from Harry. So the fact that he eventually missed his shove is beyond me. Second, he didn't go for the traditionally British ‘pants down rugby-push' that's so popular in their culture. No, that would have made too much sense. He instead stretched his arms out first, not facing Harry mind you, and used his hips to lurch his torso forward to generate any sort of potential attack. An attack that not only failed at its sole purpose, but reversed the harm to Moby as he fell ass over teakettle into the hallway mirror. Moby seriously honked like a goose when he hit the ground. It was very out of place.

“Blonkers!”

The mirror shattered in dozens of mercuric shards. Harry stared at the mess. Not knowing what to do. He caught his fragmented self amongst the reflective glass (that's another way of saying mirror). A sort of trance-like calm consumed his as he peered deeper into himself. His attention moved from the larger, reflected collage of his face, to the hundreds of smaller impressions trapped within each shard's edge. He wandered in this moment, not wanting to let it go. Or was he unable to let it go? Did he seek these brief moments of peace on his own or did they manifest themselves? An uncontrolled subconscious mechanism that takes over like sleep to the man who fights it. Was this tyranny built into his psyche to prevent an eventual fracture of the mind? The questions swirled.

Moby was drooling on the floor, a massive wound painted on his forehead. He said nothing.

At last Harry believed he had an answer. He said to nobody in particular:

“I... I think I'm an android.”

Moby farted.

“That explains why...” Harry paused. He had no fucking clue what he was on about. He probably wasn't an android, he thought. Nah. He was most likely completely spacing out while his brilliant uncle slowly died of a self inflicted head wound after trying to attack his nephew for no discernable reason.

Moby farted. It could have been a coincidence, but this seemed to snap Harry back into his trance where he believed he was an android.

“Androids aren't for slumping now are they?” said Harry as he corrected his posture. He snagged one of the many jelly crumples jutting out of Moby's pocket. He stuffed it into his mouth, convincing himself that what he tasted only amounted to a collection of ones and zeroes. He paused, spat out the jelly crumble and wiped his mouth. Moby had a habit of “modernizing” (as he put it) his pocket jelly crumbles by adding a dollop of mayonnaise to each cookie. Harry, nor anyone else in the family, was particularly fond of this. Pretty much any part of it. The adding of the mayo, the sexually frantic look he would give each one... the consuming. Oh god the consuming was the worst.

Moby groaned. Then his ass groaned. Like, a human groan. It was cosmically frightening. Harry picked up the fire poker that I just decided was plopped right by his feet and gave Moby a good poke. Moby laid perfectly still. Harry decided to smash a lamp over his head.

“Uncle Moby!” barked Harry as he did his English best to gently smash a glass object over his uncle's already lacerated head. A new trickle of blood flowed from Moby's temple. No fart. The footfalls began as it became clear that something out of the ordinary must have been going on downstairs. Meb Dornkle was the first one down. She recoiled at the sight of her husband who laid still as a drunk goat. Pants down, ass up, blood pooling around the crown and forehead. She shot a brief glance at Harry, not wanting to take her eyes off of Moby for too long. Was he dead? Was-

Before the second question could even fully take in her head she doubled back to Harry. It was slow to surface, but her subconscious mind had caught up to her dominant level of awareness to remind her of what she had seen. It was only a fraction of a second, but she caught something.

“Harry were... were you just doing the robot?” she asked.

“You wot?”

“Were you doing the-”

“Was I where?”

“No, Harry, not where you were. What you were doing?”

“What was I doing where?”

“Here”

Harry stared at her. He attempted to shoot lasers out of his eyes. That, he thought, would distract her for a moment. No lasers came out.

“Mungles” Harry muttered.

“Harry what are you doing!?” Meb was bewildered by the bloody scene and her adopted son's behaviour.

“Moby fell.”

“I can see that, but what were you doing just when I came downstairs?”

“I was making sure Moby wasn't dead.”

“By dancing over him while he lays there bleeding out?”

Harry gave one more earnest shot at frying her with a laser beam. Nothing. He cleared his throat. He didn't want to fess up to doing the robot dance. He didn't want Meb to think he was some kind of fruit crumble. Although he had nothing against homosexuals, and neither did anyone in his family for that matter, Harry was still entrapped in that stage of boyish insecurity where most of the day is dedicated to convincing people you're not gay. He instead decided to confess to something else.

“I'm trying to shoot a laser at you.”

“You're what?” Meb felt like she was in a dream. But a pretty decent one considering most of her dreams were horrible nightmares dealing in some way with flightless birds. Half of them consist of turkeys, because Meb has no fucking clue if they can fly or not. However, her unconscious mind has apparently made the decision that they most certainly can not.

“I'm trying to dispatch a laser at your mother body” said Harry using an awkward choice of words. “That is what I was-”

“You were doing the robot.”

“No I-”

“I'm making it to the bottom! Clear the up-walk!” shrieked a voice from upstairs.

Suddenly a multitude of sharp cracks echoed throughout the house as DuffBart Dornkle took himself down the steps the only was he knew how - by falling. This was never an accident by the way. This probably mentally challenged (but not really for the sake of comedy) person would stand at the top of the steps, announce his intended arrival at the bottom, issue a quick warning to those who may be in the way and then allow his legs to go limp as his 275lb body plummets downward. Most of the time he would reach the bottom without any unforseen delay, however I would be lying if I said that he /always/ reached the bottom. His success rate was in the 75% range. Most failures were due to him getting impossibly hungry during the 3 seconds of free-fall which caused him to flail around like a dying spider. This would throw him off the usual course that gravity had freely provided and inevitably wedge his head or appendages between the banisters where he would stay, whimpering, until Moby “buttered him out”.

This voyage was a success.

DuffBart rose up, checking his arms and legs for any cuts. Apart from the routine toilet bruises, he was in tip top.

“Oi, I'm hungry” fat-talked DuffBart like a fat piece of shit. I'm sorry that's mean to fat people. Please accept my apology. Unless you're fat. I'm not looking for your approval. Hillary should have won / we should pledge to reduce our carbon footprint by joining the Paris Accords / Black lives matter. There. Now you can't be mad at me.

“Oi, I'm still hungry!” said DuffBart. Spittle cascading with every word. Here's the timeframe on those two statements just in case you need to see the big picture here. Okay here goes:

DuffBart stands up.

“Oi I'm hungry.”

One quarter of a /second/ later, before anyone can even register his presence.

“Oi I'm still hungry!”

Meb, needing to comfort her only son, rushed over to DuffBart making absolutely sure to shoot Harry a hostile glance. She needed to remind him of how much he wasn't DuffBart and how much he wasn't their biological son.

“Look what you've done to my little Duffy Muffy Moo Boo Goo Boo Boo Boo Shoe Duffy Magoo Little Duffy Duff Duff Duff Booby Doopy Goopy Woopy Duff Boot Doop Shoop Loop Scoot One Two Boot Shoot Doo Boo...”

She continued as the words trailed off in Harry's head. He was trying to set them on fire again. I think at this point he should have given up. DuffBart may be painfully stupid, but somehow he was intuitive enough to catch on to exactly what Harry was doing. He lost his fucking mind.

“Mum he's trynna! Mum Harry is making the hot come out of his face at us! I'm hungry! Mum we're gonna right cook in the minge wot if we - Mum I want some sandwich and soup with bread pudding roast widget on the barney!”

Moby farted again, but nobody really heard it. Moby, however, felt it. His farts were always extremely painful due to the fact that he rarely (almost never) chewed his food.

DuffBart meanwhile was now shirtless. He thought that he could catch Harry's laser beams in his shirt and then later humanely release them to the sun outside. At this point Harry was not even looking at DuffBart, but still he proceeded. Finally a collective exhaustion fell over the family. Harry's eyes were sore, DuffBart's limbs were aching and Meb's emotional reserves had depleted. They stood and watched the patriarch of the house bleed out. Meb quitely shuffled over to the closet and grabbed some masking tape. Which she used to make a pirate hat that she gently placed over Moby's head. She added a strap of tape connected to the tape-hat that went tightly under the chin for extra security. This did absolutely nothing to stop the bleeding. Meb smirked, satisfied.

“I want a hat. I'm hungry.” said DuffBart as he fumbled his way towards his father.
