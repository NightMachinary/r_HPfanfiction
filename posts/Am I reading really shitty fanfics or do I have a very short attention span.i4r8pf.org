I figured it would be the former because I often find myself absorbing Rowling's every word but when it comes to fanfics, especially action scenes, I find myself skipping the whole action and jumping to the next dialog line. If the dialog indicates that something big happened I will go back and skim through it. I was wondering if any of you had the same feeling about certain scenes being pointlessly dragged on and on. I don't give a shit about a particularly long duel where random spells are thrown only to avoid the target, neither do I care about ridiculously action packed Quidditch games. I just want to know how the action of the story progresses.


** Nope, you're just reading stuff that's padded out to hell and back. I do the same thing when faced with that sort of crap.

** I've recently felt like I've read all the good stuff and now I'm down to mediocre crap. Why must there be 60 chapters of filler in one story? Most of my reading is done by skimming now and it's depressing, to the say the least.

*** That's exactly my situation. I can't find well written fics with a well thought plot anymore. Most of the fics that I try to read now have plot holes, grammar and spelling errors that make my eyes bleed and a lot of useless information just to increase the word count. It's quite annoying.

** While there are extremely well written fanfics, any fanfic would have a hard time competing with a novel. Not only are published authors on average a selection that's supposed to be very good at what they do, publications get professional lectors, editors and beta readers.

** One of the most advanced and late game reading skill you can acquire is to skim a paragraph and get most of the meaning. This DRASTICALLY reduces reading time, when I first started reading Fanfic, I used to take like 3 days to finish a 100k word fics. Now, in the span of 3 days I can read a 300k fic. Maybe I just spend a lot more time in a day reading it now, but I think it's mostly because I skim over useless stuff.

This is a double edged sword, though. There may be a chance that you missed something important bc the paragraph started out really boring.

*** 3 days for 100k words?? What's your reading speed (in thousands of words per hour)? Mine is around 40k an hour

**** I'm not sure, but I took like an afternoon to read an 80k word fic a couple months ago, so possibly close to yours. I used to be really slow at reading when I started, but fanfic has really helped me improve.

** I actually do this with everything I read regardless of quality. I have aphantasia so I never really picture anything in my head. As such, detailed descriptions are pretty worthless to me and I skim through them. I'm particularly bad with character descriptions. I actually made it through 3 books in a series before realizing/recalling that one of the MCs was African American because it wasn't relevant to the plot until then and I kept skipping all the description.

Maybe because it's fanfiction you don't really need the description. We already know what a good chunk of the characters look like and we know what most of the major locations look. A paragraph on what the potions classroom looks like doesn't really add anything and at this point it's hard to describe it in a new way without sounding strange.

** I think people already mentioned the main reasons why fanfics are less interesting than books. I'll just add that, in the case of Harry Potter, this fandom has more than 10 years, a fresh story became a rare treat, and it most of the time, it feels like I always read the same 10 stories with only a slightly different wording.

** When talking about fanfiction, the former is always good assumption. Remember, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's_law]] knows no mercy.
