Im in the mood for fics where Harry either1; pre-Hogwarts learns, controls and trains in Wandless magic. or 2; during the summer between years figures out how to do magic without a wand, and trains/has fun with his magic. I like in depth exploration of magic, so theory heavy fics are fine.

*** Thanks, i recently read it, and while mind arts aren't really "real" wandless magic (charms, transfiguration) its still a decent read :)

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change)

It involves a bit of theory but it's not super heavy. Also it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea (somewhat OP Harry, indy Harry, goblin-friend Harry, the relationship moves a bit too fast for a lot of people).

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

*** This one is also really awkward/uncomfortable later on. I mean "12 years old and the author uses innuendos and strange descriptive verbs and adjectives" uncomfortable, I eventually put it down when it started talking about how 'sculpted' he is, but the strangeness starts long before that.

Also, it moves really fast and really slow at the same time (god-like by the end of CoS, but takes 60 odd chapters to reach CoS)

**** Isn't Harry something like hundreds of years old mentally in this, and he can physically change his age as well? I feel that this is one of those grey area stories in this regard.
