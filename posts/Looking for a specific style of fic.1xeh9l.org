Hi there! Longtime Reddit lurker and just found this subreddit! I have been active in the HP fandom for 10+ years and have been a reader and writer of fic for just as long. I'm looking for a certain style of fic and wondered if anyone had any suggestions.

I'm a huge fan of the Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness series (read DAYD and Sluagh, making my way through A Peccatis slowly but surely), and really love any realist fanfiction. I'm up for anything, Founder era, Maurader era, first war, Hogwarts with the Trio, post-Hogwarts, post-epilogue, really good second generation works. I don't usually go for AU unless it's still within the constraints of Rowling's universe (not a fan of no magic AU, for example). I love darkfic and genfic, but absolutely love a good angsty romance fic from time to time. I ship mostly canon but also love slash pairings.

The more serious and realistic the better - I'm looking for writers that seriously take into account the toll the war took on the Wizarding world and the wizards who fought in it, and authors who explore Harry's psyche - going from an abused orphan and then finding out he's a wizard and then he's basically realizing that he is the only person who can save his new world from this evil wizard, and then realizing the one man he loved and trusted, his one true parental figure, has basically been grooming him to die for this purpose!? Come on, man. That's some serious stuff. You don't just head over to Fortescue's after all of that is said and done.

Anyway... recently I found a fanfiction I really enjoyed, and I was wondering if I could be directed to writers with similar styles or topics. Thanks!

[[http://kissesforcrises.livejournal.com/9434.html][Apple Crumble, Apple Tart by akissinacrisis]] It's hella AU but a really good read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41962][DAYDverse by thanfiction]] Dark and long.

Both of these are quite long, but I also really enjoy one-shots and drabbles.

Thanks for the help, and I love this subreddit!


** I loved DAYD, so here are some recs for you (some are AU, but believable and in the spirit of the series, except perhaps a little darker in places):

If you loved DAYD, oh boy, you are going to /love/ this one! AU. Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute]]

Lupin/Tonks, AU after Bill and Fleur's wedding. They follow a different and darker path to canon. Due to certain actions in the heat of the moment, Lupin is forced to stay with the werewolves as he has lost his place in the Order. He decides to take over from the inside and ally the werewolf army with the Order and gain werewolf rights along the way. AWESOME fic! [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4764695/1/Lord-of-the-Werewolves]]

Snape/Lily, AU. Mulciber pranks Lily instead of Mary Macdonald, which is the catalyst for Snape turning away from the Dark Side. Amazing story with believable Snily in the first half and an epic war/battle plot in the second half. Also a fair portrayal of James, which is refreshing. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4026081/1/The-Wrath-of-the-Half-Blood-Prince]]

Andromeda/Ted. The definitive fic on their relationship, even if the timeline is messed up (they're the same age as James and Lily - and Remus!). First-person Andromeda's POV, starting pre-Hogwarts all the way until school finishes. This story is wonderful - it's so much more than just the romance: it's also about what it means to be a Black, the relationship between the 3 sisters, and Bella's slow descent into darkness.

A redo of DH, mainly canon-compliant, but 'fixed' by a fan to be more awesome, with less camping, less Expelliarmus, and a Harry with a plan. My verdict: great fun, and really feels like a Harry Potter book. I really liked some of the changes, but was a little disappointed to see some of my favourite parts from the original book were cut out. [[http://m.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/dho/a/0001.html]]

Lily/James, canon compliant up to OotP (Snape plays an important role in this fic, but there's no backstory of him being friends with Lily pre-Hogwarts and being in love with her all along). Can James Potter, Marauder and troublemaker extraordinaire, ever convince Lily Evans, Prefect and good girl, that they were meant to be? One of my favourite long LJ fics.

** I love stories on the minor characters, especially mid- and post-war! These are some of my favorite oneshots, mostly gen and character-focused:

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=298538][Something to Fight For]] - the Prewitt Brothers and Marlene in the first war
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas in Prison]] - Draco and Luna during her time in Malfoy Manor
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305538][Amaranthine]] - James and Lily in their time at Godric's Hollow
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322079][A Lightness]] - Lavender Brown, over her years at Hogwarts

** A few recommendations, all of which are complete:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] by Perspicacity - a very dark post-war story exploring some of the implications of Harry's Mastery of Death.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]] by BajaB - a slight AU where James survives Voldemort's attack. The Marauders were not nice people.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville - a dark and cynical postwar piece.

** [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Last_Horcrux_final/index/][Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux]]. I find myself recommending this story a lot here, hope people aren't tired of it yet. It greatly expands on the Wizarding world, we get to see other countries and their brands of magic. It's realistic in the sense that it depicts the effect the war has on both wizards and muggles. It's also quite dark, or the first half is, at least.
