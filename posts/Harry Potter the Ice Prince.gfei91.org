As we all know that Daphne Greengrass is considered as ice queen and in most of the Harry/Daphne Fics that I have read, Harry tries to thaw the ice queen's heart and eventually they end up together. I was just wondering are there any FanFics where their personality is reversed...I mean Harry is the ice Prince and Daphne tries to win his love. If there are FanFics based on this idea, then please suggest me some. (I would really appreciate if it's Harry/Daphne fic but I have no problem if it's Harry/any girl)


** Or Daphne is the Ice Queen and slowly turns Harry into the Ice prince.

This can happen either emotionally as Harry learns Occlumency and hides his emotions, grows to overcome petty schoolyard squabbles.

Or literally in that Daphne is like Elsa from frozen, and teaches Harry some ice magic powers.

** Y'know, this might not be that far off from canon. Harry never really interacts with anyone but Ron and Hermione. He turns down Draco's friendship pretty coldly. He ignores everyone else. Maybe he's oblivious due to his lack of social skills, but everyone else thinks he's totally stuck-up?

*** On the flip side of that, there should be more fics where Daphne is just as oblivious as Harry is. It'd be funny to see a story where it turns out she's not an aloof princess but kind of an airhead who believes in a lot of the same stuff that Luna does and accidentally ignores people because she's so easily distracted.

*** Harry's friendly with his dorm mates and the quidditch team(and later the DA). He speaks casually with several other students than Ron and Hermione. He turns down Draco because Draco is a massive dick. There's no indication that he's anything other than well liked(excluding of course, second, fourth and fifth year, through circumstances not of his own making). He just keeps a close circle. Nothing in canon supports him being in oblivious to social cues, if you discount Cho, who was being very difficult.

*** This has been my headcanon for years. Harry, Ron and Hermione are all pretty dorky. And then Luna and Neville are like super dorks.

Too bad its just because writing a large group of friends is very hard to do well.

******* I'm don't think I'm better than you, nor am I trying to make you do anything. The way in which you're writing is incorrect, but it's your right to be so, if you so choose. I just wish you'd stop presenting it like some sort of alternative style when it is, in fact, just wrong.

* edit because I'm a dumbass: I was on mobile and my phone likes to make assumptions about what I /mean/ to type regardless of what I /actually/ type. The result was an unironic homonym in a comment complaining about someone misusing the English language. Y'know, as ya do.
