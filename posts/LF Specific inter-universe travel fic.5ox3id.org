Harry is shunted off to another universe, I don't remember the exact mechanics but I remember that, James and Lily are alive in the alternate reality, Harry's counterpart is a bit of a prick, Sirius and Remus are a couple and have an adopted son who is a werewolf. The son who's last name is black is treated like shit by his supposed friend the in-universe Harry, but he puts up with it because he's afraid no-one else will be his friend.

A specific scene I remember is Harry (our Harry not the prick) attempting to sit next to the adopted werewolf and ends up sitting on the floor to eat with his friends.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** I asked for the same fic not too long ago lol. What makes it really annoying is that theres a fic with the same name on FF.net with a totally different story. Anyways, I hope one day the author finishes this story.
