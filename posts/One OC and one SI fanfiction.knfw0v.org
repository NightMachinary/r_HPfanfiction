I've recently taken a crack at rewriting my first fanfic and was curious if any here have come across it? I'd appreciate any feedback on it.

The premise follows the OC grandson of Gellert Grindelwald.

The other story is part of an SI jump chain though can be read standalone, without much effecting the premise itself, if one doesn't want to read the previous.

This particular premise follows an eccentric SI been placed into the mind of Sirius Black with canon quite literally been written out of existence within the first few chapters.

Any and all feedback is heavily appreciated! Constructive or otherwise.


** I really enjoyed *Not Another Harry Potter Story! (SI Jumpchain series)*...

The fact that the SI monologues out loud, and the HP cast reacts to that. well it's great.
