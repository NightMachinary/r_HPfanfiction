I'm currently reading Fate by TheTrueSpartan, and it is Absolutley Amazing!! I'm not even a third into the fic, but since I'm already looking forward to the post-book depression after I finish it, does anyone have Ron-centered fanfictions that are on-par or just good that you would reccomend?


** This 2 story series: The Book of Morgan LeFay [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1634421/8/The-Book-of-Morgan-Le-Fey]] and The Final Reckoning [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1700997/1/The-Final-Reckoning]] by LavenderBrown preHBP but my favorite Ron centric fics!

** Okay I know I'm super late, but here are my fave picks! There's a lot.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24897403]]) is also a time travel fix it, Ron-centric.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341]]) is just fucking good. It's where Hermione gets consequences for attacking Ron in HBP. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12365883]]) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561046]]) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16199003]]) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16288199]]) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23425024]]) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1992918]]) is a oneshot where Ron comes back from summer after something terrible has happened to him.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951044]]) is an amazing post hogwarts fic in which Ron and Draco have a lot to do with. Draco redemption, Ron and Harry friendship, Ron and Draco friendship.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]) is incredible. A series of what ifs, with 16 works, each about 8000 words.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2044746]]) is a poignant Ron whump fic. Oneshot.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24003130]]) it's a Ron becomes a vampire before 6th year fic.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13139083/1/]]) This one is simply incredible. The tale is spun so well. The anticipation. It's amazing. Follows Ron on his last case as an Auror, finding out Harry's family's darkest secret...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/]]) Chess game and Ron and Snape centric. Not a slash! Just good ol Death Eaters and a chess championship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632781/1/]]) Powerful Ron with a power he doesnt know how to use. Incredibly well written. Incomplete but the author will be updating.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12868266/1/]]) An exploration of Ron and his family.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12870741/1/]]) Ron-centric and major whump. The Boogeyman is real and Ron knows this all too well...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11595257/1/]]) How Ron and Snape become bros!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10024932/1/]]) What happens when Ron leaves on the Horcrux Hunt? To what lengths will he go to make it right?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]). PeggySue Ron that died in the Hogwarts Battle coming back to first year. 

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12578431/1/The-Chessmaster-Black-Pawn]])

A really great Slytherin!Ron that includes politics but is really realistic about everything.

It also has sequels up to fourth year by the same author

#+begin_quote
  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16904064/chapters/39712053]])

it's a post-apocalyptic, time-travel done right. first chapter or two are a bit confusing, but the rest is great.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21926938]])

this is really fun post-epilogue. i've been waiting so long to recommend it to someone, it's incredible.

#+begin_quote
  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? [Trope stew: this fic began as an exercise, an attempt to use problematic or challenging tropes. A meta-discussion of each trope to follow each chapter.]
