Chapter 31 just came out, to anyone new it's the best LOTR / HP crossover in existence so far, along with SteelBadger's other works, and I advise you to check it out. If you'd like to see his style in a short novel he has another HP LOTR crossover where Harry ends up in Rohan in the lead up to the battle of Helms deep, its a shorter story, but it's also complete and a great way to see if you like SB's style, as Shadow of Angmar is longer and takes a couple chapters to 'warm up' in my opinion.


** I think I prefer his Kicking Gotham story more, can't wait until he starts posting the next work

** I like that I don't have to check my fanfiction account to see if this has updated as reddit normally tells me first. This is just about the only fic where this happens!

** Dude this fic is fucking amazing seriously, check it out if you haven't already. I'm probably going to wait until another few chapters come out now before rereading everything once again so I can sit down and go through a nice fresh chunk of the story. I've done this several times already and it's worth it lol

** How much Lotr knowledge would you say is needed to read this? I've read Fellowship and seen all the movies but that's it. I know Middle Earth has ridiculously deep lore and world building, so that's why I'm asking.

*** I saw the films just once when they came out and I'm doing fine. Harry lands in Middle Earth with no foreknowledge so you learn about the lore as he does.

There's a 5 minute "CGP Grey" video on youtube that explains most of the lore that might be worth watching too.

***** Yeah, if it wasn't for the massive hype on this sub I'm not sure I'd have ever tried it.
