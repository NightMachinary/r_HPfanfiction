It wasn't terribly good or anything, it's just kinda driving me crazy. All I really remember is that it starts in the summer before 6th year. Harry is having trouble with Sirius' death and starts doing pull-ups on his propped up bed frame. He also signs up for a load of practical magic courses that I believe are run by Madame Hooch. I cant remember much beyond that. Help is appreciated!
