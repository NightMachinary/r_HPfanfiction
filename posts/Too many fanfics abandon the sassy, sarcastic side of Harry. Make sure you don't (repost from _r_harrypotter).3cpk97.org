So, I see many fanfics that are trying to emulate canon!Harry completely and utterly failing at points in an attempt to portray an angsty, saviour-Jesus-sacrificial hero figure. Furthermore, many completely leave out the sarcasm and sass Harry has in an attempt to do this.

Here are some examples of amazing lines from the books (compiled from [[/r/harrypotter]]):

--------------

*There are a few classic sassy Harry moments:*

#+begin_quote
  "There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It's time you learned some respect!"

  "It's time you earned it." said Harry.
#+end_quote

*But some of his sass is highly underrated:*

  "I know what day it is," Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.

  "Well done," said Harry. "So you've finally learned the days of the week."

  "Well I don't believe it," repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of Harry again. "I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it's a plot to get the house."

  "The house?" repeated Harry. "What house?"

  "This house!" shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein his forehead starting to pulse. "Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and then you're going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and --"

  "Are you out of your mind?" demanded Harry. "A plot to get this house? Are you actually as stupid as you look?"

  "Don't you dare -!" squealed Aunt Petunia, but again Vernon waved her down. Slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted.

  "Just in case you've forgotten," said Harry, "I've already got a house. My godfather left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?"

  There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument.
#+end_quote

*and*

#+begin_quote
  "You know your mother, Malfoy?” said Harry - both he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron's robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy - “that expression she's got, like she's got dung under her nose? Has she always looked like that, or was it just because you were with her?” Malfoy's pale face went slightly pink.\\
  “Don't you dare insult my mother, Potter.” “Keep your fat mouth shut, then,” said Harry, turning away

  “Why were you lurking under our window?"

  "Yes - yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our windows, boy?"

  "Listening to the news," said Harry in a resigned voice. His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.

  "Listening to the news! Again?"

  "Well, it changes every day, you see," said Harry.”
#+end_quote

*don't forget:*

OP:

#+begin_quote
  Malfoy glanced around - Harry knew he was checking for teachers - then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, 'You're dead, Potter.'

  Harry raised his eyebrows.

  'Funny,' he said, 'you'd think I'd have stopped walking around...'
#+end_quote

  'What are you doing, Potter?' said Snape, as coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four of them.

  'I'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,' said Harry fiercely.
#+end_quote

*and*

#+begin_quote
  "This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?"

  "Yes," said Harry firmly.

  "Then why," asked Snape, "does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib' written inside the front cover?"

  Harry's heart missed a beat.

  "That's my nickname," he said.

  "Your nickname," repeated Snape.

  "Yeah ... that's what my friends call me," said Harry.

  "I understand what a nickname is," said Snape.

And this is why I hate angsty!Harry fics - because all they do is take a period of a few days from the end of OoTP and stretch it out for the whole fucking fic, resulting in a dry, two-dimensional character that is terribly predictable and just not interesting to read.


** Why thank you bringing up my favorite character trait that Harry has. He is a sass God. He will sass anybody if he can.

Oh I was going to add. You forgot the part in the 6th book where Harry is tripped out on liquid luck. Both the movie and the book have him super sassy and sarcastic the whole time.

** Ah, yes. Harry is a great sarcastic bloke isn't he? Everything you've written is part of the reason why I love Harry. And I agree with the above comment, there were some hilarious quotes when Harry was on liquid luck!

Slughorn: It's nearly night fall. Surely you realize I can't allow you go roaming around by yourself

Harry: Then by all means, come along, sir!

*

Hagrid: Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are. It's the eyes, I reckon, they unnerve some folk.

Harry: Not to mention the pincers... /Click Click Click Click/

*

Horace Slughorn: Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?

Harry Potter: Through the front door sir.

Slughorn: Harry!!

Harry: Sir!!

** I wonder if the lack of grasp of sarcasm/sass comes from the fact that the humour in Harry Potter (Harry, but also Ron, Ginny as some posters have pointed out) is very British, while the majority of fanfiction writers, or at least a sizeable chunk of them, will be American.

*** I think that has a lot to do with it. I, American, remember reading the books the first time and thinking, "Wow, Harry's kind of an ass." And because his overall characterization is as a really good and nice guy, the comments that seemingly go against that get minimized, while it's easier to remember the more obvious humor like the twins. Harry's humor has only made sense to me after having met actual British people and hearing how they joke. Foreign humor is hard to replicate.

** I won't say fanfics ignore Harry's snark -- it is just that the general impression is that canon Harry isn't snarky. Many fanfics do infact make him snarky, but they overdo it and/or make him pervy as well, which isn't canon Harry at all. Fanfics like A Black Comedy, Wastelands of Time and Circular Reasoning come to mind as sarcastic versions of Harry, but those versions are unquestionably OOC and their character voice is much different from canon Harry.

Harry isn't the only victim of fanon ineptness either. Both Ron and Ginny are wonderfully sarcastic in canon, yet this rarely carries on to their Fanfic portrayal. Instead, authors try too hard to make Fred and George funny, with stuff like Gred and Forge and completing each other's sentences all the time and whatnot, and the humor almost always comes across as forced.
