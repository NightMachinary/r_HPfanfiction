I'd just like to see a student with the Lestrange name in Hogwarts, in Harry's time (rather than a marauders era fic); alike Neville, many students in Hogwarts had their relatives terrorised by people like Bellatrix in the war previously and I'd like to see how such a character would be treated by those such as Draco, Neville, etc. You get the idea. Thanks!


** There's actually a recently published fanfiction on ao3 with this premise. Cassandra Lestrange is two years older than Harry.

  What if Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange had had a daughter during the first war, who had to grow up without her parents, living among the winners of the war as a child of the losing side? This is the story of Cassandra Lestrange, a girl with the fierceness of her mother and the determination of her father, lovely and lonely, who belonged only to herself. "Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter: therefore be of good cheer; for, truly, I think you are damned."

** I have memories of a Harry/Daphne story where (I forget which) one of the Lestrange brothers has a son. Harry ends up "adopting" him as a younger brother.

I feel like it was either a Ravenclaw or +Slytherin+ Harry

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

** Delenda Est has Harry go back in time and teach at Hogwarts briefly. He interacts with a Hogwarts-age Bellatrix Lestrange (she was a Black at the time but she's a Lestrange for most of canon so I figure it counts.) It's also a romance between Harry and Bella but one of the good ones. Fair warning though: it gets kind of weird about halfway or so through the story but it's great before then.
