I'm not certain if this would count as self-promotion (request maybe?) so please let me know if I need to change the title.

So I'm messing around with an idea for a while now where I wanted to focus in on the fact that the main cast of characters is in Gryffindor and Gryffindor alone.

Don't get me wrong, I respect the G House but I never really got behind the notion that all heroes were in the same house. I get that they're not the only heroic people but they are the main ones.

Take the Battle of the Department of Mysteries (there were only 23 people, does that count as a 'battle'?) for example. Out of the 23 people present, 11 were with the OotP and 12 were with good ol' V for Voldemort. 9/12 on Moldyshort's side were Slytherin and 3 unknown but I'm going to assume Slytherin. Solely because they are the bad guys in this story but I will get to the in a minute. 8/11 on Harry's side were Gryffindor. That's almost all of them. The only outliers are Luna (Ravenclaw), Tonks (Hufflepuff) and Kingsley (Unknown).

So the analysis is all Slytherins are bad, I'm even assigning people whose houses I don't know to it because they were the bad guys; all Gryffindors are good and Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are auxiliary.

I find that too simplistic.

It would be far more interesting to have a main cast that is divided between houses and still manage to stand up to status-quo and face a common enemy. Facing off against presumed loyalty and affiliation while fighting off expectation and contempt of your peers is far more compelling than all characters being from the same group and a few other added in for flavor.

Harry, Hermione and Neville share two things. All could have been sent to different houses but their hidden bravery put them in the same house. I think it would be interesting to watch them be in different houses but come together to have a friendship that defies social expectations. Showing your bravery despite what the world has labeled you. Throw in people that overcome their own limited views because of an example of the whole 'more unites us then divides us' spiel and run to the hills with it.

There are Gryffindors that are bad, Slytherins who are good, Hufflepuff that are brave and Ravenclaw who are undeniably loyal. However, none of them have the center stage but are the backdrop.

I would like to see how a main cast from different houses would interact with one another and overcome their differences.

I know for a fact that I am reading way too much into a set of novels aimed towards a much younger audience but I am posting it on a fanfiction reddit so eh.

Probably, she is a bit head strong and pushy.

** As a proud Ravenclaw, I totally agree. Seriously, if it was that simplistic, how did Hermione end up in Gryffindor and not Ravenclaw?!?! I would argue her most defining characteristic is her desire for knowledge. So I'll help kick you off... Hermione to Ravenclaw!

It's always been my headcanon that the Sorting Hat places people in houses based on what they /value/, not what they /are/.

The kids are eleven years old, for crying out loud. You can't really have an eleven-year-old that is super cunning and political (despite what some fanfictions may lead you to believe). And it's hard to have a brave eleven-year-old when the vast majority of kids would have never been in a situation that would require them to actually face their fears and stand up for what they believe in. However, it is definitely plausible for an eleven-year-old to /want/ to be smart, or cunning, or brave, or... hufflepuff. This would also explain why the majority of people get sorted into the same house as their parents, as a child's values are often heavily influenced by those of the parents.

For example, despite how he turned out later, Neville was clearly not brave or courageous at eleven years old. However, you could definitely argue that being brave was one of young Neville's biggest desires, and thus would make him a perfect fit for Gryffindor.

Likewise, despite Hermione being "smart", you could argue that some of her biggest character traits are that she's very big on standing up for what she believes in and doing the "right thing", even if that means working tirelessly on some elf campaign that nobody cares about, or following along with Harry/Ron's stupid plan to investigate the third floor corridor at risk of being expelled.

*** I think she has both desire for knowledge AND bravery and courage in equal measure. I've seen the argument that she had already embraced the intelligent part of herself developed and her bravery needed a good environment to grow in. Hence, Gryffindor. The only issue with that is that implies that people in other houses can't become brave because their house isn't MEANT to develop that trait. Or any other trait. Hufflepuffs won't develop intellectual curiosity because they aren't in a house that fosters it, Slytherin and loyalty and Ravenclaw with hard work.

I think she should be in Ravenclaw and STILL find the part of her that is a Gryffindor rather than be in a house that mocks her for being smart while she grows some courage.

Isn't it obvious? She's even braver than she is smart. That's why she is Mary Sued so much, because she's hell of a lot smart.

*** We see that she admires bravery in the books, Dumbledore and Harry she holds a significant amount of respect for. She probably asked to be put in Gryffindor and the Sorting Hat probably saw her latent abilities (she's very prinicpalled morally and wants to fight for a cause).

First for a related rec: linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity)

Whatever the Sorting Hat said in his songs should be taken as advertising. I think the qualities of the Houses are more reflected in what the new student finds important in life; what they value, even if they don't have it.

EDIT: which apparently [[/u/averysillyman][u/averysillyman]] already said, but I'm not the first person to bloviate in agreement around here.

Gryffindors value popularity and positive attention. It rather explains why Peter Pettigrew and Neville were sent there.

Hufflepuffs value involvement and participation. They're the ones who want everyone to be attended to. Even the shyest of them would be motivated to make sure that they 'did their part'.

Ravenclaws value being right. Not righteous, mind you, but to have the correct answer - to be /proven/ right. The slowest of them still aspire to be there with the right information when someone asks about what they find interesting. It's the most competitive, isolating House. They tend to travel alone or in pairs (for how can you be right unless someone else is wrong).

Slytherins value influence. They don't have to be the most powerful, but they enjoy flexing their resources, especially if it might get them more. It attracts bullies as much as business magnates or dark sorcerers.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** As to other houses for characters, I'm always a bit troubled by what people come up with.

Harry fits pretty well in Gryffindor. He's not particularly cunning or ambitious so no Slytherin and he doesn't value knowledge above all else so no Ravenclaw either. Maaaybe Hufflepuff, but it'd be pretty difficult considering his hot-headed "my way or the highway" attitude. Not that it wouldn't be valuable for him.

Ron: Really, where else should he go? He's a simpleton and a proud ignoramus, so Slytherin and Ravenclaw are right out. In Hufflepuff he'd probably be stuck to the ceiling the first few nights for being a bully. Not sure if he'd ever learn to be a team player, but I have little hope that he has it in him.

Neville: Could maybe be a Puffer, but his bravery arc is one of the stronger elements of the HP novels for me ("don't judge a book by it's cover", "silent waters", etc. yadda yadda)

Hermione: She's the only one I can see in any of the houses. I don't think I've ever seen a fanfic that put her in Hufflepuff, but I blame that solely on HBP. I've pointed out plenty of times on this subreddit that any Muggleborn Gryffindor as smart as Hermione but not as loyal would have gotten her and her parents out of Britain after GoF.
