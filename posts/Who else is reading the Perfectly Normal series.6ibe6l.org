So [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7150730/chapters/16235486][part 4]] of Perfectly Normal by BrilliantLady has just been completed and we now have to wait until 2018 to see the next installment (completely understandable but I'm still sad). Who else has been reading it? I love it so much and though there have been some issues with it I've come across they've generally been very minor and/or easy to overlook. In the end I love it and all the ideas the author has implemented. The different parts have expanded satisfyingly each time though I don't think I'll ever get over part 1. (extra love for an australian author)

What have other people thought of the fic(s)? Also I'd love to know any recommendations for similar works :) linkffn(11990559)


** I was reading it until that scene at the end of the 3rd year where Snape says "oh I'll make sure Sirius gets what he deserves" or something.

I don't remember exactly why I stopped reading it, but it was a combination of the plot being too farfetched (the whole time turner thing took me out of it) and the fact that I stopped caring about the characters. Something jsut took me out of being invested in Harry and I just dropped it.

The first 2 years were good though, I just couldn't get through the 3rd. I might pick it up after while though and see if maybe I was just having a bad day.

*** third year has definitely been the hardest for me to get through and I also found the time-turner stuff weird and also quite rushed. Sirius characterisation was off enough that I occasionally lost the suspension of disbelief too. I'd say the time turner stuff has been the weakest part -plot wise- of the series so far, which is a bit sad. Maybe the author might fix it one day? idk but it doesn't take up too much of the story.

Harry wears on me sometimes but I've realised that it's mainly when the other characters(author) goes into expositions on wizarding etiquette and customs and such for ours and Harry's "benefit". I skim those parts unless its about ritual magic stuff :~) That's one of the drawbacks I've found. I can see why the author thinks it's necessary but I think it could be handled better than just being told what a bunch of customs are all in a block.

I do recommend getting though the time turner/meeting sirius chapters though because the final few chapters are quite good. Not necessarily exciting but the characters (and particularly Sirius) are fixed up a bit I guess and made more believable and there are some real nice friendship moments :') And with how the story has progressed book four looks to be very interesting and quite different. And you have like a whole year until then if you ever decide to try catch up.

** I've was reading it but I stopped after the Diagon Alley Sirius Black confrontation and was waiting until it was done. That scene and everything with Sirius was really bad.

*** I think they don't know how to write Sirius very well which is sad. its unfortunate how frequently he's written with fanon traits and though the author doesn't fall into the deep dark hole of (over)using the word prank and prongslet(gags), he still came across far more light-hearted than in canon. but imo the fic ends well

  Harry finds juggling studying for his Muggle IGCSEs and his Hogwarts subjects harder than he expected, especially with the distraction of Sirius Black escaping Azkaban. What he really needs is more time... why does Hermione look so guilty when he says that? Smart!Harry, Grey!Harry, Sane!Voldemort, pure-blood culture. Part 4 of "Perfectly Normal". Complete.

** I've enjoyed it so far. There's a lot of interesting aspects to it that I haven't seen elsewhere, and it's quite well-written.

** I've read the first pre-Hogwarts part but got too overwhelmed by the inclusion of all generic bad cliches at the beginning of the second one and dropped it hard.

*** evil dumbledore? i'm so over the trope I view it more like humour now (also slight spoiler but harry's realised he's not that bad now). There's other cliches but I guess I found the benefits outweighed them. tbh my favourite part is harry studying for his gcse's :') but yeah.. I personally like the story but the other parts don't hold up the way the part 1 pre-hogwarts does. It's for sure the best one. the best written and most emotionally poignant +sorry that i used the word poignant+
