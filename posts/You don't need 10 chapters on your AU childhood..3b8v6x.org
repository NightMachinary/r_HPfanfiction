Think about the Philosopher's Stone, Rowling gives us Harry being dropped off at the Dursleys, then a couple of scenes just before he goes off to Hogwarts. What she doesn't do, is spend an entire Novel's length breaking down the Dursley's treatment of Harry from ages 1-11. That's because it would be boring, tedious and unnecessary (we can infer from context what kind of people the Durleys are [50p for christmas anyone?]).

Similarly, your 'hey wouldn't it be cool if Harry was raised by Batman' fanfic does not need to devote half its length to an arduous 10 year training montage. Just give me: batman, quick glimpse of Harry being batmanish, Hogwarts express.


** Or just jump right in. Harry's on the train, at the Sorting, or even in class for the first time. Characters can (gasp!) talk to each other about their personal histories. Things are different. Why? Read to find out.

Let things expand organically. Leave some mystery to unfold. I mean, there is a /reason/ for the AU changes. Right? Things will be different in this story, leaving lots of room to explore different backgrounds for various characters, and it won't just be a rereading of canon events from start to finish with a pet OC or OOC protagonist.

Right?

** The counterpoint is when the story opens on the Hogwarts express or after and your favourite character(s) are so OOC or overpowered that most readers ragequit after one and a half chapters. The fact that most of the protagonists are eleven also makes it rather weird, since a lot of AUs imbue them with a level of maturity that escapes your average 30-year-old as well as capabilities that, quite frankly, imply things about their upbringing that leaves you feeling vaguely ill.

Like, say, the ability to shield minds or beat highly paranoid and experienced war veterans at age eleven. Most of the explanations for such behaviour (the most palatable of which being that the person was specifically trained to do such things before even reaching puberty) range from unsettling to downright terrifying ('why did you learn the Killing Curse, little prepubescent boy?' 'Because it was either that or be eviscerated by hellspawn. By the way, can you help me with my fiendfyre casting? Last time I cast it, the hyperdimensional portal my house is built on spat out a balrog at me and I ended up killing hundreds in a freak firestorm. I'd like to avoid doing that next time.') and can cause a lot of people to basically go 'why?'.

Therefore, showing enough of the environment in which the character in question underwent whatever transformation you can think of before Hogwarts is a must. The degree to which the change affects the character dictates the level of detail one must go into in order to highlight why the character is different and in which ways they are likely to differ from the baseline.

Devoting the equivalent of ten chapters (around 10,000-20,000 words) to setting that up is, quite frankly, not required unless your character essentially goes through an incredibly involved and life-changing experience that could very easily be handwaved by saying 'and then all of Voldemort's super secret Unspeakable Training dumped itself in Harry's mind, whereupon he spent the remainder of his time until reaching eleven locked up in a psychiatric institute. As a result, a relatively sane version of the Dark Lord attends Hogwarts once more. Then plot happens. The. End.'

However, doing so can be fun, which is why I have been known to indulge in overly elaborate backstories. World-building tends to be a lot of fun, generally.

*** I think it just depends on how well you can write. If you are capable enough to let the readers know about the backstory as the story goes along, then it's not necessary to explain everything in pre-Hogwarts chapters. Sometimes it's even interesting because there is a bit of mystery about the MC's past. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9735652/1/Salvation-in-Shadow][Salvation in Shadow]] for example. Starts in 5th year, when Harry enters Hogwarts. He is powerful, and nobody knows why or how, but that mystery is part of the story and makes it interesting.)

Also, in my experience, fanfics that start with overpowered protagonists that act like grown ups are mostly just bad, and even a few chapters about the early childhood don't help anything.

*** Oh god the 'Harry speaking like an adult at age 11' drives me up the wall. Was just reading an odds and ends compilation and they were all 'Harry realises the truth and creates his own path' type stories. I like them for the trash and cliches they are. But when you have 12 year old Harry beating Lucius Malfoy in a duel and telling 'Dumbles' what for and knowing who Amelia Bones is and calling for her it's a bit much.

** I completely agree, especially when I read like 100 upon 100 of fanfics and every 10th of them begins with at least 10k describtion of Harry's childhood. I mean, give me a list-like rundown of the differences, and I'm completely okay with that. I know its not proper writing etiquete, but come on, who the f*ck wants to hear about a small child's daydreams etc? So yeah, give me what differs from cannon so we can get to the interesting part :)

**** Whenever Harry internally questions if he'll get the bull whip or cat o' nine tails that particular beating, whilst being tied to the stairs; this is the most important parts of his characterization. His choice to have treacle tart, to save Hermione, to randomly stab Scabbers, it all stems back to the choice of Vernon using the bull whip on Harry's 8th birthday, the cat o' nine tails would have meant Harry would eat chocolate pudding, just stand and watch the troll kill Hermione, and then join with Voldemort and hand over the stone at the end of first year.

** I'd rather say: start close to the action. It's okay to start a Robin!Harry fic before Hogwarts as long as you're having Harry /do/ something interesting in that time. If your main conflict is with the Joker and starts when Harry is eight, you might want to start before Hogwarts. Or you might want to put some of that conflict into the backstory. Both work.

** The assertion that in PS we get Harry being dropped off at the Dursley's and then "a couple of scenes" before he goes to Hogwarts is simply untrue. The book is (in its current edition) is 332 pages long and Harry doesn't get to Hogwarts until Page 121, so not quite halfway, this is considerably more than "a few scenes".

However, your point remains, what she does with that time is establish the world and it's rules and gives us the most relevant information in broad brush strokes so that it can be brought forward and embroidered upon as the story arc requires.

For most fan fiction establishing the world and its rules is largely unnecessary (unless explanation of AU elements is needed) because the audience is comprised of people already familiar with the source material.

"The Daily Mail claims the play will focus on the story of Harry Potter's parents, Lily and James, before they were killed by Lord Voldemort. If this is indeed the case, we can assume that Harry will only feature as a baby- if at all -- since he was only a year old when they died."

That's a bit more exciting than 10 years of "boy! clean the kitchen. Now get back in your cupboard! No supper!"
