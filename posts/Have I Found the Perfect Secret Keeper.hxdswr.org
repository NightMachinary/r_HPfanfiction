I was thinking about the Fidelius Charm and the issue of the Secret Keeper. Now IIRC the Secret Keeper stores the spell inside themselves. The power for the spell comes from the caster. So the Secret Keeper doesn't require all that much power themselves. Now the downside to this spell seems that the owner of the property can't become the Secret Keeper and if the Secret Keeper is captured or a traitor they could give up the Secret. And of course, in order to provide the Secret to others the Secret Keeper has to be outside of the protected property to authorize someone else access.

So how to avoid these two glaring vulnerabilities of a Secret Keeper outside of the protected property and ensuring that the Secret Keeper never betrays you. And then it comes to me.

House Elves!

The have magic (from their bond with their "family"), completely loyal (especially to their family if they are treated well), fairly powerful, and they can pop directly to someone give them the secret and pop back having no exposure for capture.

So what do folks think? Is there anything in canon that would preclude having a loyal family house elf be the secret keeper? (Fanon can do anything).

Edited due to fat fingers posting before it was finished.


** I'm generally of the view that the spell requires you to place genuine faith/trust in another, so any clever workaround which removes the need for trust and the risk of betrayal would cause the spell to fail.

So I think entrusting the secret to a house-elf is likely fine. It seems likely that house-elves have souls (the secret is hidden inside the soul) and giving a house-elf something of such importance and no one ever figuring it out feeds into the idea that wizards almost always underestimate house-elves. Especially the Death Eaters - they're never going to think that a wizard would trust a house-elf with something so important.

HOWEVER, I doubt you can give the secret to your own house-elf, who is magically bound to be loyal to you. That binding removes the need for trust and thus the spell would fail.

*** That's an interesting view and in a way it does make sense. I think it could still work with your house elf though just consider that Dobby and Kreacher were both able to do things against their family that would have been considered as being disloyal. That little bit could be enough to allow the need for trust that you are talking about.

With the flexibility that JKR left us I still like my idea. üòÅ

**** They never actually disobey an order though and seem compelled to obey them, Kreacher is silenced when he's ordered to shut up, Dobby is unable to give any actual information about Lucius' plan or even who his master is.\\
If you order an elf to keep a secret then they will have to do so.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

*** I don't think that a random house elf would work. If the house elf was already bound to a master he would have to give up the secret if his master asks. As the family bond would override Harry's order to tell no one unless he gives permission as Harry is not the House elf's master.

I think something similar could happen to an unbound elf who later becomes bound. If the elf hasn't been abused by this new family eg he likes his family. When the Master goes "I have to find Harry Potter" which the elf overhears the elf is more likely to help his master and go "Tippy knows where Harry Potter is". And then gives up the secret when asked directly.

***** Yes by a car accident. But I did think it was an interesting way to handle the Fidelius. The secret keeper couldn't betray him as he didn't know the secret anymore as he was obliviated. And since he was chosen randomly no one could guess he had anything to deal with it.

Ron says that Shell Cottage is "Bill and Fleur's new place". Saying it in this manner points that they own the house, at least to me. The wiki says that it's Bill and Fleur's house - which to me, means that it is their house.

******* That's just an example. It doesn't have to be rent. It could be X's house that they stay at and are allowed to put under fidelius, even though they don't own it. Like if I owned a home, but let my sibling use it, I would still say "let's go to sibling's new place" and if it was put under fidelius, it would still be fine and I would still be the owner. The fact that there is a discussion means saying "Bill' and Fleur's new place" does not */clearly/* indicate Bill's the owner. You taking it to mean it is their house, fair. But it isn't clearly Bill's house as you initially indicated.
