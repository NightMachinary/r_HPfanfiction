So you know how Rowling wrote in her Wizarding World post about hatstalls that Minerva was almost Sorted Ravenclaw and Filius Gryffindor? So, uh... yeah.


** With regards to McGonagall, it's quite possible she may leave an impression on Hermione to go for Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor--/maybe./

Beyond that--which is by no means small potatoes--Ravenclaw has a relatively small part to play in the story.

Cho Chang might find herself with a halfway decent broom instead of the Comet 260.

Luna...Luna marches to the beat of her own little drum. If Fred and George were able to do as much mischief as they did in canon, then I doubt McGonagall could stop the teasing Luna gets--unless she catches someone in the act.

Oh, and odds are that McGonagall would not be kind to Marietta if the SNEAK incident occurs. Ravenclaw or not, she was still Dumbledore's right-hand.

Flitwick, who's less strict and more easy going than McGonagall, probably accepted all of his students without question. However, I can see McGonagall being very strict and stern as Head of Ravenclaw (just like her canon self in Gryffindor), and she probably wouldn't tolerate Luna and the latter's wild imagination.

I can see something along the lines of this taking place in a private meeting:

"Miss Lovegood, while I appreciate your penchant for ... creativity, I must confess myself disappointed in seeing a student of Ravenclaw subscribe to such /ridiculous/ beliefs."

Luna proceeds to either ignore McGonagall or calmly argue in favour of her points, i.e. the Rotfang Conspiracy, Fudge's Heliopaths (which McGonagall would shut down, seeing as she worked at the Ministry herself), etc. McGonagall, however, would be just like canon Hermione in shutting down Luna and arguing in favour of logic and common sense.

Suffice to say, neither side will budge, and Luna would probably have a rough time with her own Head of House. Her life would then go in various ways, such as, perhaps:

- She remains adamant in her beliefs, and thus has an even more miserable time than in canon.

- She starts to accept McGonagall's point of view. Perhaps Pandora Lovegood (Luna's mother) was less whacky than Xenophilius, and thus a Luna who accepts McGonagall's common sense might end up being more in tune with her mother's behaviour (we know from canon that Luna was a lot cleaner and tidier when she had her mother around. Perhaps Luna was different back then?).

Of course, Luna without the whackiness wouldn't be the Luna that we know. Perhaps she'd then turn into more of an artistic, creative person but without the whimsical imagination. Perhaps she'd be similar to the character Badeea Ali from /Hogwarts Mystery/, in a way?

** Well, the most immediate difference is that Harry would probably have gotten detention instead of a chance for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team (Though McGonagall loathes Snape and may have told Flitwick to "keep an eye on Potter next year").

Which means no Nimbus 2000 and by extension, quite possibly +no Midnight Duel+--Flitwick interrupted their argument in canon, so Malfoy might be extra cautious if he thinks Harry might tell his Head of House.

Flitwick doesn't seem to be quite as strict as McGonagall, so Hermione might not have had points taken from her for the Troll Incident, if Hermione kept the lie of taking the troll on herself--"I think...I think you've learned your lesson, Miss Granger...please, all of you, go to your dormitory."

Beyond that? I don't doubt they'd get in huge trouble for Norbert, but I don't think a full 150 points would be taken--at least Neville probably wouldn't have gotten 50 points taken.

As for telling him about the Stone, Flitwick /might/ be more willing to listen that "we think someone might be trying to steal it," but that's an open question.

Edit: I stand corrected. I forgot that the Midnight Duel happened right before Harry got his Nimbus.

You acknowledge that Flitwick is less strict, so I'm not understanding why Harry would be more likely to get detention here?

Harry joining the quidditch team in his first year depends on the author, but I have no problem imagining a man who fell off a stack of books upon reading Harry's name would also buy him a broom. OotP shows us he's just as likely as McGonagall to reward rule-breaking when he sees fit.

The midnight duel happens before Harry gets the Nimbus and would still happen if Ron is Harry's friend.

Flitwick would not have witnessed Harry catching Neville's Rememberall. McGonagall would have been impressed, but would not have put him on a House Team that wasn't hers.

Oh, oops. I forgot to double-check /Sorcerer's Stone./ It's been a while since I read the book.

Refresh my memory. When was this ever stated? When it comes to grades, I remember the Dursleys making excuses for Dudley's poor marks and that Vernon scoffed at having a boy who was genuinely interested in education.

**** Ha ya, I always felt like Dumbledore would of been a great Slytherin, especially in his youth when he was very ambitious and hadn't yet gone through the tragedy of losing Arianna which made him curb that ambition.

Plus I think Dumbledore being in Slytherin would of been great for the plot, and for Harry to at some point after hating on Slytherin thinking they are all evil, to learn that one of the greatest wizards of all time on the good side, Dumbledore is a Slytherin. It could have been perfect!
