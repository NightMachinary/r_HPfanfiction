Really, Harry should be a lot more possessive of his money. He grew up in an environment where he was not allowed to have a lot of stuff. The Dursleys went out of their way to make sure Harry had as few possessions as possible. And then took it a step farther and gave as much to Dudley as possible. When Harry discovered that he was rich, he should have been very possessive of it.

A lot of poor kids grow up to be like that. My dad, when he was growing up, he would iron his dollar bills so that they would be all nice and pretty.

Harry should have counted out his galleons and keep an obsessive watch on his wealth. And yet, in the story, he is very dismissive of it. I mean, sure, he was happy to have his own money, but beyond that, he pretty much didn't care. His lack of care even went so far that he casually let Molly have basically free access to his account. That is just not something ANYONE does, let alone a formerly poor child.

I don't care how much he trusted her, that is a different kettle of fish that doesn't make sense, seeing how a child that grew up in the environment he did would not trust easily. However, I won't get into that.


** I think the biggest problem is that the money isn't real to him.

Aside from that 2 weeks he lived in the Leaky Cauldron, when, exactly, has he had a chance to spend his money? 4 weekends a year in Hogsmeade where you can buy... candy and jokes? He barely even gets a chance to do his own school shopping!

Sure, he went a bit crazy when he first saw it, but Hagrid stopped him from buying solid gold everything. And then after that... nothing. He has nothing to spend money on and no place to store any stuff he might consider buying.

The money isn't real to him because it's, by and large, completely useless to him.

Later in DH, when Hermione impersonated Bellatrix, she went to Gringotts with the reason to pay off some East European dude. Other Death Eaters and the Bank considered that totally normal.

The notion that Voldemort doesn't hire assassins, goons, opportunists, thugs, and torturers is completely ridiculous. He would only *mark* true believers though.

*** Also he has a big enough pile of it, that "small" expenditures don't seem like they would meaningfully impact how much he'll have left. Making money more abstract.

It's not like he has 40 and won't get more until he starts working. He has thousands (or tens of thousands) and spending a couple hundred won't affect that. Or it seems that way to Harry.

Harry in some way is like a person who won the lottery, but also who hasn't had the chance to be frivilous with it.

** There are indeed lots of issues I would expect Harry to have as a result of how the Dursleys treated him. Stingy with money isn't necessarily one of them. I'm not saying he couldn't react in the way you describe--- of course he could. I could also see him reacting as he does in the book. He wants to share because he knows what it's like to have nothing. Giving Molly access to his account is extreme, but he's pretty clear in his internal narrative that he'd like to give his money to the Weasleys and that he knows very well that they won't take it (with the exception of the twins accepting a startup loan). So if Molly abused her access to his account--- and Harry was correct in his belief that she never would--- he would actually be okay with that.

I've heard dozens of stories of professional athletes who grew up in extreme poverty; started raking in millions as teenagers; gave away their money to everyone from their childhoods who asked; trusted childhood friends more than they should have regarding financial issues; and were bankrupt at age 35. They had no concept of money because they went from having none to having a seemingly infinite amount. Or they wanted to trust and share above all else. Or they couldn't take the feeling of having more than others, knowing how it had felt to have less. Harry could choose that path as easily as he could choose the hyper-stingy path. Luckily he trusted the right people.

Given the way HP magic works she probably couldn't do that and Harry knew from the very beginning stealing from Gringotts would be near impossible.

Edit: I mean that had Molly entered Harry's vault with the intention to steal she probably wouldn't have been able to, key or no. Just as Voldemort couldn't get the stone because he intended to use it.

**** She wouldn't be stealing because he gave her access to his account, if she could take money for Harry, she was already inside the safe, and Harry's safe didn't have any protections like Bellatrix's did. Gringots accepted Molly into the safe, she went there with his key amd with a Gobling who granted her access to it, ahe could've swept it clean and it would be legal, because Harry granted her permission when he gave her the key.

This doesn't change the fact that she DIDN'T, not because she couldn't, but because she didn't WANT to. They could use the money but they're honest AND PROUD people, they'd never take money from a minor. They may not have much but they're able to support their family with their basic needs. I don't think the weasleys would accept money even from their oldest children, who were working and probably had a bit to spare, because that money wasn't theirs.

***** It is more about the principle of the matter than the action it self. What irks me the most is Harry did not give his key to Molly of his own violation. What I mean by this is he did not say, "Molly, here is the key to my vault. Take it and take out money for me to use to buy school stuff." Instead Molly said, "Harry, give me your key so that I can get money for you to use on school stuff." I am paraphrasing obviously, but this is just not something you do. I don't care how close you think you are to someone. You do not just ask for access someone's else's bank account. That just screams thief. It is hella rude on top of that. You don't see me asking for access to my best friend's bank account. At the very least Molly should have known better than to request this.

That said, I don't think it is too weird for an adult in loco parentis to a child (which she is at the point this happens) to manage their money. It would absolutely be rude and weird to do it to an adult (not gonna lie I can actually see her trying this shit with Sirius as well...) but it's kind of acceptable for adults to take responsibility for things like the finances of kids in their care. I think you're right and it /shouldn't be/, but I also think in terms of social norms, it doesn't scream thief the way it would if it was an adult doing it to another adult.

******* In locus parentis is more of a legal matter. The fact that Harry is a child is actually worst because he is a child. Ignoring how he was raised, if he was just a normal trusting child, giving access to his vault to a strange adult would be a terrible thing. The reason is because children are much easier to manipulate and trick. Molly should have know better.

***** This is idiotic. Theft isn't defined by whether you left a door unlocked or not. If I lend you my house key to fetch something for me or to manage my household, it doesn't give you the right to empty it out. It is still theft. I was just foolish on top of it.

Lending the vault key comes with the expectation that Molly will only use it in ways that benefit Harry. Not to enrich herself. Especially, since Harry is a minor.

EDIT: And to be clear, I'm making the distinction that she might be able to take the money, but it isn't legal to do so. The wizarding world is dumb legally, but definitely not that dumb, and even politically Molly will lose against the Boy-Who-Lived when it comes to who a corrupt government will support.

****** In the first book, after the break in, Gringots issues a note on the daily prophet saying that the vault that was broken into was emptied that day, and because of that all their security measures had been dropped, and that's the sole reason seone was able to break into that vault. It was stripped clean of any protection.

Also, Harry just managed to invade bellatrix vault because he had the help of a Gringots goblin, otherwise they'd NEVER would've managed to find the vault in the first place, and saying they entered without issue is obnoxious, because the goblins were aware someone might try to break into the vault amd they knew there was something wrong with hermione-bellatrix the moment she presented her wand, and Harry had to imperious the goblin who was assisting them so they could get access to the carts. Also, they allerted everyone of their presence when they went through the thief's downfall (where they could've died if it wasn't for hermione's quick thinking) and it exposed their location to every employee of gringots. If it wasn't for Griphook's mad desire to get the sword of gryffindor, they would've been dead.

  Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.

  Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.

  “But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.

That's what was said in the Prophet.

I'm confused as to what your 2nd paragraph is attempting to disprove. They /entered/ the Lestrange vault without being killed or harmed. Just as Molly would have been able to enter without harm if she was there to steal. My whole point is that she would have an issue with moving the contents of the vault given the way HP magic works.

******** I honestely don't even know what I'm trying to say amymore lol My original point was that it was a pain to get out alive of bellatrix vault, which was more protected than Harry's, and they only managed to do it with a goblin's help, so it'd be safe to assume it'd be easier to steal from Harry's vault, that was less protected, and she had managed to legally access that vault. But you're right, we trully don't know the protections in place inside the vault. But in year 6 I think, Bill takes money from Harry's vault without his permission and without the key, so I still think Harry's vault was not that protected, and if Molly wanted to, she could've taken some extra money for the weasleys without Harry knowing and without her being arrested for stealing. Unless Gringots somehow has a way of capturing a person's intent, but we don't have enough information on that

********* Intention magic is the single greatest invention in this universe, and realistically, it would be used for literally everything. Shop security. Advertising. Police work. Bank security. etc.

By detecting someone's intent, you could create a society that is completely safe - as soon as intent to harm, kill, steal, rape etc is detected, a team of aurors is dispatched to scout the situation and stop any possible crime. As soon as you step into a store, an enchantment detects your intent to buy a specifice product, and a worker comes to lead you to where those are sold. As soon as the bank detects an intention to steal, or to take hostages, it is locked down.

Intent is foolproof, because it only exists when you are actually going to do something. Just thinking "heh wouldn't it be crazy if I robbed this bank right now" won't trip anything, as it's just an idle thought. To have intent, you need to have decided to do something, and will therefore either be deterred by changing circumstances like the aurors arriving, or be caught in the act.

********** Can you give an example of intention magic other than the Mirror Of Erised? Because the only canon example I can think of is the way the mirror is used at the end of Stone, and I got the impression that the mirror was a specific artefact designed to read your intentions or desires, and therefore Dumbledore was able to enchant it so that someone with the intent to use the stone couldn't access it. But this relied on a specific artefact (the mirror) charmed in a specific way by a very powerful wizard.

I can't think of any other examples of "intention magic" in canon at all, and the one I can think of sounds like a lot of work to set up and reliant on a specific artefact!

While it is true they have house based lessons, they also have double periods with, in particular, the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs. I would assume there are also lessons with the Ravenclaws but I can't remember those specifically.

** In practice though, growing up without money doesn't necessarily make you frugal. It could just as well make you not really understand the value of money that you don't need right now. I grew up in a family that just about got by. I never had more than a few pennies to my name until I went to university and got my student grant. And when I got that grant, I paid the rent in advance, put some by for food, and then went mad with the rest. I didn't understand the value of the rest of that money, and when it ran out I continued to go mad because banks love lending to students. Fifteen years later and I'd been in a well-paid job for years. After paying the monthly bills, including interest on something like fifty grand of credit cards, I had half of fuck all left. Provided that the necessities of food, accomodation and utilities were paid, money hadn't been real to me. It only became real when, one month when I got paid late, it suddenly looked like I might not be able to pay for the necessities.

It took me years more of scrimping and saving and careful personal austerity to undo those terrible mistakes. If my background had taught me the value of money, if I'd saved and invested instead of pissing money up the wall on fripperies and interest payments, I would now be looking forward to very soon retiring at 50.

As for trust ... Molly is the first adult other than Hagrid who has demonstrated that she cares about him, and by that time other members of her family have also shown that they care for him and can be trusted. That puts her into a different category from the rest so I think what he did was realistic. By that point he sees her as being at least some kind of replacement parent.

Harry doesn't want to be a rich jerk who flaunts his wealth to his poor friends, because he saw Malfoy do it. That was the progression of arguments in the post you quoted.

You argued against "Harry not wanting to flaunt his wealth" by referencing an event that happened before Harry got to this point. Before Malfoy gave him a very negative example of such a person.

So basically you seemed to argu in your first comment that "Harry does flaunt his wealth" because of an event that took place before Harry learned not to flaunt his wealth.

In which case, yeah, no shit.

Initially I figured you just thought that Malfoy came by and did his thing before Harry bought all the candy, so I corrected you.

A few of your other comments in this thread make me think you might be a troll though, and just saying purposefully obtuse shit.

Order of events: Harry sat in the empty compartment, Ron later joined him because "everywhere else is full", Harry buys treats for himself and Ron (flaunting wealth unintentionally but still flaunting it), Hermione stops by to ask if they've seen Neville's toad, Draco comes in and insults Ron's family, Scabbers (who we later find out is Pettigrew) bites Goyle's finger causing the Slytherin Trio to retreat.

Tell me again how the rich jerk barges in first and makes fun of the Weasleys? Also, pretty sure Harry doesn't really know how rich Malfoy is as he (Harry) has been introduced to the wizarding world at most a month ago. So, in reality, it was just Malfoy being a jerk.

Harry was not poor, Dursleys were at least middle class. They could at least buy dozens of gifts of various kinds for Dudley every year, as well as living in a gated community or something similar, maybe a suburb.

Point is Harry was emotionally abused not poor. Being denied access to things growing up while his cousin was spoiled, as well as being treated poorly and being bullied by cousin should have made for a different Harry. At least in my opinion.

** For all that is an amazing character, Harry James Potter is also extremely unrealistic. He has next to no major negative effects from his treatment at the dursleys save an implied difficulty realizing his own value, and even that is uncertain. It's kind of the point of him, an allegory for self determination despite ones circumstance, especially when one considers the similarities between his and Voldemort's childhoods, but it is also extremely unrealistic. The abuse by the dursleys was rather horrific, originally due to the almost cartoony style of the series and "evil step-parents" trope Rowling used, and eventually Rowling toned down the abuse once she started making the books more serious, but the abuse from before remained. If Harry were a real person he likely would have grown up as either an almost always silent hyper-meek hyper-skittish person with so self esteem and a (literally) neurotic need to please people as a self protection mechanism, or as a reckless rage filled rebel constantly seeking out the most extreme forms of rebellion he could regardless of consquences while at the same time suffering from horrific depression either way. All in all he is highly unrealistic, but I honestly would not have wanted Rowling to create a realistic story with the world she put Harry in.

** Most likely he doesn't really get that it's a thing.

He never had money before, but now he does. More than he can count. The problem arises from 2 points.

A. He hasn't been raised in money so now having it and being able to acces it whenever he likes isn't something he knows. He most likely doesn't see it's worth for what it is. Notice how he also hardly ever buys anything with it. The only two things I remember were the magic binoculars and a ton of sweets. He never gets anything else beyond his school supplies.

B. (This is the most crucial one) To him it might not be money.

He's first off muggle raise, he had spent the formularise years of his life with real money, Muggle money. That's money to him. But then he finds out he's a wizard and they use these big gold and silver coins to pay for everything. He likely doesn't treat it as a proper currency. He doesn't know too.

The best example would be in game currencies. In a game if you saw a cool suit of amour that you wanted, 9/10 times you would buy it, even if it used up all of your saved currency. But if you ever thought about doing that in the real would it would be impossible for you to do, you would never spend it all, because it's real. Harry might perceive wizard currency the same way we might view V-bucks or credits in our favourite game.

***** I wouldn't say giving someone you live with your credit card is at all comparable to giving someone your vault key - not in 2020.

I can check all my banking details 24/7 on my phone. I could literally monitor in real-time what anyone I gave my credit card to was spending and report it as fraud with the tap of a button. Online banking has been a thing for a fair few years now.

Despite copious fanon on Gringott's statements we have no canon evidence of them existing. Logically they probably do, but otherwise it seems like you're responsible for knowing how much is in your vault and not giving your key to people. (also, Harry doesn't give his key to Molly on screen, she just has it and she doesn't give it back on screen either)

Frankly it's more like giving someone the card linked to your savings/debit account and your pin number and telling them to go get cash out for you. If you couldn't get to the bank to check your balance (back before online banking was a thing) and you weren't sent a statement then you wouldn't know how much they'd taken until it was way too late.

Molly doesn't provide receipts so she could have got out more gold than she needed, bought some things and pocketed the rest (I'm not saying she /did/, just that the action of doing so appears to be /possible/). We have no indication that Gringotts can track money after it's been withdrawn or magically ensure that it's handed to someone other than the person who got it out of the vault.

And if you've got a big old pile o' gold like Harry does, would he /notice/ the difference. Maybe, maybe not.

****** I don't think how much effort it is to check really matters as long as it's not /super/ prohibitive. I choose to assume that Goblins do keep track of how much gold they pay out to their customers. Harry would likely have to go to Gringotts and ask for the documents in person, which would take effort, but is still very much doable.

I also don't quite see the difference between shopping with my credit card and withdrawing money from my savings account. I can see the balance of my account just as easily as that of my credit card, and before online banking it was just as hard. And the limit on my credit card is probably higher than the daily withdrawal limit on my bank account.

But let's say I would only notice the next time I check my bank account, and let's say because of the effort involved in that I only do that once every few months. Let's further assume that whoever I give my card to doesn't take the entirety of my money, because if they did I would notice it immediately the next time I try to use my card. If I give the card to a random stranger, then of course finding out they stole from me a few months later is too late. But if it is someone I have a personal relationship with, someone I trust, then a few months are hardly too late. They can't really disappear from my life in those few months, and even if they did, that would likely hurt them more than taking a few hundred bucks from my account would hurt me.

Similarly, Harry noticing a year or two later that the Weasleys once stole from him is hardly too late. Unless they emptied his entire vault, which he would likely notice and which would probably have severe legal consequences (and Gringotts would gladly provide testimony for that, because the alternative is that someone broke into their vault and stole the gold), he would not be meaningfully (economically) damaged by the theft. Meanwhile, the consequence for the Weasleys might be that he stops being their friend and considering how generous he is, his friendship is worth more than the few Galleons they could steal from him.

Regarding the key and who has it at any time, I believe JKR just completely forgot about the existence of Gringotts keys whenever they aren't mentioned in the text.

The difference is more that you've got time before you have to pay off a credit card to discover and contest the unexpected money loss. But also, they /have/ to tell you what your balance is every month because they need you to pay it. You can flag it as fraud and, worst case, pay the absolute bare minimum monthly payment to get yourself more time to fight for your money back.

If your savings account gets cleaned out in cash, you've lost all your money and you're kind of screwed.

Now, theoretically, UK banks (obviously muggle UK banks but still) will refund money stolen by fraud /unless/ they deem the customer to have been 'grossly negligent' (or is a fraudster trying to scam the bank) which can include never giving out your pin number.

The other thing is that Harry doesn't actually go and see his vault...at all for the rest of the books. Mrs Weasley gets money out for him in GOF and also does his shopping for him, his shopping is again done for him in OOTP, Bill gives him a sack of gold in HBP and then there's obviously only the Gringotts break in in DH.

******* I don't think you realize how controlling dumbledore and the other adults we're over Harry. He couldn't even write his friends, let alone be in charge of his vault. When did he EVER have a chance to go to greenhouse, buy a better trunk that could fit EVERYTHING HE OWNED.

With the fantastic be stories we realize that we think could have trunks where you can fit everything in it. You could even live in them.

Is completely unreasonable that Harry would not have one of these. He didn't rely on the diskettes for anything. He didn't trust the adults (even Molly), bc of how controlling and dismissive they were.

Nobody TAUGHT Harry ANYTHING about how to function in the wizarding world. Other children do not count.

*** Yes, I have. Usually, fics that have an actual war. Or motivated Harry.

I wish that if JK wanted the weasleys in harry's life it had been the twins he befriended not Ron. I don't have anything against Ron but he has so much influence over Harry that harry essentially loses his ambition to succeed. Remember he's a Slytherin, not Gryffindor.

At the beginning he was so curious about magic then he just... Stagnates. Which doesn't make sense. He was supposed to be the other side if Tom Riddles's coin. Harry had power, similar childhoods, etc. But the difference was that he chose to be good.

It doesn't make sense that Harry wouldn't spend more time learning about magic. 1. A dark lord is after him. 2. Magic could do a lot of his work for him 3. He was very interested in DADA. 4. Being able to magic would be a little kids dream come true.

** Also, he became rich at 11, which is still very young. He never went without due to lack of money -- he went without due to lack of love and support. I think a lot of money hoarding steams from not having enough and always having to stress about money. He doesn't get nice things, not because of a lack of financial security from the Dursleys (see Dudley's extravagant birthdays and Christmases), but from being told he's not worthy or deserving of these things. Money hoarding comes from not having enough to meet your needs, stupid spending comes from wanting /things/ you can't have - neither of which Harry experienced. I feel like if Ron were to suddenly come into a pile of money he'd blow through it in a year, whereas his parents would hoard.

Then he becomes best friends with Ron, who has all the love but no money and as Harry spends time with the Weasleys he sees that it's people that make him really happy.

I really think his attitude to money is done quite well. It's just a non issue for him. He goes off to school where all his needs are met at the age of 11, then has summers off where he doesn't spend his time wanting /things/, perse, but he longs for his friends. Then when he spends time with Ron and co, he's jealous of their relationships and love, not their things.

Additionally, we do see him sort of want to spend on stupid things in the beginning-- in the first book he wants a solid gold cauldron. Then he just buys what he wants -- GOF occulometers or whatever they're called

Even children from well off families don't really start to have access to their own money until 11-12. Sure some get an allowance, but really how much money would a middle class family give their kids between the ages of 7-11? As someone who grew up dirt poor until I was 12 and then my dad went off to work oil in Qatar and set us up with pretty much unlimited checking accounts, I did pretty much the same thing. Bought an iPhone 3 and spent a stupid amount of money on a pair lululemon pants. Then the novelty of having money wore off and aside from paying for the occasional meal out with friends, I never really spent money on stuff I didn't need until I was an adult.

He's never had much which is personally his and he clearly cares fairly deeply for certain things, but he's also never been in a situation where money mattered to him. His is, in general, an attitude of "you don't actually need that much" or "X is enough".

** One thing to consider is that some of the most generous people with their possessions are the homeless, because they know what it is to be without and want to help their fellow homeless when they can, both so they get help when available and so ease suffering. The most miserly tend to be those who have a lot of money.

Harry grew up effectively homeless (while he had a roof, he often went without food and anything that he got was often taken from him or he only had what was deemed to be trash by the Dursleys). It is not surprising that he would see Ron, another who was not well off, and be willing to help him out financially if he was able.

Who do you assume wants to steal from Harry?

1. Dumbledore? He's a very prestigious man, holds three very prominent positions, one of which in a world government, and is a very universally admired academic. He doesn't need to steal, and he wouldn't steal because of his morals.

2. Hagrid? He's too kind-hearted for that, and he lives as he does freely. You think Dumbledore didn't offer him a place in Hogwarts itself when he was hired as groundkeeper? Even Filch lives in the castle. No, Hagrid is fine with his life as is.

3. The Weasleys? While I admit it's kinda weird that they had his key, they are too stubborn to steal. The money would be good to them, yes, but they aren't thieves.

I think you've dived too deep into fanfiction, friend.

** I imagine he's not possessive because he didn't want to end up like Duddle. He never had anything of his, so whenhe discovers he has a shit ton of money, he wants to spend a lot on himself (hagrid has to stop harry from buying a lot of useless things in diagon alley in 1st year), and when he meets rpn, who's basically the first nice person to him, and discovers Ron doesn't have a lot of money and possessions, I think he sees himself in the weasleys and want to share what he has with them. The weasleys accept Harry in their life without batting an eye, they're one of the few people who showed him love and treat him like family. It's not strange to give a member of your family access to your bank account, especially when there's a threat directed at you and you can't leave the house (in this pandemic I'm the only one in my family going to banks, so I'm managing the bank accounts of everyone who lives in my house, and that's commom for a lot of people). Harry's not greedy, he doesn't aspire to be rich, he just want to be loved (which the weasleys do) and make a name for himself, outside his history with voldemort and his parents. He's not moved by money, so I don't think it's weird he doesn't count every knut in his account, especially when people close to him doesn't have that luxury and he have the means to help them.

I'm sorry your father had to go though this, but it's important to remember that every person process traumas in different ways. My mom and dad both grew up in a very similar enviroment: big family, lived im a farm, they produces what they ate, so there was not a lot of variety, they'd both would spend weeks eating the same thing, meat was only for special occasions, they each had 2 paira of clothes and 1 paur of shoe, stuff like that. They never went hungry, but they didn't have the money to spend with anything. My mum is really organized financially, knows where every cent was spent, has a spreadsheet to compare the balance between months, meanwhile my dad would spend all his income in one day with frivolous things if he could. Every person is different, they have different ambitions, goals, and values, and those things are what guide our decidions and the way we act.

** As someone who grew up extremely poor and all my friends are extremely poor, just because some people react a certain way to money ( ex your dad ) doesn't mean everyone will. Saying he ‘should have' acted any way is not how humans work. I have friends when they get money they are very careful with it, but I've never seen anyone obsessively check on their money as you say, unless they're just making sure they have enough. Heck, many of them usually blow any money they get immediately because they want to treat themselves to things they haven't been able to have, and because they don't know how to manage it, having never had to before. Harry doesn't have much opportunity to do that but he does show examples of this when he gets everything in the snack trolley. I also have other friends that as soon as they get money they treat everyone to dinner, are constantly offering to pay for others, buying little gifts, because they feel guilty for their fortune. I think this would be Harry over anything else.

But to say ‘Harry should have been like this, why wasn't he?' Doesn't make sense, because as mentioned all humans are different and react differently. Just because your father reacted one way doesn't mean everyone is going to.

** The main reason why Molly has an access to Harry vault is because, when she wrote the books, Rowling thought as an author and not as a psychologist, (and even that is up to debate since some "poor" people does become really generous when they gain access to money).

When Rowling wrote these scenes, she didn't think "/Wait, Harry should be possessive of his money and would never let someone else have access to his vault/", she thought : "/I already foreshadowed all the revelants informations for the plot, so rather than wasting a whole chapter for a shopping trip, I'll have Molly do it off screen, and to do Harry shopping, she need to use his vault/".

Also, Canon clearly say that the only reason why Harry does not share his vault with the Weasleys is because he knows that they would refuse anything looking like charity (this is also why the whole "*Dursley teamed up with Dumbledore to steal my vault*" trope is stupid.

** His trust was never betrayed in that manner.

Harry is just a kid who had at least one attempted murder on his life every year since age 11. He had an abused, isolated childhood. He spent most of the books still being abused and being alienated and/or isolated. The only people who he trusted enough to count on were were also children.

He went directly from having no money into not having to worry about it. Money issues were never visibly displayed in the Dursley household. He'd have no concept of how money works or the consequences of trusting the wrong person with it.

He doesn't even really know what someone being a financial burden means. Being told he was a burden burden would just mean that if he got something, he didn't deserve it. He never saw the Dursleys struggle with money. Burden would have been the loudest word there and it would have been defined by what he saw vs how he was treated.

Harry never felt financially poor. Harry just saw people with money never give him anything. If he wanted a toy, it was you don't deserve it. Dudley deserves it. “Love” was the currency there.

Harry is a good, sweet kid who was busy fighting against people constantly trying to either murder him or torture him.

If he buys something for someone or gives them money, it's because he cares.

**** Harry Potter didn't care about money because it couldn't and didn't give him anything he actually wanted.

“Harry never felt financially poor” means that he didn't suffer because of poverty. The Dursley's had money. He was a person they didn't want so he was punished for existing.

Harry Potter was told he was being a burden. Harry Potter wasn't being a burden. He was The Burden.

He didn't have things because his Aunt and Uncle told him they didn't deserve them.

*Money didn't give Harry Potter anything he wanted. Money wasn't why anything bad happened to him.

When he got stuff, it meant someone cared about him. That's what he wanted the most.

** I don't think Harry was really given much time to actually spend it. The only time he left the Dursleys was to buy school supplies and go to Hogwarts, and for the entire school year he couldn't really leave the grounds to visit Diagon Alley or Gringotts, so he was never given any chance to spend the cash and let it sink in that he was rich.

And even then, where would he keep the stuff he bought if he DID go crazy buying all the things he wanted? The Dursleys would either confiscate, destroy or give the non-magical stuff to Dudley, and probably assign Harry more chores as punishment for "wasting money on people [Harry] who don't deserve it"

Everything bad happens to him (for plot reasons, but still) and he never reacts, he only tries to deal with it as best he can. Some of my favourite fanfics are where he ends up in a hopeless/ridiculous situation and just gives up and leaves.
