Hi guys! So uh, I had this stupid idea featuring Oliver and Company, where Harry, Hermione or even Ron. (For some reason? I really dig the idea of The Weasleys taking in the streetwise crew.) Discovering them.

Would be awesome if they could talk.

Would this sound like something you guys would read?

Just curious! Might actually try n write it.
