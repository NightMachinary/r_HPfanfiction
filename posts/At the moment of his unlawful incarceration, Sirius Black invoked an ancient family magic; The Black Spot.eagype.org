*A magic as old as the Black family, born before the bigotry and madness inherent to purebred lines. The Black Spot marks those who have wronged the Black family with a spot on their wand-hand, who's size and darkness shows the severity and willingness of the individuals actions. And, visible only to the Black family and those who know of the Spot, it will mark the individual, or individuals, as deserving of righteous revenge, and having not yet received their revenge. Once Sirius and Harry meet, Sirius tells Harry about the Spot and other family Magics as Harry is his heir. And in a bid to gain the freedom of the last vestige of his family, Harry reveals this information. And now a fair bit of the British wizarding populace are aware that a horrible injustice has been wrought on Sirius Black. Maybe Harry's pleas for the man's innocence are the muttering of a confounded child after all?*

Luckily, as only he and Sirius can reveal this information, knowledge of the Black Spot in the general populace will die out with Harry's generation and the status quo of the Back Spot will return.

Basically; a direct descendant of the Black family (Sirius, his father, grandfather, and son/heir) acknowledges that they have been truly and deeply wronged by a person or group of people get a mark visible only to the black family or those who are aware of the magic, such as a spouse. Much like the fidelius, only the head, past head, and heir can speak of the Spot. And only a family member who is within four generations of the head are considered â€˜family' by the magic. So Draco, who's Mother's Father was the brother of the head can see it, as would his son, but not his grandson. (This way it isn't visible to everyone and their mother due to inbreeding)

If a member of the black family sees the mark they will be mildly compelled to act on it. They won't be /forced/ to do anything, but there will be a persistent dislike of this person until they are dealt with.

After being incarcerated Sirius casts the Black Spot, Bagnold, Crouch, Pettigrew, and everyone involved with getting him in Azkaban gets a Spot. The guards get a small, pale grey spot as they were very willing to imprison him but they were just doing their job and thought he was a sentenced criminal. Crouch and Bagnold who had him imprisoned without trial get a medium, black spot as they willfully imprisoned without trial, possibly as a political ploy. Pettigrew gets the worst of it with a spot slightly smaller than his palm and as dark as vanta black as it was his willful, premeditated actions led to his imprisonment. And anyone who was aware he wasn't a death eater/didn't kill Pettigrew get a medium to large spot that's a few shades lighter than black as they have information that could end the injustice inflicted on Sirius, but they choose not to. Among these people are Narcissa and Belletrix, Lucius, Voldemort, and the other inner circle who would've been aware of Sirius had joined their cause. As you might imagine this causes some friction between Narcissa, Draco, and Lucius.

Of course, this is just how I see it working, if you've got a better take on the mechanics of the Black Spot I'd love to see a story with it!


** Wow!

Very detailed and actually original.

Personally I would add the idea of a countdown, the more time someone has a Black Spot, the more magic is taken from them slowly killing them. This would only apply to the one who asked for it (In this case Sirius) so he would have to work swiftly to get revenge or suffer consequences, so by the time he gets out in POA he doesn't use much magic.

Also Sirius should have a mark on his body to signal that he did it, and the antagonists could be guessing who put the Black spot on them. This could lead to more Black family members from outside the UK entering and Sirius having to play a double role, not knowing about the Spot but acting upon it like a Vigilante.

The main antagonist in this would be Pettigrew, I would make him more adept to make things more fair. Have him learn more darker magic and bc he spent a lot of time as a rat he has supernatural reflexes and is fast(?)

And Dirius cannot die until all the black Spots on those who wronged him are dead. So Sirius rushes to kill someone and gets his ass handed to him.

To me at least this would create character growth for Sirius, to learn from his previous life and have him switch to a more political and vigilante opponent.

I would also scrap the Heir bit, I like it but I dont think Harry should be involved much. He should be involved but Sirius doesn't tell him the revenge plot of the Spot and slowly as Sirius delves into more moral dilemmas Harry should leave Sirius and Sirius would re evaluate his choices.

Personally that's how I would structure a fic based of your prompt, and Sirius dying at the end but him leaving everything to Harry. The end would be Harry putting a Black Spot on Voldemort who kills Sirius...

Voilla!!!
