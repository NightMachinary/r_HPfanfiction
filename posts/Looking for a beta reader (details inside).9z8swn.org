Hey all,

I'm looking for a beta reader for my Chessmaster series linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight; The Chessmaster: Black Bishop). I'm nearly done with the third in the series, and the total word count is currently sitting at about 175k. It's a planned seven-year series (I have fourth year completely planned and am starting to plan fifth year), that is a political AU with Harry, Ron, and Hermione all in Slytherin.

My grammar tends to be fairly good, and I'm looking for a beta to double check grammar and check for general flow of chapters. I'm also looking for someone who can help ensure that I don't open up any plot holes.

If you're interested, please dm me and answer the following questions:

- your experience as a beta

- why you are interested

- your familiarity with the Chessmaster series


** Hey can I just mention that I love your stories!

  Chessmaster Volume II. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons.
