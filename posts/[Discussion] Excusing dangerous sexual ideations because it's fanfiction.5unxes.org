A lot of pairings, however cracky sometimes, tend to be incredibly inappropriate and rife with incest and adult x child or child x child interactions. Examples are preteen fredxgeorge, snapexhermione (underage), harryxsirius, etc. I find these incredibly disturbing and basically entry level child porn that people find easy to excuse because it's "just a story" and "no one's getting hurt" (as if the predilection isn't what's fucked up). Do we have a responsibility as fans to self police and rail against these fictional abuses? I obviously have a very set opinion about it, but I think it's an important question to ask. At what point does fanfiction encroach on dangerous territory?

EDIT: Reading all the different viewpoints on censorship, cathartic release, etc. has been wonderful, particularly with so many amazingly well thought out posts. Censorship is certainly not the aim, though. Conversation is!

No, at the very least because you have no idea what mindframe the author is writing from. I've written some of these stories, I ship Harry/Sirius (these days, mostly in a time-travel context, I'll admit). There's a HUGE difference between content that glamourises and glorifies these things, and that which treats them as the horror they are. I am a survivor of CSA, and my writing was massively therapeutic for me.

In addition, attempts to censor this sort of content have gone poorly in fandom. This is how LiveJournal's DeleteGate started, and the beginning of the end of LJ's place as the main hub of fandom activity. Unfortunately, it was far too broad a stroke, and the private journals of actual survivors got caught up in the banwave. This is a massive part of why AO3 exists today--the argument that ALL fanworks have a right to exist, regardless of whether they contain what some may consider objectionable content.

There is a much-derided (at least on this subreddit) phrase that comes to mind, as to what you should do when you find one of these fics: Don't like, don't read. Don't support authors and artists who make content you object to. Don't send them reviews, don't leave Kudos, don't read their work. Support the creators who make stuff you DO enjoy. Most will be discouraged by the lack of response, and some may stop creating or otherwise move on.

Whether that's a good thing for the fandom is of course a matter of personal opinion.

*** I really really appreciate your nuanced response.

I think as recommenders or reviewers we have a responsibility to mention when an author or story doesn't seem to be handling things appropriately. We can't know where they're coming from, which is why I'm not a fan of call-out culture, but if the nuance isn't coming across, it might not matter to a casual reader that the author was victimized.

Yes, if most people see twincest, they can just choose not to avoid it, but you can necessarily tell ahead of time how the author will handle rape as a plot device.

Our culture rails against censorship, but I think we're overdue for a discussion and some serious scholarly research about how media consumption affects us. People are terrible at separating themselves from the narrator and maybe authors should voluntarily modulate their work in light of that. Some pedophiles sympathesize with Nabokov's Humbert Humbert at one extreme, but a lot more people are unable to totally reject Humbert's perspective and think Lolita was manipulative or acted sexually precious or whatever.

**** This is probably going to get long, and I'm not terribly sorry about that. So for ease of reading, I'm going to address your points individually. Also, my perspective is not without bias: I work in the gaming industry, and obviously that will colour my views. In addition, I've been in HP fandom for close to 20 years, so some of my thinking may well be dated. Caveat lector.

Should all stories always make an attempt to handle things appropriately, then? Who determines what appropriate is? A male survivor, a female survivor, someone with a heavy social justice background, a Supreme Court judge, a congressman--all of these will have a different view on what is appropriate. The US attempts to legislate obscenity, but it remains a movable benchmark. Are stories that are intended to be solely pornographic exempt from this 'appropriate handling' issue?

Taking your example of rape: A man writes a fanfic from the aggressor's point of view, let's say Draco and Hermione, just to put some names on things. It's clearly purely sexual fantasy on his part. A woman writes a fanfic from the victim's point of view, let's say Dolohov and Hermione this time. Once again, it's very clearly pure sexual fantasy. Is one of these things more appropriate than the other? Is it more appropriate, or less, if Hermione is the aggressor and Draco the victim? Does it change if it's Bellatrix and Hermione, or Voldemort and Draco? Is it different if these are all original characters, and the site of publication is, let's say, Letters to Penthouse?

Porn isn't less valid literature, and people need a place to play with sexual fantasies that are otherwise inappropriate or taboo. Which leads us into the second point.

The main misstep here is to take all media as a whole. The underlying point is good, but each category of things will have to be studied separately; there's a world of difference between reading a drabble on the internet and spending 10 hours a day playing Call of Duty. However, it also needs to be considered that consuming certain forms of media which depict inappropriate behaviours may actually make it LESS likely that people will engage in those behaviours afterwards. It's far more socially acceptable to vent my frustrations about my Very Noisy Neighbours by shooting up the opposing team in Overwatch than by shooting up my neighbour, and a game of Overwatch (like most competitive shooters) has tangible and emotional rewards that positively reinforce using it in that manner--not to mention which the Most Dangerous Game definitely applies, as it's far more satisfying to win against people who fight back.

In terms of how this relates to fanfic, pedophilia, and online communities, Dusk Peterson has addressed this in some of their writings far better than I ever could. The [[http://www.duskpeterson.com/master/index.htm#unmasked][Unmasked stories]] are based in RL events. [[http://www.duskpeterson.com/obligations.htm][Their essay on the ethical obligations of fiction authors]] is also relevant.

Regarding Humbert Humbert and the Lolita Problem, I'd argue that that's not so much a difficulty of separating themselves from the narrator specifically as a problem of modern culture generally. After all, people seem to have little trouble realising that the narrator of The Great Gatsby is unreliable. The attitude that 'she was asking for it,' even when the girl in question is underage, remains prevalent. Men who cheat continue to have been 'tempted' by faithless women. We are not Humbert Humbert, but we made him, and we continue to validate his existence.

***** Continuing this in a part 2.

The reader of Lolita is supposed to, on some level, identify with Humbert Humbert; this is the purpose of making him the narrator. It's a social commentary, and one is intended to recognise these problems in our culture and ourselves. The problem with this is that we only see the world through Humbert's eyes, we only see Lolita through Humbert's eyes. To him, she is manipulative. This is the perspective the publishing industry grants us. Published literary fiction massively skews towards the perspective of the straight white male protagonist.

Fanfiction is by its very nature subversive literature. Fandom is dominated by amateurs, unpublished writers, many of whom are women, queer, not white. There is already a form of censorship at work, even if it's merely passive, in the low representation of these voices in published literature. Fanfiction gives Lolita her voice. What happened to her is wrong, but that doesn't give us the right to tell her it didn't happen, and that talking about it is ALSO wrong. This is how more people end up hesitant to report rape. It stops becoming a thing that can happen to anyone, and by extension, it becomes somehow the fault of the victim.

Discussions of rape fantasy are already taboo. Discussions of consensual sexual violence (BDSM) were taboo, until Fifty Shades of Grey brought that set of kinks into very public eye. Where did Fifty Shades of Grey start, you ask? Twilight fanfic. Fanfic has turned into the way we talk about things we're not supposed to talk about.

In this era of political conservatism and increasing government control of media, we need more of that, not less.

Take incest. In the majority of the western world and half of the USA, first cousins having sex with each other is not seen as incest and perfectly legal. Yet people regularly complain about incest if a story here features that. Which rule should be followed?

Take underage sex (for non-explicit stories, not smut). Which is the age of consent? 14? 15? 16? 17? 18? The majority of Europe has an age of consent of 14 to 16, for example. The United Kingdom's age of consent is 16, for example. And in Wizarding Britain, you're an adult with 17, so that's the bare minimum for age of consent - it may be lower.

The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender. The term age of consent rarely appears in legal statutes. Generally, a law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity ...

Correlation is not causation. There is a known (and arguably higher) correlation between violence and other social factors--mental health status, income level, family involvement. And as I replied to another commenter above, many violent video games (or at least, the largest ones--MOBAs, shooters, MMOs alike) attempt to incentivise using them as an outlet for violent behaviour rather than RL, through competitive play, encouraging teamwork, obvious victory conditions, and rewards both tangible and emotional. Their intent is obviously not to prevent RL violence, but to encourage players to keep playing, but it does have some of the same results.

My entire being is adamant that this is not harmless and that it can be incredibly insidious, fueling fantasies and material for the fantasies of future abusers.\\
There are, of course, exceptions to every rule. I wouldn't for example condemn the book Flowers in the Attic for it's depiction of rape, incest, and underage sex. It had it's place, it meant something. I understand the cathartic release it can give victims of these acts and that it's important to express these realities in all forms of media, so of course I don't think you can blindly say that because it has that content that it's evil or detrimental. I think everything, in every aspect of life, should be taken on a case by case basis.

** I'm not a proponent of incest, but I have difficulty finding a moral objection towards it as long as pregnancies are avoided.

Underage sex can be problematic if it is pornographic (for the sexual gratification of the audience or authors), but stories who treat anyone below 18 as asexual are equally as disturbing. IMHO teenage sexuality (in this context I mean ages 13-18) can be done in a tasteful way and can be important for the story and characters, but depending on your cultural context it may always be disturbing no matter how it is executed (from a biological standpoint this seems more abnormal than acknowledging it, but whatever).

Also stories should be able to address ethically objectionable relationships (like abuse of a Teacher/Student relationship, etc...). I'm personally not interested in reading stories that glorify this and there seems to be a consensus (at least in this subreddit) concerning this viewpoint.

A part of your comment seems to touch on the topic of something I like to refer to as "Democratic Censorship" which isn't much better than censorship by the state. Public opinion is not a reliable measure for what should be protected as art.

If you consider fanfiction as being able to be porn, then wouldn't you have to consider these graphic fics as such? Then, building on this, how do you proceed? Would you not take it down?

** We shouldn't police stuff, regardless of our own opinions on whether it's fucked up or not - literature as a medium is one of the only ones that isn't heavily censored, and as a result has both the good and the bad that that entails, i.e. disturbing or otherwise morally questionable content.

If the choice is between none of that but actually vetting things like fanfiction, and just letting it be a free-for-all and letting the chips fall wherever, I'm inclined to support the latter.

I just tend to turn off of stories that include sexual content I find objectionable - Twincest is a resolute no for me, as I'm a twin myself and it offends me more deeply than other stuff. Honestly, most depictions of twins (mental-twin-speak and shit like that) in fanfiction make me /very/ angry.

That said, you're entitled to your own opinions, but likewise so is everyone else - if you want to avoid content like you've described, the far easier and in my opinion more generally right thing to do is just pay attention to what you read yourself, and turn away from things you might find offensive, rather than make a concerted effort as a community to purge certain points-of-view.

** No, we don't have any obligation to self police or rail against "abuses". Cultures, thoughts, and opinions on how things should be vary wildly from person to person, and group to group.

I think that you should censor yourself, rather than try to censor everyone else. If you don't want to read stories containing incest, or other acts which may be offensive to you, then don't. Censoring such content encroaches upon dangerous territory, if the media out there is any indication. Encouraging mob mentality will lead to further problems down the road. Once the "mob" eliminates these kinds of stories from fanfiction, what will they do next? Will they settle down, as their mission would be concluded, or will they mob after another aspect of FF they do not like?

Don't like? Don't read. It is the easiest and most peaceful solution, which will avoid needless confrontation.

******* I agree with you, if I'm understanding what you're saying. The problem that I /may/ have with these types of "thought crimes", as you call them, actually stems from a question that I've never been able to find the answer to. Quite simply, can written work help to stop physical altercations, or does it act as a gateway for escalation. Let me explain. First, I was a victim of childhood sexual abuse. My step-father went to jail for eight years, and I have absolutely no contact with him now. But I always wonder if it was just me. No other victims came forward when he was arrested, he claims that I was his only victim, and I hope that that is the truth. But what it he doing now? He's free, walking the streets. Even if I was his only victim in the past, does he still have those desires? And assuming he does, what is he doing about them? Personally, I would *MUCH* rather he read some kiddie porn abuse fics on ao3 than go out and find another young girl to abuse. But as someone who doesn't have those desires, I honestly don't know if reading about them would be satisfying or frustrating. I don't know if it would decrease the urge to find a victim, or increase the desire to play out the story in real life. I just don't know. If it's the former, then I am /all for it/. Read to your heart's content. Write to your heart's content. Anything that will keep another potential victim safe. If it's the latter... Well... The problem that I see is that it's probably a mix of both. There are probably some people who can read about it and choose not to actually do anything, while there are probably others who use the fics as foreplay. I don't think there is a good answer.

** I'm much more tolerant of these things in fanfiction mainly because adults tend not to write underage sex scenes and glorify them. Even if they do, there are still degrees of objectionableness due to differing cultures and laws. To me, two 14-year-olds having sex is not really bad in fanfiction, because that's something teenagers do in real life, and it's something a 14-year-old author might want to write about. In any case, I'm just not interested in reading it.

What adult readers don't always take into account is the age of the author. Underage authors have sexual fantasies of their own, and may not be aware of how adult readers would receive their stories. For them, I think fanfiction is a healthy outlet for sexual expression with privacy. It's a hell of a lot better to write about weird sex than try it IRL without taking proper precautions. It would be wrong to deny them this outlet.

Dangerous territory would involve real people as characters and a predatory nature to the writing. If the author uses their writing as a platform for inciting violence, that is dangerous and should be reported. Likewise, writing that targets a specific person the author knows for bullying. I've never seen anything remotely dangerous in fanfiction, however.

If you think this is the "worst" the internet has to offer...you're seriously mistaken. At abolutely worst, it's a wank story about fictional characters doing sexual things to other fictional characters. They don't exist in real life. They're not real, just as the people you kill in video games don't exist either. Now if it was a wank fic about Emma getting tag teamed by Rupert and Daniel, complete with 'shopped pics of them getting it on, yeah the creep factor would be /much/ higher, but that's not the point.

** So I won't bother writing an essay about this but just take it as bullet points. A good few of those that have already answered have hit on a lot of my views already.

Sexual content: If characters are at the age of consent in their country/world. Though subtracting two years depending on how low/high it is can be reasonable.(My middle school science teacher pointed out that the early debutants could be as early as that)

Incest: If consensual, sure. As stated, there are places where first cousin incest is legal, even in the west.

Underage: As in a 14-year-old Hermione X Snape, no. Two consenting underage characters? Yes.

But as stated by [[/u/padfootprohibited][u/padfootprohibited]] when one posts on AO3, tag things correctly! It's a bummer to try and eliminate what you don't want to read, but you still end up with what you don't want to read because as an example:

I don't read slashfiction, sorry, not sorry. That's not my cuppa tea. So I just search for F/M, multi and Gen fics. But as one background pairing is F/M it still shows M/M fics :/

Second, I think stories/chapters that are intentionally depicting unhealthy/abusive/whatever relationships should come with a note, stating that while it's perfectly fine to read/fantasize about that pairing or act, it's not a portrayal of a healthy relationship between two consenting adults.

On the other hand, however, I can't get away from the fact that there's quite a lot of rape in published fiction (off the top of my head: "Girl Who Played With Fire/, *The Windup Girl/, /Pillars of the Earth/, pretty much every Neal Stephenson I've read, /Deerskin/, "Beloved/, *Go Ask Alice/, some 80s romance novels, etc.) and in terms of sexual exploitation of children you can definitely add /Brave New World/ to the obvious /Lolita/ (for general teenage sex shenanigans there're whole "young adult"/"new adult" genres).

To your second point, I think things start getting a bit fuzzier with the "captured by deatheaters"/"soulbonded" tropes and worse in situations like the /Twilight/ series (where people seem to be split along a stalking/"true love" divide). I appreciate it when people warn when a relationship/character is awful but I believe people can have very different ideas about what a healthy relationship looks like so enforcing a warning would be difficult.

Question for you [[/u/narwhalnel--how][u/narwhalnel--how]] do you feel about fic where Snape is having sex with young Hermione and then surprise! Hermione wakes up from one of Fred and George's patented day dream charms? Or Fred and George are having sex, but it's really Lee and George is delusional/roleplaying? If all the stories you find objectional ended with "And then <character> woke up and went down to the Great Hall for kippers with the sense that they just had a really strange dream" would that make things better?

I'm glad that ao3 hosts everything and I say this as someone who never wants to glimpse another A/B/O fic again ever. A "scientific " study of a question on which you have a firm moral opinion leads to fun things like the Eugenics movement and the whole question feels a little like newspeak. Website hosts can decide what they want to allow, but the idea that we should police a community (that we have no authority over and no evidence of wrong doing) for nebulous immoralities seems odd(?) to me.

This is why I said "intentionally depicting". There's some authors that set out to write about an awful relationship (e.g. Nabokov with Lolita) and there's authors that write just what they think is romantic (e.g. Meyer with Twilight - this is just an assumption, but I'm sure there is a book where this is true). I still think that Twilight's love story is problematic, but it probably wasn't written with the intention of exploring flawed characters and a broken relationship. Instead, it was written as a teen romance, suggesting that the behaviour is romantic, not abusive. Technically both would need a warning, but it's absurd to ask for one if the author doesn't view their own work as showing an abusive relationship.

By the way, if you want to ping [[/u/narwahlnel]], you need a space after the username.

** So, this is a little late, but as the age of consent in the UK, where the books are set, is 16, fics with characters of that age get a pass from me.

I myself live in the UK. Due to this being my normal, I find it pretty interesting when US writers treat 16-year-olds like kids or as immature people, or use characters of that age to write fics with a slightly exploitative edge to them.

Presumably US writers see 16 year olds as children that are starting to have some sexual feelings etc. and so are ripe to be characters in exploitative or 'naughty' stories that push the boundary of acceptable. Whereas, UK residents and writers see 16-year-olds as just about adults because by law that is the case.

It's similar to how in the US you aren't able to drink until 21, and your college is just like an extension of school rather than a completely different thing altogether.

** I think it's important to note that the author is creating the whole story of the characters. from the author's perspective, the kid is giving consent and is not being taken advantage of. Maybe the kid is written to have adult level maturity in a childish body. In a fantasy world, if the author says the consent is the absolute god-given truth, then it should be. The author is God of that world. Obviously this is not true in real life, but stories are not real life. Obviously real kids cannot give consent because they are kids with kid level logic and maturity.

I also think these stories tend to be written from the perspective of the young kid authors who think old people are hot and not from old pedos who think kids are hot... A lot of teenage boys write about motherxson where mothers teach their kids how to have sex by practical experience. It's weird but the trope is everywhere and I doubt moms are actually having sex with their kids to teach them?? People just have weird fantasies and to think about something is wayyy different from acting on anything.

For example, i think bestiality in a fic could be OK if the author explicitly shows that the beast has a normal IQ, finds the sexual experience enjoyable, and wants to continue. but in real life, this sureness is impossible, so it's always always rape.

Overall, no matter what, there's no crime because nothing's real... just accept that people have weird fantasies, I think. As long as no real humans are harmed IRL then it's OK. if a teacher jerks off to a student, that's not illegal. It's only horrendous when the harmful fantasies are actually acted upon. But brains cook up weird ideas for many people... Better to just keep those ideas contained to the darker side of the internet.

** I'm a little late to the party, took my time reading all of the responses first. But I really wanted to put in my own two cents. The problem for me is the amount of grey area here. Things that I consider inappropriate may be (and probably are) vastly different from what you consider inappropriate, and probably changes from person to person. For example, at what age is it appropriate to have two fiction characters form an sexually explicit relationship in a story? To use a common pairing, how about Ron and Hermione in 3rd year? 4th? 5th? Not until they've graduated? I personally don't like anything below 15 years old, but that is actually 4th year for Hermione, and 5th year for Ron. So what about Hermione and one of the older Weasley's, George? George is less than two years older than Hermione, at what age would it be appropriate for them to have a relationship? At what age would it be appropriate for the author to write explicit scenes about this relationship?

Going with a different pairing, you mentioned Harry/Sirius. You didn't state what you found inappropriate about this relationship. Are you implying that Harry is underage? If so, at what age would a relationship between Harry and Sirius be no longer problematic? Are you implying that it's inappropriate because Sirius is Harry's Godfather? I didn't grow up in a religious family, so I really don't understand the significance of a Godparent, and thus don't see why the title would preclude a relationship. I doubt this is the case, but is it because it is a slash pairing? If so, what about Hermione/Sirius? Or is it because of the age gap? Is there a point when the age gap becomes less relevant? We know that wizards have longer life spans, so what about a 25yo Harry and a 45yo Sirius? What about Harry/Bill (10 year age gap)?

And then you have the issue of magic... You've got time travel. If Hermione travels back in time and gets with Sirius when they're the same age, I would assume that isn't a problem. But what is she gets thrown back into the present? Now you have two characters with a 19year age difference in an established relationship. Is that wrong? And you've got Do-Over fics. One of my favourite fics has Hermione thrown out of her time where she lives out 10+ years of her life. Then she's snapped back into her past, a 35yo in a 15yo's body. In that case, what would be more appropriate? A 35yo in a 15yo's body dating other people her physical age, or her mental age? Any way you look at it, there's going to be an age gap, either physically or mentally. Another one of my favourite fics has a Harry that can't die. Every time he died he wakes up as a baby. In the story, he starts an explicit relationship with another character when he's 14yo. But he uses aging potions to appear ~25yo. And mentally he's like 300+... Like I said, massive grey area, lol.

I'd love to hear how you feel about some of these more specific examples...

*** For sure! I'm almost always down to discuss this more, simply because of the massive amount of gray area. The Harry/Sirius bit is with the assumption that this is during their schooling and there are no changes to their age. Godparents...I don't have an issue with other than it being evidence of the age gap. I never have an issue with Harry/Bill, I think because Bill isn't a parental figure or parental alternative. Also, I've never read a harry/bill where harry is still a teen. Half your age plus seven is the rule of thumb for minimum age differences.\\
Time travel is a nonissue in my eyes; you need to ignore the trope and take what they're giving you at face value. Is 35 y/o Hermione in a 15 y/o body going to go around fucking around the castle? Not only would that be OOC, but imho would be borderline inappropriate, especially depending on how the sexual content is handled.\\
BRO I LOVE THAT FIC UR TALKIN BOUT (but i never finished it). I don't find that one problematic until the later chapters, but the author does a good job of addressing discomfort with Harry's young form and using aging potions (which I don't find a problem because of his mental age).\\
I think about 99% of examples will be gray area, but there is a 1% of vile fic out there that excuses disgustingness with it 'not being real' and 'no one getting hurt'. Literature is plenty real and has plenty of impact on the real world.

** I never read fics that have explicit sex scenes before the age of 18. That's my personal opinion and way to go.

When it comes to the question of when it is appropriate to write sex scenes, we have to remind ourselves of two things:

- Amorality can be part of a story.

- Age of consent is different in different cultures.

I'm honestly not sure where to draw the line between "stuff I find in bad taste, but not bad enough to report" and fics that I report for content that steps over a line. For example, "The Real Us" is one of the stories I reported for overstepping the bounds for being just blatant child pornography.

*** Refuting your points in order, just sticking to well-known British people of the era:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John#Sexuality_and_family][No one was really homosexual: Elton John came out as gay in 1988, and started dating his now-husband in 1993.]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall#Relationship_with_the_Prince_of_Wales][No one really practised adultery: Prince Charles and Camilla, now Duchess of Cornwall, were known to lovers in 1980, and likely all through Charles' marriage to Princess Diana.]]

That didn't make these things not scandalous, but in order for something to be a scandal, it has to exist.

It's highly unlikely that the UK would have a high enough contingency for the main character of a novel to be gay.

************** Dumbledore was said to be gay by JK Rowling who was trying to further her liberal agenda at the time. There was no evidence to it other than the author's psudeo-character development in interviews.

The way we make Harry get with Hermione, Daphne Greengrass, Tonks, Luna, etc... is by changing circumstance, is by changing the character Harry is. It's highly likely that Harry would just turn around and say "I don't have time for relationships as I'm more likely to die in this war than not." But naturally, JKR has to further her agenda, and he has to pay more attention to Ginny than he does to training for his upcoming fight with the big-bad. Anything can happen in fanfiction, but if it happens without reason and with no explanation, then it's very badly written. Simply as that.

*********** For one, the word you meant is "bait", not "bate". Spell check is your friend.

You said, and I quote "Elton John is Elton John, he is famous and he has a platform. I doubt any fans of his really cared of his sexual preference. *I mean Adultery as in a younger female student having a relationship with an older male teacher.*"

I then informed you that you were incorrect as Adultery is between someone married and someone not married. Nowhere in that quote did you mention Arthur Weasley or Hermione Granger so how was I supposed to know that was what you meant? I don't read minds.
