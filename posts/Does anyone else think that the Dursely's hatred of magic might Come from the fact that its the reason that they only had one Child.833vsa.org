Does anyone else think that Magic might be the Reason that the Dursely's only have one child?

One of the things that make me think this might be the Case is the way that they indulge Dudley. It just screams of them trying to over compensate for the fact that they cant have another child.

and there Hatred of magic as least in Vernons case seems a bit to personal. for it to just be bleed over from Petunia hatred of magic.


** I just chalk it up to them meeting at one of the sisters' wedding. The Boys got into shenanigans as they are wont to do, and Vernon and Petunia Did Not Approve.

Vernon took the Unnatural route, and Petunia is just her usual envious bitch self, especially since her nephew is more well behaved than her own son.

*** Might Lily's wedding have been attacked by Voldemort and the death eaters?

After all Lily and James marriage would be every thing that the Pure-bloods fear, the only way it could be worse would be for it to be a marriage between a Pureblood and a Muggle.

** I recall that a fic had the wards make Petunia infertile. And that's where their hatred of magic came from. Or at least heightened it.

** Personally, I think Petunia only laid back and thought of England enough times to get Dudley and then she was done. I mean ... Vernon.

*** It takes all kinds to make the world go 'round. It's not as if Petunia was some great prize, either. It always felt to me as if Vernon and Petunia were just mirror-images of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy - they're assholes, but they genuinely love each other.

** I never found Jo's Post story explanation as to why they hate magic as fulfilling.

My head canon is that Death Eaters lead by Snape attacked the Evans home as a way to get back at Lily for choosing Potter. Vernon was over that night and watched as his Mother and Father in Law were Killed and he and his Fiance were tortured. The Order shows up before they can do Petunia and Vernon in permanently in particularly James, Lily and the Marauders and a few others. During the battle Vernon overhears Snape and James arguing. The DEs are driven off and Vernon is sitting there in the burnt out husk of his near wife's childhood home holding his wife after several near death experiences and the entire reason for it happening is standing in front of you.

My head canon of Vernon is someone who hates Harry on Multiple levels, one for being a wizard like the ones who nearly killed him, another for being in particular James and Lily's Son for being the one to drag him into everything and final for being forced to look into the face of the man who he owned his life too, while not enforced by a Life Debt like Wormtail, Vernon is a very proud man and knowing that he owes everyday to some man makes him steam especially since he now has to look at the man's son every day. As for the Normal thing, It didn't matter what he did, he was a normal man not a freak and no matter what he did he would ALWAYS be Normal and Nothing could change that
