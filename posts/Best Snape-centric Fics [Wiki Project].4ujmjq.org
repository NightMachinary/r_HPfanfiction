** *A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles*

*Genre:* drama, tragedy

*Link:* ffn(A Difference in the Family by Rannaro)

*Status*: Complete

*Thoughts*: An extensive expansion of the character from his early days living outside Manchester, through the time of the books and up until his death. The school-age years appear to have been written later as they show a more personal and immersive style, littered with all sorts of real-world touchstones, in particular about the space race. Unapologetically revisionist and pro-Snape, it still draws you in and provides an interesting take on the one of the series' most interesting characters.

*** linkffn(A Difference in the family by Rannaro)

Your description is on point. Just like to link my own review */[[https://redd.it/3paqd5][here]]/* with all the information on it (other sites, a history, etc).

#+begin_quote
  The Snape Chronicles is the most unappreciated fanfic on FFnet, and I'm not just saying that. It takes you from before Snape was born right to his death, and no part is skipped over. Usually any fanfic makes Snape out to be a bitter, petty old man or a romanticized anti-hero, but this fic portays him differently than we usually see. It takes in, not just his wizarding aspect, but the muggle half of Snape as well, with topics like the space race and social issues of northern England. With what little (but yet so much) JK Rowling gives us about Snape, Rannaro fills in everything. Even if you hate Snape (or love him), read it. Keep in mind, this is not just HP book 1-7 in Snape's point of view, it takes a whole lot of time and chapters to even get to Harry's sorting.
#+end_quote

My description / review doesn't give it justice. Just read it!

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** *In which Snape befriends an old grey donkey*

*Genre:* Friendship/Family/Humour

*Link:* linkffn(4903653)

*Status:* One-shot, Complete

*Thoughts About It:* A lovely little story in which Snape accidentally apparates to the 100-acre wood. Set during HP & the Philosopher's Stone, it's a short look at Snape not as a tragic anti-hero, or as an evil murderer, but as a man, written with a very deadpan sort of humour.

** *The Apprentice*

*Genre:* Drama

*Link:* linkffn(6306296)

*Status:* Abandoned

*Thoughts:* The best Snape redo fic I've read. The best part of the story is Snape working in the potions shop as an apprentice; his relationship with Master Jigger is really well done, and Potions as a subject is nicely explored. The story is Snape/Lily as well, but it is not really the focus. Unfotunately abandoned, but there's some really good stuff there.

** *A Dream Carved In Stone*

*Genre:* /Drama/Romance/

*Link:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8134710/1/A-Dream-Carved-in-Stone]]

*Status:* complete

*Thoughts:* It's the only Lily Evans/Severus Snape fic I've ever read, and likely the /only/ one I'll ever read. The writing quality is uniformly excellent, the characterisations are all mostly believable, and it manages to somehow redeem a Snape who is already a Death Eater (albeit slowly and painfully). However, it's been quite a while since I've read this one, and I can't remember many details.

** *I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love*

*Genre:* Drama

*Link:* linkffn(I Know Not, And Cannot Know, Yet I Live and I Love)

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts About It*: Luna/Snape friendship, canon-compliant. The author doesn't shy away from portraying Snape's flaws, and at the same time makes him out to be really human and gives an insight into why he behaves the way he does. The interactions between Luna and Snape are just hilarious (at least in the beginning) and sweet and emotional. Really made me appreciate Luna even though I do not normally care much for her character.

** *Never Say Remember*

Genre: Drama

link: linkffn(3983170)

Status: Complete

Thought: One of the very few fics that has Snape as a believable father figure. It also has the most believable take on Snape/Lily that I've seen; the moral complications involved in that relationship is glorious. The contrast between the Harrys and the Snapes of the two universes is stark, yet they're believably in character.

And Snape discovers that a new Potter has appeared. One who won't leave him alone. Who knows Snape's deepest secret. As both Harrys search for a way home, they begin to question what home really is.

** *Genre:* Angst/Drama

*Link:* linkffn(Stronger than Hope by Alaunatar)

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts:* This is perhaps the only mentor!Snape fic that does not whitewash Snape's character. In this, he is his sarcastic, bitter, self-interested, obsessive and unwholesome self that we see in canon. While it is built on a very angsty Harry background, it is not nauseating, and is relatively plausible.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

  This started out as a crack-fic idea. Then I started writing it, and it decided it wanted to be much more than crackfic---and much, much longer as well!

To the mods for putting such hard work into organising this big bang, with extra special thanks to accioslash for much needed honesty when I was angsting over the ending of this which prompted the brainwave I needed. To my britpicker rycolfan for her reassurance, badgerlady for whipping my typos and M-dashes into shape, and abrae for a fantastic and thorough beta (the semicolon is dead; long live the semicolon!) and her immeasurably kind words. ♥ And last, but not least, to my artist---I hope you've had as much of a blast illustrating this as I have had writing it!A/N 2: Any scenes/dialogue quoted and adapted from the books are JKR's property and used purely for transformative purposes; I lay no claim to them and make no money off them whatsoever.

** *Happiness is a Broken Wand*

Genre: Adventure, Crossover

Link: linkffn(6430570)

Status: Abandoned

Thoughts: A very rare LotR cross which has /actual canon divergence/. As another welcome bonus, it has actual conflict with Snape suffering heavy setbacks. On the flip side... the writing is no more than serviceable, the starting isn't the smoothest, magical cores exist and it is abandoned. Which are some pretty heavy drawbacks, but the positives are pretty huge, and my general feeling after reading it was that of enjoyment, with a familiar tinge of frustration over its abandonment. I would recommend it to those who don't absolutely hate abandoned fics.
