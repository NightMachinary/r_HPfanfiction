** Yeah, but think about how much damage one imperioed saboteur could do. That's not something muggles would have any defense against, and you could effectively turn all their weapons back against them, or use it to undermine them more subtly.

If the muggles had the element of surprise and managed to nuke the right place at the right time, then maybe, but in the long run my money's on the witches and wizards.

(I would totally read this fic, though, as long as it's more than just a fantasy power-wank for one side or the other.)

**** I think they'd be in trouble even with muggleborn help, which I actually think they would get pretty easily. But Voldemort makes a point to distrust/persecute muggleborns, so they wouldn't be able to easily undermine Voldemort the same way a few imperioed spies could undermine the muggles. At best they could maybe mitigate some of the direct damage they could do - set up some anti-apparation wards, stuff like that. But once muggles started killing wizards, I think most of the "centrist" wizards, for lack of a better term, would pile behind Voldemort out of self-preservation, so the muggle-born wizards would be massively outnumbered.

And the muggles' numerical advantage would work against them here, because it leaves so many potential openings for the wizards to take advantage of.

***** If you put a wizard against Muggles, it would just be a slaughter.

I think a motivated wizard only need 3 spells to represent a true risk for a Muggle government :

- *The Apparition charm* : or the capacity to teleport
- *The Imperius Curse* : or the ability to create puppet and pass any defense
- *The Fiendfyre (Curse?)* : or the ability to cause mass destruction

So one common spells that most students learn while still in school, and 2 who seem to be in the standard skill set of Dark Wizards. And with these 3 spells, it's already only a question of time before a country is destroyed, assuming the muggles don't get a lucky shot or something like that.

Once you add other things like the Disillionment Charm (or just an invisibility cloack), brooms and even magical plants like the Mandragores, I just don't see how muggles could win against one (reasonably talented) lone wizards, so if there are several . . .

******* I remember a discussion on this sub about who would win between the Wizards and the Muggles in case of war.

A pro muggle had said that muggles just had to "nukes" the blank zone on a map to kill the Wizards. Even if this method worked (and I'm pretty sure it doesn't), 2 of the 3 biggest wizards locations are in the middle of London. Who would be hurt more in case of a nuke, the people with magical protections potentially able to stop the blast and (more importantly) the ability to teleport far from it, or the guys who just lost their capital and have hundred of thousands of casualities?

******** Yeah, I've seen the “we just nuke the parts we can't see” argument before, but, like, that's not how it works? It's not “we can't draw on this part of the map” it's “we don't notice there's a blank spot”

** Good points all, however, there is no evidence that your average wizard, dark, light, or plaid, is any less arrogant about their superiority over the Muggles than their ancestors.

​

If magic users were going to take over the world, wouldn't they have done it back when all they had to worry about were pointy sticks (swords and spears et al)?

They didn't. In fact, they went as far as to actively start hiding from the Muggles in 1689 under the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. Not in isolated pockets of Britain, either, but 'international' (which I'm assuming meant Europe, but it expanded to worldwide with the passage of time)

The reasoning offered for this was that the Wizards were suffering persecution at the hands of the Muggles, with Nearly Headless Nick being only one of the victims of the skirmishes that lead to the statute.

Sabotage by imperiused victims is certainly a possibility, but militaries are nothing if not adaptable, and while Tom and his buddies think they are all sneaky and terrifying in their bone masks and black robes, your average fireteam would find dealing with them something less than difficult. Remember, most offensive Potter magic can be dodged. An incoming round, not so much. Hell, in a properly set up trap, a decent sniper team could have four or five rounds on target before the Death Eaters have a chance to react to the first head exploding, and all of this is before the Wizards get introduced to the wonderful world of artillery, where your first indication of failure is quite often the world blowing up around you.

No intention toward Muggle Wank here. My position is that the wizards started hiding from Muggles in the 17th century, and when you consider that one of Magical Britain's leading experts on Muggle Technology doesn't understand the purpose of a rubber duck, they haven't kept up with the greater world's progress. It is canon that the bombings of WWII killed lots of Wizards. Why would anyone expect them to fare any better against modern smart munitions?

And more importantly, they don't have the numbers. There is a significant percentage of the human race that would rather die on their feet than live on their knees. Even if the massed forces of the Muggles in the world only managed to kill a single wizard in exchange for a thousand Muggles, the Muggles win.

Wizard populations are tiny, especially if they start 'reeducating' the Muggleborn in 'camps'. JKR's numbers put the worldwide population at less than 10 million. If every wizard fought (a large assumption) they would be bum-rushed by every Muggle (all 6+ billion of them)

*** People often talk about how firearms are faster, but that is extremely reliant on the muggles having the opportunity to hit them. So they have to be having their gun pointed at the wizard, the wizard can't already have a shield up, and the wizard can't know they're there because then he can just disapparate before they pull the trigger. That's very specific.

For one thing, magical settlements are imperceptible to muggles. So they have no way at all of going on the initiative. They can only hope to strike against wizards when those wizards venture out to attack them. That's no way to win a war.

For another, guns were invented before the Statute of Secrecy, and wizards canonically participated in both World Wars at the very least. It is logical to assume they have some countermeasure against guns. Maybe not widely publicly known in times of peace, but after the first time one of them gets shot in the face during a raid I imagine that it'd get dusted off and used again.

It's also worth noting that wizards didn't go into hiding because they were scared of muggles. Remember, they thought muggle attempts to harm them were mostly a joke - witch burnings were something you participated in for a laugh. But it was getting to the point where the muggle population was /so/ hostile that the wizards would have to either conquer them hard, wipe them out, or go into hiding.

In short, they're not hiding for their benefit, they're hiding for ours.

**** There is absolutely no canonical evidence that any wizards shield can stand up to gunfire. If such a shield exists, how long can an individual hold it? How many impacts can it take before it fails? How will a wizard know when to cast the shield spell? None of the shields presented in the Potter books offer 360-degree coverage. You know us Muggles, we found out that standing in neat lines and taking turns firing at each other was a stupid idea centuries ago, we're more than willing to put people behind the wizards to light them up from the rear.

​

I agree the magical places are invisible to Muggles. So, are they invisible to our satellites? I can see cameras, both still and video being susceptible to the charms as they work sort of like the human eye. Satellite cameras, on the other hand, are utterly unlike an eye, scanning in spectrums outside of visible light. Do wizards even know about infrared? It wasn't discovered until well after they went into hiding. But even they do and can shield from satellites and IR scans, I can think of many ways to find the wizards.

​

For example, do a satellite scan of an area and then turn the results over to a computer running mapping software. Look for the wholes in the middle of the data.

​

World leaders know about the wizards. Believing that the world's intelligence agencies haven't managed to find out where they are is laughable. The easiest way? Look for the 11-year-olds who suddenly disappear from school while their family (including siblings) remain.

​

Canon has a single magic-user who thought being burnt for being a witch was fun. It also has Nearly Headless Nick who was quite successfully killed. I imagine nick had somewhat less fun. No one hides for someone else. They hide for themselves.

***** There is absolutely no canonical evidence that those shields /can't/ block bullets. They can stop physical objects, and they can stop directed energy weapons. If you want to make magic piss-weak in your own universe, fine, but there is absolutely nothing to suggest that bullets are superior to fucking magic shields.

You don't understand how anti-muggle spells work. They don't create physical invisibility, they make it so that muggles just don't notice it. Think like in Westworld, how even Hosts who know they are Hosts physically can't perceive things they are programmed to ignore. "Doesn't look like anything to me". The only way they got around that was the programming being removed from them.

Nick was executed by muggles sure, but it was centuries before the Statute and wizards were probably involved in his capture.

****** Wizards have mind control

how can you fight a war against an enemy that can destroy your chain of command like that

a wizard could imperius your leader turn into them with polyjuice

how can you wage a war against an enemy where dave your brother in arms could be one or subverted by one

Wizarding locations are also hidden for muggles, I imagine fighting the wizarding world would be alot like living in the soviet union constant fear because you have no clue who is working for them

***** I mean, there's no doubt that muggles would try everything they can to innovate should it come to open war, and we have a lot of stuff we could try to attempt to circumvent the wizards' protection. A lot of it would probably even work.

But I don't think it's reasonable to think that wizards wouldn't /also/ innovate. There's no evidence a shield would stop bullets in canon? That makes sense, since shields are mostly meant to stop other spells, not solid objects. But you can bet that after the first few times a wizard gets shot someone is going to come up with one.

It would undoubtedly get ugly fast, and the first time someone got the smart idea to, say, release nerve gas in Diagon Alley, it wouldn't just be Voldemort's supporters looking for ways to fight back against the Muggle threat. And don't forget that half-bloods are a thing, and at this point it would be pretty much a coin toss which side they'd end up on. The Wizarding World wouldn't actually be relying on Mr. Weasley's technological knowledge.
