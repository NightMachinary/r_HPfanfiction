I'm making a story where all four houses are represented using OCs, but I wanted to know if AO3 or Wattpad is better for this. TY!


** Question. Why are people still using wattapad? It has zero search functionality.

*** It has zero any functionality ... but I guess for the same reason people still use FFnet, it is where readers are.

**** At least it has some functions. And DLP scryer is basically an enhanced search engine for it. Currently using it to look for any interesting fics from before I started reading but after the books were done.

*** The app is well formatted, but I am not familiar with other apps, so maybe there are better ones out there.

**** Being a guy who only read on a pc, via a browser. I've no idea how wattapad functions there. But it has zero filters on a pc. Not even something as simple as the fandom you want to read.

***** There is a search function on the app. I have never read on a pc, only my phone using a browser or on an app.

****** Yes it has a search function. If using the search bar on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] or ao3 is considered searching.

** I like AO3 because of the tagging and searchable bookmark formats

I actually cross post to both ao3 and ffnet though, as I find there seems to be a pretty even split for readers' preference

** It depends on your writing abilities and target audience, I believe. If you want to write something that's for younger people, probably 13/14 or younger, id advise Wattpad. If it's more mature, then I'd advise Ao3.

Its whatever's more comfortable for you, my dude.
