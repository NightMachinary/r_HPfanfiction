Take the contents, the pairings and the themes away and there's only the writing style left. That can make an author famous or infamous, so who are the famous ones? Who is an author you read in spite of not liking the pairings or themes they write because you like their styles?

Now, why do you like that particular style?


** From HP stories, I have to say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5695650/whitetiger91][whitetiger91]]. She has a mature way of writing and never deviates from the plots with excessive details. She also writes Slytherins like normal humans, giving depth to their characters.

** Darth Marrs. Character arcs are planned very well imo, enjoy how progression occurs.

The firebird trilogy was perhaps the most engaging political fic I've ever read. His ability to move the plot along at a just right pace.

** Fanfic- Emerald Ashes, for the two stories I read multiple times; Seventh Horcrux and A Matter of House. Also LadyAltair for multiple stories. They both have a way of creating a vivid and impactful scene with only a few words. I guess I would say they are good at using the right words, and not too many of them.

** SwimDraconian. He wrote linkffn(CircularReasoning), and has a real talent for creating suspense and filling in details which you wouldn't really think about. I personally love it, because it allows me to engage much more. The imagery, and description make it seem like I am right there, and he has a knack for explaining complicated situations without simplifying., or infodumping.

** IIRC, Lightning on the Wave /([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Sacrifices Arc]])/ had an exquisite and beautiful writing style, rich with prose references and rare words.

Other authors whose writing style was of technically high-quality:

- Lady Khali /([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]])/
- Voice of the Nephilim /([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]])/
- AngelaStarCat /([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]])/
- LessWrong (HP MoR) --- credit where it's due, I remember him paying attention to the reader feedback to improve the writing style in various ways, including the replacement of American expressions with British equivalents.
- The Sinister Man /([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]])/.

Rinsbane, tarteaucitron/girl_tarte, duniazade, caecelia, vissy, musamihi, all of whom seem to have left HP.

***** Hah! Atrata is an absolutely stellar writer, and yes, she does things with words that put her in this company. My mind defaulted to authors who are more temperamentally elegant and wordsmithy or attracted to imagery. Atrata writes scorching, emotionally spot-on prose and brilliant dialogue, and I would love to be able to write like her. So yes indeed, she belongs on this list. Mia_ugly, too.
