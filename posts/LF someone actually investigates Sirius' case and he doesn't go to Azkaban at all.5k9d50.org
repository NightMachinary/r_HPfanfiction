I haven't seen a fic with this plot line yet. Are there any?


** FYI while Sirius didn't get a traditional trial his case was investigated in canon. Dumbledore states in PoA that he gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius was the Potters' secret keeper. That he gave evidence implies some level of formal evidence collection; given what we saw in GoF it seems likely that Sirius was convicted in absentia by Crouch Sr in the Council of Magical Law.

The is actually more than enough evidence to convict Sirius even if he had a proper trial. The prosecution would be able to call witnesses to both him being the secret keeper and to him blowing up the street of Muggles. In the absence of a captured Pettigrew, Sirius' story would likely be written off as the ravings of a madman or the desperate excuses of a criminal.

**** Which it isn't, because it's fallible.

  Veritaserum plays a big part in finding out the truth from Mad-Eye Moody in book four. Why then is it not used for example in the trials mentioned in the same book? It would be much easier in solving problems like whether Sirius Black was guilty or not?

  Veritaserum works best upon the unsuspecting, the vulnerable and those insufficiently skilled (in one way or another) to protect themselves against it. Barty Crouch had been attacked before the potion was given to him and was still very groggy, otherwise he could have employed a range of measures against the Potion - he might have sealed his own throat and faked a declaration of innocence, transformed the Potion into something else before it touched his lips, or employed Occlumency against its effects. In other words, just like every other kind of magic within the books, Veritaserum is not infallible. As some wizards can prevent themselves being affected, and others cannot, it is an unfair and unreliable tool to use at a trial.

  Sirius might have volunteered to take the potion had he been given the chance, but he was never offered it. Mr. Crouch senior, power mad and increasingly unjust in the way he was treating suspects, threw him into Azkaban on the (admittedly rather convincing) testimony of many eyewitnesses. The sad fact is that even if Sirius had told the truth under the influence of the Potion, Mr. Crouch could still have insisted that he was using trickery to render himself immune to it.

** Although both have a brief stint in azkaban, that's a plot point of [[http://rosie-writes.livejournal.com/1468.html][Bring Me a Boat]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices]].

Bring Me a Boat is an alternative universe fic, exploring what might have happened in 1981 if Remus had never stopped trusting Sirius.

Choices is a time travel fic where Lily Luna accidentally goes back to 1980. One of the plot points is that she convinces Dumbledore that Sirius is innocent.

** It is probably not quite what you had in mind, but in linkffn(The Brightest Black by Enigmaticrose4) Sirius never gets to Azkaban because he never confronts Peter.

Tangentially, there are several good fics where Sirius escapes earlier than in canon. For example, in linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox) he escapes 5 years earlier, while in linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI by Larry Huss) he gets Lupin's help escaping about 3.5 years earlier.
