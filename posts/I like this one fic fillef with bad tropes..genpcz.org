It's Harry Potter and the rune stone path. It has it all. Harem, manipulative Dumbledore, good goblins and supersmart Harry. I can stomach those tropes and enjoy the story. But there's one trope in the story I truly can't stand: unobservant Harry. While Harry isn't the most obserbant guy in canon, some people take it too far. In the epilogue Harry talks to one of her wives. She's practically shouting that she's pregnant, but because Harry is idiot lol he of course doesn't get it before it's pretty much spelled out for him. It's so frustrating to read.


** Fair point, but thankfully it was just the epilogue. I learned to avoid epilogues in all forms of media from J.K Rowling herself. Harry in the rest of the story is not nearly as bad, so I think it was played for laughs?
