It's AU to the point there's no Voldemort or boy who lived business. But instead it takes Rowling world and create something entirely new out of it.


** Yeah I love this fic as well. Unfortunately it seems abandoned. That said, if you liked Black Luminary then you would probably like linkffn(Fate by thetruesparten) as well.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
