** I came across a new fic by chance that was pretty interesting but was so riddled with grammar errors, wrong words, and the like, that I left a review praising the elements of the chapter I liked but indicated some of the errors.

I didn't check the author's profile but assumed it was someone for whom English was not the primary language.

Author was USA based. S/he reacted by sending me a hatred filled PM that claimed I was picking on them because they had ADD and that I was being abusive. I tried to explain by repeating that I liked the story but that it was very hard to read because of all the errors, but that only made things worse, another few hate-filled PMs followed.

Fortunately it ended there. They deleted their profile, taking the story with it.

I don't point out grammar etc. errors out in reviews any longer now unless the author asks for them.

** I was trawling the new submissions on FFN and one caught my eye so I read it. I thought it had an interesting premise and was somewhat original. I wasn't really thinking when I wrote the review and I pretty much went through it like I was grading it-pointing out misspellings, grammar errors, and suggestions to tone down the fanfictiony-ness of it. After that, I told them all the things that were good, pointed out things I liked, and said that I was looking forward to reading their next updates.

Today, I went back to read through it again but it was deleted. I feel pretty bad. They had said they wanted criticism etc and I wasn't harsh or mean, just matter of fact! But now I feel like a troll. :/

*** I once collected all the typos/misspellings in a separate list during my read-through and---after finishing the story or deciding to drop it---posted everything I've collected in one big final review.

Stopped bothering after the 5th out of 6 such big reviews got ignored by the author.

Still have the “compulsion” of highlighting all the errors while I'm reading a story though, so now I just ask first (also telling how many errors I've picked up precisely), and only if the author writes back I send them the 100+ “proofreading” list.

**** That's a little surprising they'd ignore that! You would think it'd be nice to get a free proofreading. It's good that some people find it helpful!

**** I could see that getting annoying if it was unsolicited. It's nice that you take the time to do it and obviously mean well, but some might find that a bit patronizing.

** I read a story where I could tell that the author wasn't a woman by three pages in. A person bought a bra for someone else, from a store they'd never heard of -- *and it fit*. That's a bloody miracle.

I mentioned this in a review. The author PM'd me in a huff, saying it's fiction and he can do whatever he wants. I guess one of the unstated rules of magic in his AU is that all women have breasts that exactly fit Victoria's Secret sizes. (Was Victoria's Secret even available in England in the 90s?)

I know this one! No they first came here in 2012, looked it up a few weeks ago after seeing one in London. There's about a dozen of them, mainly in London.

** I've had reviews deleted before, because the authors couldn't take constructive criticism. While I can be harsh, I try not to be while personally talking to an a writer. After a while, I started to review on DLP, where people expect harsh criticism.

I'm never going to tell a writer "Your fic is shit", but I've said things like:

#+begin_quote
  Your spelling is all over the place. Grammar needs plenty of work. The conversations don't feel natural at all, and Harry sounds like a Goddamn fifty year old man, not a 12 year old. You need to make your characters sound realistic, they're kids at a magic school, not socialites.
#+end_quote

I've got the rather bad habit of cursing (when I'm not at work) and it tends to bleed over to my writing as well. It sometimes makes me seem harsher than I really mean to be. I try to avoid that when reviewing, but it slips out every once in a while.

** Tooooootally. A fic popped up called "Did I Do That?" Which was supposed to be a super!grey!independant!Harry, but in less than 1000 words has Harry run on paragraph think about how everyone sucks and Sirius is dead and Fumblegore doesn't care and angst angst angst. I posted a review saying there was a lot of problems with the fic, extremely short, massive spelling and grammar mistakes, as well as some weird content issues, like saying Harry was going to do something "like Luna:Slytherin style" which I pointed out as well. I suggested ways to clear it up and lengthen it, providing more fleshed out content etc.

The second chapter went up with over half the word count accusing people of saying she sucked, is just doing this for fun, and doesn't have time to write even 5000 words a chapter. She ended the a/n by saying she doesn't really have a plan for the story and is under writer's block. I couldn't find it when I went to double check my review and it was down. Oh well, I guess?

** Yeah I once wrote a review saying I thought it was really refreshing to read a 'Harry goes to America' story where America is a but shit and Muggleborns are slaves ala black people. Got an email accusing me of bein a coward, pathetic, foreigner (this one was actually right at least) and I'm pretty sure I'm a Nazi now because I wanted Germany to win WW2. Really weird.

** I left a review that went something along the lines of "the squick is really unnecessary. sexualizing tweens/children is disgusting. if you want to write that kind of porn you really should take it somewhere else as it doesn't fit on this kind of story/site." The author had underage sex (10,11 year olds) and parent/child incest in their story. He then continued to post that shit and claimed I was flaming him in one of his ANs at the beginning of the story. It was an okay story up until then too.

*** To be honest, it really isn't your place to police fanfics like that. If that's what he wanted to write, then that's his thing, it's not like anyone was forcing you to read it, and if it was against the site's rules, then a simple report would have solved that. There really is no reason to write a review complaining about the subject.

I don't care for slash (at all), but you wouldn't see me writing reviews on all the slashfics at ffnet complaining about it. Even if the fansite had a 'no slash' policy, I'd simply report the story and move on. Wasting time complaining about it is just that, wasting time. Same thing.

TL;DR It's fiction, it doesn't matter. If you don't like the subject, ignore it. If the subject is against the rules, report it.
