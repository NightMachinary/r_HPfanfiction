Wands are always depicted as looking like wands from all of our stories of witches, wizards, fairy godmothers, etc, yet whenever a muggle sees a wand in a fanfic, they call it a stick.


** It's a rod of wood. Most disparaging/condescending name to call /any/ rod of wood? A stick. And then you get turned into a newt, and great shame and mockery is brought upon you.

**** True. But sadly, I can only have successful litigation against the witch if she weighs as much as a duck.

** How much of thin but of wood = wand comes from Harry Potter for you? The Harry Potter series takes place in a universe where the Harry Potter series doesn't exist. As such, magic and fantasy are much further away in the eyes of the public. Its a clear way to avoid the temptation of making in-jokes and the like that can ruin a story.

** Actually, I'm not sure about this one. I mean, before reading Harry Potter, my mental image of your typical wand was a lot less organic - more like those stout metal ones with the star on top, or something really ornate - encrusted with heaps of jewels and stuff. I can't be alone in thinking that, so maybe HP-universe Muggles are similarly minded.

** If I saw someone on the street carrying a long, thin piece of wood I wouldn't think "hm, that person is carrying around a wand" but "that person is carrying around a stick, reminding me of a wand." In a world where magic isn't real, the more logical assumption is that it's simply a stick that person is holding for whatever reason, not a magic wand. At least imo.

** Muggles don't know magic is real and as such when they see a piece of wood they think stick. Children often carry around pieces of wood shaped like Harry Potter wands and say they are wands so people are kind of trained to think something that looks like a wooden wand is a stick, if I saw a person carrying a 'wand' and they were an adult I would assume it was a stick and they were carrying it for some inane reason.

** In the book series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, the main characters are frequently seen in public with swords or other weapons drawn. The muggles ( or mortals in this case) do not perceive the weapons. The weapons appear as things the mortal knows about and can comprehend. In some cases, the weapons are mistaken for baseball bats, or guns.

Wands are much smaller and more portable. Therefore, wands have much more potential to be mistaken for a variety of common objects.

I can think of several items a wand could be mistaken for: chopsticks,custom pens, hair accessories, paint or makeup brushes ... Granted, some of these items might be silly, or strange, however, I think it would be more intuitive for a muggle to perceive a wand as something that serves a purpose rather than seeing just a stick.

All those items listed would not be out of place in a backpack, purse, or briefcase. If a muggle saw a magic wand it would be reasonable for them to assume it to be one of those aforementioned items. It they see the tip of the wand glowing, it could be a trick of the light, or a flash of camera.
