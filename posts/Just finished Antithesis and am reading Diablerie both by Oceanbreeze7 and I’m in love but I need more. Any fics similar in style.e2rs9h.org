I'm looking for maybe familiar tropes--- or fresh ideas--- fleshed out as if a real author put their soul into it as a book, but it's just a fic. I've read some of the best and I want more.


** One of my all-time favourite authors is The Fictionist!!! I'm so happy to hear this about Antithesis and Diablerie!!!!!

**** I actually am in the works with publications!! I'm starting with short stories written heavily like Antithesis (style-wise) and aiming for a more Diablerie style novel! I am so happy you enjoy!! Let me know if you have ANY questions over my works, I would love to chat or gossip! I've been meaning to work on the next chapter of Diablerie but exam season has ruined my schedule....it'll be out soon!!!

*** This is kind of ironic because I remember reading this and I remembered the scene with the pictures but couldn't remember anything else and have been trying to find it again for ages!!!

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
