Hello guys, this is ReadWriteUnity from Wattpad, and I am looking for a certain ‘Flee From Britain' fanfic that I read awhile ago, the fanfic has the following credentials:

•Harmony/Harmione Pairing (Harry and Hermione) •Sirius was alive •They fled to Brazil •Sirius was cleared of charges •Hermione played soccer I'm also looking for another fanfic with the following credentials: •Harry/Hermione Pairing •Dan and Emma as Hermione's parents •They defeated Voldemort with guns

If anyone could help me with this, I would be grateful. Also, I have a newly made account on Wattpad @ReadWriteUnity, and so if you would follow, I'll have my first fanfic, Rising, up soon.


** It sounds a lot like Hermione's Brilliant Plan by Ares.Granger linkffn(11101063) except it's Spain instead of Brazil.

  A fourth year fic. Harry is stuck in something he doesn't want to be in, Dumbledore's a manipulative bastard, Voldemort wants Harry dead, the school hates him...sounds like every year right? Well this year Hermione has a brilliant idea (or more than one) and her idea(s) change Harry's life, her life, and a big black dog's life too. AU and no idea which genre to put this under.

** The second one has little to go on, though it sounds a bit like [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] and sequel, though I confess I never finished the million-plus-word story to know how Voldemort was finished off. It was another "escape from Britain" type story.
