Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality definitely has a lot of good points but one thing that really bugged me was the characterization of Harry himself. I felt like he was as OOC as it gets and not at all likable. You'd think having kind loving adoptive parents would make him even more like Lily but it seems to have had the opposite effect. I think I would enjoy this fanfic a lot more if Harry acted more like he did in the books.


** Yeah, he was essentially how canon Snape sees Harry and the characterization reminded me of someone I know and hate IRL because he acts just like Harry in MoR.

** This sub has little love for any of the "top" fics on FFN.net with the possible exceptions of Oh God Not Again and Nightmares of Futures Past. HPMOR has been widely panned by many members of this sub for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that Harry is a egotistical jerk with few redeeming qualities and little real character development who belongs on [[/r/iamverysmart]]

*** It really surprised me to see the top rated fics. Usually I just check out the latest fics over 60k words and Harry as the main character, but a few days ago I decided to sort by favourites.

Out of the top 50 or so favourited stories there are perhaps one or two where everybody acts in character and there is no bashing.

I had no idea that the most popular fanfiction would be fanfiction that is completely different from the books. In many cases the characters are so different that they would be barely recognizable if we weren't told their names. It's not what I expected at all. I thought a lot of people were like me and read Harry Potter fanfiction because they like the story and the characters and want to spend more time with them, not that they wanted completely different characters.

Some, like myself, never really liked or cared about the canon characters, and instead only care about the world. So OOCness doesn't bother me unless it's unexplained, or so completely opposite to the original characterization that it's hard to suspend disbelief.

****** /Something/ like that. The difference is that he was an /intentional/ Horcrux. The wording of the Prophecy was slightly different in that AU (the final lines were "Either must destroy all but a remnant of the other; For those two different spirits cannot exist in the same world"), and Voldemort, when he heard that Prophecy, decided to try and fulfill the Prophecy on his own terms by using that AU's version of the Horcrux Ritual (which also works differently) to /make/ Harry's spirit more similar to his own.

The key point of this Voldemort is that he's a genius, an unparalleled mastermind who is, at his core, excruciatingly /bored/ with the world. Dumbledore is a slightly better opponent than the norm and that's why, purely for entertainment value, he'd drawn out the first war over so many years when he could have easily taken over Britain in a year or two if he'd /really/ gone all-out. With Harry, he hoped to kill two birds with one stone by simultaneously fulfilling the Prophecy /and/ giving himself an actual smart person to talk to.

That Harry was literally born to be Voldemort's idea of good company.

Only, Voldemort hadn't anticipated Harry would keep the conscience that /he/ never had.

** People of this sub need to remember that although it's technically HP fanfiction, it's so entirely different from the rest of the fandom. I don't know of any fic that changes everything as dramatically as HPMOR. It also has such a different tone.

Normal fics are JK Rowling with some amount of difference. Thing is, they all accept the existence of a soul, death, and whatnot.

HPMOR just doesn't. Everything is different. I wouldn't really call it HP fanfiction, even though it technically is. It's just not like other fanfiction.

So, I usually just want people to go into it with their minds open, and be aware that they might not like it. It's definitely a highly flawed work, but it's an enjoyable one.

It's so much like an original work, that I don't think there are any other HP fanfics with as much fanfanfics written after them as HPMOR.
