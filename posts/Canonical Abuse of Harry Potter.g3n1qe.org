I recently read two blogs about the abuse Harry experienced at the hands of Dursleys and thought I would share it. I will recommend you read them to understand the full extent of it but I am going to be posting some highlights as well.

[[https://www.quora.com/q/nsfzupaphixdypzw]] Child abuse in Harry Potter

[[https://www.quora.com/Is-Harry-Potter-how-he-should-have-been-Some-people-say-that-since-he-was-abused-he-should-be-a-little-more-messed-up-What-are-your-thoughts]]

Both are by *Nathan Drake*. Here are some excerpts I have copied and pasted here. Once again I will recommend you to read the blog itself as I am posting a limited part of it.

​

#+begin_quote
  *CoS ch 2:*

  Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that *small* amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day.

  [...]

  Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, *he'd probably starve to death anyway.*

  [...]

  The cat flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, *whose insides were aching with hunger*, jumped off his bed and seized it.

  [...]

  He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat flap and lay back down on the bed, *somehow even hungrier* than he had been before the soup.

  [...]

  The room was growing dark. *Exhausted,* *stomach rumbling*, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.
#+end_quote

The excerpt indicates that Harry was indeed occasionally deprived of adequate food *to the point of starvation* for extended periods as punishment. *To be at the point of* */Exhaustion/* *when you haven't exerted yourself is a serious and dangerous sign of malnutrition.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is another critical piece of dialogue in *Order of the Phoenix---**clear evidence that Uncle Vernon had hit Harry on more than one occasion*---perhaps the only time that Harry let slip to Hermione just how awful things were for him at the Dursleys.

But in true Harry fashion---like a number of abused kids who try to keep it to themselves and/or have grown somewhat inured to the violence and come to view it as a normal part of their life---Harry plays it down and makes a bit of a joke out of it:

#+begin_quote
  *OotP Ch 29:*

  “Well, it's a very responsible job, isn't it?” said Hermione absently. She was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet, that was headed, SO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS? “You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!”
#+end_quote

*“You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” said Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like.”*

#+begin_quote
  *HBP Ch 3:*

  Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, *as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible.* There in the doorway stood a tall thin man with waist length silver hair and beard.
#+end_quote

In conjunction with all the other evidence up to this point, this really is definitive proof that the adult Dursleys---especially Uncle Vernon---physically abused Harry on a regular basis before he attended Hogwarts, and even on some occasions after Harry had started Hogwarts. *Sixteen year old Harry is STILL scared of being within arm's length of Uncle Vernon, even with Dumbledore standing in the doorway.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

#+begin_quote
  *PS ch 2:*

  The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. *By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started.*
#+end_quote

Dudley's birthday is June 23rd. In the UK, schools generally let out for summer holidays in the third week of July. *Harry was forced to stay in a dark cupboard all of his waking hours (except for school) for FOUR WEEKS!!!*

#+begin_quote
  *DH ch 4:*

  “Don't you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. “We'll never be here again. Don't you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories ... Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the dementors. ... Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. ...”

  Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.“And under here, Hedwig”---Harry pulled open a door under the stairs---“is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then---*Blimey, it's small, I'd forgotten. ...”*

  /Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two./ Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once---Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it---a flying motorbike...

  There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. *Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame.* Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon's choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden.
#+end_quote

Let THIS sink in for a minute:

#+begin_quote
  Harry straightened up with a jerk and *smacked the top of his head on the low door frame.*
#+end_quote

Huh! ... “*/Low/* *door frame*” ... The next time you hear someone on Quora claim that Harry's *small* cupboard-under-the-stairs was a “small room,” shove this in their face.

There is no possibility of Harry's cupboard under the stairs being a small room. That is why---in the books---it is called a *cupboard* instead of a “small room.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope this helps clear up the extent of abuse Harry went through and I will once again recommend that you read the blogs.

** THANK YOU!!\\
I've ranted and raged for *years* about Rowling's cavalier attitude regarding the abuse of not just Harry but multiple characters in the series! My objections and treatise on the subject have been dismissed and 'hand-waved' away by those who don't want reality intruding on their *worship* of JKR!

In 2005 my husband's adult nephew came to stay with us and he had the HP series, up through book 5. Now, I've been a voracious biblioholic of mostly Fantasy & Sci-Fi, since I was 6 or 7 years old, so of course, I wanted to read what all the hype and hoopla was about these books.

I got a bad feeling from the opening paragraphs: Who, in their right mind, leaves a 15-month old *toddler* on a doorstep, in the middle of the night, WITHOUT even ringing the doorbell or in any way alerting the occupants of the house, in NOVEMBER, in ENGLAND, in *1981*?! A toddler is *walking* by 15 months!\\
The sleazy and furtive way that Dumbledork slunk towards the house had me on high alert already! Right up until I skimmed through book 6 (when I finally gave up on reading this highly derivative [as a long-time reader of Fantasy and former Children's book reviewer for my Public Library, I recognized multiple characters, scenes, and sometimes dialogue that were nearly direct *steals* from other books and stories! I've come to realize that Rowling has produced the highest-paid piece of crossover FANFICTION in history!] appalling waste of my time!) I thought that the MOB would turn out to be the actual *villain*; to paraphrase Frodo: He "looked fair, but felt foul"!

As I read through the 1st five books, I kept trying to 'suspend my disbelief' and tell myself, "It's GOT to get better!" But no! Rowling & her publisher were able to SELL unmitigated, unremedied, and dismissed CHILD ABUSE of *multiple characters* to a fantasy-starved public! I believe that at any other time in history, she and they would have been run out of town on a rail! I still can't believe that "Scholastic" had anything to do with these books!

These were first published, in the U.S., in 1998! My God, the U.S. public had become aware of and been on a 'witch-hunt' about Child Abuse since the 70s and here was this author making money off the suffering of a child throughout a *series* of books!! WTF?!?

My disgust finished any interest in "Harry Potter" until, in 2012, I accidentally began reading a fanfiction story in my current favorite fandom, that crossed over with "Harry Potter". My first inclination was to exit immediately, but something was truly different about this interpretation of canon HP: This author didn't attempt to 'gloss-over' or dismiss Harry's abuse nor the bullying ongoing at Hogwarts! This writer was willing to point out and fix many of the plot chasms and horrors extant the deeply flawed original! I was in *wonderment*! ;D

HPff has become my favorite genre of FanFiction for just that reason! There are *thousands* of magnificent writers, toiling away for *nothing*, who write so much better than Rowling and who tirelessly attempt to write/right the glaring *wrongs* of the "Harry Potter" series!

Thank GOD!!

Thanks for reading!

Take care and stay safe!

*** PS ;)

From the time I was 3 years old, I grew up in a truly dysfunctional, abusive alcoholic home where */I/* was the "problem" and thus the designated 'hittee'. My mother and step-father were both severely alcoholic, my mother also abused prescription medications--both hers and my epileptic brothers.

My mother was the more abusive of the two, but she'd rope my step-dad into 'double-team' beating us kids when he'd get home from work late and after he'd had a few drinks! She never told him that she'd already beaten me/us for whatever wrong-doing I/we'd committed that day, so we'd get woken up to be beaten with the belt, a stick, and/or fists; whatever happened to be handy. I remember being backhanded *in my highchair* so hard that the chair went over backward! Etc., etc. Sorry. :(

Anyway, reading the HP books brought back a lot of bad memories that I only thought I'd dealt with, long before. It was one thing growing up in the 60s in the family I did, but to read about an abused child written about so callously and dismissively in a purported "Children's book"? That's what set me on the warpath against Rowling and books!

Did I read books about abused children as a child? Sure I did! BUT those children, such as "Jane Eyre", "Tom Brown", and "Margaret Thursday" were ALL eventually rescued and/or ended-up having loving mentors/protectors thus they gave me HOPE! Their authors didn't thrust them back, BOOK AFTER BOOK, into the same abusive homelife and horrific, bullying school life!

Had I read these books when I was a young child, I might have tried *harder* to kill myself to escape my childhood! These books did the opposite of giving me the hope of a happy childhood!

Shame on you, Rowling; shame on you!

I felt compelled to explain that it wasn't as a 'disinterested' 3rd party that I feel such disgust with Rowling's crap! I just haven't had much of a 'forum' outside reviews and commentary on fanfiction, to "vent my spleen"!

Thanks again.\\
MelJ

BTW, Just in case any of y'all DON'T know, Rowling said in an interview that she was "forced" by her Editors to "tone down" the abuse because she was much more descriptive and wanted to sell to a younger audience! :P

**** I think this is part of the reason why many angry harry, runawat harry, Manipulative dumb as a brick or evil dumbledore, and other fanfics are made.

Because it makes no sense at all. Dumbledore could have made a safe house for the summers with the fidelius charm, or visited somedays when Harry was young, but blood wards are supposed to be better somehow? even after almost getting eaten by dementors?

There is a severe neglect of an abused child, and the main book do not show a healthy way to confront it. Just a take it all and ignore it.

*** I loved and will probably always hold fondness for JKR's HP despite the faults, but the handling of child abuse has always been a major low. When I was young, there was a point she was claiming that it wasn't really neglect/abuse (or maybe I misunderstood).

In any case, the abuse never being addressed was problematic for me. There is an expectation that children know what is wrong, after all if not at home then school or the community says it, right? In reality, this is not always the case particularly given cognitive dissonance.

One of the key reasons I didn't tell anyone about being abused was because JKR was my idol and she never thought anything was wrong - after all, nothing happens when the window bars are brought to the Weasleys or Molly sends him food, etc. As a child, I wasn't able to make the cognitive hoops about why they might not have taken it seriously.

Dozens of times I started to pen an letter or later email to JKR only to destroy the evidence. I was terrified I would never get a response or worse she would tell me that what was happening was right based on her writing.

**** Luna, dear;

Never base your perceptions of what's correct and good or what's wrong or 'improper' on anything that comes out of JKR's pen!! Mein Gott, she has an entire generation of sheeple believing the psycho-babble that she came up with to explain Severus Snape's behavior towards Harry and most of his other students!

The psychology behind Snape's bullying points more towards a *spoiled child* (ala James Potter) who grew up terribly spoiled by aged parents, became a bully through having little or no empathy or compassion for anyone not blessed with his gifts of love, health, and wealth. If said overindulged child/teen is suddenly *thwarted* in their life and/or desires (becoming suddenly orphaned & impoverished; being blocked from the pursuit of their desired profession; being rejected by their 'love interest' and/or bested by their rival in love, etc.), THEN one could reasonably see the antecedents to the character of Severus Snape. But NO: JKR *chose* to frame the characters of James Potter & Severus Snape using the old EGOTISM of *CLASS* stereotypes:

James Potter: Wealthy, high-class, *Pureblood*, Gryffindor Golden Boy, from the *right-side* of the tracks="Hero"!\\
Severus Snape: Impoverished, abused son of an alcoholic 'muggle' father & ineffectual, beaten-down Pureblood mother, Slytherin, from the *WRONG-side* of the tracks="bad boy" attempting to find redemption! WTH?!

I'm sorry, but I could go on and on about all the things that Rowling got so wrong that it would be laughable if there weren't so many people who've drunk her koolaid and subscribe to her brand of pseudo-psychology!

That's what made me so g-d ANGRY with her and her empire: It's built on the blood, sweat, tears, and bodies of children like you and millions like you who now seem to think that the kind of home life that Harry was *forced* to live through--however 'toned-down' it was--was "okay"!!

IT'S */NOT/* /OKAY/ and Rowling better like it hot where she's headed for her "next great adventure", cuz it actually says in the Bible, *“*But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and /that/ he was drowned in the depth of the sea.” (*Matthew 18:6, King James Bible)* I find her works *very* offensive towards children!

Sweetie, you're not in the wrong about how you perceived and experienced your childhood! Talk to someone or join a group near you or even online! You need to be heard, acknowledged, and validated! Only then can you start to heal!

Take care and may God Bless YOU!!

***** Aw, thanks. Luckily I'm an adult now with my own view on life and the spectacular NHS to thank - meaning I was able to get intensive support without the involvement of my parents, before I turned 18 and still have support now, though of a different kind.

I suppose in many ways it could be a contrast between Snape and Sirus, like Voldemort and Harry.

Even if most abused/bullied people don't go on to become Snape's, a notable minority do. Broadly speaking the psychology is sound, it's just that it's very stereotypical framed. It can't have helped that she had Dumbledore force him into a teaching position when he obviously lacked skills, temperament or interest in it.

It doesn't excuse what he did, but really he's there as a villain-with-a-twist so none of the sensible things (like teacher training or interviews with student involvement or, idk, staff performance measures) were there.

In a world outside her requirements, I imagine that Snape would have gone on to be a socially isolated lab worker, perhaps creating potions for St Mungos or a shop and lived a quiet, if snarky life.

** I do agree with most of this, just have a few comments. My main criticism is that the author comes to conclusion not based on what is said in the books, just his own opinions. For example, this passage:

#+begin_quote
  We're never told explicitly that Vernon gave Harry a beating once he physically “dragged Harry upstairs,” but at this point, given the context provided in Philosopher's Stone when Vernon hit Dudley “round the head,” it is not a mere inference, but a logical deduction---it would be more than reasonable for us to safely conclude, with certainty, that Vernon did hit Harry a few times, more than a few times really---i.e. that Vernon gave Harry a beating. There really can be no doubt that Harry had bruises and welts after that incident. Only the most obtuse Dursley apologists would suggest otherwise.
#+end_quote

Um, yes, there can be doubt about that. All that happens in the book is that Vernon takes Harry upstairs. No mention of a beating, no mention of pain, nothing. My view of the abuse is that Vernon was no stranger to slaps around the head, pushing, grabbing and throwing, etc. We see this even when it comes to Dudley, as the author observes. However I don't believe there were prolonged “beatings” as such - there's nothing that suggests that in canon.

Furthermore I have a comment on this passage, discussing Harry's remark about ducking Vernon in the career advice chapter of OOtP:

#+begin_quote
  There is another critical piece of dialogue in Order of the Phoenix, that is definitive evidence that Uncle Vernon had hit Harry on more than one occasion---perhaps the only time that Harry let slip to Hermione just how awful things were for him at the Dursleys.
#+end_quote

Why is Ron excluded here? He's also present for this conversation. Yet the author paints this as Harry confiding in just Hermione. Just an observation that tells me that the author is comfortable ignoring canon when it suits his narrative.

I can't comment on why the author ignored Ron in the second one though.
