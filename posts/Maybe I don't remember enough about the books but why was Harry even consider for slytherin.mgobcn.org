It has been over ten years since I last re-read the books and my vision of Harry may be not the most accurate of them all but why did the hat want him in slytherin? He isn't particularly ambitious and his cunning is lackluster at best (although none of the original slytherins are much better for that matter) so why was he considered if anything I would say Huffleppuf would have been better for him.


** Because he was resourceful, determined, could speak parseltongue, had a certain disregard for rules, and could be cunning when he wanted to be.

I don't know why this is a reoccurring question, though, as it strongly suggests many of you think Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle were cunning and ambitious.

** I actually think there's some misconception about this. The hat mentions that Harry has a "thirst to prove himself," but doesn't mention Slytherin until Harry himself asks to NOT be put in Slytherin. Even then, the hat says that Harry could become great in Slytherin NOT that he would fit best there. The hat also mentions that Harry has a good mind. I always thought that the hat was a bit mischievous. I honestly think that if Harry had chanted "not Ravenclaw, not Ravenclaw," the hat would have told him he would do well in Ravenclaw. Harry may display SOME Slytherin qualities, but I would argue that most people show signs of all the houses. Hermione is very cunning, Ron shows signs of ambition, but their PRIMARY traits are those of Gryffindor. Same goes for Harry. Also, I think we can all agree that Harry would have been miserable in Slytherin. Completely miserable.

  Also, I always imagine that the Sorting Hat detected the presence of that piece of soul when Harry first tried it on, because it's strongly tempted to put him in Slytherin. So that's how I see it.
#+end_quote

So that's one option to take, that it's the fragment of Voldemort's soul. That's probably the option to take if going by canon-ish versions of Slytherin as just the 'evil' house, IMO. Though, frankly, I quite dislike that approach.

If fleshing out Slytherin a bit more, and emphasizing the cunning/ambitious side of things, we can come up with some pretty easy reasons. Harry definitely has a bit of all of the houses - but /everyone/ does have characteristics of each one.

*** I reject this answer. Not because JK said it she seems to have a hardon for making herself irrelevant, but rather because it doesn't make much sense.

The horcrux in Harry's head doesn't ever seem to influence Harry directly. The worst it seems to have done is forge a link between Harry and Riddle.

I think it's a nice rationalization after-the-fact, but I believe that Rowling clearly intended to have Slytherin house have some kind of redemption arc before at some point she decided, “Fuck it, let's literally have a Slytherin student suggest shipping Harry to the Dark Lord in the Great Hall while surrounded by Harry Potter supporters. Oh, and we'll use Amazon to do it.”

She may have decided “Fuck Slytherin” around the same time she nerfed Harry after the events of PoA.

I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with an author changing their mind about the direction of a 7-part series written over the course of a decade, just that it was obvious in at least a few places.

  It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it --- Harry had to put it out with his hat.

  Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.

  “Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.

  “You're saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar' nice and long.”

  “You do it, then, if you're so clever,” Ron snarled.

  Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa."

  Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.

  Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased.

  Exam week began and an unnatural hush fell over the castle.

  Then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back upstairs for the Charms exam. Hermione had been right; Professor Flitwick did indeed test them on Cheering Charms.

Even with the Patronus Charm, it's said that it's fueled by emotions, so it doesn't really say anything about his overall magical ability, especially since, according to Harry himself, the only reason he cast it so powerfully was because he already saw himself cast it so powerfully. Maybe I'm overlooking something, but it seems to me that he wasn't all that great at magic, even in the first three books.

It still makes sense. The hat is detecting the strongly Slytherin horcrux and the strongly Gryffindor Harry inside the one head, and therefore is torn between them. It's not a question of whether they interact with each other, just what the hat can sense. It probably doesn't realise that part of what it's sensing is a separate fragment of someone else's soul; it's only a hat, after all

**** Ambition comes in different forms.

He had the ambition to defeat Voldemort, but it went beyond just getting revenge for his parents or trying to save himself from another terrible year--- he would actively seek out the guy even if he didn't have to, just for the sake of doing it. He took the prophecy in stride and literally caved in to what it demanded of him because he /wanted/ that mantle, even if he disliked the fame and other associated consequences.

He had the ambition to become an Auror not because he fell in love with the idea of becoming a wizard cop under the purview of the Ministry (which he despised), but because he wanted to do something and /be/ something his parents (especially his dad) would've approved of. If you look at his actual skillset and interests, it makes a lot more sense to see canon Harry being happy as an Unspeakable, Professional Quidditch player, or Hogwarts Professor (though while he'd probably like all of those, he'd still likely /choose/ to be an Auror).

And there was also his brief obsession with the Hallows in the middle of Book 7 that was quickly smothered, but was still there under the surface. Though to this day, I'm still incredulous that he thought it'd be a good idea to drop the Resurrection Stone in the middle of the forest where anyone or anything could get it, and then just puts the Elder Wand back in the tomb--- where again, multiple people know of it can take it. Not to mention the fact that going by the rules of claiming wand allegiance, with Harry winning the Elder Wand after disarming Malfoy of his Hawthorne wand, means that every person at Hogwarts (Death Eaters included) who heard him wax poetic about the Elder Wand's allegiance to Voldemort before he died knows they can win it's allegiance by disarming him (even if it's when he has the Holly wand). And plenty have the incentive.

I think that speaks a lot about his struggle to accept the Slytherin side of him; he does have that ambition and cunning part of him, but he runs away from it time and time again. The result is that he makes a lot of extremely stupid decisions that will end up coming back to bite him.

That's Fanon. While we don't know what grades Dudley had, Harry mention in PS that his grades "weren't bad". As long as Magic was not concerned, the Dursleys juste didn't "care" about Harry. He could probably have brought any grade as long as they didn't have to do anything about it (/don't get grades so bad we are called to the school, or so good they ask you to participate in things like spelling bees or science fairs/).

Canon Harry also has above average grades, just like Ron. And while both of their work ethic could use some improvement, they are 100% in the norm when it comes to teenager, and neither is keeping the other down, they just both prefer hanging out and play rather than write an essay 3 weeks in advance. If anything, Hermione is the weird one who works too much.

​

Outside of that, I agree. Harry is shown to be cunning throughout the series. After all, he was able to solve several mysteries that eluded adults around, and he did plan some crazy things like robbing Gringott.

He's not a normal kid, he's a kid whose life is threatened constantly by authority figures at school, and whose wellbeing is constantly ignored by family at home. Although I'll admit his behavior in response to that is understandable considering the trauma, unhealthy coping mechanisms, etc.

** Oh, Harry has ambition and cunning aplenty. He takes advantage of situations when it suits him (using the HBP's book to ace Potions). He's not afraid of leading someone astray when it suits him (neglecting to tell Griphook precisely WHEN he could have the sword of Gryffindor back). He only follows the rules when it suits him (countless examples of this throughout the entire series). He even briefly becomes a bit obsessive about power (the hallows).

But the important thing there is the fact that Harry is in Gryffindor because he didn't want to be in Slytherin. Even if he does have traits that Slytherins have, he didn't put any value on those traits.

In other words, a person is sorted into the house that they /want/ to exemplify, not necessarily what they /are./ Harry would rather be brave than ambitious, which is why he's a Gryffindor.

It could also be due to his unhappy childhood. The boy lived 10 years in a cupboard as a slave to the Dursleys. He must have learned to be cunning and sneaky, most abused children learn to care for their own self-preservation, which is detrimental for Slytherin.

Influence of Gryffindors and Dumbledore is probably the reason how he eventually cares nothing for his self-preservation and is reckless and naive and willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good.

In my opinion, the only people l could say are worthy of house of Slytherins would be Voldemort, Lucius Malfoy and Dumbledore.* and Slughorn. Nobody else. Draco Malfoy acts more like a Gryffindor. Snape is brilliant like a Ravenclaw, loyal like a Hufflepuff, brave like a Gryffindor but has zero ambition and self-preservation like a Slytherin should have.

Or to pat him on the head,but still send him to his doom due to the prophecy.

The whole point of OotP, and Dumbledore examining each year Harry spent at Hogwarts, was to show that keeping Harry sheltered and ignorant was stupid and that it wouldn't keep him away from Voldemort and vice versa.

For all of Dumbledore's faults and old age, he largely was able to grasp that children were people, too, and, therefore, should be able to make some of their own choices. Harry made his own choices and it strips a lot away from his characterization to say Dumbledore made him do those things.

** If harry potter tricking Luscious Malfoy into freeing Dobby isn't evidence that Harry Potter had the cunning to make it in the house of snakes, I don't know what does. Remember, kids respond to their environments, the Hat said Harry will do well in Slytherin, Slytherin would make him great, maybe had he been sorted in Slytherin he would have been more motivated and might have developed a taste for ambition.
