So I used to follow the Dramione Awards a number of years ago (I am only just getting back into fanfiction after not reading any for several years) are there still similar award pages where people nominate fics for particular categories? I did a quick google and couldn't find anything that had been updated recently.


** [[http://harrypotterfanfiction.com][harrypotterfanfiction.com]] does The Dobbys, which I think are site-specific.

[[http://z8.invisionfree.com/The_Golden_Snitches/index.php?act=idx][The Golden Snitches]] is another one. I don't know whether that is also specific to HPFF.

A quick look at [[http://www.siye.co.uk/][Sink Into Your Eyes]] seems to indicate that they have annual H/G awards, but I can't find any information on that besides that it's a thing.

Unfortunately, it seems as though most of the other large sites have stopped doing awards. Makes me sad to see so much inactivity :( Go ahead and check out LJ and I'm sure you'll find awards for specific ships or genres or whatever.

Might also want to ask around different forums that are still active. They could host their own awards, or know of other forums that do.

If you're trying to find good sources of high-quality fic, you'll probably have more luck sticking to popular/high-rated stories on the larger sites and the winners of challenges and fests. Those don't require an active forum to function, which is why they're still around while annual awards have mostly died out.

*** HPFF is site specific. The Golden Snitches isn't technically limited to HPFF but the entire community is from HPFF so there have only been HPFF winners.

*** Thanks for the detailed reply! Yeah, It's sad that a lot of them have stopped running, I used to love reading and voting for the nominated fics! I'm sure I'll find some good stuff to read elsewhere though! Cheers.

** There are a couple of groups on DeviantArt that do polled awards.
