This is just something that made me start wondering if I'm the only one who finds that certain things don't work as well as when I first got introduced to the series. For me, one thing that just doesn't seem feasible is Ron and Hermione getting married.

Especially after Ron found out about Hermione kissing Krum at the Yule Ball and getting jealous about it in Half-Blood Prince. Like, I'd understand if it was six months before, but two years? Just seems creepy to me.

Krum kissing Hermione is definitely up there, since I believe he would've been a legal adult in the Wizarding World at that time. That's up there as well for me

** I feel like it's weird how everyone expects Ron to always act as he did when he was sixteen in concerns of whether he and Hermione should have married. I mean, ignoring the war for a hot second, they were kids, surely they matured as they grew?

I only think they maybe shouldn't have married because, in general, I think marrying your childhood sweetheart is probably a bad idea, so I don't think anyone should do that, (or even marrying anyone you went to high school with, but again, maybe that's just me).

Or, well, they fought a war together, so maybe it's different, maybe they bonded closer over shared trauma and became a stronger couple because of it.

Now, Rowling's world building? /That/ doesn't hold up at all, because you only have to look at her schools to understand how painfully Eurocentric the HP world is...like, 8 named schools and 3 are in Europe? Ok lol.

*** That's a fair point on Ron, but to me, it's just a slippery slope. Jealous of a kiss two years after the fact? That could easily spiral into worse things. Not to mention the PTSD(or would it be PTSS?)both would have and it's a situation that could have been addressed perfectly.

Rowling wasn't good at world building. Cause if 17 is the age of maturity in the Wizarding World, then would Krum trying to get with Hermione violate some type of law? Or is it a case of just ignoring the actions?

For the record, I do think Ron would mature, but as stated above, I'm concerned about the delayed jealousy and the PTSD/PTSS they'd suffer after the war and how it could spiral out of control

**** Sorry, I fell asleep.

It could be a slippery slope, but, honestly, I read that part as more him being in his insecurities again, rather than actually jealous.

Like, ‚ÄòOh, the girl I like really did kiss a world-famous quidditch star, I'll never be able to compete'. Was it right of him to act like that? No, but it does kinda fall in line with his character, while on the flip side, it also wasn't right for Hermione to physically assault him for being with Lavender either, but fans tend to praise her for that move.

(People tend to overlook that Hermione could be just as jealous and unfair as Ron, but ignore it because it doesn't fall in line with fanon Hermione, who is perfect).

But again, this all happens while they're teenagers, and after the war, I'd like to think they matured for each other.

**** He was just turned 18, she was 15 (nearly 16 if you consider the extra time she spent with a time-turner, which I do). That's not really that much of an age gap.

Some places have what they call "Romeo and Juliet" laws, which allows an of-age person to have a relationship with an under-age person as long as they are within X years in age.

But yes, Ron still being that jealous that many years later is not a good sign. But he often showed unreasonable jealousy during the series.

Honestly, his perfect match was Lavender, who loved him just as he was and didn't need him to change or improve himself.

***** Personally, I didn't see anything wrong with Krum and Hermione's age gap, because it was like...3 years? I knew so many people in high school that dated or screwed around with the gap between them.

Now, Krum sizing up Ginny during Bill and Fleur's wedding? That's weird, but I also think Rowling might have added that because she wanted some perceived competition, probably forgetting that Krum would be in his early twenties, while Ginny would be sixteen (now that's an unforgivable gap).

Yea, Ron is jealous, it's a character flaw of his that he does actually try to work on in canon, but you are ignoring all of his other traits that clearly Hermione likes, which is his bravery, loyalty, maybe even his sense of humour?

I'd be more worried about Ron getting with Hermione, because she has never been called out on her questionable actions, is vicious when she's slighted, to the point that physical and mental assault are perfectly justified for her (literally making the decision to mind wipe her parents, probably against their will, is just /so/ many red flags) and shows all the character growth of a flat-line.

When I say ‚Äòhopefully they matured' I'm talking about her too, because she shouldn't be with anyone as she is in the series, nobody deserves that.

**** This is my main complaint when romione fans say that Ron would mature with age, and that Ron and Hermione's communication skills would get better in time. We know for a fact that in /canon/ they did not get better. Hermione still nagged at Ron and treated him like a child. Ron lies to Hermione to avoid her nagging. Nineteen years later and their communication is still very much fucked.

Romione is one of those things that could have been good in theory but was executed so poorly that majority of the good stuff pretty much just exists in people's imaginations.

Edit: Ron /had begun/ lying to Hermione to avoid her nagging.

I do like Romione, because it's one of the more realistic ships, that definitely isn't perfect, it's one that takes work from both characters,but ultimately still love each other in the end.

I do, however, recognize that it, and the characters have their flaws, and could have objectively been portrayed better. Honestly, I'm down for literally all ships, in the world of fanfiction, anything can work, but for canon, it's what we got and I'm not necessarily unhappy with it.

As for them being fine, that's debatable. While I like Ron as a character, their relationship starts because he decides to try and protect the House elves. Not bad, but all that was needed for me to fully enjoy their relationship--and not make me wonder why she didn't use Cursed Child to retcon it--is a simple sentence in Order of the Phoenix.

Ron, after passing the tryout for the Quidditch team, turned to Harry and asked "do you think this will impress Hermione?"

Simple, and then justifies her jealousy of Lavender in Half-Blood Prince, and gives a deeper meaning to Ron's jealousy of the kiss she had with Krum.

** I definitely love book Harry/Ginny but hate them together in the movies. Movie Harry and Hermione should have ended up together. As far as Ron and Hermione, I have gone back and forth and think that they would be one of those couples that are together for like 6 months before agreeing that they're better off friends both in books and movies.

There's a couple of other things that have floated through my mind before, but I can't think of them right now.

** Dumbledore giving out 170 points to Gryffindor at the Leaving Feast and thus humiliating everyone in Slytherin, when it was supposed to be their celebration.

None of them had anything to do with Quirrellmort's run on the Stone. 99% of them had never done anything to harm Harry. But all of them were made to look like fools, because...Dumbledore didn't have a chance to hand out points sooner? Because giving a handful of Gryffindor children a public morale boost was more important than the morale of dozens or hundreds of Slytherin children? Because JKR's depiction of Slytherin House is in practice, if not in theory, designed to be an acceptable target?

** I definitely agree with you on Romione. My problem with it is that people's assumption of them "getting better over time" is about as canonical as Harry being attracted to Hermione. It didn't actually happen in the books.

  Like, I'd understand if it was six months before, but two years? Just seems creepy to me.

I'm going to start here because I get what you mean. His possessiveness and sense of entitlement towards her really creeped me out too. And the books never did resolve Ron's feelings of jealousy over Hermione. He doesn't learn to have a healthier regard for Hermione - instead, it validated his possessiveness.

  ‚ÄúAfter you left,‚Äù he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron's face was hidden, ‚Äúshe cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . .‚Äù
#+end_quote

We also see in the /epilogue/ that their communication pattern are still as terrible as when they were teenagers. He's guiltlessly lying to her, and it's implied that she still nags him all the same as they did in school.

  ‚ÄúParked all right, then?‚Äù Ron asked Harry. ‚ÄúI did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confund the examiner.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúNo, I didn't,‚Äù said Hermione, ‚ÄúI had complete faith in you.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, I /did/ Confund him,‚Äù Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train.

  ‚ÄúI only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.‚Äù

And even if I /did/ give that Ron became a better person over time, that still doesn't change how they have fundamentally different values. While a grown-up Ron can be good for Hermione (he sounds like the type who would bully her to eat and sleep which she would need), /Hermione/'s priorities have always been her duties - often at the expense of her personal relationships. If we keep her canon personality, Ron won't even rank as /part/ of her priorities. Her own natural tendencies would trigger the hell out of his insecurities.

Being with her is probably the single most masochistic thing Ron can do to himself.
