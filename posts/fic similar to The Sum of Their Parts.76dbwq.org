  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I find linkffn(Made of Common Clay by Lomonaaeren) a little bit similar.

*** Just a little, yeah. I like quite a bit of Lomona's other stuff but this is very weak. Harry reads like a caricature. His opponents read like simpletons. And the rest of the characters act like either powerless victims or retarded halfwits.

1/5 and I'm generous.

**** Yes, I do prefer The Art of Self-Fashioning (their other gen fic) to this one, but it is still early days... This Harry reads very differently to what I'm used to, but I'm curious to see what the payoff will be.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

** This is far from a perfect fit for your request but in this fic Harry does blow up a bank and then try to rebuild wizarding society for the better. Been a while since I've read it. Linkffn(5890484)

  Tear it all down and build it back up, better. It's a modest goal.
