Any fics where Ron specifically defeats/humilates Malfoy


** Fate by TheTrueSpartan

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

***** Oh, wow. I summoned the bot, refreshed the page, and didn't see this response immediately, so I assumed it didn't work and deleted my comment.
