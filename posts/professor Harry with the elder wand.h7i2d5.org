*** Hmm there was one where Harry traveled back in time and landed by accident in Lockhart body, I don't remember how much pressure was put on teacher job beside that he was far better than original Gilderoy

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

** Kinda random but why didn't they name hogwarts The Scotland Institute Of Magic? SIOM for short. I know with the story she probably called it hogwarts for creativity. But in the magical world it would make more sense to call it the above name. Just a thought.

***** It may have predated Scotland itself, it's said the school is more than a thousand years old, and Scotland was founded/established around the 9th Century.

At that time they wouldn't call it an Institute anyway, probably a College or Academy(the equivalents in old English at least)
