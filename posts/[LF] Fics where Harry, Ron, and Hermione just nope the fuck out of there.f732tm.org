Exactly what it says on the tin. Any fics where Harry (preferably accompanied by Ron and/or Hermione) take one look around at what's going on and decide they want no part of it. Give me anything with the Golden Trio on the run from both the Light and the Dark. Something like Escape by SingularOddities would be great.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

** This one has always been a favorite of mine. It's a rather AU oneshot where the entire Ministry Six get the fuck out of dodge after defeating Voldemort and they figure out that a new dark lord is on the rise. I think it does a really good job at showing how such a potential situation could happen, keeping everyone in character, and showing the corruption, cowardice, and selfishnss of the Wizarding World. I think it also does a good job at showing just how badly a war and insurgency would fuck up a bunch of vulnerable teenagers, and how it could disillsuion them of wanting to fight any further.

*** After Order of the Phoenix and the scene in Dumbledore's office, Harry leaving or doing his own thing, saying "screw the Wizarding world and dark lord bs" became a whole subgenre.

I must have read dozens to hundreds of them back in the day but I don't remember most.

For just Harry leaving and having non-plot related adventures, Make A Wish (and the following Mr Black stories) by Rorschach's Blot likely qualifies. Make a Wish is probably that author's most popular story, having several sequels and guest authors for additional stories on their old Yahoo Group. They also did a popular version of Harry taking over Azkaban, Lord of Caer Azkaban.

I can't speak for the quality of the writing since I haven't read it in maybe 10 years or more, but I remember it being fun and Harry building up his abilities in strange ways and meeting odd characters along his meandering journey around the world.

  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup - to escape where the contract can't follow; across borders where the Ministry's laws can't follow him. Where he goes changes him, and those who remained change too. Desperate measures implemented change how paths are walked for not just Harry but others too.
