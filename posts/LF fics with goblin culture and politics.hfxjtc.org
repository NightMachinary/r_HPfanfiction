Almost all fics I've read treat "the goblins"/Gringotts as one group that all act the same even though there's got to be internal disputes and politics. I'm looking for something that focuses on that.


** I feel obliged to mention linkffn(Harry Crow), since I'm one of the few redditors here that actually like it, which primarily centers around a Harry Potter raised by a goblin. It also involves OP Harry, a rather ridiculous version of Harry/Hermione, and manipulative!idiot!Dumbledore.

I swear, the manipulative Dumbledore trope would be so much more popular if authors didn't always make him an idiot when trying to be manipulative.

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

To be fair, if you are a time traveler and have the Bradygames walkthrough book and you don't make Manipulative Dumbledore look like an idiot, you are doing something wrong.

You have the walkthrough right there.

That fic is great for giving culture and soul to the Goblins. They were seriously neglected in canon.

Yeah, sure, but it's also prevalent in non-time travel fics.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.
