I've been looking for a specific fan fiction for YEARS. The details I remember about it: - Time traveling Harry - One of the pairings is Harry/Ginny - Luna is involved in helping send Harry back - Something about Draco speaking spanish that I never go into the fic long enough to find out why - At one point or another it was on FF.net

That's all I can remember from it, but I've been scouring the internet for YEARS looking for this.
