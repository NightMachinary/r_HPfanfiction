I've done a lot of research into Jung and Type psychology in the last couple of years, and it occurs to me that I may be able to shed some light onto the plight of the multi housed. The right solution levers the might of a theory I found on YouTube one night describing multiple sides of the mind. People who set their sights on belonging to the likes of different houses ought to consider where their preferences lie, for while they might fight for two houses, their use in the mind is no tie. /Sigh./


** I like your thoughts, unfortunately, I don't have much to add.

*** To be honest, that's better than a lot of comments I see that make someone else's thing there thing with little to no actual contribution.

** That's why I think the Hat is more magical than just mind-reading, it probably reads the person's soul and applies some divination(limited precog).

** Maybe it's just me, but your wording is hard to read.

Secondly, I'd like to note that Jung is generally outdated in Psych today.

However, even nowadays many companies still use these insights, so it's possible jkr was inspired.

Lastly, I always found sorting to more simple than most make it out to be. It's just whatever the student wants at this point in time.

Neville wanted bravery. Hermione wanted to make a difference, Ron wanted glory, Harry wanted to follow Ron. etc

Inside the houses we get self-fullfilling prophecies, influenced by surroundings of the 4 micro cultures.
