**** That last bit about the stars and the witches in Pendle... Absolute killer.

I nearly didn't read the Snape Chronicles due to the dialect at the start - and it is a bit of a slow burn to begin with - but I'm so glad I did. Utterly absorbing.

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  Severus Snape is thirteen. Riding the train back to King's Cross. He's watching London rise up out of green fields dotted with sheep. The train rushes over bridges and through tunnels covered in graffiti. The vibration of the train is rhythmic, like blood whooshing through a jugular.
