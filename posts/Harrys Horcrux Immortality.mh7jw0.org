So, I have read that fanfiction, where Voldemort stated that Harry, as a Horcrux, could only be killed by three things: the Killing Curse, Basilisk Venom and Fiendfyre.

Because Horcruxes can canonicly only be killed by those three things, I asked myself: Do you think Nagini and Harry were really near-immortal as long as they had the Horcrux in them?

What would have happened if something else would have killed them? Like Harry falling down a broom and breaking his neck. Would he be able to stand up and walk away from it? Or would it, as falling from high places is not one of the three things that can kill a Horcrux, have only killed Harry and the Horcrux taking over his dead body? What do you think would have happend, if Harry was killed by another thing that those three?


** He would have stayed dead I believe, im pretty sure that the canon states that the horcruxes are incredibly hard to destroy because of protective enchantments voldemort later added rather than just innately because of being horcruxes therefore harry wouldnt have any

*** What do you think of Nagini? She must have had those protections then.

**** she probably had a fair enchantments making her a lot tougher, but the point of destroying a horcrux wasnt that there is only three things that destroy them it was that you had to do something to them that put them beyond the reach of magical repair. death, in any form, comes under that banner.

**** I think there's only so much protective enchantments you can put on a living being. Otherwise why didn't everyone do it to them selves. Or why didn't the put them on Hedwig

** As explained in DH, Horcruxes are not almost indestructible because they are Horcruxes. Their resilience comes from the fact that Dark Wizards first enchant a "suitable container" (by adding all the protections they can think of) before putting their soul inside. Since Harry doesn't have any of this protections, he is just as durable as any other wizard (as show by all the injuries he suffer throughout the series), and could be killed by the same things as them.

Also, it is a personal opinion, but I don't think the Killing Curse would work on a "normal" Horcrux. It worked on Harry because he was "alive", and it would probably also have worked on Nagini, but since the other are not truly "alive", and the Killing Curse would not be able to break their container, I don't think it would work.

And, if anything else than Voldemort had killed Harry, I think he would just have died normaly, and the Horcruxe with him. Dumbledore whole plan in DH with Harry sacrifice was not there to destroy the Horcrux, but to give Harry a chance to survive the experience (though I kinda like the idea of a dead Harry being possessed by the Scarcrux).

â€‹

PS : I can't remember the name, but I remember seeing a fic that plays with this idea, with a child Harry that discovers he is kinda immortal and makes experiences about it.

Totally forget about that part to be honest. Thanks for the reminder!

*** Going off of Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel in the DoM, the killing curse can cause physical damage to objects though. I had to check my copy and see, but Dumbledore blocks it with stuff several times.

1. Golden wizard statue - bounced off harmlessly
2. One armed centaur statue - burst into millions of pieces
3. Fawkes - died and got reborn

I don't know why it didn't break the first statue and only the second. So, maybe it can break a horcrux?
