Everyone thinks Dumbledore puts potions into his lemon drops but they're wrong he's actually putting weed. Secretly he's been spiking his lemon drops with weed thats why he's always so calm and chill and why he makes absolutely no sense half the time. Because only someone on drugs would let a first year play quidditch of course. And thats why he always wants to give other people his drops because he wants his entire school to be potheads.

** This reminds me of alchoholic dumbledore from magicks of the arcane:

Completely out of breath, he leaned against the cold and soothing stone of Hogwarts and transfigured a simple pocket watch out of a pebble as the sun had begun to descend and he wanted to check the time.

He saw that he still had enough time to get a decent dinner in the kitchens without bothering about curfew, when an exhausted looking Dumbledore came walking towards him. Harry wondered why the headmasters wand was lying in his palm and pointed towards him, but chalked it up to some craziness from the older man.

"Harry my boy,-" the headmaster started and gasped for air. "-your movements in the last hour have been incredibly erratic." Now, that statement was certainly true, but what a way to spout random informations.

"I searched for you-" he said and took another deep breath. "-and even my highly modified Point-Me spell has led me running all over the castle."

"I was talking a walk..." The look Dumbledore gave him really made his day.

"Anyway, why did you look for me?" he asked and inwardly chanted a mantra. Please don't remember, please don't remember! "I remembered some things about the evening of the Yuletide ball." Fuck.

The headmaster trailed off, but the famous twinkle blasted out of his eyes with full power. "I will have you know, that in the over fifty years in which my beard was the same length, I did not even once trip about it."

Harry could only look down, his neck crept with a flush. This kind of situation had the innate potential to be incredibly mortifying for a young student. "But don't worry, I'm not here to scold you." Dumbledore said and Harrys gaze snapped upwards. "Instead,-" the Headmaster continued not bothered. "- I am here to swear you to secrecy."

"You see, my ill-mannered affliction to the delectable brews filled with alcohol has been a well guarded secret for nearly over a century now and as people are already calling me an old goat-" he gave Harry a sly wink. "- it would be bad if they knew of it..."

Did his headmaster really just admit that he was an incurable binge drinker? What the effin hell... this day truly couldn't get any more weired.

"And as an incentive to guard my secret most viciously,-" he pulled something out if his robes. "- I'll give you this. Use it well!" With those words Dumbledore vanished into the castle and left a thoroughly bewildered Harry behind.

As he looked down, he saw a bottle of finest Firewhisky in his hands. The day couldn't get any more weired? He had spoken too soon...

***** Haha I would like to write my dumbledore similar to this, but the very beginning of my first chapter has my voldemort commiting an act so vile against house dumbledore that it might be hard to to write him as being so upbeat and cheery.

If your curious what I'm having V do to dumbledore so early, I can PM you with a clipping of the text. I kinda wanna see what someone else thinks of it anyways lol

********* Cool. How much do you want? I'm still working on the first chapter, but I can send up to 5092 words, which is where I'm currantly at. Im actually writing as we speak lol. If you want to read it all that's fine, and likely helpful. I always reread my work a lot to catch errors and inconsistencies, but another pair of eyes is always nice
