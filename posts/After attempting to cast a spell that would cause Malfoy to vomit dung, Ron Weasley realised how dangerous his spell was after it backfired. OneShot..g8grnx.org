** In linkffn(My Life as a Teenage Gladiator by 1hellyeahz1) there is a similar thought: Lavender Brown knows how much damage to a small rodent dropping him can cause (she dropped her beloved rabbit) and so she is completely horrified when the fake Alastor Moody bounces Draco Malfoy transformed into a white ferret.

Chapter Fourteen: Lavender finally talks to Trelawney.
