I've been on a crossover kick lately, specifically with the Star Wars, ASOIAF, or Marvel universes. I've noticed though that most of the stories I'm finding have Harry ending up in that universe as opposed to something set in the wizarding world.

Can anyone provide some good examples where characters from the above crossover universes end up in the HP world and interact with Harry and company?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]]: Sith Harry rampages through HP world. Typical Darth Marrs fic with lots of ups and downs

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]]: Ginny becomes the new Slayer and takes the lead in Horcrux Hunt.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]]: It's a very rare crossover with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantai_Collection][Kantai Fleetgirls]], in which Voldemort returned in form of zombie battleship Bismarck. The Trio fortunately receives help from the recalled HMS Hood.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]]: Ahsoka Tano ends up on Earth and raise Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]]: As the title says, tomb raiding plays a central part in fighting Voldemort.

If you ever wanted to throw someone logical into HP world and see what would happen, this is /laugh until you cry/ hysterical. As the author says "I threw Ed Elric at wizards. What more could you want?"

Nothing, is the correct answer to that. It is /amazing/.

** I love me a good crossover. A couple of my favorites:

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/6972218/1/Rediscovery]]

A Star Trek: TNG crossover which errs in making the future wizarding society a bit too much a carbon copy of the 20th Century British one, but otherwise good. Feels very true to both the Potterverse and Trek settings, and somehow manages to merge them very well. Complete.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/2856276/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eagle-of-Truthiness]]

Stephen Colbert (in his Colbert Report character) teaches DADA. Short fic, also complete.

And a shameless plug for one of my own:

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/12769170/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gargoyle-s-Curse]]

Harry Potter/Gargolyes crossover. Unfinished. Not the only Potter crossover I've written (or, rather, started and not finished, for which I do apologize), but in my own humble opinion my strongest work to date.
