I love a good time travel / redo fic ( and I even write some) , but it is getting more diffocult to find new ideas and yet not explored themes, so I thought about sharing my own views on what a good time travel fic would be, a couple of recommendations and also, ask you if you have some titles to add to this thread:

1) I am against ANY time travel fic that sees a character CHOOSING not to meddle with time, especially in the Marauders Era. My reasoning is simple: why the hell would someone be given the chance of time travelling if NOT to change things? I read many well written time fictions that have, for instance, Hermione travelling back JUST to be the object of affections of Marauders and suddenly discover her sex appeal while crying that she cannot do anything to stop Voldermort killing her "friends" otherwise Harry would not be born ( how in the hell avoiding Marlene Mckinnon getting killed willl affect James Potter from impregnating Lily?)

2) I also dislike when the time traveller is either too sure of himself to the point it becomes a super hero, or , again in the case of Hermione, said character just time travels to have sex with as many people as possible ;

3) I enjoy a good measure of humour , characters that have learnt from their mistakes in time travel fics and when the author does not completely change a character personality to fit its plot, especially in A.U fics ( honestly, I read some fics where Harry is as anti-muggle as Voldermort , some even having HermioneÂ´s know it all reinforce his prejudices)

4) I also have some problems with overuse of Canon pairings in A.U and

5)I tend to prefer long fics ( 100.000words) but not like MASSIVE fics or series of over 3 fics

In this view, I would like to reccomend :

I hate those dumb time travels as well. I mean if you were given the ultimate deus ex machina of time travel, you might as well use it! What's the fucking point to rehash canon plot rails again and again? I would rather read JKR's original.

That being said, I have several time travels (not only Marauder Era) to recommend in which the time travelers decide to fuck the time line right from the start:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione time traveled to her two years old self in 1981. Hilarity ensued, but also heart breaking moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry was thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. He started out a little slow, but got things going eventually. Not everything went the protagonists's way though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): Ginny accomplished her primary mission objective in a very efficient and painless way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): It's a very unique Hermione to Marauder Era time travel narrated from James Potter's POV. She didn't get paired with anyone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): As the summary says, Harry would kill ALL of them, but without involving the kids.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Harry and his girls finished them off even before they were supposed to go back to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): Basically an one-shot, but it's the only time travel fic in which Hermione KILLED Tom Riddle in his orphanage instead of raising or shagging him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 day (!) old Rose were thrown back in Aug 31 1991, and they got down to business immediately. This fic has a very good plot and great Trio friendship, but is somewhat in lacking in grammar and spelling.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Powerful Harry somehow ended up in 1970, and began fucking over Death Eaters immediately. Bellatrix was very impressed.

*** I think I'd read A Little Child Shall Lead Them before and then forgotten about it. It's not especially revolutionary, but the wipe and gradual restore of Hermione's alternate memories is touching, and the whole thing wraps up quickly enough to not overstay its welcome. Worth a read, since it doesn't take long.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

*** Delenda Est was an interesting one. It reached my favorites list due to the first half, but the second half let it down. And yet, the second half had a lot of unfulfilled potential. It lacked tension and credible opposition, and yet there were plenty of hooks that could have been turned into that.

It's still on my favorites list, because the first half was worth it.

** I agree with most of your stuff, and even like some of the fics you rec'd, but Knowledge is Power is trash. It is easily Robst's worst fic (he even agrees, which is why he's rewriting it, though the rewrite is just as bad IMHO). The fact that Harry and Hermione create a new school, which they want taken seriously, that is named PISS is just so totally unbelievable so as to ruin the whole story for me. That and then the story gets distracted from the new school idea with the orphanage. Not only that, but what kind of mansion are they living in in Italy that can house, school and feed hundreds of people? I like robst's stories for the most part (I'm a big HHR fan), but Knowledge is power is god awful.
