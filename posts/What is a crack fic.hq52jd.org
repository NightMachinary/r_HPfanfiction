While you're at it explain what a fluff fic is too üòì


** A crack Fic is the author writing on crack, thus don't expect logic reason or plot to get in the way of writing whatever the hell they what.

Fluff is all the gooey emotional romance shit that makes your teeth hurt with the amount of sugar in it. Normal lacks Lewds and plot.

*** Outright hilarity! A great Crack Fic has me laughing aloud and enjoying the absurdity. My favorite Crack Fic author is Corvusdraconis on Fanction.net.

** Crack is when the logic of the story doesn't really hold up if you think about it too hard, but the story is still hilarious. Can be thought of as either ‚Äúwritten while on crack‚Äù or ‚Äúmake you crack up laughing‚Äù.

Fluff is lovey-dovey romance or emotions. It's sweet, or adorable, and almost always isn't really explicit. Not restricted to romantic relationships, sometimes is about parents and children being happy as a family. It makes you feel happy inside, ‚Äúas if your insides are made of fluff‚Äù.

** Also the sub-category of 'Crack Taken Seriously'.

Which in my head means the initial story premise is still totally weird or the overall tone is very lighthearted and funny, but the author maintains a certain amount of internal logic within the story that pulls it all together or has the characters reacting seriously/logically to a really ridiculous situation.

The Harry Potter fandom is one of the bigger users of this tag on AO3. In my experience not every fandom makes the distinction.

** I'd define crack as fics that make no sense /on purpose/, usually for comedic reasons. Heavy plot holes, author's comments in the story itself, anything that you might find on [[/r/iamveryrandom][r/iamveryrandom]]. Not to be confused with shitty fics, which are just horribly written without any comedic value.

** Crack fiction: linkffn(5251386)

Fluff fic: linkffn(8788999)

The story which was originally one of these (perhaps even both), but somehow it got life of its own and became a bit more serious: linkffn(13132217).
