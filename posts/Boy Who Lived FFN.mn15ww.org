Hello Reddit HPFF Community!

Long time lurker, first-time poster. I wanted to self-promote a HP fanfic I have been working on called The Boy Who Lived. FFN link (13464146): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13464146/1/The-Boy-Who-Lived]]

*Summary*: What if when Voldemort heard the prophecy, he decided that not only would he go after Neville and Harry, but every child born in that year? What if he decided to kill all children born the year before and the year after as well, just to be on the safe side? Harry Potter is the only boy who lived through the Purge, no one knows why. How will a young Harry Potter now cope?

I've written a lot of HP FFN in the past, A LOT of cringe-worthy stuff. This is the first one I have ever been remotely proud of. Not saying it's spectacular or anything, but if any of you like a bit of magical mystery set in a messed up radically AU world, please give my story a go. It's officially 60% done at this point and I am approx. 7-10 chapters away from the end. My goal is to wrap up the story in the next few months (by July latest).

*Fair warning:*

(1) It is dark and probably somewhat different from standard tropes. I've tried my best to stay away from fanon tropes with this one and strive for as much originality as my limited skills will allow me. Not saying I've achieved that, just that I've tried.

(2) Harry is very much a normal, average 11 year old set in even more perilous circumstances than in canon. He is not Super!Harry or God!Harry or Endless-Titles-and-Surnames!Harry, he is pretty much going through the meat-grinder in my story.

(3) I have no 'bashing' of anyone in this story. Dumbledore is a kind and intelligent old man who is weighed down by a lot of mistakes that he freely admits to having made and does not have nearly as much clout as canon Dumbledore did at the beginning of the series.

*TL;DR*: It's extremely AU and potentially saddening.

If any of you feel that something like this might be your cup of tea, please give it a go and I would love to hear your thoughts should you decide to review it. If not, thanks so much for reading this post and considering my story anyway! :)
