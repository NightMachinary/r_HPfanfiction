Does anyone know of any good Harry Potter / Game of Thrones crossovers?


** Several, one abandoned but still worth reading, another still in progress, and another that is decent in both quality and length.

(This is the incomplete one) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/1/][The difference one man can make by Joen1801]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11255223/1/][The wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter]]

Bit of background for the last one. This is technically a sequel to a story called "lightning Dragons Roar" by the same author. The entire series is a massive "multiverse Crossover" it is utterly unique among Fanfiction as far as I am aware and is quite good. As an example of this, the method of initiating the GoT crossover is rooted in an immediately previous Devil May Cry crossover. The entire thing is worth reading and is quite interesting all around.

1st in the series [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][Lightning Dragons Roar by Zero Rewind]]

2nd in the series [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11904771/1/A-Song-of-Ice-Fire-and-Lightning][A Song of Ice Fire and Lighting by Zero Rewind]]

#+begin_quote
  Reborn as the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, Hadrian must shoulder the responsibilities of being heir to Casterly Rock and play the game of thrones. As war takes hold will he rise to win the game or will he be crushed by the factions all around him. Rated M to be safe.
