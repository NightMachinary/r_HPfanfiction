I'm really new to all this fanfic jargon and websites but basically I am looking for a story in J.K.Rowling's style of writing about Albus Severus Potter and his adventures at Hogwarts and maybe even living at the Potters house. Preferably book length.


** I like using the [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net][scryer]] to find fics. You can select the character(s) that you want and the length and then sort by various methods.

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.
