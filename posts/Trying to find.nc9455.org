:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi I'm looking for a Harry Potter fanfic he's made housless kicked out of grtffindor by Ron. Hermione Fred George and Neville try to convince gryffindor to change there mind but eventually they become housless too. Professor mcgonnal never notices and gets mad when she finally realizes he's not sleep in the dorm and eating at the table (the gryffindors wouldn't let him eat). Professor flitwik and snape eventually realize and they all come together to get resorted before they get outed as housless.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he's had enough, he's sick of pretending to be stupid, he's sick of constantly fighting against the whole world. It's time to step up and take control of his life.

** This sounds like it might be two different stories mixed together. The first part sounds like Exclusion by Maethoriel Raina.

Not sure about the second, though.
