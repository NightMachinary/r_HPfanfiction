(Disclaimer: this is a personal off my chest, not an instruction on how to live your life)

It's been nearly 9 years since The Deathly Hallows came out and, in that time, I've read through Harry completing his journey through Hogwarts hundreds of times, each in slightly different ways.

I've seen him fall in love with almost every named character. I've hated a character in one fic, only to love them in another.

Frankly, I can't even tell you what was canon and what was fanfiction any more.

Then I've moved on to fics involving other characters, and some that were so removed from the canon story line that the author might as well have changed a few names and released it as an original story.

So, for me, it's time to put Harry Potter back on the shelf, and find a new set of characters to fall in love with. With a bit of luck, they may even be real.

Thanks for listening.


** I thought the same thing a few years ago, and now I'm back. ;)

Best of luck for the future, hope you find a new world that's just as captivating.

Sometimes I get sick of the books I've read so, so many times and just have to give them a rest, but whenever times are difficult, they're still going to be there. So: have fun out there, but if you need to come back, we'll welcome you with open arms.

** Recommendations, then! Disclaimer: not all of these are books as in novels.

If you're still partial to the whole magical teenager saving the world thing, try the Skulduggery Pleasant series (by Derek Landy, nine books, complete). It's more dark urban fantasy than HP, has an interesting and well thought-out magic system, and the characters tend to, well, act a lot smarter. Also it's chock-full of dry, black humor. Basically it's amazing.

If you don't like the "urban" in "dark urban fantasy", or much of the "fantasy", there's a manga called Claymore that's less about spellcasting magic and more about badass human-monster hybrids killing everything with giant-ass swords in a mediaeval setting, with crazy political machinations going on in the background. It's a very tragic and visceral story with touches of horror though, and if you're not a manga reader it might be a bit difficult to get into (whole different set of popular tropes and all that).

Speaking of comics/graphic novels, if you liked HP's sassy humor then you could pick up a Deadpool comic (if you haven't already). Here's a [[http://www.comingsoon.net/extras/features/645971-best-deadpool-comics][good quick guide]] on where to start.

Also I will always, always recommend the Discworld series because /it's freaking Discworld!/

Finally if you're tired of fantasy (or you weren't really a fantasy person to begin with) then I'd recommend Haruki Murakami's works. /Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman/ is my personal favourite, followed by /Kafka on the Shore/.

Good luck out there!

P.S. I just started reading it and half of Reddit is crazy about it, so maybe you could try the web serial Worm?

Also give Steven Universe a shot! ^{^{And}} ^{^{Madoka}} ^{^{Magica}}

** Sad to see someone fall of the train. For me, I have never been able to let go nor do I think that I ever fully will. I have read other things and even stayed away for a year or 2 but the call is always there for me.

** Honestly for me I started reading the books when I was 8 and I am still absolutely captivated by the universe today at 19. I am near the same point you are where I have read so much fanfiction that I sometimes forget which details are canon and which are fanon and also I have hit the point where I really have to dig to find something that I haven't read that also interests me. I wish you the best of luck in finding another fandom to fall in love with but for me I don't think I will ever grow out of Harry Potter.

** [QUOTE]Frankly, I can't even tell you what was canon and what was fanfiction any more.[/QUOTE]

I've probably read over 100 millions words worth of fanfiction, and that's not true for me at all. It's usually very easy to tell what's not canon since most authors do not have the talent that JKR does.

So, you read the Alexandra Quick series and realize it could be very easy to just pull a 50 shades of grey and change the names?

True, but a lot of that talent lies in world building and character creation. When you have the characters and universe established for you, it's not all that hard to match the writing style somewhat.

**** That, and some things in fanon aren't leaps of logic, but little shuffles instead. Tempus isn't canon (hell, roman numeral clocks don't seem to be canon), despite it being a very simple, logical spell that seems very useful.
