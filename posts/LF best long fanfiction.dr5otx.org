  Harry and Spencer meet as children (timelines adapted to make Spencer two years older than Harry). Even though they only spend three weeks together, having the support of a friend, even one he can only communicate with by letter, transforms Harry's attitudes to life and those around him and may even help save his life and win a war.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) Currently my fave HP fanfic series. I love the historic world building and well, the characterization of nearly everyone.

Linkao3(There May be Some Collateral Damage by Metisket) Not the most sensible crossover with Bleach, but an entertaining one for sure.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent by Barb LP) Warning; teen hormones are all over the place. I rather like those older fanfics that were written before the series were completed. It's interesting to see what they made of it.

Linkao3(Face Death in the Hope by LullabyKnell) Accidental angsty time travel with cute, yet awkward! familial vibes to soothe it all.

Linkao3(Switchverse by Corvidae9) Kinda cracky. Don't let the word count mislead you; it's an entire series that will exceed the 50K requirement when you add all the parts together.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

*** Also here are some other fics which I enjoyed. (Mostly slash, I hope you don't mind)

Linkao3(4148136) A Marvel x Harry Potter crossover. Brilliantly written, great relationships and characterizations and the plot was great. Pairing Loki/Harry

Linkao3(1134255) A Sherlock x Harry Potter Crossover. Also really good. Pairing is Mycroft/Harry

Linkao3(3205676) It's shorter, I think about 15 k but there I would recommend you to take a look at the whole series, I think it's only two works at the moment therefor you get to read a little bit morw, it's also really good and funny. Basically Harry and Hermione examine the veil of Death and everytime you walk through you land in a different Universe. This one is a Supernatural x Harry Potter crossover, the next work in the series is a HP x Marvel Crossover. Here is no real pairing but I think Ginny/Harry is mentioned in one of the works but there is no focus on that.

Linkao3(9372596) I remember that fic to be very well written, excellent writing style. The pairing is Voldemort/Harry so some people aren't very into that. But I think the author has some other good works too.

Linkao3(11244426) Pairing Tom Riddle/Harry Potter. If you like that pairing I would definetly rec you to check it out. The ending always gets me, and I remember it to be quite good also

Linkao3(4340120) One of my favorites. Harry and Hermione travel to the marauders era. Pairing Hermione/Remus and Sirius/Harry

Linkao3(979182) Pairing Sirius/Harry. A 16 year old Sirius appears out of the marauders map in the year after the original/older version died.

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
