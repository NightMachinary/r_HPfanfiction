I know in canon Draco is supposed to be Harry's rival, or at least in his mind he is, but I'm looking for any fics where Harry has an honest to god rival. Someone he's constantly competing against, someone who is just as good at magic as him, etc.

** There's a good one by Sage Ra, called Harry Potter and the elemental ____. I can't recall the title or link it right now as I'm on mobile but I'll do it later.

#+begin_quote
  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.
