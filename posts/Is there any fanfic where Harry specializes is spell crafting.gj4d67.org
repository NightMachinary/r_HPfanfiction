Hi, as the title says, could you recommend me a fanfic that revolves around spell crafting?

Thank you ðŸ˜¸


** In this case it should have been a request, recommendations is when you recommend a fanfic. Maybe linkffn(For the love of magic) and linkffn(Albus and Harry's world trip) seems to be heading in this direction, also a little at linkffn(The mind arts), although it isn't really the focus.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable, and allows him to use magic that no one's ever heard of, that no one's ever seen. But as time goes on, and he becomes more and more entangled in the webs spun by those around him, he starts to realize just how deep the magical rabbit hole goes and how dangerous power like his can be. All Harry had ever wanted was for the world to make sense.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Angsty story based on Broomstick Flyers story 'Please Believe Me'. Heavy Hermione bashing to start, but will be H/Hr. Timetravel, AU, and limited soulbond. Please Read & Review Upping the rating due to language.
