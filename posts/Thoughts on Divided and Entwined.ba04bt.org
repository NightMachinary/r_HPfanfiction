For those who have read it, is it worth the read if I'm looking for a romione-centric story with an actual plot?


** Starfox writes entertaining fics I don't mind reading a couple of times. I've always felt that his stories have probably the best Ron in fanfiction. That being said read his fanfiction bio for his headcanon.

** Is it worth the read? That depends if you like Starfox-style plots or not, which generally features the following:

- Strong, badass, competent pro-active Hermione as a central protagonist.

- Major theme of muggles and muggleborns versus the evil pureblood power structure.

- Mugglewank. Muggle weapons and technology used against wizards and winning.

- Fix-it plots that patch up or solve the perceived flaws of the canon Potterverse.

- Decent writing. Spellchecked, lots of action scenes, but pretty dry prose overall. If you prefer more poetic/literary style prose, or even JKR's style of writing, you'll be disappointed.

I'd say that it's more about people taking what Sirius did with his motorbike and Arthur did with his Ford Anglia and applying it to weapons to create stuff that's incrementally better than what typical combat-trained wizards can do but not that much better. It's kind of how the motorbike and the car were better than brooms and carpets in some ways, but not overwhelmingly so. Outside of /Marriage Law Revolution/, I don't think Muggles are meaningfully involved, either.

** You will like it if you like the following:

- Revolution that eventually overthrows the corrupt, incompetent, and malicious Ministry/Wizengamot
- Hardline, uncompromising stance against those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums aka Death Eaters
- Detailed depiction of military and intelligence ops
- Lots of politics and intrigues
- BAMF Trio
- Hermione centric
- Great Ron
- Political hack Dumbledore
- Rational Voldemort
- Fun and competent Sirius
- No canon Horcrux Hunt as Voldemort has something much more devious and dangerous
- Astronomical body count
- Awesome battles and fight scenes

*** Lmao, at this point "Starfox" is now its own sub-genre of HP fanfic. There are Indie fics, Whump fics, Dark fics, Marauders fics, and Starfox fics.

***** [[/u/Starfox5]], parent has a point (not that I would know what a 3D porn comic would look like >_> ). You've got a lot of fans---maybe get someone to draw some covers for you?

****** I decided to do my own covers for a few reasons. First, I like 3D rendering. I don't claim to be good at it, but it's fun creating a picture.

Second, I'm not going to step on anyone's toes by using my own stuff. No legal trouble - all models were bought fair and square. No back and forth between artist and me, no potential trouble about who owns what. No "but I imagined this character differently", either. No waiting on a commissioned piece before I can publish a story.

Third, "it looks like a 3D porn comic" basically means "I associate 3D renders with porn" and that's, honestly a shitty argument. It's on the level of "mangas remind of hentai manga", and insults a lot of 3D rendering artists who create fantastic pictures.

Now, "they look bad" might be a valid criticism - although there's a lot of bias and personal taste there - but I spend on average about 30 minutes to an hour on any cover picture, roughly the same amount of time I spend on writing a single scene, with no postwork in photoshop or such, so that's not exactly surprising.

So, in short: I don't intend to invest a lot of time and effort in changing my covers just so a number of people who associate 3D renders with porn won't be offended by them.

******* Fair enough. I don't actually think they look like 3D porn comics, just really rough renders. /Do/ you get fan art of your fics? I don't recall you ever linking to any, but I could have easily missed some.

******** Not to my knowledge.

(Also, they may look like rough renders, but I'll take them over a stolen/borrowed picture any day of the week. A quick glance at the first page of HP stories on FFNet certainly didn't reveal a plethora of great original cover pictures.)

** I've read about half. I think it does quite a good job of depicting how "war is hell". Eventually it was a bit too grim for me, but it's well constructed, certainly.

Not sure I'd call it Romione-centric, though. I don't even recall whether that ship was a thing in the first half, but if so, it certainly wasn't the centre of the story. The centre of the story is war.

*** Originally, it was planned to be a Harry/Hermione story, but as I wrote, Ron turned out to be the one to win her heart. I hadn't decided on that, though, until the moment I wrote the scene where it happened.

Also, it's grim, but it has a happy ending.
