*** While I do love that story, that Harry is an eldritch death god. Not quite what I'm looking for. Specifically, I want a fic where the Angel of Death (Gabriel according to Judeo-Christian tradition or Azrael as the Islamic name for essentially the same individual) is incarnated into human form to destroy Voldemort.
