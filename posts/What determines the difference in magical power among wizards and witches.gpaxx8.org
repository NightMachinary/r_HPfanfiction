In canon, Dumbledore himself said that Harry's powers won't make a significant difference when compared to him, and Voldemort and Dumbledore are stated to be more powerful than other wizards.

Since 'magical cores' and 'magical exhaustion' are fanon theories which contradict canon, what do you think is the reason some witches and wizards are 'more powerful' than others?

This is a really good comment thread expounding on that exact question.

*** [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]'s theory is the one theory on magical power I've seen that makes the most sense.

**** I also love how his point on emotional state makes Voldemort's fear tactics make even more sense - when you're afraid, your magic is measurably weaker.

** Some wizards are more powerful then others, for the same reason people like Einstein were better at physics and Mozart better musicians. It's basically a combination of intelligence, natural talent for the subject, and time spend refining their skill. Some situation factors like quality of tools and emotional stability also matter to a degree.
