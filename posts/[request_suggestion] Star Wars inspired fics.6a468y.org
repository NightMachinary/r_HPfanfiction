Are there any that have done something similar, with the young hero saying 'you killed my father' and Darth/Volde/Zurg going 'No, I am your father'?

Or does anyone want to try it? It occured to me while watching Star Wars that it'd be possible, if the Horcrux fragment latched onto one of the fresh bodies. It'd involve a bit of canon changing, like if James were in the same room, and perhaps wasn't dead, but brain damaged, or in a coma. Enough for James to be essentially "dead", but enough left to fight back at the last minute and refuse to kill Harry, killing the main soul, Voldemort, instead. It would probably require a different prophecy, or perhaps there being two horcrux fragments, one going to Harry as per canon, one going to James, and taking over the body. The Power he knows not would then be a /joint/ parental love - father and mother.

It would actually work better if it were Lily, as there'd be a reason she wouldn't be quite dead, like Voldemort deciding to spare her life - without /actually/ leaving her alive in the real sense. The body would decay a bit, explaining why no one knows the real identity of Darth Death, who essentually becomes the real Voldemort's right hand man, helping him gain a body.


** I know there was a story where the horcrux and Lily's protection came to an accord and combined with Harry to protect him from the abuse. Harry became basically Voldemort's kid. Can't remember the name. Sorry.

  Sakura's words die in her throat as the man's eyes shoot open, and the coldest red irises she has ever seen meet hers. She is hit by a wave of terrifying certainty about two things right then -- that she knows these eyes better than any other and that, if he wanted to, this man could stop her heart with just a look.
