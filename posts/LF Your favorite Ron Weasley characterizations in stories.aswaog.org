Rather he's the main character or a side character is unimportant to me.

Would rather it be completed, but if not I understand

No Harem Harry

No Seer Luna

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No super powerful or incredibly smart Harry, Harry; smarter or more powerful than canon is fine, but make it believable, please.

Can be happy, can be dark, can be in between.

It's a Slytherin Ron story. He's a different Ron, but still holds a lot of the canon Ron characteristics. It's incomplete, but is still being updated at a very rapid pace. I suggest you check it out.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no one is perfect.

** linkffn(To end in Serenity; Red Knight; Grow Young with me; Harry Potter and the Magic of Life; Eclipse of the Sky)

I like how the Ron from Magic of Life is portrayed because it expands upon his jealousy and makes it relatable, while not making him and Harry "enemies for life". They are friends who had a fight with valid reasons on both sides, and it really shows.

Both from GWYM and Eclipse are great, laid back but loyal and brave.

To end in serenity is simply hilarious with his relationship with Hermione and Harry, they all have such a good chemistry.

Red Knight is obligatory Ron-fic.

** I really like Eternal Sunshine of the Scourgified Mind. Basically, the story is that in an AU where Deathly Hallows didn't happen, Harry, Ron and Hermione all suffer some weird form of amnesia and forget everything related to magic,,, which means Harry and Hermione remember their Muggle upbringing but not much else, and Ron just vaguely recalls that his name is Ron. Oh, and he's also gone missing because he has no idea where his home is.

Fic focuses mostly on Ron trying to cope with not knowing anything while stuck at a Muggle mental health clinic, while his family try to find him. Not the most action-packed fic, and sometimes downright tragic and angsty, but still with a lot of fun moments... cause Ron might not have his memories but he hasn't lost his talent for sarcastic quips.

linkffn(I'm writing a Fem!Harry story, with the twist that almost the entire magical world is female, with like ten witches for every wizard... and it's a very different magical world as a result. Story hasn't reached Hogwarts yet, but we've had a lot of magic.

*** Thank you for the recommendation. I read this over the weekend, and while it has a rough start in terms of quality, it does get better and ends up being a very solid and enjoyable take on questions of personality and mental health.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce by Imagitory. Ron isn't the protagonist, but he is considerably more developed than in canon. It is RPF, but the author is so effective at writing Ramsay as an actual charaxter in the WW that you forget about it.

There's some shipping, but I think it's mostly with minor characters
