Like "best time-travel" or "best fics general."

Feel free to post your lists as well!

Thanks!


** TVtropes has fanfic rec pages for most fandoms, they usually have a few broad categories like general, shipping, fix-it, etc.

** The only compilation site I know of is Painless J's. [[http://painless-j.net/blog/category/hp-recs/]]

There are two things, though: It's oriented heavily towards slash (there are categories for both gen and het) and it hasn't been updated in nearly ten years. Many links are dead, but a search by title usually finds the story. If I were ambitious and knowledgeable, I'd try to create something similar with fics that have been posted since 2009.

*** I really really wish this was still kept up to date. There are many amazing stories on here but also many many dead links and lots of newer fics missing
