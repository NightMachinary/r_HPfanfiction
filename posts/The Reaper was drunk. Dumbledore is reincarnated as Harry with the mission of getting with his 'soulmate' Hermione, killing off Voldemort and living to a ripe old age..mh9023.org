"Harry Potter, how many times are we meeting again? This must be the 16th time... hic~" The hooded figure hiccuped in a drunk haze, cradling a bottle like his dear friend Madeye.

Dumbledore would have tried to clear the misconception, but couldn't spit out a word.

"You know the drill. Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard, he is love potioning you to get with Ginny. Hic~" The hooded figure didn't seem to know that the man she was maligning was right before her.

"Actually your true soulmate is the Granger girl. Beware of Ron who will love-potion your soulmate. Beware of Dumbledore, he is will manipulate you. Beware of Ice Princess Daphne, her Stand allows her to freeze time. Now get lost." The hooded figure drunkenly waved Dumbledore off.

The next moment, Dumbledore woke up in a cupboard underneath the stairs in a malnourished child's body.

Bonus:

"Imperio! Haha Lucius, tell me the list of your little Death Eater friends. No innocents should go in Azkaban after all. Also, transfer your Gringotts money into my vaults, I am lacking money. This too is for the Greater Good! Hahahaha!" A few hours before, Harry Potter had been spontaneously sent back in time into Dumbledore's body.

Being from a future in which a Second War against Voldemort had occurred, Harry of course knew what he needed to do. Neutralize all the Death Eaters before they could group up again! Destroy all the Horcruxes and never let Voldemort return! And finally, fill his vaults with enough money so that he would never be wanting for Lemon Drops!

**** The only one that went right was the one where Harry's response was to call out how incompetent his Death is and quit.

  Harry's dead, and his Death will get fired if Harry doesn't go back. Well... hmm. Let's think about this... /oneshot, mild angst, minor Dumbledore-bashing and Weasley-bashing; riff on Reptilia28's 'Don't Fear The Reaper' challenge/

******* Thanks! Not sure why someone's downvoting us (and the bot, lol). It wasn't quite as funny as I'd hoped, but I enjoyed it anyway.
