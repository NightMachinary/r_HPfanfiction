I was thinking about this, and it confused me sightly. Lycanthropy can only be passed by a bite, and not blood lines. When Remus and Tonks had Teddy Lupin, he wasn't a werewolf. After the second wizarding war, werewolf protection laws were passed and such, this should prevent werewolves from biting other people (plus wolfsbane). After that generation of werewolves has died out, there would be none left to bite others. Werewolves would become extinct if everything was managed properly.

Nothing is said about how the first werewolf actually came into existence? Any theories about this one? I was thinking something along the lines as the moon's magic cursing a group of wizards after they tried to destroy it (similar to how Hogwarts can protect itself).

I'm rambling, but it just came as a thought to me.


** You're acting under the assumption that all werewolves are like Lupin.

And most probably are. Most people are generally nice, decent folks just trying to get by.

Then every now and again you get a Fenrir Greyback. He messes everything up. Remember how Lupin became a werewolf in the first place? Greyback /deliberately bit him/. A little child. He did that to a lot of kids. That was His Thing.

And the Ministry couldn't catch him. They couldn't hold him the few times they did catch him. It was a mess.

So it's likely that lycanthropy will be perpetuated by those people who are twisted up inside like Greyback - because there is always a fraction of any population who are wicked. One ‘bad' werewolf can infect many, many people and is very hard to stop.

Edit: I think I remember reading once about how the first werewolf was someone attempting to transform themselves into a grim, and the two magical cores clashing with one another, but I can't recall if that was a fan theory or a JKR thing

*** Definitely a fan theory. Magical cores are fanon, and the “Grim” only exists as an omen, not a creature, in the same way that a “tyger” is not a special kind of animal, just a tiger in the context of heraldry.

Wasn't Remus horrified at Tonks' pregnancy because he could have potentially passed it on?

*** Word of God is that he worried over nothing, basically, and it doesn't happen (but if two werewolves mate in wolf form then they'll make a super smart wolf baby, which...is horrifying on a number of levels. Also, that happens enough that Hogwarts has a whole pack of smart!wolves in the Forbidden Forest).

***** It's...a thing that JKR wrote, but YMMV whether it's "canon," lol. Personally, I'm /super/ ditching the smart wolf babies thing in my fics.

Anyway, JKR wrote about it [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/werewolves][here]]:

  Werewolves generally reproduce by attacking non-werewolves. The stigma surrounding werewolves has been so extreme for centuries that very few have married and had children. However, where werewolves have married human partners, there has been no sign of their lycanthropy being passed to their offspring.

  One curious feature of the condition is that if two werewolves meet and mate at the full moon (a highly unlikely contingency which is known to have occurred only twice) the result of the mating will be wolf cubs which resemble true wolves in everything except their abnormally high intelligence. They are not more aggressive than normal wolves and do not single out humans for attack. Such a litter was once set free, under conditions of extreme secrecy, in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts, with the kind permission of Albus Dumbledore. The cubs grew into beautiful and unusually intelligent wolves and some of them live there still, which has given rise to the stories about ‘werewolves' in the Forest -- stories none of the teachers, or the gamekeeper, has done much to dispel because keeping students out of the Forest is, in their view, highly desirable.

****** Ooooh, I read about that in a fic once, but I had no idea it was technically canon. I haven't really kept up with the “extras” JKR releases, tbh.

I'm somewhat unsure about how I feel about the implication that the werewolf would carry and likely birth a litter of puppies in their human form. I'm also very impressed that the trauma of shifting on a full moon doesn't terminate the pregnancy.

******* I think the birth would happen nine full moons later (so, in wolf form), but you're right that the mother would still be carrying puppies in human form.

******** Normal dog (and probably wolf) gestation is only 63 days, though. Maybe the extra intelligence requires longer gestation? A two month pregnancy would probably be less traumatic, at least. Still, it's just... odd. So much of her post-book stuff is odd. Very, very odd.

And jeeze, can you imagine being a werewolf and realizing you're pregnant one day. You'd have no idea how. If you had a human lover, you'd probably assume it was from him. Then, if it's true that they give birth in wolf form, you'd wake up after another transformation NOT pregnant and either surrounded by puppies or nowhere near them and having no idea what happened to your “baby.” It would be horrible.

ETA: I kind of want to write a dark oneshot about this now.

********* Writers really need editors. JKR's notes, especially from the middle period of the series, were full of “I was going to do X but my editor talked me out of it.”

But, inevitably, a creator becomes big enough that the editor is a formality, and then, well---JKR offers every damned idea to come out of her head. Harry Turtledove throws poorly-written sex scenes into his novels. George Lucas makes the Prequel Trilogy.

If I can't convince my beta reader that something is good, then I almost always just go with what my beta advised, and I never ignore my beta's advice twice in a row, because there's too much evidence that authors shouldn't listen to every damned idea that occurs to them.

And lmk if you write that fic.

** I don't know how the first wolves came into existence... I presume different cultures have different lore... Evolution?

As for dying out, sure. Maybe? And would that be a bad thing? Werewolfism feels like it hurts? I dont think it's something people want to get.

Also, would everyone take Wolfsbane? Aside from the obvious "it's really expensive and werewolves often can't afford it", loads of people refuse to take vaccines for various reasons. I don't think Greyback would... So I'd say there's always someone to pass Lycanthropy on even if it becomes exceedingly rare...

I've always loved by the headcannon that Werewolves don't like Wolfsbane.... Mostly because the idea of having a human brain inside an animals body seems very dysmorphic (if that's the right word) but I cannot imagine it's pleasant. Animagi chose it. Werewolves don't. Also you'd remember all the pain of both transformations, whereas you generally forget as a wolf which is probably easier to deal with? We know Remus is unusual for a werewolf. He goes to visit packs. For wolves in Greybacks pack who fully embrace there Lycanthropy, Wolfsbane to them would be just another wizard trying to control them you know? It wouldn't be nice.

** Well one of the main mundane theories on the first werewolf is in Greek mythology with the Legend of Lycaon. According to legend he angered Zeus who turned Lycaon and his sons into wolves/werewolves.

Since we have seen how some mundane myths (ghosts, vampires, giants, werewolves, etc) are actually real in the magical world then why not have the mundane legend of how werewolves be true as well. With the difference being that the Greek Gods were actually very powerful magicals.

** I always liked the idea that the original werewolves came about because of a type of inherited magic (like parseltongue) that allowed a family or clan to transform into wolves (likely Scandinavian origin?) but the clan were cursed by an enemy to become rabid beasts instead with the infectious bite either being intentional or completely accidental and possibly something that would come back to haunt whoever cursed them.

Cant remember where i originally read this idea, but it stuck with me.

** No law is 100% enforced, nor is any protection 100% reliable or will be used 100% of the time. Otherwise, the first world would have no AIDS.

And perhaps more importantly, those laws don't apply abroad. Even if you eradicated the curse in Britain, it's still around abroad. So unless you propose that Hermione dusted off her great grandfather's colonial office plans to paint the world map pink, that law would be nothing but a droplet in the ocean on a global scale.

** Josephine Darcy writes of a theory in her story linkffn(The Marriage Stone) that Lycanthorpy was the result of a failed animagus transformation which you might find interesting.

Chapter 26

"According to Slytherin lycanthropy was the result of a failed Animagus transformation," Harry explained. "An Animagus has the power to transform into an animal -- a non-magical animal, like a cat or dog or deer. According to Slytherin's notes there was a wizard a long time ago who made an attempt to transform himself into a magical creature -- a Hell Hound to be exact."

"You can't transform into a magical creature," Hermione protested. "It won't work. Wizards and magical creatures have a different type of connection between their minds and their magical cores. Such a transformation would disconnect your mind from your magical core and you would no longer be able to control the magic -- which would automatically stop the transformation."

Harry nodded. "According to Slytherin, when an Animagus transforms into a non-magical animal the connection between his mind and his magical core remains intact. But when a human tries to transform into a magical-creature the connection breaks. The man who attempted the magical transformation reasoned that all he would need to do would be to come up with a potion that would bridge the gap between his mind and the Hell Hound's magical core so that not only could he control his magic but he would also retain his human mind. But something went wrong -- he got the potion wrong and it only partially worked. He retained his magic so that the transformation worked, but he lost the connection to his mind and mutated into a mindless, wolf-like beast. He never transformed back, and before he was killed he managed to bite several different people. His saliva was infected with the potion he had taken.

"Now obviously his transformation was triggered by the Animagus metamorphosis spell. But the potion was unstable and it automatically triggered a weakened version of the metamorphosis spell the first night the moon was full. The victims of the wizard's bite transformed into mindless beasts until the sun rose the following day. The first werewolves were born. But the thing is, Slytherin didn't think that there was anything wrong with the wizard's logic -- he just reasoned that the man had screwed up the potion. That is what he wrote in that notebook -- his own experiments with the potion. There were two things wrong with it -- first he'd used several lunar-based plants which caused the potion to react to the full moon in a way that it shouldn't have, and second, the wizard himself did not possess a strong enough magical core to complete the transformation properly. According to his notes, Slytherin fixed the potion and gave it to a number of different werewolves. If they were strong enough, it cured them."
