After so many years of reading this misspelling, I finally figured out why writers sometimes misspell Pomfrey as Pomphrey. I was writing Pomfrey's name on a word document, and it did the spell-check thing. One of the common spell-check terms -- actually the very first one -- is Pomphrey.

So I think people forget how her name is spelled, and go with the spell-check version.

I know this is random, but it was very interesting to me.


** Mf is nonstandard english by the rules of spelling unless you're adding -ful/l to a word for the most part. In a standard english spelling, it would be mph.

*** There are IRL people named both 'Pomphrey' and 'Pomfrey' based on googling - in fact, it comes into English from medieval French through Welsh, so it has approximately several billion spelling variants.

The original name-word-source has meanings of 'bear cub' and 'peace' for what it's worth.

**** Also, chamfer, and discomfit (which comes from comfy).

Side note: While /dumfounded/ is an acceptable spelling, the more common form is /dumbfounded./ Dumbfounded is closer to the root words /dumb/ and /found/, which indicate its meaning.

**** Dumbfounded. And i said "for the most part."

Half of those words are portmanteaus which avoid that because they're two words become one.
