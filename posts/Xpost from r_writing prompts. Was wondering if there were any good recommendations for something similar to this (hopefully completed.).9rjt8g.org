** Yes, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice, Shall You Pursue]] by White Squirrel, linkffn(11961978), is close enough. But the students didn't call the Muggles though.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

** There's linkffn(2784825) (old soldiers never die by Rorschach's blot)

It's not /quite/ the same, but does involve Harry (and others) getting the british military (or at least their squib retirees) involved and it turns out guns are really effective against people who don't know to shield yet. It's been a long times since I read it, but I'm pretty sure it culminates in a bombing run or three.
