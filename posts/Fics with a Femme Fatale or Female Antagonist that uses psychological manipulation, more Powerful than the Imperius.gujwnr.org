Maybe a little explanation about, what i think about the Imperius. As we learn in Year 4, the Students are directly confronted with the Curse, so they are aware of it and experience how it is to be under its influence. Maybe its needless to say, but a Person who gets cursed in a moment of unawareness, still notices that the Body Moves without its owners influence, like a Puppet.

I would like to know Fics with a Femme Fatale or Female (main) antagonist, that uses this psychological Power. Whether she has a great charisma and can "catch" all of her Audience with it and she can manipulate them with such a sublte way, that those who are under this "spell" wont notice it or arent sure, if their actions are from their own or the Will of someone other. Of course this can be a Form of Imperius curse, but more powerful and i would like it to be this sort of way. Maybe said Female has a talent with the performance of the Imperius that she can use it in an "advanced" style.

well, i imagined that she could "charm" the MC and during the process they grew closer. But in the end, its unclear if she really has this talent (or if she really charmed all of those, who are assumed, she did) or if it was really their own doing.

A short summary about what i imagined about the Fic: The Female "use her skills" to impress those around her. She learns to know the MC and decide at a Point to use charm him aswell. He grows closer to him, (maybe without noticing it) and in the end, they enjoy each other. In the end of the Story, they seperate and as he turns and departs, she take her Wand, pointing at him and thinking about Kill him, because "it would be so easy".....after a moment of indecision, she decides to not do it and leaves aswell.

(As a subpoint, i add: a reason for the separation would be that she plans to leave the Country and the MC (her possible lover) detected the connection between her and the Crimes, however, he decides to let her go, because her actions/Reasons were reasonable (Revenge for something....possibly) and her "point-wand-at-MC" action would be a way to get rid of the one, who dicscovered her, but she decides against it....for multiple reasons, one might be that she has feelings for him (too). But just as a Subpoint, because this end would definitely make her the Main culprit and so destroy what i actually looking for. However, as i write this, that plotline comes interesting to me too. So i would request it, but i would like, if you make a note, if said Fic follows the subpoint.)

An alternate way to end this Story would be, she turns and looks after the MC with a strange Expression, then turns and leaves aswell.

What i want to say with this: its unclear if she is a manipulative Person or not and its unclear, if she is able to do a Murder (since the final act, but also because in said story Murder/crime cases happen). The "Murder/Criminal" is either catched or remains undetected and its unclear, if she is the one behind this all or if the Culprit is really so clever.

Anyway, thats all, that i had to say. I need to apologize for write such a big text. I actually just wanted to give a short summary about what i wanted to read. If my request is unclear to you, im sorry for this aswell. Ask me if you are confused about things, but i think, that i made everything clear in the Summary, although it is now a little Spoiler....but spoiler are in most Requests anyway.

By the way: i imagined the Female to be Bellatrix and the MC to be Harry (somehow, this "Pair" draws some attraction from me), lets just assume, its an AU and Bella is an actuall clever Woman. But im of course fine with any other Characters (possibly her with Black Hair, but i think its good if she is the same grade of attractivity as magical capability).


** This is a pretty cool idea. I'd read it, though, honestly, I see Narcissa more than Bellatrix filling this role.

Or an OC, given that you're suggesting the fic move overseas. Don't the Zabinis have ties to Italy, or is that just fanon, not canon?

Either way, very creative and original!

** Speaking of the imperius curse... Do you guys ever get the feeling that Lucius was indeed under the imperius curse, but it was Narcissa who did it to keep him from looking for Voldemort along with the other Death Eaters?

** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/the-stalking-blood-sack.15818/]] has the basic idea behind your request. I doubt you'll be able to find a fic with every desired detail.
