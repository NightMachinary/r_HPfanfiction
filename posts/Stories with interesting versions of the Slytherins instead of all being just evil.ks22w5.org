I don't want the good guys to suddenly be bad either. That's just as bad writing imo.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any Length/Old or New. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

No Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes

** I'm going to recommend linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) and subsiquently get downvoted because that always seems to happen üòã.

But they're lying. It's brilliant. It's what would happen if Slytherins were actually cunning and sly and ambitions and you know, all the shit a Slytherin is supposed to be instead of just a dickhead.

And they are. They are cunning and sly and sarcastic and clever. Snape actually gets some motivation and justification into his actions. There's so much history and lore and power. Voldemort has his moments of cleverness and evil as opposed to just random mania.

I adore it. I adore Nizar. I adore Sal. I adore the intrigue and the build up and the planning inside planning wrapped in enigmas. It's lovely üòä

***** I definitely recommend it. The same mechanism of time travel in a sense, but a different timeline and fem!Harry if you're ok with that. I'm not sure if it's on AO3 though

*** Boy, that's a long fic.

Can you tell me about the relationships there? I see ‚Äòcannon' and ‚Äònon cannon' used so frequently in the tags and it scares me a bit.

Does Harry ends up with someone? Does he shows interest in someone and acts upon that interest?

**** The relationships are not the focus of the story. It's more plot driven story around Voldemort and fixing the issues in the HP universe. There's a lot of lore and family trees and secret societies and schemes and plots and history and language.

Theres very little romance? Any pairings that happen are already established or the two characters get together very quickly and stay together. The pairings aren't a point of conflict for the story. They're just there and you roll with that =). Again, the main focus is the overarching "Fix the world" plot.

That being said, if you want to talk about the pairings. The main one of any consequence is a m/m Snape and Nizar (if I say anything else on this I'll spoil it but Nizar is an OC Slytherin who is very clever). The story focus's mostly on these two. I think Hermione and Draco get together at some point but that's such a nothing part of the story its barely worth mentioning. There's Triad Marraiges too which would explain the non canon, as well as all forms of characters in the LGBTQ+ community so who knows which ones are canon or not. That being said, this story never pretends to be canon. The plotline is Canon Compliant till the end of GoF so whatever Harry assumed or knew of people at that point is what we assume and know. After that it goes in a totally different direction.

Again, the pairings really aren't the focus of the story. The only one with any weight to the plot is Snape and Nizar. All the rest you can just go along with for the sake of the story. I can't tell you what happens with Harry I'm sorry I'll spoil it. But he ends up happy. I just love the story for the amount of research and work thats gone into creating it. It's just so dense and cunning and clever i adore it.

Edit:: Also yeah their tags are insane don't worry about it! Theres like 400 characters in these books and they tag them all just ignore it!

**** Yes. Nizar would be. Him and Snape would be the two main people... Oh and Sal... And McGonagall... And Hermione.... And a lot of others really depending on where in the book you are...

But Nizar is good. Very good. I can't say anything without spoiling it but there's a reason for him being there and he has an interesting history üòÄ. They didn't just invent him out of the blue.

** *Anguis series* (linked below), *Hogwarts Houses Divided*, *Lion Eagle Badger Snake*, *Subversion.*

The last one is a bit of a snarkfic but has enough originality that it's not your usual "snakey Slytherins" fic. The first three have completely unique takes on House Slytherin.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1305209]]

The first part is a multi-focus fic primarily on the children of Death Eaters realizing what they were raised to is wrong. The second part is about their slightly dysfunctional spy ring.
