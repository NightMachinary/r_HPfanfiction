Any oneshots or multi chapters that deal with the other characters when Harry, Ron and Hermione are doing the saving Hogwarts thing?

The Trio can be in the story, I'd just like them to have more minor parts. And just have the other the story be focused on the other more minor characters; would be kind of funny to see the characters reactions to the trio's adventures and stuff as well.

Could even be with the Weasley siblings discussing what they think goes on with Ron, Harry and Hermione.

Or something like that.


** linkffn(The Professors' Point of View) fits perfectly, and is actually quite great.

  Admit it, you've always been curious about what the professors were thinking while Harry, Ron, and Hermione got themselves into all kinds of shenanigans.

*** It's rather irritating to read though. Don't know why the author didn't just use dialogue tags.

***** It's fanfiction.net. They work. The author just decided to tag who's speaking my formatting the text differently. I get the reason, it's just bothersome to read.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

** linkffn(Daphne Greengrass, Side Character) kind of fits the bill. It starts in 5th year and shows how Daphne and the other Slytherins (mostly Daphne) feel about Harry and is Harryness.

Even if that doesn't sound like what you're looking for, I should tell you the writing in this story is really fucking good. It's my favourite on-going story right now.

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.
