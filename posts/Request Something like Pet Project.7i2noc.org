(2290003) (Pet Project)

So I tend to stay away from Hermione/Snape pairings just because it's not my cup of tea, but I read it after people recommended it to me and surprisingly loved it.

Heck I tend to stay away from Snape pairings in general just because they write his character way out of character, but for the most part I think the author did a pretty good job with his character overall. (And this coming from someone who loves Snape; I just tend to not like pairings with him in general just because it normally feels so out of character)

So yeah, I'm looking for more stories like Pet Project. Note it doesn't have to be Hermione/Snape, it can be other pairings.

For instance along with Hermione/Snape I don't like Harry/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Gabrielle, or Harry/Daphne.

Either because the characters are normally written so out of character or in cases like Daphne Greengrass are so stereotypical what you normally see in fanfiction. For instance for Daphne being an ice princess/ice queen. Which isn't how I see her at all. So if you give me any Harry/Daphne do not give me stories where Daphne is ice princess/ice queen

And another note it doesn't have to be the pairings I mentioned; if you can also find more Snape pairings that have the characters pretty believable to them then feel free to suggest them.

The more rare/minor the pairing the more interested I'd be interested in seeing it done believably. For instance someone was talking about Ron/Tonks, it sounds like a interesting pair but don't know any stories that have the pairing. And other stuff like that.

NO character bashing if possible.

Would rather not have Harry be super powerful or super smart, a little bit is fine but not so much so that it's unbelievable.

Any Era, any rating, am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.


** These are the SS/HG I liked. Like Pet Project, they take place during the war.

*** About Camerado: I have depression so I stay away from stories where he dies in the end, and I make sure I skim through the end paragraph to see that he is alive.

In Camerado, its some stuff about her smiling at her reflection in the mirror. Does he die?

I haven't started it, waiting for your response.

** I'm into Snape/Hermione fanfictions exclusively (mainly because I like that they are intellectually matched and in most Pet Project like stories, their romance starts on an intellectual level first, and its slow, angsty and mature).

ss/hg review ( [[https://sshgreview.wordpress.com/?s=outstanding]]) is my primary source of all things Snape/Hermione.

Pet Project is the site reviewer's favorite fanfic too and she clearly mentions that a GOOD ss/hg fanfic includes

1. In character Snape

2. Adult Hermione

3. Slow simmering romance and the realization of love not happening instantly. Angst

4. Romance that arises from intellectual compatibility and match

She reviews various novel length Snape/Hermione fics has the characterized as Outstanding, Exceeds Expectations, Acceptable etc.

Most of the ones mentioned in the "Outstanding" and "Exceeds expectations plus" category are at par with Pet Project.

Other than this, somebody had written a Quora answer to Fanfictions and has a detailed list of ss/hg fictions she has read. Here is the link to her answer, you will find the Snape ones (with hermione and others) as you scroll down her answer.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
