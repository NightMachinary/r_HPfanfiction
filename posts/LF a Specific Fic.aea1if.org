One scene popped into my head and I'm having trouble placing it.

Harry is in Diagon Alley and sees a large number of death eaters, and casts a drawn out diffindo with 2 wands at once (killing them all I think) and then passes out. Fred and George see this from their shop and make some kind of commentary as well.

I think Moody later berates him for being reckless.
