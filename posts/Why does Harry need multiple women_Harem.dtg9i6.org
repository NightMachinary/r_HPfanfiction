** I think you're reading a bit too much into it. Like a lot of fan fic, especially smut, it's pure fantasy and not meant to be logical.

** Tbh we don't admit it but for a LOT of male Authors, Harry is our self insert/POV character. Nobody likes reading OCs and most don't like writing for them, so Harry becomes a go-to.

It's a common thing in fanfictions for people to write/read MC/their taste. The reason Daphne Greengrass is so commonly shipped with him is â€˜cause everyone wants a tsundere Slytherin waifu. It's all about fantasy fulfilment, my guy

  Imagine how much the women would fight each other.
#+end_quote

I can't imagine any of the usual suspects fighting each other because I can't imagine any of the usual suspects agreeing to be part of Harry's harem in the first place. Fleur and Tonks are adults who can have their pick of grown men, but they'd rather share a teenage boy? I mean, why?

** Why would Harry need multiple women? He wouldn't and doesn't.

Better question: why would the authors and readers want Harry to need/have multiple women? Blatant wish-fulfillment and power fantasy, almost exclusively written by males.

Same reasons for OP main character (see Harry, Hermione or SI), much of the "independent" (read: teenage brat) genre, and ridiculous child-abuse/trauma/neglect. This is a pretty common occurrence not just here but in other fandoms. I mean, thats the main reason people get into fanfiction in the first place isn't it; they want to see something that was not depicted in canon for a variety of reasons.

*** I feel like you could somewhat realistically write two if you can depict a good poly relationship. Something you basically never see in fiction. What pretty much all attempts at that get wrong however is that they make Harry the central element rather than one of three equals. Then again, writing one relationship well is already difficult, writing 3 is almost guaranteed to not work out. I mean, there's a reason you don't see that kind of relationship very often IRL, and trying to convey the subtleties of human interactions with words in a convincing manner is tricky.

** To avoid repeating all the other answers, here's the [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dt2374/what_do_you_think_of_harry_dating_only_2_girls_in/][Hellstrike approved response:]]

Harry needs multiple partners in fanfic

- Because teens are horny bastards and teens having lots of sex is "realistic". The Age of Consent in Europe, blahblahblah.

- Because someone facing as much pressure as Harry needs sex to relieve tension.

- Because it's scientifically proven that men are more open to casual sexual encounters than women. Harry is male. Ergo, Harry would want casual sex. It's "realistic".

Pick one of the above!

**** Because Harry's is the kind of guy who's all for the "hookers and blow" lifestyle.

I guess he just doesn't realize that wizarding Britain is a conservative society where it's expected and totally normal for 19/20 year olds to get married and start families as soon as they've landed serious partners.

** How can he save the wizarding world from extinction? He needs atleast 300 wives to save/restore 300 families from extinction. He will pump atleast 5 children in each girl so that's 1500 kids in next gen. 1500 becomes 7500 then 37500 .. and so on. That's how he is gonna save wizarding world.
