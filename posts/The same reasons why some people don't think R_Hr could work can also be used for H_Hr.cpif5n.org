The same problems people have with the Ron/Hermione pairing would still be problems for the Harry/Hermione pairing.

Here's a few that I've seen:

- Ron is not an intellectual equal of Hermione

- If I remember correctly, When Ron gets the prefect badge, Harry admits that he wasn't a better student than Ron was. On a side note, whose to say that Hermione would really /want/ to be with someone as smart as her? I find her too competitive for me to believe that she'd actually want that to begin with.

- Ron and Hermione are too argumentative

- Where Ron is combative, Harry is usually dismissive or often completely trying to avoid her really. Hermione, in my opinion, is more willing to argue with someone than be ignored.

- Ron and Hermione don't have much in common

- What do Harry and Hermione have in common? They have has many common hobbies together as Ron and Hermione do, which is not many admittedly.

I think that a H/Hr pairing could work, but I'm glad JKR didn't go that route. The Trio's friendship was one of the big selling points for me while I was reading them and Harry and Hermione getting together would inevitably have pushed Ron out of the fold.


** I do love H/Hr but I think that in cannon they should all have gotten their own spouses, including Ginny.

I dunno I always had the mindset that JK threw them all together to make it easier. ü§∑

** I don't think Hermione needs an intellectual equal, she herself admitted when she was only 11 that there were more important things than books and cleverness. I think it's more of a desire to do good for the world and stand up for what's right is what she shares with Harry. Ron has it too but he would be less inclined to be a leader in that regard than Harry and Hermione. So Harry maybe not be an intellectual equal, but even JKR called Harry and Hermione "equals", so it must be for some other reasons.

I think Ron and Hermione bicker about petty things, but when Harry and Hermione argue it can be extremely constructive as they are on the same playing field. The scene that stands out to be in particular is when they have that fight in OotP about whether to go to the DoM or not after Harry had his vision. Hermione is quite sure it's a trick and Harry is blind in his anger/fear to consider it might be. They argue with each other and finally come to a compromise, to check Grimauld Place first. Hermione even offers to accompany Harry if Sirius is not there, and he even in the heat of his anger he is able to step back and recognize her "solidarity." Whereas often Ron and Hermione will take really low blows and actually try and hurt each other.

OotP is the main reason I shipped Harry/Hermione. The other books have some things I like that support my argument, but I'd say 80% of why I prefer them together is that book.

** There are some other reasons people don't like R/Hr that don't apply to H/Hr:

Ron's casual teasing of Hermione feels demeaning to some.

This is similar to the last point but it really needs to be said; Ron's remarks on Hermione's attractiveness in fourth year with him getting together with her later feel like negging (the act of lowering a prospective partners self esteem so they settle for less.)

The troll thing in first year, Ron got her into that situation Harry got her out.

Here are some counterpoints for your counterpoints:

#+begin_quote
  Ron is not an intellectual equal of Hermione - If I remember correctly, When Ron gets the prefect badge, Harry admits that he wasn't a better student than Ron was.
#+end_quote

Even if Harry thinks he and Ron are equivalent, Hermione seems to think Harry is more deserving of the prefect badge.

[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2003/10/19/partners-and-friends-the-evolving-relationship-between-harry-and-hermione/][This essay]] has a lot of good points in it, but the one relevant to this conversation is

#+begin_quote
  They stick up for each other with particular ferocity in OP. Hermione reacts quite sharply indeed to Draco's query of how Harry felt being ‚Äúsecond-best‚Äù to Ron (‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù and ‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù): even Draco recognizes that he may have ‚Äúhit a nerve‚Äù with her (175-176). Harry receives another detention for questioning why Umbridge was docking Gryffindor for Hermione's question (284).

  Ron and Hermione don't have much in common - What do Harry and Hermione have in common? They have has many common hobbies together as Ron and Hermione do, which is not many admittedly.
#+end_quote

While they don't share hobbies they do tend to act as partners in the important parts of the story things like Saving Sirius, training for the tournament, and running the DA.

More excerpts from that article:

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Hermione work more as a partnership (and less as two members of a Trio) in OP than they have previously. When they are reading the Prophet article about Sirius, they shush Ron and continue to have their own conversation (257). Harry and Hermione obviously hadn't clued Ron in on the conversation they had the night he made the Quidditch team regarding Umbridge and Harry's scar, since Ron is utterly bewildered by this when the three of them are talking to Sirius in the fire (270).

  Hermione takes the initiative with forming the DA, anticipating and countering Harry's reluctance with powers of persuasion and calm certitude in his abilities (290-96). The two of them have a conversation about the similarity between the gold coins given to the DA members and the Dark Mark, another sign of a growing shared outlook (353). She also takes the initiative with arranging Harry's interview with Rita Skeeter (‚ÄúI want him given the opportunity to tell the truth‚Äù) (500). She seemingly sat through the interview with him. Harry himself indicates that talking about the events of that night in such detail was difficult, and therefore, Hermione may be privy to details or emotions from Harry that he hadn't previously confided to both her and Ron (502).

**** That's just bad writing on JKR's part, though. Or at the very least it's an awfully poor portrayal of friendship. I'm convinced the only reason Harry finds it such a chore to hang out with Hermione is because it was the easiest way for JKR to show they weren't romantically compatible. If she wasn't so worried about who ended up with whom, I figure their relationship would have steered a lot closer to a normal teenage friendship.

tl;dr: Harry and Hermione's relationship is heavily influenced by the fact that JKR did not want them to be shipped by readers, which arguably poisoned the well of their friendship as written

*********** What I have a problem with is this:

#+begin_quote
  Their friendship is defined by what it isn't (a romantic relationship) rather than what it actually is (a platonic friendship),
#+end_quote

Their friendship is spelled out in the first book. They've bonded through trauma. Hermione shows that she's willing to bend the rules for them after they show that they care about her, which she was not willing to do before. Over time, this two-way street broadens, with Hermione being willing to do more and more, and Ron and Harry showing her there's more to life than studying and that following the rules and trusting authority doesn't necessarily always work out. It's through Harry and Ron that Hermione's entire greater social life begins and grows - Hagrid (who she depends on for emotional support when Ron and Harry are mad at her), Dobby (who she's willing to go on a crusade for), the Weasleys, Lupin, even the Order as a whole. To the best of my knowledge, the only social connections she makes without Harry and Ron directly involved are Neville and Krum.

#+begin_quote
  In other words, their friendship didn't grow naturally because there is an anti-romantic metacontext informing how all of their interactions were written, platonic or otherwise, which inevitably led to their somewhat lifeless friendship.
#+end_quote

Hermione blossoms as a person through her friendship with Harry and Ron. It's less pronounced, but Harry and Ron rely on her to pick up on things and check their own personalities. They're more self-sufficient, but Harry is repeatedly grateful for Hermione's support in trying times (though not always the way she chooses to express it). Ron isn't the viewpoint character, so we have correspondingly little to go off of, but he engages with her more frequently, and they have perhaps the liveliest platonic relationship in the series until their feelings take shape. It's up to each reader to decide when that actually happens, but you won't convince me that it's in the first book or two.

#+begin_quote
  When I read the series again with that thesis statement in mind (Harry and Hermione's friendship is defined by what it isn't rather than what it is) it just seems glaringly obvious to me that their friendship as written only makes sense in that context. I hope that makes sense, and obviously you're welcome to disagree, but this is the conclusion I've come to based on several re-readings of the series.
#+end_quote

I do disagree. Metacontext seems like a great excuse not to give any concrete examples. JK Rowling clearly wanted to establish a world that was reminiscent of her life experiences, and not all realistic friendships constantly fawn and slobber all over each other with how close they are.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

At the end of HBP, when Harry goes off to break up with Ginny, he contrasts her with Hermione in the closest JKR ever gets to using omniscient language. Hermione is not specifically named in this instance, but she's the one obviously being alluded to when Harry states Ginny won't tell him to "be careful," or "don't do that." Now I agree with you that Harry isn't attracted to Hermione in canon, but if that were the case, why does he compare the two at all?

I doubt JKR's answer would be that Harry subconsciously compares his girlfriends to Hermione, because that would imply at some level, Harry /does/ consider her a potential romantic partner. No, rather I think this is because by that point JKR had become aware of the shipping wars going on in the real world and sought to include this to very definitively state Harry and Hermione are 100% incompatible. However, if you strip away the Jo's real-world logic, only the former explanation makes sense, because in the context of the narrative, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny are real people and not the created by JK Rowling, despite the fact that we know Harry isn't attracted to Hermione in any way and only considers her a friend. Like I said, their relationship is defined by what it isn't, rather than what it is. The last couple of books have more than a few examples of this sort of self-defeating writing that undercut Harry and Hermione's friendship in service of preventing people from shipping them.

Personally, I don't think this character dynamic is present in the first couple of books (and I'll concede I should have mentioned this earlier, rather than making it seem like I thought their relationship was like this from PS onwards), because the first book was written completely in isolation without input from the internet, and it probably didn't affect any of the next three books that much because the fandom was a bit smaller, the turnaround between each book was quick, the internet wasn't as popular to megaphone opinions, and the characters were still too young for romance to be an issue. But you can see a marked shift to writing more like the example I listed above after the "three year summer" when Jo started becoming aware of the shipping element of the fandom, which iirc she later described as a seething underbelly or something to that effect. I'll concede it's only present in bits and bobs throughout OotP but she has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer with it in HBP and, to a lesser extent, DH.

He doesn't have the same hobby as her, which is her studying obsession. He only dislikes hanging around with her alone when she's obsessing over that. In canon, this happens twice: When Ron is angry during GoF, and after he leaves in DH.

In GoF, she's attempting to break through his mental block regarding Summoning Charms, and later trying to teach him useful spells (I don't have the book in front of me, so I can't check if that was before preparations for the Third Task exclusively or not). This is an actual hole in his education that he's in danger of receiving irreparably bad marks on. A good friend would push through this and help her friend even if he wasn't all that interested. This is exactly what happens.

In DH, they're both reeling and in some ways actively grieving over the loss of Ron, along with the inability to maintain any personal space or privacy. Most people would probably be snappish with Mother Teresa in that circumstance.

That's possible, but I don't think this has effected their relationship at all, which had grown naturally out of the course of their childhood friendship. I think the reason she's so down on the Ron/Hermione relationship is because she's been exposed to the fandom's general distaste for Ron, and/or because she's let it slip that Ron is based on a real-life friend of hers and Hermione is based on her, and Rowling is married to another man IRL.

It's possible that it's just a hypothetical "normal girl" and that this specific reading of HBP caused me to miss the forest for the trees, but I think there's just too much evidence (in my opinion, of course) that it comes off as a really sly dig. The reason I've been avoiding giving more concrete examples is because all the examples would end up being extremely lengthy, require me to get out my copy of HBP and DH for quotations, and I'd be writing for ages using the semi-obtuse language of literary criticism, the kind that couldn't be dashed away in a quick reddit response. And, to be honest I'm a massively lazy cunt, and I don't really have the time or energy to be writing a formalist critical thesis on Harry's friendship with Hermione not working when framed around the Death of the Author. If you think that's a copout, fair fucks, it probably is; I can only lazily shrug in response. I would, however, really encourage you try re-reading at least the last couple of books with the metacontextual argument in mind if the interest ever takes you, you might be surprised what you find.

The problem is we don't get a lot of moments where they are alone together and do seem to genuinely enjoy hanging out with one another. Obviously we don't need them palling around like it's a sitcom or fawning and slobbering over each other as you put it, but it feels like there's so little of it, that there are people who occasionally come out on this sub and the main HP sub saying Harry and Hermione aren't very good friends, and a lot of people seem to agree.

It's possible. Fandom is a many-feathered bird; the fandom feeds off the author, who in turn feeds off the fandom. I think if you're gonna knock R/Hr, Hermione is just as culpable as Ron for their supposed incompatibility. After all, no matter what Ron may have done to Hermione, he never physically attacked her.

We don't /really/ get any with Harry and Ron outside of Divination, either. Harry just glosses over most of his school year unless it's important. On the other hand, we know that Harry and Ron probably /do/ have friendly moments that don't revolve around solving mysteries, and they just aren't mentioned.

On the contrary - when Hermione chooses Harry over Ron in their feud, he still stands up to Snape on her behalf. When Hermione started dating Krum, he masked his jealousy as concern, being worried that she was being taken advantage of and that Krum was really after a way to interfere with Harry. When she's gaga over Lockhart, Ron's skeptical of /him/, in what turns out to be a completely accurate judge of his character. When she dates McLaggen, he once again is negative towards /him/, not her, and again is proven correct when McLaggen turns out to be a pushy braggart with zero respect for others.

I see where you're coming from now, my only caveat to it would be that JK has never been the type of writer to just let the characters and their relationships speak for themselves.

You've got a point here; I think it has a lot to do with the fact that trio are most often exactly that, a trio, and their friendship makes the most amount of sense when all three are together. The individual friendships are never quite as strong as the whole, though I think the Harry/Ron and Hermione/Ron friendships are a little bit stronger than Harry/Hermione. Personally, I would've preferred if all of the trio found romance elsewhere in canon, purely because I do think that two of the three being romantically involved (whether it be R/Hr or if canon had shaken out to be H/Hr) would fundamentally alter the dynamics of their friendship.

****** I never disagreed with the argument that Harry doesn't enjoy spending time with Hermione, I said it was bad writing. Which it is. To me, Harry and Hermione's weird not-friendly-friendship seems like a byproduct of clunky writing rather than brilliant character development. The clunky writing was to serve JKR's aim of convincing us that Harry and Hermione are not compatible romantically, but all it left us with was a very shittily-written friendship between two supposedly very close friends.

Harry and Hermione are undeniably close friends. We see some instances where they get on super well; and we see some where they're kinda awkward. Personally I don't think that's inconsistent at all --- you can absolutely be awkward with close friends. But the awkward bits aren't 'bad writing' because it contradicts what you'd rather see portrayed.

And honestly, I think all this debate is kinda pointless. "Better" in a relationship is very subjective --- real-life healthy relationships have been built on much shakier ground. RHr and HHr are both perfectly plausible pairings, the former just happens to be canon.

But I dunno, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with two friends being awkward around each other, but imo all the parts where they get on seem to be because the narrative dictates they must be close friends for the series to work, and the parts where they don't get on seem to be written with an agenda. I hadn't really noticed it until several rereads and writing a bit myself, but all those sections read to me as JKR pointing at Harry and Hermione with big, flashing neon signs saying "hey they're not into each other," rather than the characters' relationship honestly being like that. Metacontextual writing like that is not bad writing per se (I was probably being a bit hyperbolic), but it weakens your writing when you treat a friendship between two characters as "not a romantic relationship" before an actual friendship.

Sometimes Harry's on board (like with Flamel), sometimes he reluctantly goes along with it (like with House Elf research), and sometimes he just can't be bothered because it's /so/ boring (like with the Half-Blood Prince stuff). Hermione's constantly submitting longer essays than she has to, whereas it's a tossup whether Harry or Ron even do theirs to the correct length.

******** I hope you'll bear with me, because this a pretty hard argument to articulate since it has far more to do with the metanarratives, and how authors can /force/ their narrative or characters in one way versus letting them unfurl naturally, than it has to do with the HP series in particular.

The problem with Harry and Hermione's friendship imo is because it often seems like there's very little to their friendship /beyond/ solving mysteries together, and it seems intentionally written so, not for reasons of consistent characterization of them clashing (because we know Ron and Hermione clash just as much as Harry and Hermione, but the former appear to enjoy spending time with each other far more than the latter) but rather for reasons regarding romance, or lack thereof in Harry and Hermione's case. Their friendship is defined by /what it isn't/ (a romantic relationship) rather than /what it actually is/ (a platonic friendship), and that inevitably leads to skewed character development.

In other words, their friendship didn't grow naturally because there is an anti-romantic metacontext informing how all of their interactions were written, platonic or otherwise, which inevitably led to their somewhat lifeless friendship. This is what I meant by saying JKR, intentionally or not, "poisoned the well" of their friendship. When I read the series again with that thesis statement in mind (Harry and Hermione's friendship is defined by what it isn't rather than what it is) it just seems glaringly obvious to me that their friendship as written only makes sense in that context. I hope that makes sense, and obviously you're welcome to disagree, but this is the conclusion I've come to based on several re-readings of the series.

Like I said in another comment, I was probably being a bit hyperbolic when I said it's bad writing, and I shouldn't have said that because people seem to be reading far more into the comment than I intended.

Hermione corrects people, frequently and tactlessly. Neither Ron nor Harry respond well to this; Ron seems more sensitive to the actual "you got it wrong" accusation, while Harry resents being bludgeoned with it instead of something gentler. (Consider, Professor Lupin criticised Harry sharply for not turning in the Marauders' Map, but he was able to put it in a way that Harry was upset only with himself.) While Hermione does later build more self-confidence, no longer hiding away in bathrooms to cry about people's reactions, she doesn't stop correcting and criticising. So, I probably wouldn't pair her with either of them without introducing story events that cause them to significantly change.

Their both wracked with guilt about Ron and are never able to settle into a relationship happily because of it. Harry is additionally burdened by the threat of losing the only family he's ever known. Those themes became common tropes after DH was released.

Of course some shippers like their fluff, but I think that can be said about any ship.

It's interesting though because I think many H/Hr shippers are put off with the opposite for canon ships, the lack of external conflict perhaps. That Harry marries Ron's sister and Hermione marries Ron and they're all interconnected in one happy family, all each-others brothers and sisters in law is seen as too clean and easy of ending.

** From a strictly canon perspective neither pairing seems that good. However for many people the characters of Harry and Hermione have evolved so much from canon. I personally find it very difficult to hold discussions purely based on canon information since all the characters (and mainly Harry and Hermione) have been influenced by many things outside the books. FanFiction is of course a big influence, but also the Harry/Hermione portrayal in the movies is not the same as book canon and much closer to how people view Harmony

** I remember not actually caring who ended up with whom. Now I dislike most canon ships, nor do I ship Harry Hermione. Though after reading some posts here I might start. I remember that Ron and Hermione's arguing always annoyed me, because they always seemed to find a reason to fight, even if it's just the fact the house elves threw them out. I think this irritates me so because arguments in general aren't something I find enjoyable to read, unless they are more more in joke form, like Harry and Hermione arguing whether there was something going on between the caretaker and the librarian. Another thing is that once they are both more or less aware they fancy each other, Ron is the one who actually tries to win Hermione's affection -he comforts her, pays her a compliment. So Ron has to work and she doesn't have to,say, be less critical. I get the feeling that Rowling liked Hermione too much to make her change. Rowling also said herself that Ron is insecure and Hermione is critical. To me that never seemed like a good combination.

  I'll admit I do read a lot. However, I am fairly sure its canon that Harry holds himself back at times as a child because Dudley (and his gang) threaten him and Vernon and Petunia also effectively hold him back through their attitudes and treatment.
#+end_quote

The whole "Harry has to hold himself back at school because the Dursley would be angry at him for being better than Dudley and accuse him of cheating" is 100% fanon.

Canon Harry was a neglected child (doesn't mean it is not abuse), as long as he followed their rules (ask no question, do nothing strange, stay out of our way), the Dursley could not care less about him.\\
Had Harry been some kind of male Hermione who always have the best grades, the Dursley, and mainly Vernon, would just have said something like /"I'm glad MY son is not some kind of pansy"/.\\
And I fail to see how Dudley gang would have any influence on Harry's grade. If anything, Harry would have been safer in a library (in full view of the bookeeper) than in a park or a playground where Dudley could hit him without any adult to see them be violent.

‚Äã

Harry was average at school because, apart from being Magical Jesus, he as the Mc needed to someone the reader could empathise with, and it's easier to empathise with the average guy than some kind of genius.\\
Also, if you think about the role of each character, an intelligent Harry would make Hermione useless. In canon (at least the book, let's not talk about what they did with the movies), both Ron and Hermione have a role of exposition :

- Ron is the "street smart" kid who is her to explain all the cultural things to Harry (and so, the reader). It's him who explain why "Mudblood" is a bad word or what are the Aurors.
- Hermione is the "book smart" kid who can explain theorical things to Harry, or teach him the spell he just needed because "she read this in the library".

‚Äã

I'm not a fan of the Harry/ Hermione ship (in big part thanks to fanfiction where there is so much "Perfect Hermione" stories that I can barely support the character), but I don't understand why some people think than making Harry more intelligent (or studious) would make him a better character "worthy of Hermione" when in the end, it would just take away most of Hermione place in the plot and reduce her to nothing more than a glorified extra. Or at least it would be the case if people wrote Hermione as in canon, from what I saw fanon made her some kind of godess who is the only reason why the good guys won in the end (or why Harry and Ron managed to pass classes in school, or just think about breathing really).

I mean, he wants to stand out from his brothers but never really does anything to do so. He's afraid that his friend gets the girl, but we all have the friend who conquers women like he's Barney Stinson, and I don't resent my bro for getting more than me. Or the one I found cute.

Which is why I find the Horcrux scene so bad. They are in the middle of a civil war where Umbridge is deporting Muggleborns into a concentration camp guarded by demons and death squads roam the land. But Ron's worst fear is Harry and Hermione having sex? Being second best? And not the brutal torture, rape and execution of Hermione by the Death Eaters? Or his own family getting that fate, possibly because of him? Or him getting imperiused to murder Ginny? Or losing the war and Voldemort having free reign?

I'd argue that the Lestrange brothers taking turns with Ginny while Bellatrix cackles that this is the price they have to pay for Ron's defiance would not reinforce anyone's fighting spirit. Or taunting them that Ron personally lost the war if you want to go with insecurities.

Under normal circumstances maybe the Horcrux would be understandable, but not during the war. I mean, Harry wouldn't do anything Hermione would not want him to do. You cannot say the same about the Death Eaters. If he truly cared about Hermione, Harry would not be a threat in his mind due to that.
