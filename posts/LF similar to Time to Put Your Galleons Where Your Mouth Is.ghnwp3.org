Says it all on the tin. Just finished linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is) and what there is of linkffn(Put my Galleons on That One) and I'm looking for something similar. I guess that means MOD!Harry, reincarnation/dimension travel, from pureblood/famous family, potentially a focus on relationships, memories of the past/slightly overpowered, good guy Harry, defeat of Voldemort. I prefer longer but desperate for anything along these lines so yeah. Please no Harem, Dark!Harry, romance with Voldemort. Suggestions welcome!

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Biweekly updates. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  As Master of Death, Harry can't really die. What he can do is get reborn, in an alternate dimension that is so much like his old world but so different at the same time. Taking down Voldemort again? Bring it on. MoD Harry DISCONTINUED
