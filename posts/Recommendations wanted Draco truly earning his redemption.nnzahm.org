Hey all .Title says it all, really. In canon and in quite a few fics I've read, Draco has been forgiven all too easily and it's deeply unsatisfying. It feels like a cop out.

I'm looking for stories where he really puts in the work earns forgiveness. Maybe he does time in Azkaban. Maybe he has to go on a mission with Harry/Ron/Hermione and really shows them he's changed...

I want angst and tension and I want to believe in the change.


** Linkffn(Exile by bennybear) Draco loses his wealth and status and exiles himself to the muggle world to live without magic. Eventually marries a muggle. The important point here is that this story has No Romance. Mixing Romance with Redemption arcs always muddles things. This Draco did it on his lonesome. He slowly overcomes his prejudices and comes to terms with his past.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** The Code by Aduro. He doesn't redeem himself but he slowly learns the errors of his ways.

Lost Children by idr, again idk if it's the type of redemption you're looking for but he learns the errors of his ways, but this one is slash
