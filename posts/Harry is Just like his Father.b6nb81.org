Harry one day getting sick of Snape saying "YOU'RE JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER" with insert random insult here, so he decides to be just that. Pranking Snivellus, coming up with some insulting name similar for Malfoy, ridiculously over the top Pranks galore.

*** I... really don't think James wanted to woo Lily because she was bright. He seemed to be into her because she was pretty and easy to rile up, which still aligns more with Ginny as she was described in the text.

**** I didn't mean he wanted to woo her because he was bright. Only that he would want to woo a girl and that the girl was a in both case a bright muggleborn in his House.

But yeah it was more likely because she was pretty and maybe her temper. But I'm pretty sure Hermione can have a right temper when she's into it. Maybe in a less flamboyant way than Ginny.

***** That's true - Hermione definitely also has a temper. There was that incident with the birds after the Yule ball, for example.

Also honestly, if he was doing it to piss off Snape (at least maybe at the beginning), dating the brightest muggleborn witch in his house would probably do it the best.

***** I wanted to start listing all the muggleborn girls that aren't Hermione... You know, there really isn't ANY? Hermione is the ONLY muggleborn girl anywhere near Harry's age. With the possible exception of Penelope, but she's not certain.

Does Myrtle count? She's muggleborn... but also dead. So still technically Harry's age?

** Harry is like James, just without the charisma and talent.

James was someone who would move mountains if it meant helping his friends - and Harry fights a basilisk for his best friend's little sister. He faces Dementors for Sirius, someone he'd hated until half an hour before the dementors attacked. James saved Snape even though he hated Snape - and Harry saves Draco from Fiendfyre, even though he hated Draco.

** I like the idea that Harry takes it as a challenge to be even more like his father than his father. It'd be like Harry making his own version of the Marauders except with more blackjack and hookers.

Instead of a werewolf, they have a hot chick that turns into a catgirl. Instead of letting a traitor in, he adds another hot girl. I can just imagine him trying to talk to the group about how to get with the hot brainy muggleborn in Griffyndor with the group, while Hermione is present.
