Has anyone seen different reasons in fanfic as to why Voldemort is immortal/ wasn't killed at Godric's hollow?


** I think I read one where as long as he had followers he could draw life force from them, essentially making him immortal

*** The dark mark tattoo mechanic was popular at one time. In some, they were mini-horcruxes, in others, he could draw life-force and/or magic from them.

***** I love the novels that do that, usually the Death Eater's that "get away" end up squibs or dead.

** I believe Starfox5 uses everytime Voldemort appears in a story he/she writes Voldemort uses a different way to become immortal. In linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider) he uses ancient egyptian curses to become immortal, in linkffn(Divided and Entwined) wierd Voodoo and in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) he becomes some sort of vampire.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Cant remember the fics name but basically voldemort made a pact with a lovecraftian being for imortality but didnt end up holding to his end of the bargin since he was already given it once the deal was struck, and the prophecy was the lovecraftian beings warning to either hold true or Itll take it back.
