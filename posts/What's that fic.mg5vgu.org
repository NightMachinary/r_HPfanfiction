:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a fic that seems like it might be abandoned. Here's all the plot details I can remember. Harry's dad was called the Barmy Baron, and was a great duellist. He invented a Pumpkinhead hex. He trapped Peeves in the Shrieking shack with the invisibility cloak.

Also, Grindelwald's duel with Dumbledore ended in a draw, so Grindelwald controlled Eastern Europe with his Tristula. I just can't remember the name. Can anyone help me?

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.
