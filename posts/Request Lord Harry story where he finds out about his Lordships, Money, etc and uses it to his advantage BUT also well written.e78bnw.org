I've do love these type of stores, especially time travel where he gets a do-over and can fix everything, but a lot of them as so badly written I just lose interest. They are often written like a checklist so it's hard to get into the story. Please recommend me your favorites of this genre! Can be time travel, or just Harry getting help from someone to realize things people have been hiding from him.

Preferably complete, or at least enough of a story that it is still worth reading if it's been abandoned


** A Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali. So political. So full of family history. So well written. It's on both FFN and AO3, and it's abandoned, but over 100k so still worth it.

**** Yes and no. The story is mainly about Harry learning the truth and gradually recovering from the aftermath. In my opinion the plot is full of fascinating moments and really picks up steam after Harry gets a mentor, but the meat of the plot is about Harry learning and improving himself, not action scenes. Personally I liked the dramatic tension in the first chapter when Harry sits down alone to catalogue all of the inconsistencies he has noticed, but if you don't enjoy that scene then you probably won't like much of the rest of the fic.

** " Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw" Is actually pretty good.... I think.

I have also read so many fanfictions that I have been getting desperate for more and may have let my taste slip. I honesly cant even tell anymore. This is a harem story without sex (its about arranged marriages for politics)

Its wrong-boy-who-lived. It does have a dumb greater-good Dumbledore but at least it has the best reason I have ever seen for the dumb-greater-good trope.

It does have child politics... but it also uses occulmancy as an excuse to raise the intelligence of the children. effectivly aging their minds.

Also this is an askaban harry and a time travel harry and an absorbs Voldemorts knowledge harry.

It manages to give harry these powers without making it look like he should just one shot voldie. It evens the playing field.

It is long and it a Writing-in-process. It just updated 5 days ago so it is still good.

Also the writer makes rituals fun to visualize. Which is a major bonus in my books.

Also ignore the shitty title. I passed it up for worse reads many times before I gave in.

*** This is a harem fic though with a very badly written harem part. Enough to turn me off the whole story and I usually don't mind romance, slash or similar. The harem.part is just plain and and wrong and at times disgusting as hell. (I had to nope out at a certain persons ritual for fertility to have lots and lots of children. At the age of 13. Soo instead of a ritual which would've boosted her magic? Her intelligence? Her whatever? She chose to become a breeding machine, because that's the trope the harem needed. A caregiving matron. At 13.)

***** I'm not categorically complaining about a 13 yo who wants to be a mother. I am talking about her choices or non-choices from both a literary view and morally one. I am complaining about the general disadvantage of harems , ie. That characters have to follow a specific trope and thus receive no character development. And when would they? With several harem members and one protagonist you simply cannot spend a lot of time with each member and give them proper room to.grow or "be" outside of the mold they are already in.

For example: the feisty warrior girl who abhors weakness and unquestioningly follows strength. Gasp! The protagonist is stronger than her and subjugates her. She is smitten. She is one of his now. Because he was stronger.

Except for dry heaving from a literary standpoint, it sounds unhealthy.

Speaking of unhealthy... The protagonist is a sex offender. While physically young, he is still mentally much much older than the girls. What does he do? He grooms the girls. He grooms and guides them into his personal literal harem. He uses his knowledge and age and status to get them.

And that grooming is harmful as seen with fertility girl. That girl has not known anything.else but his grooming. Her whole life has been decided before she even entered puberty. And now she wants to give herself more to him by ensuring that she will give him healthy and many children and her one true burning desire is to be the matron of the household, his number one woman? Disgusting.

No. He just have very one-track mind when he is in a situation where there is potential for rise of another Dark Lord. Harry was victim of such situation. Dumbledore is not a good person here but we have a reason for that too. As for story recommendation, I would also suggest 'Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man' and 'The Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool'. The Sinister Man is another genius of world-building. LinkFFN(11191235) LinkFFN(8045114)

*** Sounds like lazy writing to me.

Harry gets Voldemort's knowledge is just a lazy way to make Harry powerful quick quick.

Occulumency doesn't age people. It's meant to protect the mind against legilimency.

Harem? Like seriously? Why? What good reason is there for Harem in the fic?

Azkaban Harry. In short, another lazy way to effectively give Harry an excuse to go against Dumbledore and his friends. The so called "Light", making him become Independent.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
