I haven't been reading fanfic for a huge amount of time and i cant seem to push myself to read fics that won't be completed or are abandoned.

I feel like imma get to the 'end' and be thoroughly disappointed that the story doesn't finish itself off nicely or at all.

Is reading incomplete fanfic worth it?

Maybe you could like some of the best ones and i'll give them a read.

All discussions make me feel popular and are therefore appreciated :)


** It's not the destination, it's the journey. There are lots of cool moments you miss out on if you don't read a fic just because it's abandoned.

** I personally go fandom to fandom looking for a niche story genre, and will take anything for that, bad stories, incomplete stories, the works. Because of this, if I want some trope and have exhausted all the completed fics I can go to incomplete ones and find more reading material.

Plus, if you always limit yourself to completed stories then you'll miss out on some gems of the fandom like (imo) I'm Still Here (though I'll admit my pairing and trope preferences do color that statement.)

** I think this is really a personal thing -- ultimately, unfinished stories /really bother/ some folks and don't bother other folks at all. When it comes to fanfiction, I generally fall into the latter category, partly because fanfic authors aren't great at writing convincing endings anyway, and so the story doesn't miss much from having them left off, and partly because the reason I read fanfiction is to explore new ideas or to spend some more time with the characters, and neither of those things miss much from having the ending left off.

Also, there's a bunch of wonderful, wonderful incomplete or abandoned stories out there, and it would be a shame to miss out on them! There's also nothing quite like reading along with a story as it's being released. That's doubly true for stories that update rarely or which you thought abandoned, where getting the email that they've got a new chapter is an amazing gift.

Staple abandoned fics include Out of the Night, by Raining Ink, linkffn(The Life and Times), linkffn(A Long Journey Home), linkffn(Harry Potter: The Last Avatar), as well as a number which have already been linked, like 0-800 rent-a-hero.

*** I think I would be much more disappointed/upset if I was reading a real book and it cut off halfway through, or if I was watching a TV show that was cancelled after a number of episodes or the like.

But that's because in general, published fiction is a lot tighter and has a lot more tension than fanfiction does, which is honestly part of the reason I read and like fanfiction. When I'm too stressed out to read published novels, in which bad & distressing shit is always happening to the main character, I can still read fanfiction, where even the most angsty stories tend to be fluffy and low-tension in their way.

This same lack of tension is why I don't really mind when there never ends up being a next chapter, because the narrative doesn't really demand one, nor feel incomplete without one. It'd be like if /Friends/ or /The Office/ were cancelled after five seasons, vs. if /Game of Thrones/ had been.

** I'd say it varies based on the fic. Some, like !linkffn(Harry Potter and the Children of Change) don't end on a cliffhanger and are such joys to read that it's honestly worth it to read them. That said, for every fic that ends on a decent note, there are fics that end on extreme cliffhangers. I personally enjoy the gamble once in a while, though if you're not sure, then ask around.

** After I read a story, I don't even remember the ending unless it's a bad or shocking one. I mean, in all happy endings they usually just resolve the problem or finish off Voldemort, right? Forgettable, and easy to just pretend that happened in a story without an ending. "What's the ending?" "Oh, they killed Voldemort." Done.

What I tend to remember are the cool ideas and nice/dramatic character moments, and you can have some of the best of those in stories that are never finished. I also love length and really having time to get into a story, I'd much prefer a 300k unfinished than a 40k finished if both were wonderfully written.

My three favorite unfinished:

linkao3(Messing With Time by slythernim)

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Yes, it is disappointing, but still plenty of those unfinished stories have a lot of good story written already. Yes, it is disappointing not having the resolution, but better something than nothing. I really like some Northumbrian's unfinished stories (which given he seemed to give up on fanfiction and write the original stories will probably be never finished) like linkao3(6057483;3068435;8402590), which despite not being finished are some of the most finest pieces of fanfiction I know about.

Or linkffn(8429437) is probably unique (as far as I know) in many aspects, and if I skipped it because it is unfinished (and it has title like some novel of Marquise de Sade) I would miss very nice piece of writing.

** I usually have no problem reading incomplete fics *IF I know beforehand* so I am mentally prepared for the sudden absence of story. Unfinished stories that are unexpected feel like a mass avada kedavra on every character and now there's a huge hole in my heart because the world that I immersed myself in has been shattered.

Nightmares of Future Past was my first experience with the pain of an unfinished story. It felt like a mild cruciatus curse.

** I read most of the old and most likely abandoned fics because I like the concept being written, especially when that concept is pretty rare or written well. Many of these fics had potential and was interesting to read but the author just ran out of ideas. Some make me want to actually adopt the stories and finish them myself. Adopting a story is an actual thing people do too.
