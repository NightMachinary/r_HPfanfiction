** On the larger scale, nothing. Bigotry against muggleborns and creatures would still exist, maybe spread more uniformly among the Houses. Tom Riddle would still exist, maybe with a few minor tweaks in his agenda. Event of the CoS would be different, but diary!Tom would surely find a way to terrorise Hogwarts even without a basilisk.

Without Slytherin-Gryffindor rivalry, Gryffindors would focus more on being against two other houses (and vise versa), because if there is a gap, something will fill it.

There might be changes depending on where Slytherin characters would be sorted to. Riddle would probably be a Ravenclaw, although watching him build an army of loyal and hardworking Hufflepuffs would be very interesting. Snape and Draco can both be either Ravenclaws or Gryffindors, and even if the former is more plausible and won't change anything, I'd prefer the latter because of the possibilities (yes, Draco Malfoy could totally be a Gryffindor, fight me. He's reckless and impulsive, likes to run his mouth and doesn't think about consequences - all the worst qualities of the red and gold crowd). Bellatrix would be in Gryffindor, and Slughorn with his networking is definitely a Puff. Other characters, we just don't know enough about.
