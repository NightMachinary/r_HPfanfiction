A while ago I read a one shot about Petunia feeling compelled to visit Lily's grave some weeks after learning about the final death of Voldemort. After years of ignoring the grave she expects it to be neglected and has brought her gardening tools but finds barely any weeds and the caretaker tells her a man used to come every week to tend the grave but he hasn't been coming for a few weeks now... it was beautiful and heartbreaking. Anyone remember the one I mean? Would appreciate finding it.


** I do remember it. Was it on FF.net or another site?
