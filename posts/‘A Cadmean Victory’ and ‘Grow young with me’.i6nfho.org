Throughout my time in this subreddit, these 2 fics feature prominently whenever someone asks for good fics. My question is, why? I've read the first couple of chapters of both but was sort of put off-maybe i was expecting too much. But still, what's all the hype about??? Their titles are good and the ships are good, but other than that it's just an average fic for me.

atleast it isn't lord potter-otter-tter-ter-er-r-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-and a whole lot more crap

** Cadmean victory is long, completed, and features a popular pairing. It also had frequent updates before it was completed. That's about all any fic needs to be extremely popular. Nothing to do with being good or well-written.

** People in this fandom seem to use 'Good Fic' like we all mean the same thing and know exactly what that thing is - even though we absolutely don't. For some, you need excellent technical writing and a tightly structured plot for a fic to be good. For others, it just has to be fun (add in 'and/or interesting' and that's the definition that I use). There's probably a hundred more varying definitions, likely even more than that.

I imagine that your definition of a good fic simply differs from that of the people recommending those two fics. If enough people's definitions overlap and they encounter it often enough, a fic becomes popular. :)

*** That's true, a ‘Good fic' could be anything to anyone- like someone's ‘good fic' could be Lord-Potter-Black-something-something with bashing of Weasleys(Weasels), Grangers and Dumbledore (Dumbles Dumb-as-a-door Old Goat etc), but it's always good to hear another's opinion of a ‘good fic' to try it out yourself, and see if it works for you.

**** Oh, on a personal level, very much agreed. But at the end of the day, this is all just entertainment. If a fic isn't entertaining you, then you've no obligation to stick around for it, and if you know you won't be entertained by poor technical writing, then I can understand why you wouldn't bother with the fic. You just have to keep in mind that what entertains people will be different when listening to recommendations. :)

** For myself, Grow Young With Me tugged at the heartstrings, especially the part about Ginny's death and what it did to Harry and his children. The author really portrayed how that would have crushed them, and it's beautiful to see the family healing. And Abby helps that process along. So that's why I like it.

I didn't enjoy A Cadmean Victory or read very far. Harry became too cold and cruel toward his friends; it's not necessarily bad writing, but I didn't like reading it. Even the finest quality cut glass still doesn't taste good.

** For just Cadmean Victory, it's been awhile since I've read it, but it is probably because:

1. It is a well written story, given fanfiction standards (that's not to say it is perfect)
2. It is completed.
3. The pairing and is one of the fleshed out completed story for the pairing.
4. Decent world building.
5. Okay pacing.
6. Solid consistency for characters that flows, or at least isn't completely out of the norm given their experience in the story.
7. Uniqueish Indy!Harry, Mentored Harry
8. It goes against the grain of a everyone gets a happy ending
9. Not sure if this one is true, but given the time it was posted and completed, it is probably one of the first stories to do what it did. Trope wise.

There's probably more, but I think that's probably why it gets recommended.

I would not say it is an average fic, given the sheer volume of fanfiction out there. it is probably in the top 10% minimum, I would say top 5% personally.

*** So...HPMoR satisfies 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9, with at least an interesting take on 3 (since it only covers first year, actual romance wouldn't have made much sense), 5 is hard to objectively judge, and there's at least room to debate 6. But it gets a lot of hatred. Have you read it?

**** I've read both. HPMOR comes across very cracky and the character feels like a know-it-all. It was a mix of Enders Game, high school (college/university level?) science and Harry Potter. It did it well and told its story but it didn't ever make me connect to it. When I read a story, I want to experience an emotional journey and connect to the characters. In A Cadmean Victory, I related to Harry experiencing heartbreak. I related to the regrets, the striving to prove oneself and the loss of innocence. I didn't relate to the robot-Harry in HPMOR. That's how I rate a story when I look back at them. Sure, there are technical flaws (and annoying bits of plot/character development) in ACV, but it took me on a relatable journey despite that. That's what counts for me.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I think Cadmean Victory was more recommended in the past. It's a long, completed fic with a popular, yet not overly common, romantic interest which I think it's why it's so popular.

I personally don't find it objectively good enough to be recommended but some people place more value on subjective interests like the sacrificial magic or the Harry/Fleur angle. Which is fine, by the way.

** They're recommended when someone asks for fics because they're in two of the most popular subgenres of fanfiction - shipping/romance, and in Cadmean Victory's case, independent Harry. Most readers (including me) don't read across a super broad assortment of genres, so I find it's helpful to specify what you like when asking for recommendations.

I finished Cadmean Victory, started and DNFed Grow Young With Me. I actually think the writing and execution in GYWM is much better. But it's a straightforward capital R Romance featuring a lot of angst, not what I'm looking for in fanfic. Cadmean Victory was meh, a decent guilty pleasure for me.

** I forget stories as soon as I finish them, so I can't offer many specifics about Grow Young With Me, but the main point I liked about the story is that it characterized harry and the others in a very good way. They are damaged by the war, Harry most of all, and that is something that has to be worked on and around. In addition to an excellent mixture of the wizarding and the muggle world, we get to peek into a very real feeling world with realistic emotions and interactions.

But that might be completely wrong, it's been a hot minute.

** Grow Young With Me is a well-written example of one of the most popular genres of fanfic: a fairly boring original character, a thinly-veiled author-insert, comforts a sexy canon character who's been traumatized by canon events, so the canon character falls in love with the author-insert and they live together happily ever after. I'm not fond of this type of story either, but many people are. I don't begrudge them their enjoyment of it. There are different types of fanfics to suit all tastes.
