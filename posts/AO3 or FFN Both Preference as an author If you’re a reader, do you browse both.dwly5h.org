I realize this may be like asking whether you prefer Microsoft ME or Vista, but worth a shot...

I posted on HPFF years ago and went inactive for a long time. I went back when I learned the site was back up but it's not what it used to be, and I'm sure it could go again at any time. I decided to migrate my fics to another site and continue writing.

Someone at the NaNoWriMo forums suggested AO3 over FFN, said he found it more user friendly overall. So I've started up an account at AO3.

I do notice a lot of hate for AO3 tags (not that I can blame anyone - it was the first thing that turned me off when I visited the site - absolutely overwhelming), and I didn't realize until I read a post here that apparently AO3 has a reputation for being where a bunch of explicit stuff has gone because FFN cracked down on it?

Anyhow, if you're an author or a reader, which site do you use? Does everyone just use both? I mean, both would be better for exposure, I'm sure.

If you find one “better,” what is it specifically? User-friendliness? Readership? Content restrictions or lack thereof? Is one of them considered “better” for HP fic in particular?


** FFN pros:

- Strict limits on summary length and character tags. Makes figuring out what a fic is going to be about easier than Ao3. (People still get around the limitations on relationship tags by spamming alphabet soup, eg. "HP/GW/DG/LL/HG/RV/FD".)

- Old site, 20 years of fanfic backlog to read.

- Mobile interface for reading on the phone.

- Large and consistent readerbase that has stuck around while Geocities, Sugarquill, Portkey, Livejournal crashed and burned.

- More in-depth reader stats for authors, showing hits per chapter.

.

Ao3 pros:

- Unlimited tags and summary length. Makes filtering for specific fic types, characters, relationships, story tropes, and timeline eras easier. (People abuse tags and have 20 lines of individual tags for the most minor characters, just to get the most hits in filter searches.)

- Newish site. Less content, but has mirror copies of fics that were deleted or transferred from other sites. No one has to worry about fics facing purges due to rule changes or lawyer-happy published authors, as FFN has done over the years for real person fics, explicit fics, "X reads the books", script fics, and fanfics based on books by Anne Rice or Anne McCaffrey.

- Legal protection for fanfic authors.

- No ads.

- Relatively engaged audience. Comment system allows open discussion, versus "PM to reply to reviews" on FFN.

- Fic uploading interface is better, doesn't have to deal with the "document upload" system of FFN.

*** Thank you for this thoughtful reply! On the subject of AO3 legal protections, I did really enjoy reading that is part of their mission. Not something I expected to necessarily impact me personally since JKR is supportive of fanfic, but I liked the sentiment and dedication to writers.

So on FFN, you literally have to upload something like a word doc, rather than pasting the text?

**** You can copy-paste the text or upload a word doc, but each chapter has to be uploaded into the system individually, and it's a hassle to go through the edit-reformat-reupload when you're fixing typos on existing published chapters. The copy-paste process destroys formatting (line breaks, quotes, lists) if you wrote in Gdocs or Word, and they automatically censor certain words, characters, and phrases.

Eg, they delete anything that looks like a link. So if you write "Thanks for reviewing, user John.Doe.1990" in your author notes, FFN will automatically reformat it as "JohnDoe1990".

Super annoying and unintuitive as fuck.

** I dont know if I could label one or the other as 'better' for potterfic but I can share my experiences and why I now almost exclusively read on ao3.

To start off, I love the tag system. Yes it's not perfect and there is a /lot/ of unnecessary or slang tags present but that doesnt mean that you as an author have to use them all right away or ever if you dont want to. But as a reader the ability to find the specific kind of fic I want to read (a specific AU, time-travel, desi!harry, or anything else) without having to rely on that information being in a summary is great, not to mention that the ability to filter OUT content I don't enjoy (pairings as either a focus or side pairing, content, or yes rating) is often even more valuable. I also adore the series function that means I never fear missing a new installment in a fic due to not obsessively checking an author's profile. Kudos are a great way to send positive opinion without perpetually clogging up you bookmarks (just because I enjoyed your story doesnt mean that I plan on revisiting it regularly)

While the explicit content on ao3 is certainly a more obvious presence then it ever was on FFN or many other old archives that doesn't mean that non-explisit content is unappreciated or even in the minority between the 3 ratings of non-sexual content that can be selected.

As for FFN, well for me it's not my go to anymore. I have personally found that little in the way of what is published there currently interests me. Even here on the subreddit most of the recommendations for FFN stories I've noticed are all fics that were completed during the heyday of fic writing. Many of the fic I loved on FFN that I subscribe to have not updated in literal years and I have found that my desire to seek out replacements and the effort that would require with FFN's search system is too great for me.

But I encourage you to try both as a reader and an author. Maybe try posting on both and see if there is a difference is the receptions you recive. No system is made perfectly for everyone, but I will keep an eye out for you on the archive.

Good luck!

*** Hey, thank you so much for this extensive response! I may give FFN a shot just to see how I like it. I felt like it might be too overwhelming to do both, but I think that once I actually finish revising and migrating my previous fics (there are about 20, including some with multiple chapters) it wouldn't be too labor-intensive to keep up each time I make an update.

** AO3's reputation for smut is a thing long past. Now it is comparably big with FFN to having all kinds of stories.

There is only one reason why anybody would go for FFN and that is perceived size of your readership. FFN is just so large, that many authors (I had this conversation with Northumbrian) have much response there. Everything else (comfort for authors, comfort for readers, support for mobile web, search, comment system allowing conversation; I don't do mobile applications) is just better at AO3.

** FFN just kind of feels old next to AO3 to me. It lacks a lot of what AO3 has while not doing too much better than it. I find it way easier to categorize my work for people to find on AO3, and a lot easier to discover new work there as well.

People do, of course, abuse and clog up the tagging system, but it still gives you a much better way to discover content and search for specific things than you can on FFN. Especially because you can filter things OUT with as much detail as you can filter them IN, which really helps narrow down searches. And even without tags, the filtering on AO3 is much more comprehensive and flexible. Particularly for, uh, porn, AO3 really lets you find what you're specifically looking for at that moment, while FFN is more hoping the search algorithm gives you some good recs.

Also, some authors just kind of suck at summaries. Or sometimes a summary is just a random line from the fic, or an update on the latest chapter. Tags can really help show you what a story is actually about when an author's vague or flowery summary doesn't tell you much.

Overall, FFN doesn't do anything bad. But AO3's superior filtering, plus tagging and numerous additional features, all add up to make it the obvious choice for me.

All this is applicable to the desktop sites, I don't use the mobile ones at all.

** I use both fairly frequently. There's about a 50-50 split on recommendations from either site from various subreddits. However as a general user, I prefer AO3. I find it much easier to simply browse for something that interests me since I can just include whatever fandoms/additional tags that I desire. I've never found it to be overwhelming, but that could be because I started reading on Wattpad, which is arguably worse than both of them in some ways. As for disliking FFN, I honestly find it really difficult to find things that interest me outside of outright being given stories. The tags are confusing and as far as I know, I can't sort results like a can on AO3 (I like sorting by Kudos or Bookmarks usually).

Edit: just noticed your question about content. I don't browse much on FFN, but I do know that there are a lot of explicit stories on AO3. I can't speak for the comparison, but AO3 definitely has awesome fanfics that aren't explicit as well. I've found both experiences quite rewarding, especially since you can choose to exclude any ratings that you want, or search by only explicit if that's your desire.

** Personally except for GoT fanfics I've never come across good AO3 fics that aren't posed on ffn.net. But to be fair I haven't spent nearly as much time there as on ffn.net as I was initially put off with the amount of fucked up shit there is on AO3. Really smut is the only thing I use it for. There might be a lot of morally unacceptable smut on there but luckily there's a lot of regular smut as well.

This might be an unfair comparison but I've always felt like with the ridicoulous amount of horrifying stuff you can find on AO3, AO3 is like the 'dark/deep web' of fanction whereas ffn.net is just your regular 'internet' meant for a casual read.

Is AO3 friendlier? Yes. Maybe because it's used by an older audience eventhough it's just a 13+ website.

Content restriction? Well that's something I'm in favour of. And since I read an enormous amount of really good fics over at ffn.net I can't say it's made me miss out.

What I did notice is that there's a very large number of slash oriented fics on AO3 even more than there's on ffn.net. So if that's your thing maybe you'll like it?

Personally my main problem is that if I read something fucked up it stays with me whereas others can just shrug it off. So I have a mild case of archiveophobia.

I've learned that the only way to safely enjoy AO3 is to bookmark a page you created in advance with all those tags you don't like (underage, particular pairings,...) and use that as a front page when going through the search on a particular fandom.

But since writers aren't forced to use tags even that might be pointless...

The main thing AO3 has ffn.net undoubtably beat in is their huge filter/tagging system.

I love the 'community' option over at ffn.net though. You can just look up 'time travel' and you'll get thousands of stories some good soul already organized for you in a single folder :).

I also think that their crossover search system is way better than AO3's.

Anyway, hope this was helpful.

**** So on the frontpage of ffn.net you see two columns for 'books', 'movies', ... If, for example, you click the second column 'books' and then 'Harry Potter' you get a new page filled with info of other fandoms and their exact number of fics that have existing crossovers with Harry Potter. Just click on something et voilà.

To me it feels way more structured and easy on the eyes than doing it on AO3. In AO3 if you want to search for a possible crossover you have to write a particular fandom in the 'include tag' bar and hope you find something matching.

You should really try reading some crossovers. There's some really, really good stuff written out there. My personal favourites are HP/star wars and HP/GoT crossovers.

** I do find AO3 more user-friendly overall... but also friendlier in tone. FFN seems to have a lot more bitching and sour commenters. Yes, AO3's reputation of having all the adult stuff not accepted on FFN is deserved... but being a bit of a pervy girl I don't actually mind this.

My personal experiences have been... well.

I started out on AO3... only have one fic there, and got a number of "You have to post this to FFN too!" requests-slash-demands. I wasn't really too keen... Even as a reader I vastly prefer AO3. FFN never sat quite right with me for some reason.

But after a few people had used the "but you'll get soooo many more readers on FF.Net!" argument, and at least two people in unrelated discussions declared their hatred for AO3 and refusal to ever read anything on that site, I relented. There was nothing wrong in posting my fic on both sites. Not like this is an exclusive deal, after all. So I signed up for FFN and started posting my fanfic.

It didn't really change my mind. Uploading fics to FFN is needlessly complicated and counter-intuitive, as is editing your content. All this Doc Manager nonsense and having to go through five hundred steps before the chapter is actually posted... who thought that was a good idea?

And don't even get me started on editing the chapters. Say you read through one of your fic and spot a typo that you'd somehow missed during the spellcheck or read-through.

On AO3, it's simple to fix the mistake. Go to "Edit Chapter," fix the typo -- boom, done.

On FFN you have to go to the Doc Manager, and if the document in question has expired you have to re-upload it to FFN again, before editing it, then going to "update stories," find the story in question, go to "Add/Replace chapters," choose the correct chapter and the correct document from drop-down menus, and then... I JUST WANTED TO FIX A STUPID TYPO!!

This wasn't the worst of it though. Turned out I'd signed up in the middle of a glitchy period. I very quickly got two reviews for the first chapter, but I couldn't view them because a glitch on the site (which people were complaining about on the forums) made the reviews inaccessible to read. I'd made sure I'd set up "e-mail me for all reviews" but that didn't happen either.

Now, I can forgive some glitches, and I realize I was a victim of bad timing more than anything else, but still, this did not make for a very good first impression of FFN as a writer.

Took a few days before I got to see the reviews, and when I actually did... two reviews were from the same person, accusing me of being a plagiarist who had stolen the story from AO3. I mean, I have like the same username on both sites, so I would have thought it was obvious I was the same person, but apparently not.

I also got PMs from some guy who wanted me to explain a loli-yuri-manga to him. What the...? I know I've made it clear my fic will eventually contain femmeslash, and yes, the protagonist is a young child in the early chapters, but surely there's a bit of a leap from that to "if you ever want me to explain the intricacies of some random adult-rated manga with underage girls, by all means give me a call!"? I SWEAR I never said that!

Now, fair is fair... There ARE things I have liked about FFN. I like how you can see how many views/reviews the individual chapters of your story has. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't appreciate the number of readers... one week up on FFN and I had almost half the views that the AO3 story got over three months. Also, being placed on the favourites and alerts lists of several people was satisfying...

But there have been several annoyances here that I simply don't have on AO3.

So yeah... I go with AO3 when I can.

*** I'm actually really glad you brought up the bitchy commenters, because I just had my first experience with that and I'm a little put off and wondered whether I'm crazy for thinking like this. I'm not some princess who needs to be coddled or complimented 100% of the time; I appreciate constructive criticism and hearing from people who disagree with me. But I don't understand the point of leaving a one- or two-sentence pissy, pedantic comment that only says you disagree with the entire premise of my story - which is what just happened to me, two days after I started using FFN.

A reviewer basically left this comment that said, “X character would never act in x way, and Y character doesn't deserve y.” And that was ALL. And the fic was very clearly a naive wish-fulfillment vision from Y's POV, so to say X would never act that way entirely misses the point.

Like..I don't go read fics featuring a ship I don't support and leave a one-sentence comment saying, “This ship would never realistically happen,” and nothing more.

It could certainly happen on any site, but by now your response here is not the only one I've heard about FFN having a reputation for bitchy comments. I wonder whether that has anything to do with the fact that there are no public replies by the author. Because you can just go shit on whatever you want and the only thing the author can do is privately message you, and that's just begging to turn into a pissing match.

Anyway.

I am also seriously unimpressed with the upload/ publishing process so far on FFN. The process you just described for making edits is wild.

** Speaking as a reader, I much prefer AO3 but I do browse both. AO3's tag system just makes it a lot easier to find what I want, which due to my reading habits is often very specific. Also, in my experience AO3 tends to attract higher-quality writers. Regarding its reputation for smut, it's easy to steer clear of that if I'm so inclined. Other times I'll go looking for it.

One note though - I do think AO3 could do with some better moderation of some of its... let's say... less tasteful fics? There's smut involving teenagers, which can be controversial on any day... but then there's outright paedophilia. Applying certain tags to your fic should be an automatic ban IMO.

** I crosspost on both sites and write for HP and MCU... Feedbackwise Marvel works better on AO3 and HP on FFN (at least for me). But my stories are mostly gen and I feel AO3 works better if you write smut. I think AO3 is more user friendly as an author. As a reader I use both but prefer FFN because I feel my search results are more relevant. On AO3 people tend to tag everything and when I search for Loki and time travel I want Loki centric time travel fics and not stories in which time travel is talked about and not actually done and Loki is a minor background character. If Loki is tagged on FFN you can be sure he really is a MC. If you write crossovers, AO3 is better...

So it really depends on fandom/genre/characters/etc which website is better. I'd say try both. Crossposting is not all that much work. Once you have a chapter written it's a simple matter of copy and paste and done in a minute. Then you'll see where your story works better and can still decide which you want to use.

** FFN as both a reader on writer. As an extremely picky reader, I can still occasionally find a new fic on FFN. The handful of interesting fics I find on AO3 are just crossposted from FFN and I have yet to see a good fic that is exclusively on there. It's not for lack of searching. The situation actually reminds me a bit of the HPFF site - everytime I found a good fic there I would later learn that it's from FFN.

As a writer, I still prefer the FFN audience. I'm established there, have been for over 10 years and have over 20 fics posted. I don't want to just be like many others and just crosspost, since it's not really about view count or anything like that for me.

** As a reader, I much prefer FFN, as while the filtering is much simpler, thats kinda all what I'm after, wordcount and Complete or not are all I really filter by, and if a fic piques my interest, its piques my interest, the rest is kinda irrelevant.

I'll read fics that are on AO3, if reccomended to me but I wont actively browse the site as honestly, the tags can give me a headache. Like, I get it, its a harry potter fanfic, no need to tag every single character that has been mentioned ever, in the history of the fandom. Maybe it's because I'm never really after anything specific, infact, im more likely to check out the author page of a person whose story i like and then check out THEIR favourites.

I also prefer the layout of FFN, even though they aren't too dissimilar for the most part, but I read on my tablet and AO3 tends to bog it down when loading.

- Images and videos can be embedded right on the page. This allows chapter fanart, fancomics/doujinshi, and other really creative things.
- Writing quality is higher for the fandoms I follow (although this may just be my perception). FFN's 20 years of Harry Potter fics means there's a lot of "My first fanfic" posts that never go anywhere.
- The tags, while they can be misused, give real freedom to be as specific as you want. The exclude system, which is a recent development, take care of most of the downsides. I do wish there were a way to specify a primary character/relationship vs background.

As an author, I prefer AO3

- There's no confusing document upload system. I just recently published on FFN last week and that threw me off. I understand it was made for an older internet era without dropbox/pastebin/etc.
- AO3 is less fussy about strange characters and embeds. I wrote an animorphs fanfic, where in canon characters communicating telepathically use < and > to punctuate their dialogue. FFN doesn't allow those characters in fics, and stripped them off my fic. Took some googling to find out why. AO3 just published everything verbatim.
- You can add co-authors, you can dedicate works to someone else, etc. It's better for collaborations.
- Making small edits, either to fics typos or to add/amend just a few lines to make sentences run snappier, is so easy on AO3. Click edit, make the edits, and done. FFN makes it a whole thing, and I now know why authors there refuse to fix typos from years ago.

** I'm a reader and I prefer [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. I dislike AO3 because it's full of underage and/ or non-consensual stuff. Normally, I'm no prude and don't mind sex scenes, but I draw the line at underage stuff. It literally costs potential authors nothing to have adult characters doing it and not kids. Now rape can be a part of a story that defines, changes, motivates, etc. a character. However, a lot of the stories seem to just consist of explicit rape that sounds like the author is living out some disgusting fantasies of his. And often the rapist gets away with it and/ or the victim falls in "love". Blergh. Just blergh.

*** Underage and rape fics also exist on FFN. Same goes for any other sexual kink. The objectionable fics on FFN just happen to be less widely known and buried deeper in search results.

**** Possibly, but sometimes it feels like every third fic is explicit on AO3. Like I said I don't mind erotica and/ or sex scenes (with adults) but some fics seem to focus only on that. (Though I admit the option to exclude certain tags is great). I must say I agree with OP on this one:

*** Yeah, underage stuff squicks me out. I'm not typically into kink shaming or judging people for using the creative process to explore taboos, but...

I've also seen a lot of stories tagged with incest in the maybe 4 days I've already been on AO3. I saw a tag “Arthur/Ginny” and just wanted to hurl.

Like maybe someone is reading that for an intellectual reason (I guess?), but someone somewhere is also getting their jollies from it, guaranteed.

** Appreciate your input! I went ahead and made a FFN account just to try it out, and the upload process is so weird and not user friendly. I see what another commenter here meant about basically never bothering to make revisions or edits to chapters because it's such a pain in the ass.

**** Not anymore. It is now so large, that there is everything there. Some thing I like (for example, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]) are decisively non-smut, or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11676102][smut is just a by-product of the story]]. And besides, with the working search, it is a way more easy to filter out whatever you don't want to see.

And BTW, despite their claims, there is plenty of smut on FFN as well.

**** Definitely not most. Of the ~230,000 Harry Potter fics on AO3, ~40,000 are rated as explicit, while teen has ~70,000 and general has ~60,000.

AO3 just has the tools to find the specific smut you're after. If you want an explicit Hermione/Colin fic with spanking and bdsm and public nudity, but no f/f content and no blindfolding and no Draco Malfoy, you can search for that pretty easily.

They explicitly allow almost all kinds of smut, plus they give you the tools to find what you want specifically, so it is the best place to look for that sort of thing these days. But the non porn stuff is still a much bigger part of the site on the whole.

** AO3's tag system is garbage. FFN has a good mobile interface, Scryer removes the limitations of FFN's native filters for searches and FFN has a dark mode and the possibility to easily adjust font size and pageview width.

Seriously, when you have more space taken by tags than by the summary, you are doing it wrong.
