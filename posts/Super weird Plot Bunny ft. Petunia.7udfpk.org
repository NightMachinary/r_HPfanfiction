So I have, and write down a lot of weird plots that I'd love to read or write myself one day, well over 200, but most I either don't finish or won't write myself.

However today I somehow came up with one that is super weird but sounds super interesting to write, so I'd like to just toss it out here for anyone interested.

What if Petunia turned into Lily, or like a twin to Lily when she had to raise Harry. Could be: 1. Harry's magic changing her into his mom. 2. Her own weak magic changing her 3. The blood wards merging her and Lily's essence.

There's obviously more than could be done as well, I just was super interested in seeing a good!Petunia that wasn't good because of who she was, but because she was changed into that.

Overall I think it's something that I can't really do justice, but would love to see other people's take on the idea.


** It would be better if it was straight up horror and focused on the fact that she no longer felt the same about her husband, son, and life as she slowly lost bits of herself and was forced to change ending with her eventual suicide as she decided she would rather die herself than turn into something she isn't.

As a whole, when an outside force takes away what is essentially a character's free will or nature, it should be viewed as horrific.

*** Totally an option as well. I thought of the idea that it alienated her family super hard but full horror would be a fun take on it as well. That was one of the reasons I was so intrigued by the idea, there are so many ways you could go with this. Does Harry accept what's happening or not. Does it happen when he's a kid or after he starts Hogwarts. Is it a mental change or a physical change? Could be both or just one. How does her thinking Mirror that? Does it pervert her view of Harry, James, and her sister drastically?

I'd love to write a few different versions all with wildly different results but I doubt I would even finish one =\

** That reminds of The Tearling series by Erika Johansen.
