** One of the Lone Traveler stories has wizardkind created when The Traveler gave a Blood-Replenishing Potion to a prehistoric mother, imbuing her child with magic.

linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard) Magic is a way of using the Force, that the Jedi condemned for its use of Sith Alchemy. The survivors fled to Earth, bringing the magical species with them.

** A Harry Potter one shot with slight crossover to Stargate linkffn(whatever happened to the likely lad? by nonjon) and a almost similar themed one linkffn(in the mind of a scientist by zenonokyuubi). The second one only goes into the origin of magic into the sequel which is almost full a Stargate story except for the Harry Potter in that crossover

  COMPLETE. One-Shot. Hermione Granger has to locate Harry Potter or she'll lose her job. She's more than a little curious what he's been up to the last few years. Perhaps, she'd be better off figuring out where he's going rather than where he's been.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

** It keeps happening that requests fit something that's going to happen /later/ in a story of mine and there, I'm torn.

There's a theory mentioned somewhere in linkffn(Lady Archimedes), but it's really, like, /one/ paragraph. There are other reasons to be reading that story, though, to say the least.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has the main character /wonder/, and he builds up a rather compelling theory for a while (involving Atlantis), though it's very much based on that AU's magic system and doesn't quite fit with canon. However, it turns out his theory is wrong, and it was all for nothing.

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
