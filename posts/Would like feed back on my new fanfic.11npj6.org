** My biggest critique of what I read in the first chapter - and perhaps the most difficult part to get right - is that the narration doesn't sound like Bellatrix. There's a lot of awkward slang: 'cuz' 'like ever', this whole sentence: 'So, like an idiot, I say, "Killing is bad." Aw yes I, child prodigy, had deduced killing was bad. Gold star for me.' I don't feel any connection from your Bellatrix to the Bellatrix in canon, and I think it's possible to make Bellatrix a secret double agent without compromising the character she appeared to be in canon. Especially in a first person narration, your character's voice needs to be very strong.

I think you're also perhaps, trying to explain too much in the first chapter, from her family to Snape's secrets. It feels like the story's just trying to dump information onto the reader. The chapter is also rather jumpy, like it's just trying to explain as much as it can about her feelings and her backstory, and it doesn't feel like all this information goes together, so it seems confusing. You can take your time. Choose what to explain wisely and you don't necessarily need to spell things out - trust your readers to fill in the rest.

*** I second the "cuz" thing. Awkward prose. Very awkward indeed. Unless you're Anthony Burgess and your prose /is/ slang, you should avoid slang in your prose.

*** Thx, I know she doesn't seem like Bellatrix. I tried to do that on purpose, I feel like she'd be trying to be as little like her mom as possible.

** Okay, I know this is a stupid nitpick, especially in a world with magic---but red hair is a recessive genetic trait, and Bellatrix Lestrange has dark hair, which is a dominant genetic trait. Without any magical influence, your character Bellana should have dark hair like her mother.

The story seems fine. There are very few grammar and spelling errors, and the dialog doesn't seem unnatural and stilted, which I've seen happen all too often. But I'm probably not going to keep up with this story, because I'm not particularly interested in after-the-war fics. This one does have a unique idea, but it's still not really the kind of thing I'm interested in.

*** I think I am going to make her have dark hair, especially since I'm going to have her dad a character we already know. Thanks:)

*** Genetics fail.

Even if hair color wasn't polygenic, which it is, your reasoning STILL makes no sense from a dominant/recessive viewpoint. Bellatrix could easily be heterozygous for red or blonde if one of her parents carried a recessive allele... which they did, seeing as they produced Narcissa.

Learn your shit.
