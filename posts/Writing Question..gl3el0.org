I was curious(Bonus if you've read the fanfic in question), how people generally felt about writers going back on their fics and uncanoning the most recent chapters.

I've been writing this fanfic on ffn on and off for the past couple years and I've recently had a few urges to go back a few chapters (Undecided on how many) and restart from there. It's a 96 chapter fanfic, over 300k words or so.

Not that what I already have isn't good. I've just had some troubling writers block with it.

At this rate I've got two options, I could either double down on the storyline I have planned out and probably get as far as the start of sixth year and hope I get more inspiration.

Or I can piss off every one of my readers and hopefully make a half-way decent plan until the end of seventh year. (I've actually already got some ideas. How well they pay off is entirely in question)

** When I had a similar issue I completely pulled the plug on the story and published a different one with the same premise and the changes. I left the original up but did my changes and reworks on the newer version.

I don't know if you're willing to go through with it that way (as you've written a lot already) but it may be a viable solution? Your not making anything of the story uncanon but still working on the story as you want to.

** Go piss off your readers. *The only* thing which matters is quality of your writing. Anything else is secondary.

  Follow Rodrick, grandson of Gellert Grindelwald, as he struggles with his own identity in a world both magical and dangerous. Will he ever be able to step out of his grandfather's shadow? Maybe if nobody finds out his family name in the first place. Though, of course, having a Grindelwald's morales doesn't make things any easier. Disclaimer: J.K Rowling owns Harry Potter.
