:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello all!

Don't know if anybody's familiar with this fic, but I thought I'd give it a try bc I'd love to reread if y'all can help me find it :)

OK, so it's on ao3, and Severus is Harry's biological parent (I forget who the other parent was, but I'm pretty sure it was James). Fic is war-centric, and involves a Sev/Siri/Remus pairing, though nothing is explicitly described and it's told from Harry's POV. I distinctly remember one scene where Severus nearly gets hurt in a war-based confrontation and Sirius flips out, remarking something to the effect of 'I'm just starting to love you, don't you dare die on me'.

I know it's not that much to go on, but any help would be appreciated.
