I'm looking for a set of Reading the books stories I stumbled across on fanfiction.net way back before the purges. It was only the first two books but it was unique in that it was set before the first year at Hogwarts and featured the Weasleys, trio and Luna. Luna bonded with the twins, Ron yelled at Molly at the end of the first book, Molly went berserk at the Lockhart reveal. Anyway I can get it? can't remember the title so I couldn't find it through fictionhunt.

I'd like to have it for nostalgia's sake and it was pretty good.
