Looking for after-the-end drarry fics, preferably from Draco's pov that show the serious aftermath/fallout of the war, pulling himself and his family back together, etc. Outside of that and being complete and at least 20k, I don't have any requirements. The only one of these kinds of fics that I've read is Slithering by astolat. Thanks!

  HPDM slash. Harry didn't think he would ever have a family beyond the Weasleys. But then, at one point he could have said the same about the Dursleys. What's most important is that he has a family now with Andromeda, Teddy, and even the Malfoys. And maybe those years before gave him the ability to have what he has now. COMPLETE.

** There's a wide range of possibilities depending on how long you define "after the end" to extend into the broader "post-Hogwarts" era. Here are some suggestions:

- Tea and No Sympathy by who_la_hoop linkao3(2734082). This is Groundhog's Day-like scenario that takes place on a day when Draco is supposed to be restoring the Malfoy family influence via a speech at Parliament.
- The Voldemort Manor by Kedavraox linkao3(1069936). Draco is forced to run Malfoy Manor as a war museum/event space as a kind of house arrest.
- He Who Must Not be Normal by lettered linkao3(1104020). Draco works in an apothecary and encounters a somewhat deranged Harry. This is more about how Draco lives after the war than family restoration, per se. Lovely story, though.
- On a Clear Day by Saras_girl linkao3(879841). In this story Draco's actions are motivated by his need to restore the Malfoy name, but the post-war theme is secondary to the relationship-building. In any case, saras_girl writes amazing Drarry.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  Potter has fame and fortune and posh clothes and all he wants is a simple life. Draco has a flat and a cat and a steady job and all he wants is a complicated life. Which makes you think this story has something exciting like body-swapping, but it doesn't. Instead it has Indian takeaway and a blue jumper and people wanting a whole lot of what they can't have, discovering themselves as they discover each other.

  The Malfoy Manor is a state run museum, renamed The Voldemort Manor by the Ministry for Magic. As part of his probation, Draco is assigned as sole caretaker. When the Manor hosts a series of high class events celebrating the Wizarding World's fourth Yuletide season Post War, it brings with it a swathe of people Draco hasn't seen in years; including one, Harry Potter.

** linkao3(2780708)

Another Mask Behind You is a really, really unique and well-written fic and another one of my favorite stories. This one is very Draco-centric and shows how he struggles after the war.

linkao3(1273078)

Stop All the Clocks is a tear-jerker and possibly one of my favorite fics of all time. It's not exactly Draco-centric (Harry's POV), but it's too good to pass up, honestly.

  Draco is a high-end prostitute who hides his identity. Harry unknowingly hires him. And then there is porn, questions about identity, domestic bliss, more porn, and truth as seen through a web of lies. (And then more porn. Seriously, if you don't want sex scene after sex scene you probably shouldn't read this. And please read the warnings.)

** linkffn(the descent of magic by lomonaaeren)

Post war Harry does magical research and asks Draco to help publish his thesis, because pureblood politics

No dealing with immediate after war effects - theyre both divorced, or something. Its been a while since i read it. Also the war finished years before the story takes place.

I strongly dislike drarry stories and generally actively avoid gay!harry stories because to me, harry has always been straight, and reading a gay harry just means hes all sorts of out of character. This is one of the few stories i've read, enjoyed and will actively recommend that also include a gay!harry.
