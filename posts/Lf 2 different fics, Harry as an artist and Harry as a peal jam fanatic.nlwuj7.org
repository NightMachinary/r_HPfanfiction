So the first one, I don't remember much about it, but I remember a scene where Harry gets his own bedroom and paints the walls with scenes of hogwarts. One wall is the lake, one is the castle, one is the forest and the final the quidditch pitch. He also paints a snitch that gets charmed to fly around the scenes.

The second one, iirc Harry manages to get one of dudleys old Walkman running and the only tape he can afford is peal jam which he becomes a fan of because his aunt hates them. I think Hermione gets him a pearl jam t-shirt for his birthday or Christmas.


** Leo Inter Serpentes is the Pearl Jam one. Here's part one, though it's not talked about until book two/second year: linkao3(922767)

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.
