As it says looking for well written Multi-chapter, the story can be as canon as possible or far away from canon or anywhere in between, just as long as it's interesting.

20 chapters or longer is what I'm looking for. Although if say 10 chapters or longer is fine.

Would much rather the story be completed.

Can be set in any Era. Any character can be the main character.

Believable Characters.

Would rather not have Weasley or Dumbledore bashing, or character bashing at all really, but Weasley and Dumbledore a definite no. Unless it's Percy, I suppose.

Any rating and am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash.

Don't like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, sorry those pairings just aren't my thing. But any other pairing goes.


** Linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) is one of the best written fics in the fandom. Only 14 chapters but over 200,000 words.

Linkffn(Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19) is well written.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

**** I don't mind a girl Harry story but I just shudder at the name Harriet. No offense to anyone who has that name, it just seems like the writer didn't think much of the name and just decided to go with Harriet.

***** I agree. Really, any girl!Harry name that isn't a flower name is kind of trash. I have always personally thought that Rose would be a very fitting name for a female Harry, and would even fit with the Evans family tradition of naming all their girls after flowers.

****** I actually like Holly Potter for Harry, or something a bit exotic maybe. I could see Lily wanting to name her daughter something unique sounding. But yeah the naming female Harry after a flower also makes sense with Lily and Petunia. I could see Lily wanting to continue the trend.
