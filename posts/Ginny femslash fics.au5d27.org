i would like to know 3 types of Fics, they could however be combined.

​

1. Harry and Ginny come together as in Canon but at a Point separate/divorce (they can have a Family or not). Ginny discovers, that she likes Girls/Woman and the story continues.

​

1. Ginny works as an Auror or something similar and falls for a female Criminal. But if it comes to the arrest, Ginny might be hesitating to do it, since her feelings for her subject battle with her rational thinking and Duty.

​

1. Ginny has a subordinate or Pupil and that one develop a Crush or fall for the Redhead. Ginny is reluctant, since she is already "that old" and her sub could be her daughter.

​

im totally fine with lemon scenes.

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Hogwarts reaches a critical point. With few options and even less people left to defeat Voldemort, the side of good's fate may rest on the shoulders and in the hands of two witches. A journey through many kinds of barriers. Eventual HG/GW
