  Harry's had a hard life, much harder than most people could have ever thought of. Unfortunately, it only gets harder on him in his fifth year. Finally he's had enough and decides to go all out for once, but when Umbridge fights back, it affects both his life, and possibly her freedom...permanently. This may sound like the story Exploring Harry Potter's Life. Well...it is. When reading this story, you will have to have the appropriate book beside you. This is a reading the book fic, without the actual story line. You'll get the hang of it soon enough. Labels: Paragraph = self explanatory.Dialogue line = One or two lines where a character speaks or does an action while speaking.Dialogue set = More than two lines where a character is speaking and doing actions.

  Take it slow the first time around. There's no rush. When you get a notice of an update, then that means you've got ten chapters to go through. There was over one hundred and eighteen when this story got kicked off originally. So we've got a long way to go.

** Tbh, I wasn't aware that they were particularly popular, cos they are hard to find.

Simply put, cos it's entertaining. I mean, imagine reading about 12 year old Ron and Hermione finding out they end up married, or if a maturer Draco took a look at his past, twat-filled actions.

Actually, if anyone knows of fics like these, please link me them.

*** I've found that they very rarely get past PS and many are taken down for copyright reasons, as it's pretty much impossible to do one well without posting the full content of the original (copyrighted) books - I read one that tried and failed miserably.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-Characters-read-the-Harry-Potter-books/85285/][This community]] exists, but consists almost entirely abandoned or low-quality fics

Essentially: I'm asking for recommendations too

** I think the situations in which the characters come to together can be hilarious. Prime example, in a fic I read a really long time ago, it was set during the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, some professors (Snape and McGonagall) and Dumbledore (who hasn't died yet) and Voldemort and a bunch of Death Eaters (Lucius, Bellatrix...) were all forcefully summoned to the Room of Requirement by Hogwarts to talk out their problems and solve the war, and they were without magic. The seven books appeared in front of this group and as per Hogwarts's orders, they had to read it. The Dumbledore was a "manipulative!dumbles" and every times Dursley abuse came up, someone would round on him and he would mumble something about greater good.

These fics can be funny in a crackish way. However, if you read one do-over fic you've kind of read them all. It's just people ooohing and awwing and gasping in horror about all the things that've happened to Harry.

** I remember finding one on TVTropes fanfic rec lists. I feel like it is one of those things that works well once, and that's about it.

** The people drawn to these stories like the idea of someone evaluating the full picture of one's life, or that they find pleasure in sharing their experience with their books with others, particularly characters that they know would have great reactions to reading the details of Harry's adventures. It's like enjoying watching your favorite movie/tv show with a friend that hasn't seen it. (I love doing this with my BF who hasn't seen a lot of TV.)

It's like how those X people react to Y video on YouTube are popular. Except I don't really enjoy those because they're strangers, but I can like the characters read HP book genre.

I read a complete one out there but I don't remember the story name and I'm at work so I can hunt it down later. It involves the head of Hogwarts houses getting a hand on at least the first book.

** The particular mix that, I guess, is wearing on me (because SOMEHOW ffn keeps making sure I stumble into them) is that they all seem to devolve into an unfinished, massively super powered fix-it which then turns into let's all throw Harry a huge pity party. It's so twisted and bizarre to me. I really don't get it, and yet some of them have fantastic comedic moments. It's so frustrating. Lol
