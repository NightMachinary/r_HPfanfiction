*** Oh! Your comment reminds me of this one shot that I don't remember the title of (only remembered that it's long and some plot points) it has the idea in the beginning - not exactly Harry-centric though but it featured Harry's life prominently. The fic was gen I think, doesn't get into shipping territory but it has a Snape/Petunia 'endgame' (it wasn't really 'the end' because Dumbledore had to save the day for his greater good quest I'm not sure about now but at the time I read it, that fic has the most realistic and the best dialogue for that pairing (I tried to look for more SS/PD because of the fic, but ended up really disappointed)

Oh also it was highly AU in which Mcg has a sister (she didn't appear iirc but this is what makes dumbledore went to no. 4 personally), Harry has a slightly better childhood, Dudders was actually magical and so Vernon divorced Petunia major spoilers Snape killed Sirius because he thought he's going to kill Harry and then they (Snape, Petunia, Dudley, Harry) went into hiding. They eventually moved to the US and with Dumbledore unable to find them even back in the UK it resulted in his side losing the war

I can try looking it up if you want since I don't really read SS/PD fics it should be pretty easy to find

Turns out it's posted as a oneshot in ao3 but in ffn it's split into 6 chapters, hope you don't mind!

Edit: and turns out it was snape not dumbledore who brought the news to petunia personally, +at least it's not a letter+ my bad

  At first she didn't quite believe her eyes. Severus Snape here, on her doorstep, was so far outside the realm of anything Petunia had ever believed possible that she couldn't fully comprehend what she was seeing for a few seconds. Alternate universe.

** Look, let's be honest, probs would've been a touch politer. Also leave baby Harry less vulnerable to being nibbled on by badgers in the night.
