AS the title says I am looking for fics that pick up during the Horcrux hunt and more specifically ones that start when Ron leaves. I prefer fics where Hermione leaves too but am open to ones where she stays. I have read Unintended Consequences and The Wrong Choice if that helps narrow things down any more.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8418356/1/A-Darkened-World][A Darkened World]]: Hermione and Ron both leave Harry behind in the tent. Neither return, and were among the few to escape Britain when Voldemort took over. Years later, their daughter Rose has joined an ICW operation that tries to stop Voldemort's power from spreading beyond Europe. However things take an unexpected turn when she discovers what became of Harry Potter. Ron Bashing and Deaths.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6536321/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Forest-of-Dean][Harry Potter and the Forest of Dean]]: What would have happened if Harry said yes when Hermione suggested staying in the forest and the effects it has on the entire wizarding world? (WiP, last update 7/4/13)

*** Loved a Darkened World. I'm never too keen on starting WiPs, especially ones which haven't been updated in a while so I am taking a more 'wait and see' approach with your other recommendation but thank you for the help.

**** I've started so many great reads just to get 50, 100, even 200,000+ words in and have there be no ending. It's so sad...

***** Especially when you know it's never going to get updated but the story is so good (looking at you Warlock of Slytherin)
