** Well, sure Draco can change, but not all the fanfics that portray Dramione show a Draco who changed. Instead, they portray Draco as misunderstood, or start with his canon personality and then disregard it so quickly you get whiplash. Like one minute he's insulting Hermione, then she's crying and suddenly Draco's like, /hey, it's okay... I didn't mean it, I'm sorry/. Or something along those lines. Except that's not how Draco behaves in canon. Canon Draco knows where to stick a knife and he knows how to twist it with little remorse. It was only the war that made him wake up.

** Because it's almost never done well, and only very rarely done competently. Yes, they could end up together, but not until both have radically changed from what's in the books.

(The only one I ever saw done well was one where Hermione has a random hook-up with Draco after they'd both been out of school a couple of years, and it turns out he's developed a cringe-worthy muggle fetish. Can't recall title nor author, but it was /hilarious/)

** As was said already, many stories don't make Draco change - they make him misunderstood and the Slytherins poor noble souls bullied by the evil jocks in Gryffindor, and often add some blatant "pureblood bigots are right; muggleborns are ignorant" propaganda so Draco can teach Hermione how superiour pureblood culture is.

** To each his own. People like and hate what they want.

For me personally, Draco is an asshole. Don't get me wrong- I love his character, which is exactly why I hate Draco/hermione. He always gets “changed “ or “hides a heart do gold”. No, he's a manipulative, snooty jerk rich boy and damn proud of it. He'd never get with Hermione simply because she's a muggle-born. Is that morally right? Of course not- but that's how he was raised and like hell he'd ever be caught with her.

I know it's fanfiction, so people can do what they want. But I prefer canon compliant characters unless there is a really good reason and build up to a character change/OOC. That's so incredibly rare for this character though (I blame Tom Felton- the boy did Malfoy too much justice and made his stuck-up snarkyniss attractive ❤️).

That's my unpopular opinion though. So now that I'm done, may the downvoting commence.

** I don't hate Draco/Hermione, but I can understand if some people do. In fandom, there's a lot of this romantic image of Draco as the dangerous but glamorous bad boy who can change and redeem himself. For those who do not share that vision it can be a bit vexing, mainly because it's so widespread. What they see is a jerk whose best quality is that he did not have the stomach to advance more in his career as Death Eater.
