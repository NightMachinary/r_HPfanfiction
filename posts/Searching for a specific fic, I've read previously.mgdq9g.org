:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fanfiction in question about a Muggle Oc woman, who moves into the house of her deceased grandmother, (who had a penchant for pickled food if I remember correctly) near the Weasley Family's home. Of course she is immediately mistaken as a witch (like apparently her grandmother was) and she is very surprised at finding out there is a whole magical community out there. Also, later in the fic she falls in love with Charlie Weasley...

If anyone knows the title or can link it I would really appreciate it!


** ‚ÄúOttery St Catchpole‚Äù by Erisah_Mae linkao3(12901407). It is an awesome story, unfortunately unfinished.

  Tumblr Prompt from accio shitpost: "i wanna see a muggle who goes stealth among wizards purely by having a ridiculous aesthetic" A muggle moves to Ottery St Catchpole a few months after the Battle of Hogwarts, and there's a slight misunderstanding.
