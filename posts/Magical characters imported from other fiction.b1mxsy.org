With magic of a different kind being revealed on Earth, he and Roxy must unite their worlds to fight against a common threat.

** I always look for crossovers with Discworld, any witches and wiz(z)ards would be great.

A Rincewind that gives dada classes about the right way to run away from danger. a Ridcully that explains why those tiny wands are useless because you can't hit someone over the head with them. A Granny Weatherwax that just stared her students down until they teach themselves everything because they feel like they should already know this
