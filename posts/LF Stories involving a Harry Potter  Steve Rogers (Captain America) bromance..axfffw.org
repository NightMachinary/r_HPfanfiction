There more than a couple stories where Harry Potter ends up friendly with Tony Stark, but I think Harry Potter would have more in common with Steve Rogers' moral compass and desire to do the right thing and save the world.


** The one I know of is Steve and the Barkeep linkffn(8410168). I enjoyed it because it has a nice friendship between Steve and Harry.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

  What is it about the Starborn Café that draws them in? And what is so special about the emerald eyed man greeting whoever walks into the Café with a smile and a warm cup of comfort and understanding?

***** Its not that one. Harry does own a bar in NYC as well. Its more of little vignettes similarly to this where they each meery Harry and then put him together later that they all know the same person. The first chapter starts off with Steve running/crime fighting in the city at night and stumbles across harry beating up some people that were going to rob him. They go back to Harrys bar and that starts a friendship. In this Steve was more partial to Firewhiskey than a Godly Drink. Towards the end something stupid from SHIELD happens and hes yelling at Fury.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

*** Is heroes assemble good? Cuz I got to the part where he basically started bragging about out tricking some agent, and I just kinda lost interest. But is the story good, it's been a few years since I read it.
