I'm looking for any fan fiction (that's dark-use the definition of dark as you will) where Sirius kidnaps Harry. Big surprises and mystery is preferred but not needed. Anyone know of any? Thanks in advance!

  Sirius breaks out of Azkaban two years before schedule. He's pissed, half-mad and prepared to do anything to protect his Godson. He's going to make the Wizarding world pay for the hell it put him through- and have some fun along the way, of course! Super! Sirius, Dark Lord! Sirius, but not evil. No slash. May include ships later. Mainly from Sirius' (and Harry's) point of view. AU.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  AU third year. I must have a sign on my back that says psycho paths please attack me. I would not put it beyond Dudley to afix such a sign to me, but I doubt he could spell it accurately enough for a psycho to understand.
