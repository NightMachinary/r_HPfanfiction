I can't remember much but harry goes back in time, sirius (i think) takes him away from the dursleys and they move into Hermiones neighborhood, she has an older brother but he dies, for some reason he gets forced back to the dursleys and finds out he has a younger female cousin with magic and he takes her away (i think?)


** I know the fic you are talking about but I need to search my bookmarks folder. If I haven't come back in 2 hours tell the search and rescue team to bring spare air tanks.

**** I am sorry to have failed you but either my collection is too big to search properly or I don't have it indexed.

What I can suggest you do is use Google Advanced Search. You search a specific site and also exact wording. I tried this myself briefly but I don't remember any specific line well enough for it to work.

This really does infuriate me because I remember the exact fic you want but the title eludes me.
