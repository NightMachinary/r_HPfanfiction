I've been playing Horizon: Zero Dawn recently, and had an idle thought. The MC, Aloy, is involved in many events pivotal to the story. For example, there is a bomb threat in the main city of the game. If Aloy wasn't involved with certain characters, or never met them, she wouldn't dig, and the mystery would be unsolved up until the Sun-King watches his city go up in flames.

And that is only the side-story.

I kept on thinking about other fandoms as well. I've seen it done, but normally as a 'X travels to alternate dimension where they never existed.'

Famously, the shit shrek movie shows exactly what happens when the MC didnt exist.

Anyone else want to contribute with their idle thoughts?

*** In fairness, it's actually a pretty good fandom question.

** I just want to make a quick mention of "The Sword of truth" serie, from Terry Goodkind (mainly because it still pisses me off years after reading it), (spoiler if some people have not read it and may want to).

Without the MC, the BBEG from the 1st book would have killed himself at the end of the 1st book. And since the plots of ALL the following books can be summed up by "dealing with the problems I created resolving the problems of the previous book", nothing would have happened and the world would probably have ended up a better place for most of its inhabitants.

*** Yep. The most unintentionally hilarious part of that whole Randian ideal obsessed series is that all of that world's problems are, at their root, the protagonist's fault.

** In HP universe, if Harry didn't exist then Neville would have been your man.

*** Eh, in a world where Harry doesn't exist, Neville is pretty much dead as there's canonically no one to beg for Alice or Frank like Snape did for Lily. In a world where Harry dies pre-canon, there's no one to bridge the gap between PS Neville and DH Neville. Harry may not think too much of him until the end of OotP, but he's a very important part of Neville's development.

**** Even if the magic in HP universe existed in real life, it would be quite unlikely that things would have worked out as smoothly as they did for Harry. If we look at a fictional universe then there could have been other circumstances to make Neville the chosen one in order to reach the same conclusion. How it would have happened is always up to the author.

*** Arguably. If Harry never exists, then why should the prophecy ever be spoken?

*** That's true. But that world runs on FATE. No matter what happens, A chosen one will defeat A dark lord. All you need to do is glance at the Fiction count on FF.net to see how many different ways you can follow the same format.

**** Actually the whole point of HP is that Divination is bogus and most actual prophecies are self-fulfilling, in the sense that the one who onsets the course of things would have had the option to ignore it and nothing would have happened. Of course, for every fantasy story the outcome will be the same, but many things can happen along the way and there can be many circumstances that lead to that outcome.

** HZD without Aloy would basically be nothing. HADES would win without much opposition. Although it would be kinda interesting to see.
