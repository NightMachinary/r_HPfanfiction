:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was surfing the web when i remembered an incomplete fic that i had read years ago, but could not find it.

I post this in hopes someone knows what i'm talking about.

The scenes that i remember:

Mc is a guy with magic, with a repair shop

Mc goes out at some point, with an invisibility coat, repairing harlem*[edited] (The hulk fight against abomination)

There is a scene of the Ancient One with a thought of something like: "What wizard would protect their home against everything, except other wizard?"

Another scene where the Mc put some music to play and sits in the middle of a room, looking at the corners in intervals, the shield agents freak out when they first notice and it seems like the guy is looking at them through a bug

The Mc has bees made of C4 and they help on the invasion of new york

Thor sees the mc even when they're invisible and tries to beat him, Mc introduces himself as "Borax(lorax?) speeker of(and i speak for) the bees" or such

Mc bullshits about demons and knowledge pacts to Fury and toss him a chip with the hydra logo

If anyone knows the name of the fic, please could you share ?


** Do you mean Harlem? That sounds really fun
