Okay, I remember the fic where Harry is dating this OC named Sarah after transferring to a school in America. There are the "olympic games" where they compete magically to magically, and eventually the Twins transfer over as well.

There is magical trunks, and other cliches I just can't for the life of me, figure out the name. Any help would be nice. :)

EDIT: I found it. Its The Brave New World by bellerophon30 but, the author changed their profile and I cant' find the story anymore.
