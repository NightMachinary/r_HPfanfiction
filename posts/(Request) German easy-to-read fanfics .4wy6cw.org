[Tl;dr at the end of the post]

Hi, I'm learning german and I think the best way to improve in a language is to practice it. I don't know a lot of vocabulary, but I'm sure I can handle a fanfiction in this language with patience and a dictionary.

What I want would be not too long (20K would be the limit maybe, but I would prefer much shorter), not complicated vocabulary (like scientific words -although I think I'm safe from that kind of words), in brief an easy-to-read text.

I'm fine with about every pairing. I prefer slash but I'm fine with any rating. I don't really like Dramione or Drarry but if it's not full of clichés, then I'm good with it. Thanks for your future propositions !

TL;dr : I'm learning German and would want easy-to-read and short fanfic.


** The only thing I know of and can at link you to without feeling like I insult your intelligence is the german version/translation to Betrayed

*** You wouldn't insult my intelligence since I'm not really good in that language :) The story looks interesting, that way I can read one German chapter then the same in English to see if I understood. Thanks for the link !

**** Some of the german stuff is just so bad that couldn't recommend them in good conscience.

A lot of mature germans write in English, leaving a bigger percentage of german fanfiction to younger authors.

***** I see what you mean. I'm French but I rather read (write) in English when I'm online. A larger audience can read and comment, and you can search through more precise filters.

******* Hmm, what do you want ? Long fic, short fic, humor, drama ? I didn't read french fics since many months but I still have many fics in my favorites (and I can search as well).

*** Sadly that is true :( (note: I am a German and I prefer to read fiction of all kinds (not only fanfiction) in English because it's just better most of the time - with the exception of books writen by great German writers!) that's why I can't help the OP :(
