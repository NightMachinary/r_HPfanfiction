I've read "On the Other Side" and it's brilliant but incomplete and I don't expect the author to update it anymore. It's one of the stories that I expect Draco and Astoria to be like - Draco's redemption arc, trying hard to forgive himself yet still arrogant. It also shows the last year at Hogwarts from Slytherin's point of view, which is quite fascinating.

Any other detailed stories like this?

Thanks, in advance.


** This is one of my absolute favorites, hope you like it as much as I did: linkffn(The House That Cedric Built by Anna Fugazzi)

*** Wow. It was amazing! It didn't over do the redemption too.

**** Yay, I'm glad this fic is getting some more love. I found its post war Hogwarts set up so plausible, and I liked the way it wasn't Harry and Ron centric - they hardly appear in this, which is refreshing..

***** Exactly! None of the Potters do. And that actually made it so much better!

  Draco didn't think there was much reason to hope for a better future. Astoria proved him wrong.

  The grass is always greener on the other side. According to Draco, it's a load of hippogriff excrement, especially now that the Little Greengrass Brat has nosed her way into their plan. Nott did always say it was the quiet ones you had to watch out for... DISCONTINUED. SORRY!

** I recommend [[https://hpfanfictalk.com/archive/viewstory.php?sid=290&ageconsent=ok&warning=3][Detox]] - it's the only other actual Draco/Astoria fic I have bookmarked besides On the Other Side. I found Astoria's character in Detox a refreshing change of pace (most fics I read have a different pairing as their endgame so she isn't explored much beyond being Draco's ex).
