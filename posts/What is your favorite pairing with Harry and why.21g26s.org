I'm writing a new story, and I usually have a pairing in my stories. And over time I have bounced between several different girls I enjoyed seeing Harry with. Tonks, Hermione, Daphne, Susan, Katie, Fleur, Etc...

Now my question is what is your favorite pairing, and why? Who do you think is the best pairing for Harry?

(For the sake of this, I'd like to keep Hermione out of this running. I think many can agree that as far as pairings go, those two are a rather logical and fan favorite choice.)


** I know you didn't mention this paring, but I love Harry/Luna. In my opinion she can help him find the good in the terrible situations he's gone through, and help him move past the negative. Plus Luna's just awesome. :)

** Well with a ban on Harry/Hermione, which is indeed the obvious choice (even JKR now agrees)... I'm just going to list some of my fave pairings.

Harry/Luna (1st choice after H/Hr): They are both broken, and can help each other heal. She is also a natural optimist which can offset Harry's pessimism. And at the same time Harry is very grounded, and Luna is too dreamy -- he can help her stay connected to the here and now.

Daphne I'll not consider since she has no canon personality at all, so she's always an OC. For the same reason I'll exclude Susan, Hannah, or just about all other girls from Hogwarts that didn't get more than a cameo appearance in the books or films. I'll also exclude all homosexual pairings as Harry is only ever shown to be interested in girls in canon.

Harry/Padma is another one I like, which is quite rare. But that's mainly because Padma is somewhat like Hermione without the social issues. I can see this work, but definitely not Harry/Parvati. Parvati, like Lavender, is shown as a vapid airhead which is not what Harry needs.

Harry/Tonks can be done really well, like Luna she is naturally an optimist. She is also more mature than Harry while still "fun". If the author uses the tantalising hint that Harry as a child was able to grow back his hair over night, a nice metamorphmagus couple story can be written on them.

Harry/Fleur: Fleur brings a fresh look from her French heritage and a more adult outlook, and they have in common that they are school champions. With Harry able to resist the Imperius, he has the strong character necessary to overcome her allure.

Lastly, Harry/Katie: Again, Katie is older, but they also share a love for Quidditch. If set in sixth year, they also have surviving a curse in common.

*** How do you think an author should get around the Harry/Tonks age issue? She's seven years older than he is, after all. That's still well within the creepy range, even at graduation.

Harry being involved with her at even 15 means she's about 22. Which is /downtown creepyville./

How does one make that /not/ look like she's taking advantage of him, without making Harry a superhero with an already growing harem, or some other such awful power fantasy fanfic trope? I'm asking because I've tried a few times and simply abandoned it because I couldn't make it work, logically.

I should note that I, personally, refuse to de-age or play around with completely AU characterizations like that. Might as well make up an OC metamorph if that is what you're going to do.

Does canon Tonks bring enough to the story to make that relationship worthwhile to present, compared to an OC?

--------------

Harry/Fleur is interesting, of course, but it isn't clear Harry resisting Veela beauty like that is canon. In fact, he reacts like Ron does at the Cup match: "The veela had started to dance, Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank." It is Hermione that knocks him out of it, just as he is climbing out of their box.

Also, and something I hadn't noticed before, apparently not seeing and hearing them works, and Harry does so during that scene. Their power doesn't dig into your soul or anything. Certainly not like the Imperius curse. That fact is also entirely fan created.

If anything, I'd say the issues with dating would be more interesting if he couldn't actually resist her like that. Makes for a good play on the morality of attraction, or some such. Being closer in age also helps here, compared to other, more mature women in canon.

***** Can't argue with that. Lupin/Tonks is the oddest of all the odd canon relationships.

Some math times. If James and Lily had Harry right out of Hogwarts (and they did) then Lupin must be (same age as parents, who had Harry at 20 years[!!] old + Harry at at 16) = at least 36 years old when Tonks is (harry 16 + 7) = 23.

Not totally gross, but quite a gap. Means Lupin could have been at school when Mr. Tonks was, but not likely in the same class.

Well poo, how am I supposed to answer your question then?

My /second favorite/ pairing is Harry/Luna. Luna is the crazy to his down-to-earth, the confident to his anxiety. Some people like Hermione or Tonks because they're older and "Harry needs an older woman"; I like Luna because she's so "out there" and innocent that Harry really shines as a responsible, mature individual.

I enjoy the dynamic in which Luna makes Harry step outside his comfort zone. I also like the way Harry makes Luna focus and apply her big brain to real-world issues. I strongly dislike it when the author "fixes" Luna and she goes from crazy to just brainy; the exception is fics where Luna's "craziness" is a defense mechanism due to having her mum die and being bullied, then I really like it when Harry helps her get over that and be more normal and more "herself". I very much like Luna as a Prophetess/Seer as well, I think it goes well with Harry being the Chosen One of Prophecy

*** Luna is a bit of a lost character. Seems like she was set up to be more than made it into the colossal books that were OotP and later. But those books were so huge, I'm sure a lot of potential ideas were left on the cutting room floor. Which is a shame, as Luna and Dumbledore are the two oddest, most magic-seeming characters in the series.

But even so, book seven hanging a key event on Luna's dad is odd, given how little book time she's had up to that moment. She barely gets more lines than Harry's roommates. Compare that to, say, Cedric in the previous book.

That leaves a lot of room for fanfic authors to have fun and still remain close to canon, so I support this pairing as well.

** Harry/Luna if there has to be a canon character paring.

Harry's character is basically striving for a childhood while also trying to fulfil a self made promise to stop Voldemort, Luna would be able to bring the joy and wonderment he missed at the Dursleys and help him to think of unique answers to stopping Ol' Riddle.

And we've already seen a canon time of when she helped him deal with a rather difficult emotional issue with honesty and straight answers that very few adults have ever given him.

She could also help with his ingrained shame from years of neglect and fun way to deal with his comfortableness with his fame and hyphenated-name-issues.

** Hehe, I'm the boring one. I love Ginny (but only when she's written well). She's got fire and passion and sass, and I love seeing that spark through Harry's eyes. They are also my favorite to write, because it's kind of sexy. I love playing with that notion of sunlight and fire, and the best description I ever wrote of her (my own opinion, btw) was "some people just burn brighter".

I stick mostly to canon, but I like the idea of pairing him with Draco or Luna, too. I'm not a big fan of him with Hermione. I actually have a hard time imagining her as a romantic/sexual person, and I think she goes great with Ron for that sole purpose (he's a little awkward and inarticulate).

I dislike Harry/Ginny for this reason. She's always so... "better than thou", unrealistic, perfect, I mean she'll have flaws but they're always /loveable/ flaws, and rarely is the relationship more detailed than Harry being into her sexually and her being /just so awesome/

*** I'll not give you flack for liking Ginny... as you mention, "when she's written well". That is precisely why I dislike her in canon - she is /not/ written well.

Her sudden popularity and Harry's lust for her comes literally out of nowhere, which we now know is because JKR realised she had been writing a Harry/Hermione pairing and desperately tried to get her story back on track so her planned Harry/Ginny epilogue would work.

But for that to have worked, Ginny would have to have had some character growth. In the books she is a non-entity in book 1, in book 2 she is only the victim, and she basically is a background character who is only shown to have a crush on Harry until the sudden transformation into the school belle. That's not written well.

**** Agree to disagree. I've heard the argument a thousand times and I'm still a Harry/Ginny shipper. I'm in favor of avoiding a Tumblr cat-fight, so let's shake hands before it gets nasty. It's happened to me before. One time I said something pretty generic about Snape and I had like 20 people rip my throat out. Harry Potter fans can be awful to each other sometimes. I think it's part of being in a fandom, but I would rather walk around that particular song-and-dance right now.

I am mainly a Harry/Hermione shipper (as is probably obvious from my other post), but I've been planning a Harry/Ginny story for a while now, mainly to work around the flaws in canon. Unfortunately I didn't get much further than the setup and Harry leaving on the train before I lost interest.

Maybe using what I have in flashbacks and starting in her 1st is the solution. Eventually I'll withe figure out out, or work on something else :)

I think she fits him quite well she listens and she sees Harry for Harry and I think she is overlooked she could help harry with some blocked gifts of some kind and have a special gift that she herself is blocked becuse of the Headmaster or becuse she is someone who has a speical bloodline that only someone that sees Luna and not the loony Luna can help her as well and with both of the gifts the could be that special 1 in a millon chance of finding each other and then the 2 of them could bond and fix all that went wrong traveling through time and histroy there is so many ways a writer could go useing the 2 of these wonderful people.

For me, I think they work so well because of that "fine line between love and hate" trope, as well as the whole "Romeo and Juliet" feel with them being on opposite sides of the divide... Also- if you're looking to make your pairing more /ahem/ physical, angry/hate sex is always fairly compelling... It also leaves you lots of room for questioning morality, conventions, expanding world view, as well as toeing non/dub!con situations, if you're into something darker...

** Usually I'm very set in which pairings I like, but Harry's a bit of an exception, because I really enjoy seeing him with various different characters.

When I was growing up, I loved shipping Harry/Ginny, and I still enjoy reading post-OotP/pre-HBP fics of this pairing (I feel that Ginny was sort of ruined by HBP after being so promising as a character in OotP).

Then I discovered Harry/Draco - oh my. There are so many absolutely canon-feeling, fantastic fics out there. I'm almost convinced that a Drarry subtext exists in the books.

Recently I discovered Harry/Neville, and I think it's a really lovely ship. There's so much respect, admiration and friendship between them by the end of the series in canon that I think a romantic relationship (in fanon) is only the next natural progression. Also I love reading about Neville having a crush on Harry since like 5th year.

** Remus Lupin and Tonks are by far my most favourite pairing. They are just both so very interesting characters and their love story is so deep and complicated + it's easy to imagine something in between the little we know about them). I wish they didn't have to die though. That's probably the only thing I'd like to change in a AU story.

I may be boring but I like it of canon most of the time. But if there is space for it I like to think about other pairings that are not in the books, like: Tonks and Charlie before the Order, Sirius and well written OC's or other minor characters - something like that.

It's very hard for me to imagine Harry with someone other than Ginny because Rowling doesn't give us a lot of space for out imagination but if I would recommend someone for him it would be : Tonks, because I guess she could do something crazy like that or Luna for a similar reasons and because they are awesome.
