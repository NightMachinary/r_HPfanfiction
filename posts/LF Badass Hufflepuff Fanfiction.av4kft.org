So from what I understand hufflepuff house is all about loyalty and yet they are constantly bullied and don't seem to retaliate against the other houses.

I was wondering if there was some fan fiction where hufflepuff house was/became “radicalized” (for lack of a better term) and started taking revenge on other houses that bully their younger years?


** Can't remember the name exactly... But I think theres one with a draco malfoy self insert who sorts into Hufflepuff and does this.
