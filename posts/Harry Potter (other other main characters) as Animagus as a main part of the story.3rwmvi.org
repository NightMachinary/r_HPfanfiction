Just read Vox Corporlis and was really happy with it once I got past the first ten chapters or so. It definitely got better as the story went on. Is there any more of the Animagus talent being instrumental to the storyline?


** linkffn(problem with purity) - assuming you meant 'or other main characters', though Harry has an animagus form there too.

** linkffn(Harry Mewter) is pretty good if you don't mind Pokemon (it doesn't actually cross with the Pokemon universe, only the animagus forms are pokemon).

  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.

** linkffn(Living with Danger) First in a long-ass 'what if Lupin/OC found Sirius was innocent and saved him and Harry and lived together' series. A bit weird in parts, but the main characters are almost all Animagi. Not 'instrumental', but it's used often enough to be fairly important.

**** Understandable. Some of the author's other stories are a bit shorter/better. I'd recommend you check them out, at least the first few chapters. Most of them have similar themes to LwD/etc. but are decentish?
