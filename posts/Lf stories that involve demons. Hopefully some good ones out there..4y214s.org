  When Hermione looked through the attic of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, she did expect to find dark magic, forbidden rituals and terrible spells. But the darkness rarely tells its secrets, and so Hermione is caught in a whirlwind of black magics, with a demon inside her head and a Mistress hailing from the House of Black.
