/(Warning: Crossover elements.)/

*I.*

With the tip of his boot, Harry gently kicked over shards of broken concrete, revealing a bloodied arm.

"Hey!" he called. "Need another healer over here!"

At his shout, some white-robed personnel rushed over and began pulling the poor Muggle woman out of the rubble. Voldemort's forces had conducted another raid tonight, and several villages up and down the coast had been struck. As usual, he had been too late, /again/, to catch the Dark Lord.

/It's okay. As Sister Aquinas keeps saying, I just need to have a bit more faith. Light always triumphs over darkness in the end./

He shook himself out of his reverie. There were things that needed doing. People that needed healing. Homes that needed rebuilding. Walking past two mages restoring a cottage back into place (it was the least they could do, even if memories needed to be erased later), Harry came up next to a silver-haired woman who was examining a dead Giant with an expression of both disgust and curiosity. Beside her stood a large black-and-silver weapon that looked like a cross between a shield and a pile bunker.

"Hey, Roast Beef."

There was a mild flash of irritation, which was replaced by quickly by a more peaceful expression. "Hey, kid. You doing alright?"

"Same as always." The Roman Catholic attache deployed from Italy had been frigid at first, but later seemed to warm up to Harry's simple honesty. There was also the fact that Harry was a mere thirteen years of age.

Not that it bothered him much. He liked the story of Joan of Arc, who had begun her life of service young, and Harry at least knew that he probably wasn't going to end up being burnt at a stake.

"Friend of yours?" He gestured to the corpse.

"Not mine. See where the entire arm was burnt off?"

"Oh, /his/ work, then." Harry sighed and looked over to where a man with red hair and black robes was yelling abrasively at a few orderlies.

Apparently, prophecies, especially those with confirmed subjects, were treated very seriously in the Church--or should he say, /churches/. Heavenly will expressed through the mouths of mortals did not grow on trees, and nearly every branch, both on the Isles and the Continent, had sent /some/ representation.

And he was supposed to lead them all. Lead the crusade to end Voldemort, the Dark Lord that had violated the laws of life and death. Still, politics and power plays aside...

"I'm glad he's here, you know. And you. And everyone." Inexplicably, Harry felt tears start to well up in his eyes.

"Oh, kid." The woman sighed. "Look, I'm not good at...at this, but uh, they say that the Heavenly Father is watching over us, so, don't worry, I guess? And even if he's turned away at the moment, there's still the rest of us to go through."

Somehow, the awkward words cheered him up better than a more reliable speech would have. Harry cracked a smile.

"Yeah, I wouldn't want to get on the wrong end of your guitar either."

"There are too many things wrong with that statement!"

*II.*

"/Lumos Solem!/"

The incantation sent a burst of concentrated sunlight at the Death Eater. At the resulting howl of agony at the burnt flesh, Harry's target dropped his wand, which was quickly severed by a quick /Diffindo/. A follow-up /Stupefy/ put the man out of his misery, at least for the next few hours.

It was pandemonium, in both the chaotic and hellish senses. The air was singing both battle cries and screams of pain, and Harry was cutting through it all, looking for his primary target. A Stunner was sent at another unprotected back, and a quick Summon-Transfigure-Banish sent a werewolf down, a spike of silver through his chest. He was debating the use of another Solar Light when--

"Get down!"

Harry ducked on instinct, and narrowly dodged a jet of green light. An burst of flame followed shortly, and the offender collapsed, clutching at their burnt flesh.

"You need to watch your back around here!"

"You're doing a pretty good job of it, so I wouldn't worry!" For all of Harry's rigid upbringing, there was still some part of Harry that spit in the face of any authority, and it usually manifested more in times of stress. "Where is he? Voldemort?"

"You broke the Taboo?" the pyromancer yelled. "On your left!"

A laminated card with the left-pointing arrowhead of /Kenaz/ soared over and stuck to the assailant, who then went up in flames.

"Yeah, used /Sowilo/," Harry tapped his forehead, "and /Opila/ for the area! It dispels the--/Accio/! /Depulso/! /Diffindo Diffindo Diffindo/!" Rubble soared over and intercepted a stray spell, then made for a useful projectile with several Cutting Charms in its wake. "Never mind! Just know that it's gone!" He yelled over the din.

"Good work! Now we can communicate!"

The exchange of words was cut short by another wave of enemies, and then Voldemort arrived.

It was obvious, and it was intimidating.

He flew unaided, without steed nor broomstick, an unexplainable, unreproducible feat that would have terrified normal witches and wizards. His robes fluttered about, like smoke on the wind, like an inky black halo that shrouded him.

Despite everything that was going on, Harry felt a grin come on to his face. Clearly, Voldemort had never heard of the story of Saint Peter and Simon Magus.

Harry was going to summon divine wrath to strike Voldemort down from the heavens, /literally/, and he was going to feel good doing it.

Unnamed characters are Riesbyfe Stridberg from /Melty Blood/ and Stiyl Magnus from /A Certain Magical Index/. The Anti-Flight Spell is from /Index/ as well.

Thanks for the prompt, I had fun writing this. I hope this isn't too bad.

THIS IS SO GOOD, I love how he still has the sass and charm of the OG harry, whilst being smarter and more tactical - which is expected after being raised by competent people.

Love how you bring in real life references, and used different spells to the the infamous expelliarmus.

Well done, would soooo read more
