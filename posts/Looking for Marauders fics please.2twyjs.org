Im looking for more fics to read featuring the Marauders outside of just their Hogwarts days. I just finished Promises Unbroken and its two prequels which I really enjoyed. I also read Roundabout Destiny and enjoyed it more than I had anticipated. I am currently following Against the Moon, A Marauder's Plan and Identity. Obviously I am into Sirius raises Harry fics right now. So recommend your favs please!


** Raising Harry (mild R/S slash), but I often see it recommended on many rec lists.
