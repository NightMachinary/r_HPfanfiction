**** I like the HPMOR/Yudowsky approach. (And I know that fanfiction isn't universally loved, but I thought this was clever for a Sci-Fi crossover.)

Magic is the way the universe actually works, and all things being equal everyone would be wizards. The laws of physics is how the universe or past life forms have prevented the universe from being destroyed from every living thing essentially having the "Wish" spell from DnD.

So there isn't a gene that makes you a wizard, instead it's a really common Gene that makes you a muggle and over the generations it has a chance to break down and create a muggle-born wizard.

***** Not going to lie, there are some cool ideas in HPMoR but the execution is shaky. Concepts like the Interdict of Merlin and temporary Transfiguration would be interesting concepts, if they were consistently adhered to.

Since HPMoR has spawned fanfics of its own, it's possible to see just how interesting those concepts are in the hands of alternate authors.

**** If summoning things works at the speed of light (299 792 458 m / s, 300,000 km/s, 186,000 mi/s), people would literally die from a) not moving fast enough, and b) the air heating up so much around the object/area, people would vaporize (see [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/][Relative Baseball]] ).

Now if objects are summoned at the speed of sound (343 m / s, 1,234.8 km/h; 1,125 ft/s), I'd be more willing to believe. The speed of sound is still insanely fast though, and can very easily kill someone.

Like seriously, what is wrong with the idea of objects moving at lightspeed while under the effects of magic. It's magic. Just because mundane methods of lightspeed movement cause everything to explode, doesn't mean it has to be so with magic.

************ Snape got to them first. Then he went to get McGonagall. Then she walked to his office from wherever she was. So she could have directed an elf to "put food on Snape's desk when I point at it". And the "problem" with magic operating at light speed is that in this case, the summoning spell doesn't work at light speed. It pulls whatever you summon from where it is as though on a leash, which is why Umbridge could chain up brooms. And conjuring food, in this universe is impossible. Not hard, not super complex, flat out impossible. Therefore the simplest explanation for how McGonagall "conjured" a plate of sandwiches and cups of juice is that she told an elf to put food at a certain place either on a cue or at a certain time.

************* That's a pretty convoluted explanation actually. And an odd instruction.

I think "deliver tea and snacks" would be something a house elf might be told, but "deliver tea and snacks but not until I completely unnecessarily wave my wand around first" is not.

Further, Harry's beginner summoning spell they learn in forth year (accio) might pull things through normal space with a leash, but there are probably a lot more advanced spells a witch of McGonagalls caliber can use to pull objects through subspace or some similar media at speeds that seem in n-space to be FTL.

Edit: my headcanon on Gamps Law's is that they are mostly due to ignorance or propaganda.

Wizards know nothing about biochemistry or nutrition on a chemical level. I posit that a wizard or witch of sufficient power to be capable of permanent transfiguration who also has a PhD in biochemistry could definitely conjure food. Wizards are lazy though, and discount muggle things.

Further, money? Please, maybe not wizarding money because 1) gold - that's alchemy, and 2) goblin cast coins. But muggle money? No problem. Absolutely no reason why I can transfigure a bit of linen to look like money. Really specific color charms if nothing else.

************** How is "do x on cue" at all convoluted. She pointed. Not waved, not Drew mystic symbols for 20 minutes. Pointed. Exactly like a person would do to a servant. She pointed her wand and, pop, food and juice appeared.

Think of what that conjuring spell would entail. She would have to concentrate on the exact ingredients of the sandwiches and any condiments on the sandwich, as well as the juice. Then she would have to put a replenishment spell for that specific sandwich on the plate. Same for the juice and cup.

The summoning might be a bit easier, but would still be more complex than needed for the situation. You'd have to know exactly what and where you're summoning it from, else you risk stealing some other kids food.

What makes more sense in this context? Would you, an assistant principal of a school waste energy on an assuredly advanced, complicated and possibly dangerous spell to summon/create never-ending food, or would you have one of the hundreds of super discreet servants do it for you? That's my point. Not simply whether she could do it, but what is most likely given the scene of, she pointed, and food and drink appeared then kept appearing after she left.

*************** 1) in fourth year, Dumbledore definitely conjures a tea tray. That's the canon word, conjured.

2) using a wand at all implies magic. If it were just a gesture driven command given to an elf, why bother drawing your wand at all? That was my point.

3) the conjuring food if you know enough about it chemically thing is an interesting thought experiment, but would probably cost more energy to cast than what you would get eating the Apple, so also impractical.

I don't think she conjured it, though Dumbledore clearly did elsewhere, but summoning fits better here imo than house elf. When Dumbledore starts a feast, he gestures with his hands, not his wand. Which prompts the elves.

******** I always thought she conjured them instead of summoned them, but that was before we knew about gamp's law. I doubt Rowling thought it through, but we could imagine that instead of summoning them Accio-style, she magically moved them from somewhere else to the office - much like the food moves from the kitchens to the great hall. Summoning is different as it requires the object to move through space, whereas in this case it is more like apparition of an object.
