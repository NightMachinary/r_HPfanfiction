You can see it present in (almost) any enforcement agency.

Police (SWAT or SCO19 if you live in Britain) Military (SEALS, Green Beret, Delta or SAS, SBS if you live in Britain)

So wouldn't it be logical if the Aurors in Wizarding Britain had one? I guess Hit-Wizards could be it but I'm not sure if they are canon or not.

The Aurors are the Wizarding World's police/military force. Surely they must have a more prestigious department that makes better use of people with certain skill sets that can do things that no normal Auror can do.

For example, would you send in a single squad from the National Guard to infiltrate an enemy compound or a team from the Navy Seals (SAS)?

It seems rather strange that Aurors would have to respond to duties such as escalated bar brawls to full on capture of Dark Witches and Wizards. That is a lot for an Auror to be responsible for and surely there are some more capable than the rest at different situations.

The general view on Unspeakables are that they are researchers. However, they are dealing with the most intricate and obscure branches of Magic. (The Veil of Death, Hall with the brains in the jars, etc.) So it is not entirely implausible that the Department of Mysteries has members that are highly trained in combat to defend their research. You do not keep highly secretive and unknown samples of study under minimal protection.

(And remember, a group of teenagers were capable of infiltrating the Department of Mysteries as well as an Order member being able to camp right outside the Department door. So surely charms can't be the entire excuse for protection)


** Afaik there are 3 tiers to the DMLE.

There is the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol (MLEP) who act as the wizarding world police, they go after everyday criminals.

There is the Hit Wizards, they seem to act like SWAT teams, going after dangerous criminals.

Then there are the Aurors. They specifically target dark wizards, the most dangerous criminals. Kind of like MI5/FBI.

**** Ahhh, this clears up a lot. It felt weird when I would find an occasional fanfic in which the Auror's duty was to “Patrol Diagon Alley...”

Do Aurors also have to do Azkaban duty as well? (Read too much fanfic so I'm not sure which is canon and which is fanfic)

** Aurors are the elite. Tonks was the only new auror in years. There is no 'academy' for aurors. James and Sirius weren't Aurors. Becoming an Auror is exceptionally difficult it's one of the more stringent careers discussed in the series. Ron and Harry were both on track to become aurors before Voldemort's death.

The Department of Magical Law Enforcement is large. It's the police, the Obliviators, Improper Use of Magic Office, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts, the Hitwizards. Probably many other departments we don't know about, that are all under the preview of DMLE.

*** I wonder what the different law enforcement officers specialise in

hit wizards seem like swat or somethng

Kingsly was in charge of sirius case, so I feel the aurors track dark wizards and fugatives from the law

is there a normal police force ?

**** There is a magical law enforcement patrol. I'd imagine them to be beat cops, except the wizard version. I think there is considerable overlap between the departments though. Arthur Weasley as a DMLE employee would have the authority to do other law enforcement work for instance when he was involved in searching Malfoy's place in CoS.

It's always worth a reminder that the wizarding world operates more as a large town than a muggle nation. We're probably dealing with less that 20 thousand wizards in the British Isles.

****** Definitely not. Wizards don't war like muggles do. If for no other reason than conquest isn't beneficial to wizarding nations. They don't need to capture industrial/taxes bases or natural resources.

********** People war for a reason. I don't think any of those reasons exist, or if they do would motivate a wizard. I think in ages past when wizards were involved with muggles they'd have participated in wars. It wasn't a national thing though. It's Wizard X is a part of Court Y or they follow them to war.

Wizard nations are young, they're small and dispersed. Wizards have no need for land, they're not religious beyond cultural custom, we know for certain that Sprout grows foreign fauna just find in Scotland.

** I think it's strongly implied that the only reason Harry and co were able to break into the ministry was because voldemort and his death eaters kicked everyone out that night or murdered them. IIRC harry mentions that there's no security guard when entering the ministry.

Now if the death eaters could accomplish this, why voldemort didn't go in himself and retrieve it is beyond me. the only reason I can think of is that there's some super strong magical protection spells around the prophecy that only the people that were involved in the prophecy can initially pick it up and if voldemort takes it himself it could be easily deduced that voldemort is alive because harry would have witnesses saying that he wasn't at the ministry

i guess there's the head auror and there would be aurors with more seniority within the department. probably the department is small enough that the head auror knows who would best fit a certain mission.
