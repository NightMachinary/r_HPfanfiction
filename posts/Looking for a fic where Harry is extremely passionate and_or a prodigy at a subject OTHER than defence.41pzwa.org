  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est La Vie]] where Harry won the war but it went much worse. Fate chooses to send a much changed Harry back to third year in an alternate universe, to see if he can save that world too. Due to necessity he had become pretty good with runes during the last war. So in the new world he's a prodigy.
