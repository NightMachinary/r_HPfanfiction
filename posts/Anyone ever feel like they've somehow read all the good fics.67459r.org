I'm at a point where out of the 700k+ fics, I feel like I've read all the ones I'd like. Like I can go down FFNs top favorited and just know them all for like the first 10 pages. To be fair, how many 80k+ words, actually well written stories are there? So I guess this is a "Give me your favorite fic" or a "Help me get some new stories to read" thread.


** IMO, fics with more than 500 Favorites have no noticeable differences in quality, and there are many great ones between 200 and 500 Favorites, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11419408;11773877).

Even below 200 Favorites, there are still a significant number of hidden gems, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327;6432055;12076771).

--------------

Then there are always new, good authors. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]] only began writing in late 2013. Both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][FloreatCastellum]] really began in 2015. A new promising author, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4497458/mugglesftw][mugglesftw]], also known as [[/u/Full-Paragon]], began in late last Year.

--------------

As long as JKR kept tending to her franchise and people's interest, there will always be great new writers appearing on the scene. And with the fandom getting older, I actually expect the overall quality of HP fanfictions to improve.

#+end_quote

What the fuck are you talking about? Filtering by # of favorites only removes the absolute lowest tier of trash, but quality still varies enormously even when looking at fics with thousands of reviews.

Favorites are largely a measure of how many people have read the story, which is driven by # of chapters and longevity. Certainly quality plays a role, but not to the extent that everything with a certain amount of favorites is within a narrow quality window.

***** I'm assuming you meant something along the lines of "The quality distribution for fics remains the same above 500 favorites" so a fic with 500 favorites is just as likely to be good or terrible as one with 5000, not that every fic with above 500 favorites is the same quality. I'm not sure how to state that simply without using math terms though.

**** I don't know - that's also not a fair statement. Some of my HP fanfics are so niche that they have barely any reviews but I wrote nearly 20 pages in Word and the quality is pretty damn good, too!

A lot of the time 'popularity' is based on the tropes the story plays up, the character shipping, how often the chapters come out, and the connections an author may have with others.

To explain the last point: we're seeing a resurgence of the same authors being promoted the way Cassie Claire, Holly Black, AngieJ, etc were back in the early 2000s. /Everyone/ knew them. /Everyone/ read their stuff (and had valid opinions on it all ha!).

I agree 100% with the rest of your point regarding quality! I just find filtering by reviews (in the vein of, /ooo more reviews = better quality!!/) might remove trash, but it also then hides or misses out on niche fics that don't have the reviews but are quality.

If that makes sense? Not that it's fair or unfair - writing isn't fair??? and I don't think I'm calling out a whine that I don't have reviews for stories I write that I think deserve it - just that it's not the best method for filtering.

It could still be shit but probably better than absolute shit, you dig? That doesn't mean below x is always absolute shit, just absolute shit rarely get praise and favorites... Well...

*** To jump on this train, there are a lot of buried gems of HP fanfiction (and fanfiction in general) that never really caught on for whatever reason. I really enjoyed linkffn(6036153) and it has fewer than 500 favorites. As was mentioned, the Dark Lord Never Died is INCREDIBLE, but has very few reviews/favorites despite being of publishable quality if a few names were changed.

****** The thing about the TV series is that Quentin is no longer the main character. Instead, he's one of 4-5 main characters. That, coupled with the fact that the TV show isn't first person, makes Quentin a lot more interesting as a character. He's still annoying, but now you're not solely seeing the world through his eyes.

The TV show has its flaws, but I actually think it's very good, and very watchable. The first couple episodes are a little cheesy, but it really comes into its own very quickly. Also, if you haven't read the second and third books, then the TV show will feel completely new to you.

I did actually really like the books, although I partially agree with your assessment of them (personally I felt that was partly the point), but I can say without a doubt that the TV show is loads better.

There's rec lists everywhere from tumblr, to dark lord potter forums, to reddit, to live journal. Sometimes I just search through the bookmarks or other works of an author I liked. There's also sifting through the newest works on ao3, usually filtered so only the newest completed works show or something. But a lot of the time, there's a lot of really good fics that are incomplete, but make up for it by being really long already.

Remember, really good stories don't rely on length. The first Harry Potter book is about 80k words (75k if I remember correctly.) Don't refuse something just because its not an epic, unless you're only interested in epics. Then I can understand.

**** Those are pretty much it. Usually I just google whatever I'm looking for + rec list because all of these websites have awful search functions. For example: "Harry Potter Time Travel Rec List"

Actually, [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] has a lot of threads with rec lists from authors and readers who have pretty strict tastes. Since HP is such a big fandom, you don't even have to search for threads about HP, just the general "What's the best fanfic you've ever read?" threads.

[Here](fics_you_could_show_a_professor) and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4ttifu/what_are_the_top_5_fanfiction_you_have_ever_read/][Here]] are two threads I bookmarked a while ago (don't exactly remember why, but I'm sure they have something HP related.)

** I think one of the things that helps me is that I tend to look for "Missing Moments." Tiny little stories, slices of life at Hogwarts, with minimal shipping.

I also focus on characters that received some, but not a lot, of attention in canon. I find that more palpable than building something out of nothing in an existing universe. (How on earth did Daphne become so popular?)

On that note, I liked the stories that focus on the "Silver Trio" a lot:

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.

****** Haven't read the first one yet. Read through 28 chapters of the second- my issue (apart from it being a little too well-acquainted with fanon- Peruvian Darkness Powder, everyone knowing the prophecy, arithmancy for spell creation, etc.) Voldemort isn't demonstrably more intelligent or pragmatic than in canon: the first two deaths are basically pure luck to change Harry's personality. Dobby's quidditch/wall incident seems odd in light of the earlier conversation with Harry, for example.

It's honestly so prevalent- Harry uses warming charms (which aren't canon), but then later talks about learning them again in the context of the tournament. Harry talks about never having interacted with Skeeter, but she's mentioned much earlier. The initial Oliver relationship is nice, but he's not even mentioned once after that first reset first year.

It's probably being written quickly, but even a round of editing wouldn't be sufficient for the larger issues of the fic.

The summary is terrible, but the story is amazing.-- *linkffn(The Cupboard Under the Stairs by Stargon1)

*WBWL / Harry has a sibling (Most of these are pretty well known, but just in case you haven't read them yet)*

*linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) *linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man)

*Extreme(ish) AUs:*

If you're looking for dark (read: quite dark), you can try linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll). It's a little more Hermione-centric, but it also has Slytherin!Harry.

If you want something that has a similar sibling dynamic as Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, the closest thing I'd recommend is linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches)

***** That would never have happened if Dumbledore had been a Slytherin! (Within context of some important person yelling DIRECTLY AT Dumbledore)

Then, annoyed with his own annoyance (Harry thinks to himself)

First fanfic I'm reading ironically. That prince of syltherin fic has so many of these within the first chapter it's a meme at this point. Perfect example of how NOT to do edgy. The title is good though lmao.

*AUTHORS NOTE*

I freely confess that I can't write like an 11-year-old worth a damn and at a certain point I just gave up and handwaved it away with a magical explanation for why children this young were so well-spoken. For one thing, there is a good bit of humor as well as drama in this work, and frankly, 11-year-olds aren't generally very witty. If 11-year-olds who frequently talk like well-educated and occasionally smart-ass /14-year-olds/ is a complete deal-breaker for you, you should probably move along.

LMAO so much cringe inside a SINGLE one of the like sozen author notes from the first chapter. This author LMAO those three years made all the difference!

I, as well as the nearly 7,000 people (as of posting this comment) who follow this story definitely disagree with you. /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ is one of the better fanfictions on the site. In fact, sir, I would like to see you attempt to do better, which I highly doubt given the numerous typographical errors and poor sentence structure in your post. Furthermore, if you can indeed read, you would notice the author's notes were the exception, not the rule. By reading further into the story, you would discover why approximately seven thousand people have followed it. I sincerely hope you do read more of it and realize the fallacy in your claims.

Had it not been for my lack of creative talent I might have been able to see the qualities of this film for what they are, GENIUS!"

When thinking of a movie, it's easy to pick Adam Sandler films when making this thought, or just imagine Paul blart Mall cop 1 2 or 3. Okay maybe 3 isn't a thing but still.

** Yes, I do. But I always find a new 'good' fic I haven't read. Recently for example I read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9525716/chapters/21539333][Tell Brave Deeds of War]] which is now up there with some of my favourites.

  There's a war going on, and Death Eaters have taken Hogwarts. Michael isn't brave; Terry isn't wise; Anthony isn't a leader. Ravenclaws aren't meant to be rebels, but then again nothing else this year is normal. There's a war going on, and it's time that they figured out what's right, what's easy, and what they want to risk.

** Harry Potter and the nugtmare of future past is a good one that can be found of fanfiction.com

The draco trilogy by casandra claire is also amazing, it is basically 3 full novels but it is not of fanfiction. A simple google search and some looking around and you should be able to find a pdf of it.

** This is one of my all-time favorites, but it somehow only has 21 favorites so maybe you haven't come across it yet. It's Neville's year 7, which doesn't sound amazingly original but it is SUPER well-done. The characterizations of Neville, Ginny and Luna are just spot-on.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

** My all time fav fic is the Life and Times by Jewels5 on ft.net. Read it multiple times, and whenever I think about it I get the urge to read it again.

I seriously want to make a bind-up of it when it's actually finished, so that I finally can read it as a proper book.

** I definitely feel the same way. Most new authors are complete garbage and have no intention to make a single magnum opus, instead of attempting to make several garbage fics that can barely read like it takes place in the HPWorld. I find that even the fics I used to like feel a bit boring now (Example: On Way To Greatness, Forging the Sword, and pretty much all the other four to five stars on DLP). Maybe my tastes are too refined compared to what they used to be, but honestly, a lot of literary fiction that has magic reads like an HPfanfic with different names anyways.
