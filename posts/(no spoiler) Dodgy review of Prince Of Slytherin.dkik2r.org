** Also mentions the fact that Voldemort wasn't a problem outside of Britain

*** I always dislike fics that downplay the threat of Voldemort to make a point "Hurr durr magical Britain is backwards".

It's not like any other countries would be much better in that regard.

***** But in doing so, they also mention magical Britain is apparently insular.

Other countries have their threats, but I think people overestimate how often people like Voldemort, Dumbledore, and Grindelwald come around.

** This is more summary than review, and not gonna lie, I think I'd prefer to chop off a limb than read this based off your summary.

*** Thing is, Price of Slytherin's whole shtick is that it uses all of these terrible tropes and actively tries to subvert them. This review just mentions that in a throwaway line at the end.

**** Subversion would be writing something that looks like the trope on the surface but turns out to be the opposite. An example would be for the Slytherin students to /think/ of themselves as prodigies at political scheming, but meanwhile the adults are shaking their heads behind their backs at how silly and gullible they all are.

Instead, Prince of Slytherin uses the tropes un-ironically and just invents convoluted in-universe justifications for them. For example, Prince of Slytherin includes genius politician!kids with the in-universe justification that all wizarding families use potions to program their kids with knowledge before Hogwarts.

**** I'm not trying to be a dick, but on the surface it looks like everything I dislike in a Harry Potter fic. I read Harry Potter because I love the characters. The magic etc is all just extra. To have characters that I hold so dear changed so dramatically, is actually painful for me to read. I love AU's, but not AU's that change who the characters are.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
