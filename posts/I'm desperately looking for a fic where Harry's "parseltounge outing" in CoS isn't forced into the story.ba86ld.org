Are there any well written ones with a reasonable plot out there? doesn't have to actually include the dueling club scene or even second year. i just want a universe where it didn't happen.

By now i get irrationally angry everytime the storyline diverges before second year, and an unrealistic scenario happens, such as:

Harry finds out about his ability beforehand, but even though he's been warned not to tell anyone he still messes up.

Hell, Harry could be a serial killer and psychopath, but authors will /still/ find a way for him to suddenly care so much about his fellow student's lifes to reveal this closely guarded secret.

Basically, everyone is forced to act ooc just so the author doesn't have to actually be creative and I'm sick of it.


** Seventh Horcrux in case you haven't read it yet. I mean its a not a serious, but its the only fic I know of that covers all seven years and has a satisfying ending. linkffn(10677106)

This is the dueling scene in it

#+begin_quote
  Malfoy's summoned snake launched itself onto one of the students. Oh, sure, I could have stopped it, but I didn't really care. Besides, our medicine is pretty good; he would probably be fine.

  The real question is why no one else did anything. There were plenty of people around -- Severus, Lockhart, the other students -- and, as far as they were concerned, I was just a stupid second year who most certainly couldn't speak to snakes.

  Taking advantage of my opponent's distraction, I disarmed him and hopped off the stage. I do so love winning.

  "Hey, Hermione," I asked, "Who's the kid with the snake on his face?"

  "Justin Finch-Flechley," she murmured. My minions flinched at the boy's screams.

  "Everything burns!" my...erm, Malfoy's victim cried.

  "Who?"

  "He's a Hufflepuff."

  "Oh, that's alright then."

there is also Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux linkffn(11762850)

Its well written but has quite a few tropes and while the sequel is still occasionally updated I doubt its going to finish.

*** thanks :) I've never read it, but it's been on my to-read-list for a while. I'm pretty desperate here, so i'll take satire.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
