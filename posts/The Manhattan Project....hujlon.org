The year is 1995, a divination project is being held on the ground floor of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Professor Trelawney and her new (reluctant) colleague Professor Firenze noted a distinct lack of interest in NEWT Divination. A subject where Scrying is taught, a popular practice for divining the past, present AND future.

As a way to drum up interest, the Professors take the time to teach their current fifth year cohort to consider the subject, they decide to teach one of the more fascinating branches of Scrying.

Perceiving past lives.

Gripped by her own morbid intrigue, Trelawney pushed to allow students a glimpse at their last days to weeks of their most recent life.

A special tea is made, many believing it contains a copious amount of her cooking sherry, before each innoculated student is set in front of a crystal ball and several pots of incense.

Very little happens besides sneezing. Confusion and irritation settling in.

Before a fairly troublesome student, known for his lightning bolt scar, begins to react. A slew of pained spasms and twitches wrack his body for a full minute as his eyes roll back into his skull.

Severl students scream, Ron Weasley jerking back from his attempts to assist only when a spasming arm strikes the bridge of his nose and sends his vision swimming.

Then stillness.

Triumph is present on Trelawney's face now as she enthusiastically jabs her fingers at the young man. The crystal ball clearing, it's usually silvery clouds receding. Within is a couple, a dark haired man and woman, posing at a carnival for a picture, context given by the distant, dreamy voice of Harry James Potter, speaking in a voice and tone that is not his own,

"It is July, 1959. And I am in love..."


** Halfway through I thought this was going to be Trelawney drumming up interest in her class by using scrying to show everyone an atomic bomb going off.

** The class is stunned after the conclusion of the memory, such a fantastical tale, some Muggleborns remember hearing from the heroes of old from America, but many thought it was just war propaganda.

"Professor, I think Harry just remembered a...mover, movie, right? That could only be one of those muggle movies?" Ron asked. Firenze was trembling and muttering to himself.

"Fascinating."

Everyone stopped and turned to Harry, who is awake and studying his open hand intensely.

"Mr. Potter?" Trelawney asked hesitantly.

As if waking from a dream, Harry looks at her, and some notice his eyes look quite a bit different, less vibrant, and more experienced.

"Potter? Yes, Harry Potter, that's my name now, isn't it? Harry James Potter, so different from John Osterman..." he trails off and looks at his hand again.

"Harry, mate? Are you alright?"

Harry stops again, and looks up, peering at Ron as if seeing him for the first time, and then looking behind him, at the wall, as if seeing something far off in the distance.

"So, it worked, almost as I predicted" he frowned, "There were other...forces intervening, could these be what some call fate?"

"Worked? What worked?" Ron was leaning away from Harry, his face paling, "Harry, you are scaring me. What are you talking about, mate?"

Harry spoke as if to himself, even if he was answering the question, "I wanted to test myself, I had already seen so much, done so much in one life, I wanted to see what could be done with two."

Those more perceptive, of which Firenze was a part, were already realizing what was a being implied and were starting to get nervous.

Harry looked at Ron, who gasped at how his best friend's eyes were starting to glow.

"I had never used magic, not how I...use it now, I didn't know about," he gestured to the room, some flinched "all this..."

He stopped again and looked at Professor Trelawney who took a step back, "I did see this moment though, the moment where I would remember, it was out of context and...not clear, not defined, flowing...it /fascinated/ me."

He inclined his head to the side, "I also wanted to see..."

"See what, Mr. Potter?" Firenze spoke, ignoring the reproaching and scared looks some students were sending him.

Harry smiled, and it wasn't Harry's smile, it was similar, but...different. He picked up the cup they had used for tea, said cup /melted/ in his hand, the white fluid flowed around his arm before reforming into a cup on the table.

"See, what made, me, /me./ Was it just my body? Or something deeper? My mind? My soul?"

He gestured at the cup again, it promptly reformed itself into a red cup, then yellow and black, and Harry glanced mournfully at it for a second before smiling.

"And I still don't know, and it fascinates me." he looked at Firenze "What I know," he raised his forearm, now bare, a blue glow started coming from the inside, then the veins and after a moment, the whole forearm started to glow blue.

"is that apparently that machine changed much more than my body." he suddenly rose from the chair, much more gracefully than he would have done before class started, but so sudden that almost the whole class jolted.

"I must go now." he gazed at Ron, an apology in his eyes, but Ron, showing more presence of mind than ninety percent of the room's occupants, merely nodded with a small smile.

"Go where, Mr. Potter?" Firenze asked, Trelawney had just sat down in a daze.

"To find myself, Professor, as you know..." the veins under all his visible skin started to glow too, his eyes were becoming white and a faint outline of a circle appeared just under the lighting bolt scar.

"It's just a question of reassembling the components in the correct sequence."

The wind picked up and Harry disappeared in a wave of blue light.
