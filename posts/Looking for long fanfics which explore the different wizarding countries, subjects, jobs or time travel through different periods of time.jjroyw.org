I am looking for adventure and world building fan fictions, where they travel to either different time periods, different countries or interact with different cultures or discover new magic or creatures,or include curse breaking etc. preferably with either Harry or Hermione as main character but I am willing to read about other characters as well. Fics where the main character has special power, talent or interest. maybe they can talk to animals, enchant objects. I am looking for adventure and travel mostly instead of political type fics.

I read a fic where harry could see the history of anyone or anything he touched and one where he becomes the God of luck due to people praying to him as a joke because he is lucky which made him a god( can't remember the name of fic, post link if anyone knows)similar fics.

this, where Harry breaks all laws of magic just with his will power and creates pokemons from existing animals[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7353028?fbclid=IwAR0JFgjtIxCJcSzgcHQ3iA-mclgpfrGo5tRuVU_a8Yi0Yg3Oa1MzPEOVRvg][https://archiveofourown.org/works/7353028]]
