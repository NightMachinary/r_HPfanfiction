Greetings.

Inspired by [[/u/viol8er]]'s thread [[https://de.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4srhee/does_hpff_do_a_what_did_you_publish_day_like/][here]], I decided to ask what you published this month.

As this is the first thread of (maybe, hopefully, likely,...) more, you may also post what you are writing on in general.

Promote to your hearts desire.


** I've been writing weekly chapters for "The Dark Lord Never Died" and "Divided and Entwined".

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Still working on my Triwizard AU where Dumbledore and Grindelwald are champions. (Slash). Yesterday I published it on fanfiction.net in hopes of getting more traffic, but I don't think many people are into the pairing despite it being somewhat canon. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12050648]])

Also have a bunch of stories lined up - one about Hagrid at Hogwarts when the Chamber gets opened, one about Cho as an adult, so that'll be fun. I feel like especially with Hagrid not many people write about him as a kid despite him having a really interesting childhood. It's been fun so far though.

  It's 1898 and Hogwarts, against all better judgement, is hosting the Triwizard Tournament. Albus is surprised when he meets a Durmstrang student who may not be on par with him in talent, but makes up for it in cleverness, charm, and spirit. Maybe he's met his rival, or maybe - just maybe - he's met his match. / AD x GG / WIP

** I start.

This month I published 2 chapters of a fic that has lain dormant on my harddrive for over 4 years. "The Art and Craft of Necromancy" features a Hermione that stumbles upon the Arts of Summoning, especially Necromancy.

*The summary:* When Hermione looked through the attic of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, she did expect to find dark magic, forbidden rituals and terrible spells. But the darkness rarely tells its secrets, and so Hermione is caught in a whirlwind of black magics, with a demon inside her head and a Mistress hailing from the House of Black.

Its completely un-edited and more of a filler between chapter of "The Salem Settlement" - a fic that struggles hard against being written.

Fleur and Harry have a chance encounter in Diagon Alley, they get captured, and now must find a way to escape. It should be pretty romance-y, but I'm a sucker for slow burn fics so it won't be immediate. The fic is in its infancy so try it out, if you end up not liking it, it was only a few minutes wasted.

  It goes without saying that a Witcher's life is one of thankless peril. Mutations, vagrancy, a profession of murder, and all they get for it are insults and a few pieces of gold to tide them over to the next contract. Yes, life is bad enough for one witcher, but two, in one small village? In that case, peril doesn't quite do it justice.

** I didn't write it but first time I read it was around the release of the last book. It was passed off as the legit book. Called Harrys last task (the bot links a different fic).Took me years to find it again and it was never finished. I kept up to date with it but the site it was on was taken down. The author had health problems apparently then went silent about 2 months after they released the last chapter they had written, around 2009. I'm missing that last chapter too which sucks

Sucks it was never finished, but I posted it anyway hoping someone with writing skills likes it enough to continue it

Harry attends Ilvermorny, and is a contender for Ilvermorny Champion, even though he's 14. Oh, and everyone in Great Britain aside from Gringotts, and a small handful of people, believe Lily and Harry both died in the Halloween 1981 attack.

  Remus Lupin vaguely knew what to expect when a being that called itself a god appeared before him. An offer for a paying job wasn't on that list. It wasn't like he was employed at the moment, and the job had good benefits. Too bad he had no idea what he was getting himself into. Pseudo-Lovecraftian AU, with Powerful!Remus. Mild Dumbledore bashing in early chapters.
