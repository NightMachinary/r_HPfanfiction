Lately I have been getting into "Hogwarts X muggle schools crossovers" but can barely find any good or completed ones. To be honest though, reading about wizards and muggles adapting to coexist is also very interesting.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.
