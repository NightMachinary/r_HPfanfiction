Found! Changeling by romanescue, Link in comments

Harry is definitely younger than 7 in this fic. He likes to read, and the Librarian notices. She sees that he is looking at an advanced science book, so she thinks he is looking at the pictures, but he then asks her for a related book because he wants to look at other theories or something. She is surprised but gets the book. Eventually, she starts giving him pieces of fruit and sandwiches. I think at some point she thinks he is an Esper or has some form of psychic abilities. Thanks in advance for any help!
