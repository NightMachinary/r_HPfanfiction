This is probably THE rarest type of fanfiction I've ever seen, because I've been browsing the website for years and have only found one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10061782/1/In-Atlantean-Caves][In Atlantean Caves.]]

In that story, during the attack at the Ministry, Harry and the others end up going through a wrong door which sort of takes them into this weird underground cave-maze where the doors don't go back to where they came from originally. Once they're there, they're on their own, in isolation, in a world that has absolutely no connection to the canon universe or any variation. It's fresh from the author's mind.

Unfortunately, In Atleantean Caves hasn't been updated in just about a year, and I wouldn't expect any more chapters to pop up any time soon. So does anyone know of any other stories that follow this format?


** Are you looking for something akin to a pocket dimension like [[/u/__Pers]] linked to or just travel to a non-HPverse location?

Do you specifically want it to be the locational equivalent of an OC? Otherwise a lot of crossovers /might/ qualify depending on the nature of where Harry&co. arrive.

This basically sums it up. Pocket dimension or not, I would simply like it to be a place that is unique to that story; in the case of In Atlantean Caves there is also a theme of isolation because as far as the characters know they are the only humans in the maze, which is a nice addition, though not strictly necessary.

** There's a sense of this in Tellemicus Sundance's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5528392/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-World-Beneath][Harry Potter and the World Beneath]].

*** After reading the first two chapters I can say I quite like it--it's not /exactly/ what I was looking for, but it's a nice read nonetheless. Thanks.

** I can think of a few crossovers that fit this description, but it doesn't really sound like crossovers are what you're looking for?

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] is an Avengers crossover that is pretty bomb. Unfortunately I think it's abandoned but there's a lot there.

There's also a really good LotR crossover, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]].

Both do feature Harry being transported to this new world and having to figure shit out. And being a boss while he's at it, because, well, saving-people-thing.
