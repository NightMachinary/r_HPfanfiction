*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/][*/What Lies Beneath/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/471812/Master-Slytherin][/Master Slytherin/]]

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller
