Trying to write a fanfivtion as closely to Canon as possible, but every resource I find is getting small things wrong such as amount of lessons per week or what days lessons are.

Does anybody have any fully accurate timetables?

*** It's not evidence of multiple teachers per subject, but McGonagal's pottermore page refers to a "Transfiguration department" which might suggest there are TA's, or assistants. I can't imagine how the professor's would get along without some kind of help.

** I didn't go super canon compliant in terms of what classes when, I went more canon consistent. I wrote a whole schedule which is now the headcanon for my WIP. I was thinking about posting it, but I don't know how I would get it from word to reddit.

The problem with class timetables is that JK was incoherent. Depending on the amount of teachers, with the students as they are split up, with class sizes, it's actually impossible. The teachers would have to use time turners, and even then it's odd.

When writing fanfiction, I think consistency and coherence is more important than absolute reliance on stray facts. Because JK certainly didn't stick to them. She wrote around it, but if you're coming at the story from a different angle you may be unable to.

If you're interested in the scheduling I wrote out, let me know. Figuring out how to post it might also be a help....
