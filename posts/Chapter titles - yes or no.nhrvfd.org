Especially in longer fics, they're really helpful, and as someone who's written something really long, its helpful to the writer if they need to go back and check on a plot point so they won't screw something up, make sure you don't forget a key detail, etc.

** Chapter titles are a must for me. Not a "won't read if they don't have," but the feeling of finishing a 75-chapter beauty and wanting to go back and re-read that first kiss and realizing you have no idea which generic "chapter 36" or "chapter 29" holds that scene itching in your brain is just heartbreaking. Even the slightest crap title that gives some indication of what happened in that chapter can help.

E.G. You name a chapter "Moony barks" and I can go "oh yeah, Moony spent that moon barking at a rabbit and the kiss happened AFTER that."

** I normally name my chapters just for the fun of it tbh. I also include the number e.g ‚ÄòChapter 2: Summer Holidays' but I don't always use the numbers. Sometimes if there's a massive plot point in the chapter I'll name it something more inconspicuous, but overall I think they're great for being able to give a bit of info before reading or letting you find a specific chapter

Often times, if I find that trying to name a chapter around the events that happen in it is too much of a spoiler, I'll use a metaphor or a song lyric/title or some reference that seems arbitrary but makes more sense once you read the chapter through. If I'm jammin to a specific song while writing and I feel like it's fitting, I might swipe a line for the chapter title :D

** As an author and a reader, I prefer fairly descriptive chapter titles because it helps you navigate the story.

In particular as a reader, if I open up an AU starting from first year, the first thing I'm doing is opening up the chapter index and using it to judge whether the fic goes anywhere.

If I open up the chapter index of a 100k word story and it's like "Chapter 45 - Halloween" then I immediately know the story is paced terribly and going nowhere and I nope the fuck out.

** I prefer chapter titles, it's much easier to orient in a story. As a writer I often have a problem choosing a title for each chapter that's descriptive enough, but I feel it's necessary. Makes a chapter feel less like a block of text to go through, gives it an individual 'oomph'.

But if not that, the least one can do is name them by arcs. Much easier to remember "third chapter of X arc" than "n. 126".

** Yes, absolutely, nothing more annoying than trying to find a certain scene then wondering whether it was Chapter 12 or Chapter 28 or what not. Titles allow for easier reread.

I personally do my Chapters a POV (Character Name) (POV Chapter Number). In writing Harry Potter currently, so if I change POV to Harry, it be titled POV Harry One. I find the easier to do as probably my readers as they can sort of n pick which story line they want to follow.

** I didn't always care, and it's still not terribly important, but now I prefer a story to have chapter titles. As a reader, it makes it easier to go back and find what you're looking for, and in general, the titles can just really be lovely and/or funny. It's a nice bonus.

Also, I'm very bad about spoiling the story for myself but I have no desire to stop this bad habit, so I kind of like when the titles are a bit specific, oftentimes I will open a new story and the first thing I'll do is read the chapter titles to have an indication of what will happen. And then it's kind of fun to end up being totally wrong about what I thought might happen from the title.

For the story I'm working on now, the story title is one word and the chapter titles are synonyms of that word. I doubt any of my readers have taken notice of it, but. I felt quite clever when I came up with the idea, anyway lol.

It helps if I want to look something up, I guess, but they can be kind of spoiler-y, so I try not to look at the title unless I don't mind being spoiled. If you can come up with chapter titles that aren't spoiler-y but still managed to describe the chapter, that would probably be best, but I know that's hard to do.
