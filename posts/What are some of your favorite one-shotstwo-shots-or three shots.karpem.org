Can be any length, as long as it's a oneshot, two shot or threeshot

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, any length, old or new

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc Doesn't have to focus on pairings

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion

Because I'm sure someone will mention it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923164/1/I-Know-Not-and-I-Cannot-Know-Yet-I-Live-and-I-Love]]


** /Faith and Understanding/ is one of my very favorites. It's Ginny and Luna's friendship, with Ginny's musings therein.

[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Link]]

As a final note, it has my favorite passage from any /Harry Potter/ fanfic:

#+begin_quote
  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  ‚ÄúLuna, who's your favorite person?‚Äù

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  ‚ÄúYou are.‚Äù

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely---nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

*** That's beautiful, thanks for sharing. Not canon compliant re: the origins of their friendship and Ginny's characterization feels off w regards to her actions v internal musings. But the writing is is whimsical and present in kind of a nostalgic way. I love the development of their friendship, and the way that Ginny sees Luna's eccentricities and loves her /for/ them, rather than in spite of them.

**** It is a little off of canon--I don't think that Ginny was truly friends with Luna until the events of OotP, but at the same time, a fair few of the characterizations are spot on--I fully believe that if those two would argue, it would be, in part, because Ginny doesn't think Luna's being properly angry with her.

And the bit at the end...where they sprawl in the grass...It's been my favorite passage for a decade.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.
