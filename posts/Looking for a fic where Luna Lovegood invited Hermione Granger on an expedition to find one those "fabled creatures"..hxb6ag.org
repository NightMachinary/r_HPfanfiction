** Okay another fict that is on the tip of my tongue is one where the female main character is a little crazy and gets a little action with many females. She turns out to be the heir to the house of black. I think she gets together with Hermione but I don't recall. It does involve killing of Lucius Malfoy and Sirius black and Bellatrix being married for some reason
