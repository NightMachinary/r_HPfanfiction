tl;dr: I like powerful bad guys. Especially if they go by the mantle "Dark Lord".

If any of you have any recommendations for fics that have a horrifying, stupidly intimidating Voldemort, please let me know.

--------------

My favourite character in any fiction is usually "the baddy". The person who is enacting their will upon the world, evoking the desire to resist in the protagonist (which kicks off the narrative, typically). They usually have a stronger character and defined goals that directly affect the protagonist and develop "stake", so the reader roots for them being overthrown.

But Lord Voldemort is pretty boring, in that regard. We are given few reasons and little evidence to view him as a super scary baddy. Now it may just be my interpretation, but I view a "Dark Lord" as something almost other-worldly. Like the devil has manifested itself inside a mortal and then borne out divine brutality against its enemies. Voldemort hasn't really taken anything from the readers that would specifically evoke our hatred for him specifically. Sirius, Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Mad-Eye, all of them are removed from the story almost as an afterthought. Bellatrix Lestrange is more of a hated baddy than Voldemort. And Umbridge more hated than Lestrange for her having terrorised schoolchildren without blinking an eye. I understand the intention from J.K. Rowling was to humanise him, especially when Dumbledore teaches Harry about Voldemort's past, but it doesn't change the fact that, without Harry, Voldemort would in all likelihood have won the first time round.

I recall reading a thread some months ago talking of something similar. Voldemort is "bad", but there is no weight to our opposition to him. This user recommended that Voldemort erase Hermione's mind, or something to that effect. Instead of simply killing Hermione, the Dark Lord removes her defining trait, her intelligence. She is given back to Harry with essentially the mind of a child, as a warning to his side of what happens when you support the Chosen One. Seeing Hermione reduced to i.e. a five year-old version of herself - with no knowledge of magic and very afraid of the world and confused in the body she now inhabits - would, in itself, likely be sufficient to warrant the reader's hatred of Voldemort. It is a callous, cruel move that directly impacts Harry.

Sadly J.K. Rowling didn't go anywhere near that dark, instead resorting to having Voldemort kill Charity Burbage, though we weren't attached to her character in the slightest so it did... nothing (for me, at least). I mean... Wormtail killed Diggory, Fenrir Greyback mauled Lavender (personally I think Ron sticking with Lavender after she's disfigured would've made for a better narrative but w/e).

I have a particular head-cannon for "what went down" in Voldemort's first rise to power, and why he was so feared.

During the Dark Lords first rise, Lord Voldemort was much more direct about taking down the Ministry. He killed any likely opponents that were powerful in their own right, barring Dumbledore and select Aurors like Mad-Eye which survived his "initial purge". He had the Giants, Werewolves, and other Dark creatures on his side pretty much from the start. He annihilated some wizarding towns until just Diagon Alley and a maybe a few others were left intact enough to rebuild into the Diagon Alley we see in the books.

To face him in battle meant a quick death unless you were in a large enough group, in which case you'd better hope that he doesn't start picking you off. His spells are of such blistering power that the average Ministry-trained wizard has no effective defence against them. His knowledge of the Dark Arts is unparalleled. His power is palpable -- merely being in the presence of his spellcasting has your hairs standing on end, taking a hit to your shield from one of his spells is like getting kicked in the chest. To goad or mock him meant a prolonged, exquisitely painful death and your body dumped somewhere publicly in a cartel-like tactic to terrify and horrify his enemies. Even after he “died”, people still wouldn't speak out against him. Wouldn't even say his name lest invoking his name brought his wrath down upon them. They call him "You Know Who" or "He Who Must Not Be Named".

By contrast, he killed so many people the first time around, that by the Second Dark War his opponents were significantly reduced. When reborn he isn't as powerful as during the height of his first rise to power. He has less opponents to target. The Ministry is weaker but he has some old-staff in influential positions like Lucius Malfoy so it's easier to bring it down from within. The Dark Lord spent a decade as a wraith, regaining energy by living off the life force of others, a panicked existence moving from one possession to the next, reduced to the most primal of instincts without personality or ordinary cognitive function. Unable to formulate plans, barely aware of life outside of an impossible existence. Then Quirrell stumbles upon him and possesses him. Feeding off the life force of a wizard for the first time, he quickly regains his strength and plans his return using the Philosopher's Stone.

Then at some point during Voldemort and Dumbledore's first confrontation (following his rebirth), we'll have dialogue to the effect of:

#+begin_quote
  The Ministry's Atrium resembled a war zone, the statues long-since melted into puddles of metal, tiles along the walls cracked and burned, stone pillars set ablaze by magical fires wept their lacquer in thick inky teardrops. Harry was stuck behind a fireplace in the impenetrable embrace of the last remaining statue Dumbledore had animated.

  Neither Dumbledore nor Lord Voldemort spared a glance at the damage. Instead they looked at one another evenly across the room, the evidence of their powerful sorcery ignored.

  "I remember you having a quicker wand," said Lord Voldemort, his thin lips twisted into a mocking smile.

  Dumbledore nodded, as though conceding Voldemort's words, then in a calm tone replied, "Time makes mortals of us all Tom, even you. I do happen to notice we're at a standstill yet again. I recall you being more powerful."

  Voldemort's face turned to hatred so suddenly it jarred Harry to see it, all his senses screaming at him that Voldemort was about to spit out a Killing Curse, but the snakelike wizard hadn't moved his wand yet.

  "Even in this diminished body you cannot best me."

  "That goes both ways, Tom."
#+end_quote

... yada yada, something to that effect. And then they begin battle anew, or Voldemort possesses Harry like in the books. Who knows. I refuse to believe the Voldemort we see in canon is the same as the one that brought the Ministry to its knees ten years prior.


** The Black Queen series by Silently Watches on FFN has an incredibly powerful Voldemort, the sort you're thinking of here; he takes out armies on his own, conquers Britain, adapts to situations and changes with ease and utilizes dark magic to the highest extent. He even kills the Boy Who Lived - although he's not the main character

The fics seem to be blacklisted from the bot based on my earlier attempts of using it for them - probably because they're some of the more fucked up fics out there besides edgy shock fics - but they're pretty easy to find via google.

** I think Voldemort leaves much to be desired and, yes, his opponents were greatly reduced, /but/ our view is skewed by someone who isn't batteling Voldemort and isn't exactly afraid of him in the same way everyone else is. If the story was from anyone else's PoV save Dumbledore, I think we'd get a better sense of how scary he is. I usually find baddies in children's stories boring because the heroes are, in a way, desensitized them. And they're limited to PG ratings.

Amelia Bones' death was a missed opportunity. A high-ranking official who'd had several family members murdered should've been scared as hell and chapter like that at the top of HBP would've been great.

  I know I am curious about the Bones death! Wish we had more detail other than he randomly showed up and killed her and she put up a real fight.

** The recent chapters of the linkffn(Innocent) series left me quite motivated to have horrible things happen to Tom, but if you aren't already reading it, there's several books and over a million words to reach that point.

Voldemort has discovered the connection between their minds, and is using it to sneak into Harry's mind every time he tries to sleep and give him horrifying nightmares. Harry's getting seriously sleep-deprived, and even Dreamless Sleep potions aren't helping, plus the immediate horror of watching his friends die over and over, often because he couldn't save them. And this is while Voldemort is still in evil monster baby form, just amusing himself, rather than being at his full power.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** I see what you're saying. I think canon Voldemort is interesting in how his motive is evading death and how fearful he is of it, how his hatred/embarrassment of his Muggle parentage drives him, the Gaunt backstory, how he operates in secrecy and tricks some of the time. I mean the diary Horcrux was quite sinister. And the line from HBP from Dumbledore was very interesting "Have you any idea how tyrants fear the people they oppress? Always they are looking for the one who will rise up and strike back." I guess I like learning his fearful side- his psychology if you will.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
