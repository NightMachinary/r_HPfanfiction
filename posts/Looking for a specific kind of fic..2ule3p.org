I'm looking for any kind of 'crossover character goes to Hogwarts' fanfiction, mainly in the vein of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8827254/1/Batman-Doesn-t-Do-Magic][Batman Doesn't 'Do' Magic]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]. The character can be "Hogwarts age" or older, just as long as the fic deals with their (usually forced/forceful) entry into the HP-verse's magical world.


** There are several [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Calvin-Hobbes-Crossovers/224/266/][Calvin and Hobbes go to Hogwarts]] stories which always stuck me as a amusingly silly pairing.

Vaguely fitting, Harry Dresden wakes up as Harry Potter, unfinished (haven't read it, so don't know how good it is):
