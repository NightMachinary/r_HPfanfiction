I'm writing a story and was wondering about current canon after the seventh book. Who's married to whom, who their kids are, who's teaching what, etc. Can anyone help me with this?


** Check out the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][HP Wiki]]. It carries canon-related info derived from the books, movies, Pottermore and JKR interviews.

**** The wiki is an amazing resource, but don't forget that it includes information from Pottermore and the video games. Some people only consider the core 7 books, or maybe the core 7 books plus the 3 charity books to be "real" canon. Usually the wiki citations will note whether something is drawn from the original books or another source.
