:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I had read a fanfic a while back where the OC reincarnated into the HP world and ends up using magic in new ways such as helping Nearly Headless Nick remove his head but I can't for the life of me find it again please help I'm begging here...


** I've definately read that... I feel like it's OaLC? Certainly an OC comes back into a new world and uses magic in new ways. I feel like that happens but I might be getting it confused with another story.

If this is wrong lemme know and I'll go back over my other fics and see if anything rings a bell because goddam it now I'm mad....
