** Which characters do you want to not be overpowered, and relative to what universe? Because canon PJO is way above canon HP (at least in terms of combat). If you want them to be equal, you have to either nerf PJO or buff HP.

*** Honestly it depends on what form of combat you are thinking of. Because combat between PJO's finales (the last olympian and end of franchise) are both army battles with two impervious generals in luke and percy. while singular combat, like luke vs percy, is not as powerful as say dumbledore vs voldemort, where just being in the same room required protection, or dumbledore vs grindlewald which is said to be the best duel ever fought.

Lets say Harry though is a demigod in pjo. He is honestly around percy's level before the dip into that river, that grants him imperviousness and more. As long as, it is end of series Harry.

Dumbledore transported... Well i dont see Kronos beating dumbledore without utilizing godmode, regardless of who his vessel is.

** I've got two that are unfinished, but totally worth it for what's there; [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10641167/12/][Serpents and Celestial Bronze]] Harry comes into a monster inheritance and become a Creator (ok so he might be a bit op but it's a fun fic anyway and the descriptions are gorgeous)

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/316664][Frey of Asgard]] series is everything I've every wanted from fanfiction. It's exciting, there's great world building, there's character development. And there's about 9 parts to get your teeth stuck into. Unfortunately the last book hasn't been updated since April last year, but I'm holding out hope, because the author was pretty regular with updates before that. Frey (Harry) does eventually become pretty powerful, but it's a long road to get there.

I hope either of these are good. Unfortunately I don't think I've found any PJ/HP that's fantastic and finished, and if I had I finished it and the tab was closed in the â€˜culling' I recently did. 200+ tabs on your phone is too many . DX

*** Can vouch for Frey of Asgard. Enjoyed that story a lot, and it gave both the PJO world and the HP world and the Marvel world equal attention which was nice

**** I am not sure I am reading these tags correctly, but why does it look like Harry is in a relationship with half a dozen characters?

***** Cause he is lol

To clarify: Harry has sex with a lot of people. And he is (kind of?) underage (but then we go into what is really underage for a godling) but yeah. I skipped the smut but read on cause the plot is actually really good
