Title: Flutter

Blurb: The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

Genera idea: What if Ginny was more heavily affected by her time with Tom Riddle? I wanted to look at how she might attempt to handle that trauma, and a different path she might have taken. This story is definitely AU, but you won't necessarily be able to tell right away.

Extra info: This will be a stand alone story, covering briefly the content of Chamber of Secrets, then more in depth the content of Prisoner of Azkaban, from Ginny's perspective. I have most of the story written, about 60k words written so far. I have also edited (by myself and with help from a good friend of mine, who has been wonderful as a sounding board and editor) the first half(ish) of the story. I would love to do further books exploring the rest of her time in Hogwarts, but I didn't want to get ahead of myself or be too ambitious. Tentatively, I would like to post a chapter a week, on Monday. I definitely won't promise that, but it's my current goal.

So, uh, yeah! I'd love for you to read it, and let me know your thoughts on it so far! Please be constructive or positive, but I'd love to hear feedback on the story.


** Well done. I can't really think of too much criticism. You packed in a lot of good building blocks for characterizing Ginny as the story progresses, and overall the way you have described her ordeal and trauma is descriptive and evocative, and therefore makes it easier to imagine what she's feeling and sympathize with her.

Overall, just a very well written chapter, and kudos for editing/proofreading before posting. Thank you for posting.

** It's really well-written and I'm intrigued where you'll take the story!

Good: Ginny's characterization. She felt like a real person and reading her internal struggles definitely reminded me of all my middle school insecurities... So... Spot on.

Nice pacing covering her first year in one chapter, not dwelling too long anywhere or getting bogged down, but going enough in-depth that you could really feel the possession take hold.

Good job making it super creepy.

Criticism: I'll be honest, I skipped the sorting hat song. But I don't read the elf songs in LoTR either, so it's just not my genre. But I think you should be aware that you will turn away readers like me (I mean people with the attention spans of goldfish) by putting that first.

Tom's monologue felt a little choppy. Maybe try reading aloud to sound out a more natural speech feel?

I got a little confused during the hospital wing confession if Ginny was sobbing or holding back tears or what during her dialog. The ums and uhs come across as more nervous than distraught.

Overall: this is legitimately the best new fanfic I have seen in a LONG time, keep it up, OP! I'm really excited to see where it goes.

*** Thank you so much for the kind words! I'm so glad you enjoyed it. And thank you just as much for the criticism. I know a lot of people don't enjoy the sorting hat song, but it is one of the things I really enjoyed in one of the first fanfics I ever read, so I left it in. But now a days, when I see it, I often times skim it or skip it as well (depending on my mood). So I'll leave it, and not be at all offended that some people give me a skip because of it.

I tried reading Tom's monologue out loud, and sort of got what you meant. I think I used too many adjectives in his insults of Ginny, but I just imagine him as being a particularly verbose child? Not sure I was able to make it come across right.

I feel like I both failed and succeeded in that hospital wing scene. I was trying to make it confusing, at least a little bit, to try and capture her state of mind. But from your description, I don't think I made it the 'right' kind of confusing, if that makes sense?

Regardless, thank you so much for your insight and thoughts, I really appreciate it! And your 'overall' comment is so incredibly kind, thank you so much!

** High quality writing, internship theme that I haven't really seen done well before, nice characterisation and dialogue, the characters feel real in their emotions and motivations.

Keep the plot interesting (hopefully one diverging from canon) and the writing the same quality and this will be on the list of great fics in the fandom. I'm looking forward to updates :)
