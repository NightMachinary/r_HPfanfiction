There is something to be said about any story with a good reveal. Not merely a plot twist, but a true penny drop. When the knife is suddenly pressed to the protagonist's throat. When the love interest wasn't actually dead. When you finally realise, the game was rigged from the start and all you can do, despite your immeasurable power and wit, is run.

What fics truly capture that intense feeling of surprise, awe and desperation, that is the staple of the conspiracy thriller genre. If you know any please send me a link. Hell I don't even mind, although I'd prefer if they are, HP fics. Any fandom is fine.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-nine]] - a murder mystery, Percy Weasley-centric. Not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but it's the closest I can think of off the top of my head. Has several “oh /shit/” moments of realisation.
