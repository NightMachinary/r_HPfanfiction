Are there any good stories where Harry, just like what the title said, is a protective bug brother? I don't care if the the younger sibling is a sister or brother. Although I rather like it to be more than one siblings that he looks after while in Hogwarts.

I just absolutely LOVE IT when Harry has a cold and calculated personality when interacting with other people but warm and cuddly with his family. (If possible.)

And please, if possible, stories where James and Lily survived and NO bashings towards them. As in stories such as Potter Princesses. (Shame it's abandoned, would've been a lovely story.)

Doesn't matter if Harry is BWL or not.

(Sorry for the grammar mistakes in advance)


** linkffn(Time to put your Galleons where your mouth is) has this, although Harry's brothers are Regulus and Sirius.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  This starts somewhere in between chapter 37 and 38 of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” by J. K. Rowling. Harry just learnt about the Prophecy and wrecked Professor Dumbledore's office, but wounded members of the Dumbledore Army are still in the hospital wing of Hogwarts. He thought that the mysterious prophecy is the last surprise of that summer. How wrong one can get? One of those stories of “the summer between the fifth and sixth year, Harry gets his issues together”, but hopefully less tropey and with a twist.Response to my own challenge at Reddit.This is very much Work in Progress, so you can expect changes even to the published chapters. Comments, review, objections and accusations are all welcome.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

** linkffn(The Darkness Within by Kurinoone) has alive James and Lily, with a little brother Damien for Harry. Harry isn't exactly warm and cuddly with Damien, but he does care about him a lot. I would read this first fic, and the rest of the trilogy to understand the other 4 or so fics the author wrote in this universe, since it takes a while to develop that relationship between Harry and Damy.
