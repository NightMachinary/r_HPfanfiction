It is not too uncommon to see AU fics where there is some sort of magical internet. Similarly, it isn't too uncommon to see fics where some plucky muggleborn is talking about going to the moon and all the magicals are like 'bwuh? moon? go to light in sky? how?'. Both of these things are a little odd if you think about it.

The internet came to be in the muggle world as a result of numerous influences, none of which are likely to be replicable in the magical, primarily because wizards have a much lower population than muggles and it is relatively easy for them to move large volumes of data automatically. This is a sort of hindsight bias I think; now that we have the internet it has way more uses than it was originally intended for so it seems like such a necessary thing. A wizard doesn't need Amazon if they can owl order things. Facebook would be a hard sell to someone living in the 70's when the internet was forming; wizards might consider it totally unnecessary and incomprehensible given that they already have things like Flu and Pensieves. Technology follows evolutionary processes in much the same way that living things do: we have an initial need which is filled with a machine. Now that we have the machine, we find new uses for it, or ways to improve its functionality. For a magical internet to exist, wizards would have had to have an initial need which could be solved by very rapid and uniform transmission of data across continents, and that seems unlikely. If you could present it to them whole cloth, they'd likely adopt it easily enough, just like muggles have, but that would be a port from the muggle world to the wizarding world, not something that wizards invented themselves.

To draw it back to the moon point: I am looking for fics where wizards aren't just shabbily copying muggles with things like the wizarding wireless, but actually invented things themselves because their needs and abilities were very different. For instance, a fic where after the statute of secrecy was passed, a large group of wizards moved to the dark side of the Moon, because they figured that would be easier than constantly hiding their magic. Fics where, because they have magic, the solutions to problems they came up with were different, and even the problems they solved were different. Who needs airplanes when you have enchanted sailboats that can go around the world in a few hours? Why invent cruise ships when you have teleporting hotels? Who needs a centrifuge when you have a gravitational amplification chamber?

Anybody got any fics where this occurs? Where wizards don't just have knockoff muggle things, but have things that are distinctly wizard?


** xerosis by Batsutousai has the plot of the wizards moving to the dark side of the moon to escape the muggles.

*** Yeah, that particular option, move to the moon, occurs every once in a while. But when it does, it generally happens as a much delayed response to something muggles did, which is sort of what I'm angling at here. Wizards are always portrayed as being very passive, and to a certain extent that might be true given their society seems to move at a much slower pace than muggle, but there still should be some things that wizards are doing on their own, for their own reasons. I remember xerosis (faintly, its been a while) and the move to the moon was done as part of the Blood War. I would love to see a fic where, maybe that was like a big part of Third Year or something, Harry learning that he joined the wizarding world at an interesting time because the Magical world has been realizing its going to be harder and harder to hide from muggles on earth and they have plans in motion to just, move everything that have been in the works for years and are now coming to fruition. They want an entirely magical planet, and they're going to get one, and while muggles are a factor in consideration, this is a big innovation that wizards are doing on their own for the most part.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.
