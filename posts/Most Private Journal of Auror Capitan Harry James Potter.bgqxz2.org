After a lot of searching an a half remembered scene I finally found the name of a story I have been trying to remember for week. "Most Private Journal of Auror Capitan Harry James Potter".

My current issue is I can't find it. It was on Seel'vor Yahoo group at one point but not anymore. Anyone know where I can find the PDF? Or is there a reason that it has vanished from the internet? I wouldn't think so I just remember it being a crack fic that was post hogwarts.
