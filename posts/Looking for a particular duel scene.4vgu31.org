I've recently read a fic which contained an exhibition between a well trained Harry and Snape(maybe?). This powerful!Harry is asked to duel in class, and enjoys it, with his opponent getting increasingly angry that he cannot beat him. The spells exchanged continue to escalate, with Harry always being the second to escalate... Until the opponent users Unforgivables... And then this Harry goes into full soldier move and takes them down with no quarter, until Dumbeldore stops him... Needless to say, Harry is less than pleased with the interruption.


** Reminds me of the honor duel between Harry and Draco in linkffn(What We're Fighting For by James Spookie).

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
