Most stories on fanfiction.net have different numbers of favorites and follows. Some have more of one, and some have more of the other. What makes you, as a reader, choose to do one over the other? Do some of you only favorite, or only follow? Personally, I rarely follow fics, because I don't like getting alerts to my email. I'm interested to know what other people do.


** Pretty much every story that isn't finished by the time I get there I follow, but if I liked it and it's finished I favourite.

Unless its /really/ good then I'll favourite while it's in progress.

But honestly whenever I look for a good story to reread I'll go search through both lists so it's not like I only ever go back to favourited stories. I do like getting email notifications, but that's probably because it's on a super old email account that pretty much only gets FanFiction emails.

** I favorite stories that are both well-written and enjoyable. In other words, stories that I'm proud to say that I've enjoyed.

My follow list consists of guilty pleasure stories, stories that I've enjoyed but are objectively bad. Basically, stories that I'm not proud of, and so I place them in my follow list, which no one can see except me.

I turn off alerts for follows, since I don't use follows for that purpose. WIP stories that I'm truly interested in are on my favorite list already, and I check them often enough to not miss any new updates.

** If it's a story that looks like I'll want to read it, but isn't complete, I'll follow it. I generally don't read works in progress. When I get an update email, I'll go see if it's complete. If it is, it gets unfollowed and put into my "to read" bookmark folder.

If I read a story and enjoyed it, and think it's worth either rereading eventually or recommending to someone else, it'll get added to my favorites.

For some authors, I'll automatically follow one of their stories even if it might not be my thing because I enjoy the author's work. It'll still get unfollowed when it's complete, but it'll still only get added to my favorites if I thought it was good.

Follows are for only my benefit, favorites are for all of us :)

** I favourite when it's a completed story, follow when it's one that I particularly like but isn't finished.

** I favorite more than I follow. The latter is done in case of WIPs that I really, really like. I'm willing to tolerate email clutter for those.

** Well, I use AO3, so kudos, subscribe, or bookmark for me.

Kudos - when I liked it or thought it was well written, but it didn't make much of an emotional impression on me. If it's incomplete, I most likely won't return to read the rest after it's finished.

Subscribe - when I loved it but it's incomplete. This says little about its quality (although I'm not very likely to love a story that's poorly executed), and a lot about my emotional reaction. It will only move to my bookmarks if I still love it when it's finished.

Bookmark - same as above, except it's already complete and I loved the whole thing.

** If I'm reading something and it's a WIP and I want to continue reading when there's an update, then I'll follow.

If it's something I would recommend to others to read, then I favourite.

Since my favourites list is public, I'm generally more picky with it. I'll follow guilty pleasure things.

** I have an email just for accounts I have set up on the Internet, and I don't get notifications for that particular account on my iPad, so I'm fine with email alerts.

I favourite when I really, really adore a fic, almost always it will be completed. Back when I first started reading fanfic, I used to fav any fic I finished, just so I know I had read it. When I finally created a doc dedicated to read fics, I switched over to favouriting actual favourites.

I follow anything that is a WIP and I'd like to read. I'll even follow fics that say they are on an indefinite hiatus or abandoned... Because you never know.

** I use favourites to bookmark stories I want to read later, since I usually find several stories at once and don't want to leave them open until I'm up-to-date on them. I follow in-progress stories I want to keep reading, and I add finished stories I like to a community I made for that purpose.

** I don't. In all my years of reading Fanfiction, I've genuinely never followed or favorited a single fic.
