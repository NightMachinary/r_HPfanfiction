** Just to be clear you're looking for harry/Amelia bones fics? I've got 2 for you. Neither are complete but they're both really good. Retrograde and double back. Both are time travel fics one with harry going back just after his trial in ootp to 1972 I think it was. the other with adult harry getting sent back to 1991 and finding a way to take little harry in.

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.

** This is tagged discussion and you seem to be asking the community as to our thoughts on the pairing, not recommendations.

Assuming I'm right, my thoughts are that there is an age difference that makes the pairing implausible, short of contrivances such as time travel, skipping ahead a few decades, etc.

Edit: We also know little of the character so even if there wasn't an age difference, I'm not sure there is much to discuss.

*** She was mostly Mary-Sue in almost all fics. As soon as she learned about Harry Potter treatment and/or Voldemort was still alive, she turns on god mode amd everything fell in her place.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.
