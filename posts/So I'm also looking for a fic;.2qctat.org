I'm looking for a specific fic that I can't remember the name of. Some details;

- Set in the summer of fourth-sixth year
- Harry stayed in Knockturn Alley
- Lived in a brothel (didn't sleep with anyone iirc, he thought it was an inn)
- He worked at an apothecary
- He was Dark, but not dark or evil.
- Some things he learned was how to light a candle by blowing on it or whistle up fairies (not 100% sure on the second).
- He had a tattoo that only others with a similar type of tattoo (and maybe Mad-Eye?) could see.

Thats about what I remember, hopefully it's enough to jog someones memory, as I've had no luck.

*** This isn't the fic I'm looking for, I'm afraid. I'll give it a look-see though.

** Did it involve a library you needed a certain token embedded in your skin to access, talking to Draco Malfoy in that library a few times, and gaining the ability to alter his appearance slightly from some sort of inheritance ritual at Gringotts? Was known as something something Peverell when using the altered appearance?

If so, I've read that one a while back. I haven't found it yet, but I'll keep looking.
