Now, we've all read and sighed tiredly whenever Ron doesn't end up friends with Harry and starts griping about how such a slight is a sign of obvious evil and that Ron deserves to be rich and famous and blah blah blah, and worse he's a moron so he just spends all his time whining or doing some other stupid pointless lashing out. Often Ron's eating habits will be further lambasted, his chess skill will be disregarded or denigrated, and he will never engage in any real self reflection or in any way try to improve his situation.

Lame.

I want a genuinely Evil Ron. I want a Ron that bends his strategist's mind towards diabolical ends, who acts like a proper Slytherin and plots and cheats for his ambitions, who gets over himself enough to get into the nitty gritty of trying to ruin someone's life for the crime of not being his friend. I want Ron to pursue the Dark with the same blind fervor he once pursued the Light. I want pain and drama and genuine human emotion.

Anyone got something like that?


** Well, it's not a perfect fit, but the Ron in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/26/The-random-craziness-file][chapter 26 of darklooshkin's "The Random Craziness File"]] is willing to get his "friends" murdered for profit.

** Actually, Prince of Slytherin has an entire year devoted to an evil Ron. I don't want to spoil it too much here, but Ron's second year is full of clever scheming. He's possessed by Tom Riddle, but the manipulations he does are still clearly Ron, and very clever in their own way.

  On the night of Halloween 1981, Harry Potter vanished for eight years, reappearing at a Muggle orphanage with no recollection of his past. The deck stacked heavily against him, Harry arrives at Hogwarts, his past the key to the present's brewing storm.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** And Ron's not a blood supremacist, so if his goals coincide with hers, this is actually plausible. Especially if she sees him actually getting things done in contrast to the light side that waits complacently until forced into action.

*** I have always been of the opinion that Purity of Desire is something to be greatly admired. Even if your goal is evil, to pursue it with fervor and devotion is a thing of grace and beauty in and of itself.

Although Ron is a ginger, which kind of kills the hotness angle for me.
