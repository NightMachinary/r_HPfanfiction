I read a Hermione/Fred fanfiction a couple weeks ago in which Hermione was sorted into Slytherin (which I can't find anymore, so if someone knows it?) and I'd like to read more Hermione in Slytherin. I'm open to absolutely everything.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** u/turbinicarpus:
#+begin_quote
  I read a Hermione/Fred fanfiction a couple weeks ago in which Hermione was sorted into Slytherin (which I can't find anymore, so if someone knows it?)
#+end_quote

There's linkffn(11568740) *Edit: Fixed link.*, which 'ships her with both Fred and George. It has some interesting ideas (like having her start Hogwarts a year early due to a bluff by her parents and her almost being of the right age). On the other hand, it has some issues. Here's a criticism of it I posted on a different forum:

#+begin_quote
  In a nutshell, it's not as inane and poorly thought-out as /Green Girl/, for example, but I still get the sense that the author doesn't really want think about the non-romance aspects of the fic, and spends as little time thinking them through as possible, focusing instead on just banging out drama. For example, it doesn't look like the author can keep characters' relative skill levels straight, and often muddles the social dynamics that would result from Hermione matriculating a full year before Harry and Draco. Also, it does Stations of Canon when they not only don't make sense but don't have any point to them. For example, Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up confronting the Troll; but because of the changes, Harry and Ron no longer had any motivation to leave to search for anyone to run into the Troll, and Hermione just follows them along; and there are no consequences whatsoever to the encounter that last past the end of the next chapter. Combat scenes tend to be awkward and feel essentially turn-based.

  I increasingly think that slow-burn romance fic writers who want to incorporate a nontrivial plot and action should get a beta reader who has little interest in romance but can nitpick non-romatic aspects of characterizaiton and the action/adventure parts, including keeping track of who can beat whom up. They don't get veto power, but at least they'd point out the issues.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?
