I'm not going to lie. I'm kind of a sucker for Harry raising Tom. I've read Boy Who Lived and Altered Destinies and am looking for some more. What other good fics fit this?


** Linkffn(Tom Marvolo Riddle Potter by SisterDear)

Lots of fluff, writing is tolerable, fits your criteria.

Doubting Thomas by AzarDarkstar is a one shot of Tom raised by Luna that I highly recommend.

  When Voldemort is defeated, the fragment of his soul still stuck in Harry drags the Boy Who Lived with it through time in search of another, complete version of itself. A time travel, Harry adopts Tom Riddle story.
