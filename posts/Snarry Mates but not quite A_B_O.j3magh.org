:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking for a fic on ao3. Here's the lowdown:

Rated E

A/B/O or mates

Severus has to “present” for any alphas in the area and has been ignored/rejected every time.

He feels humiliated each time until one day he catches a scent of a powerful alpha (Harry)

Harry was waiting for his mate (Severus) rejecting all others he scented

Please help bc I cannot find it!
