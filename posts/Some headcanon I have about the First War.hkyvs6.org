These are all fanfic ideas, but I don't have the mental capacity to write any of them right now, so thought I'd share them here. If you want to take one and write a fic, please please do and then link it for me.

If you can't tell, I'm absolute trash for tragic romance pairings.

Edit: 0.5) James Potter definitely wore matching fleece pajamas to bed. They were definitely always of ugly, festive print. Or paisley. Sirius, of course, slept without a top on. üôÉ

1) Gideon Prewett's watch and Shell Cottage:

After the deaths of the Prewett twins, Fabian's watch was returned to Molly, but Gideon's wasn't. It was given to his wife instead. He and his wife lived at Shell Cottage, and after Gideon's death, she couldn't handle staying in Britain and went abroad. Of course, that left Shell Cottage free for the Weasley children to visit over the summers. When Bill gets married, this aunt by marriage gave him and Fleur the cottage as a wedding gift.

2) The source of Rabastan Lestrange's mania

I'd like to think he was more of a Lucius Malfoy in his youth, and like Lucius, fell in love with a perfectly respectable pureblood girl. Unfortunately, she was naive about the muggle world and excessively lively and curious. One night, she sneaks out to go to a muggle bar, and a group of muggle men drug her and rape her. (A wand doesn't stop you getting roofied.) She kills herself, and Rabastan goes mad, deciding that muggles are a scourge upon the earth.

Lol I know there is zero hint of this possibility in canon, but I like to give people reasons for their psychopathy when I can.

2.5) While we're on the subject of Lestranges, I think Bellatrix was definitely the fanatic one in her marriage to Rodolphus. In fact, I like the idea that Rodolphus was wildly in love with Bellatrix, and that's why he started down the path of madness. There's already a [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12847562/1/Roses-and-Thorns][fic]] written about this. It's really good, true to canon and true to characterizations. Highly recommend.

3) Andromeda really tried to give Sirius a trial

This is pushing it, but I just can't see Sirius calling her his favorite cousin if she didn't understand him on some level. I think she kept on insisting they give him a trial in the first weeks following his imprisonment, but was HIGHLY discouraged from it by everybody, including Dumbledore, especially considering who her relations were. She had a child, and couldn't afford to bring ministry suspicions on herself and her family. Eventually, she gave up, and as everyone (including Lupin) we're convinced of his guilt, she became no longer sure of his innocence.

4) Lily's parents

I think Lily sort of pulled a Hermione and sent her parents out of the country during the war. Obviously she didn't erase their memories, but I like to think she sent them on a long vacation to the US. (Maybe they played it off as a gift from James' family.) Maybe they died in a car crash while there, and it's another reason Petunia resents Lily.

5) Kingsley Shacklebolt and Marlene McKinnon

Why was Kingsley so adept with muggle clothing? Because he was best friends with muggleborn Marlene McKinnon at Hogwarts. In a familial situation similar to Harry's, Kingsley would spend the holidays with the McKinnon family, which consisted of muggle parents and a whole bunch of siblings, all wizards. Can't imagine having his entire surrogate family wiped out at once was a good time in Kingsley's life.


** I have a similar thing about Lily's parents.

I think at least one of them (no idea which one, but I'll say Mum...let's call her Violet) died while the war was going on, and Petunia was left to do all the arrangements because Lily (first actively fighting, then being in hiding) wasn't able to help. Being left to mourn your Mum alone, plan a funeral etc when your sister

a) isn't there to help and

b) won't tell you WHY she's not helping? If you ask, she either doesn't respond at all or brushes you off with something that's blatantly not true, but you have no mechanism to find out what's really going on?

That's grounds for some bitterness. She's been sucked into a whole other world and a whole other life where Petunia can't follow her, and she can't or won't come back out even for this.

I think the other parent (Dad) died while Lily was still at school, so Petunia had probably just left...but Harry Evans died from something wizards can treat, but Muggles can't. Imagine the fury of knowing Dad COULD have lived with the right magical help, but that help wasn't going to be allowed because he's ‚Äújust a Muggle‚Äù and not special enough.
