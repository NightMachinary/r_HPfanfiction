Writing my fic about Tom Riddle's escape from the diary for NaNoWriMo has led me to an interesting question. If I understand the complaints correctly, it's referred to as 'hat-tipping' when everything just happens to go right for the hero... so: what are interesting, amusing, plausible, or even just the oft forgotten fundamental ways in which things could go wrong for someone who is for all intents and purposes a 16 year old displaced about fifty years into the future? Or for any HPverse character going about their lives in canon?

Also, am I just exceptionally bad at passing the are you human tests? or is it supposed to /always/ take 2 tries?


** Step 1: Create an antagonist.

Step 2: Give your antagonist a goal which is not good for your main character.

Step 3: Make your antagonist be very good at pursuing that goal.

Hey presto, you've got conflict.

*** This is come of the best advice you can possibly get. It's also important that the antagonist wins throughout the story. The antagonist should be better than the protagonist, or there's no sense of actual accomplishment from the character in the story.

It should seem to the readers that the antagonist could actually come out on top. Otherwise stories come off too much as waiting around for the protagonist to win.

** I think 'hat-tipping' is the idea that the author is such a fan of manners and chivalry that they have the main character act like a Victorian romance novel escapee. Also expecting that the excess of manners will be seen as adorable by blushing nymphettes and intimidating dowagers alike is part of the crime.

On the Murphy's law suggestions... a temporally-displaced Tom isn't likely to try fitting in using funky modern lingo. That said, any time you want to throw some wrenches at the character, try thinking about what would happen if Peter Pettigrew or Gollum or some other reprehensible subhuman character were in this position, then feel free to think up painful and humiliating things for Peter to suffer.

** So I didn't read your fic (feel free to post a link!) but I can think of a few things that could wrong for Tom:

- someone recognises him. An old classmate (who might blackmail him), or Slughorn (who might panic and run straight to Dumbledore or Amelia Bones, or send out a warning to his old Slug Club alumni to protect them), or Hagrid, who tells Dumbledore, or even a random muggle from Little Hangleton who notes his ridiculously striking resemblance to the old Tom Riddle Sr (he might ask Tom about it, or he might go back to LH and gossip about old Tom Riddle's bastard son having a kid, with who knows what repercussions!)

- his complete lack of knowledge of common events for the past however many years gets him in trouble. I'm sure a smart guy like Tom looked up major events, but I mean little things, like Star Wars, or a particularly amazing quidditch World Cup accident that literally everyone knows about.

- his old-timey speech gets him noticed. Maybe he uses a few slang words which were particular to Hogwarts students when he was there, but which fell out of use and was forgotten decades ago.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10803241/1/Patchwork-Souls-Loose-Threads][What I have so far]]

For reference, its August between Harry's second and third year. Story follows a Tom Riddle that escaped from the diary. Prior to his escape he'd spoken with a number of the main characters, but the person that died that he might live was Lockhart... Who's wand he promptly stole.

<Edit> I added in my rough draft of Tom's time alone in the diary. I'm pretty sure there's a variety of little errors in both.

**** While there are a few typos and missed words here and there, this looks /great/! Tom's internal dialogue is interesting and flows well, and I really liked the diary time skips.

As for the whole Saint Murphy things, I think it would work very well for your Tom if he did have a string of everything going right. He gets overconfident (one of canon Riddle's flaws) and then something comes back to bite him in the ass.

***** Yeah... one of my points of internal debate is whether I want to show anything that goes on outside of Tom's field of vision or not. Do I let the readers know that Dumbledore is suspicious and has moody tailing Tom? Or do people only find that out later when Tom notices?

Is it more interesting to be blindsided along with Tom? Or to know that things aren't always going nearly as well as he assumes they are?

Also is it just me, or is it somewhat depressing that Harry agreeing to live with someone he just met is not only in character, but like, directly canon?

****** Sorry to enter this discussion late, but I'm a firm believer that keeping the scope minimized can only help. Chekov said that anything that is not relevant to the story should be removed. Once you broaden the scope too much, you are at risk of ruining the potency of the conflict.

You should write notes for yourself (in a timeline format), but only make people understand what happened when it is relevant (Scabbers is actually Pettigrew! Harry's visions were a trap! Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him!). It creates a lot of drama, and makes people understand that the scope of things is much larger than what you present without too much exposition. It's a literary trick, but a surprisingly efficient one.

******* That's an excellent point. Particularly since I want to come close to the feel of canon which as your provided examples point out, did that a lot.

** - Advances in law enforcement. I'm sure he got away with underage magic in his time, but the entire first war happened and the Aurors probably had to up their game.
- Records. There are magical records of every magical child in the ministry. The moment someone asks him to identify himself it won't stand up to scrutiny.
- Current events would be lost on him. He'd have some serious problems in idle chatter. This may not seem like much, but he was charismatic and charming, and this would quickly expose him as odd. That's attention he doesn't need.
- His face is known. Not only by Slughorn and Dumbledore, but by everyone who followed him in the first war and wouldn't be partial to his return because now they have too much to lose.
- The Dark Mark possibly wouldn't work for him. While Voldemort marked his followers, his sixteen year old self didn't.
- Getting money may not be simple when his knowledge of magic is so outdated, and labor laws probably banning children from working in the magical world (not an underage waiter or clerk in canon, even during summer).
- Where is his wand?! No one knows, except possibly Pettigrew. And would Pettigrew reveal himself to a sixteen year old? Would Ollivander supply him with a new one, knowing full well who he is?
- What is the source of his power? He was brilliant but so are Dumbledore, Hermione, and Snape. While possibly exceptionally powerful, it makes more sense that he furthered his power by decades of delving into the dark arts which he hadn't done to a great extent at sixteen.
- spirit!Voldemort is still out there. And he won't like the competition or sharing power... or could possibly take over his body if he ever finds him.
- The Weasley twins have the map, and suddenly a new name appears. So many ways this can go either amusingly or horribly wrong for him.

In short, there are plenty of ways things can go horribly wrong... from the most mundane things ("Weird Sisters? Are they Dark Ladies?") to the most horrible (spirit!Voldemort is hunting him down and can sense him anywhere not secret-kept, forcing him to live on the run from the ministry who send half the Auror force whenever he does magic, the Order is sniffing out his hideouts, and himself without a source of income and with outdated magical knowledge - while all his old supporters try and kill him on the spot because their lives are now comfortable and war is something they don't want).
