I know many don't like Rowling's magical worlds in other countries for a variety of reasons. So I was curious. How do you envision the magical worlds of other countries? It can be one that doesn't officially have a magical world. Or it can be one that does but you see it differently. If you have ideas of britians magical world being significantly different than what it is in HP thats fine to talk about. But only if it is super different. Im just curious to see the ideas different people have.

*** I also love the idea of wands being a european thing

I read in some fic that european wizards have more surface level magic which is why its so wand based and have a large range of types of magic they learn. While those from certain asian countries ( in this case japan) focus on a certain area of magic the student is particularily adept at and learn that branch on a much deeper level than most european wizards they become experts at it and its largely wandless and wordless. But just for that one branch of magic rathet than a wide array. So they more resemble benders from Avatar than wizards from HP.

And thats been my headcanon ever since

I also love the idea of philosophy influencing how magic is practiced and what magic is practiced.

**** Wands are also really really good. Could be the reason why Europeans pretty much conquered the entire world once. Until the locals got their hands on wands too, and got the ability to tell the Europeans to leave.

****** Statute of Secrecy (1680) was probably around peak power of magical Europe, so it was not just for the safety of wizards (gunpowder just got popular and few wizards can cast a shield charm in less time than it takes to pull a trigger) but also to preserve the status quo of the European magical governments being effective world leaders.

******* You know, in RL it took a massive multicontinental war to create a world government and even then LoN was weak and ineffective. Rowling says that the Statute of Secrecy was created by the ICW in 1680 as a response to the Salem witch trials but I honestly just don't see it happening on a global scale, considering the politics of the time. MAYBE if ICW was just a European organization, but even that seems a bit of a stretch. Most RL European countries from the 1680s don't even exist anymore.

Of course, having an ICW to create a Statue of Secrecy implies that the Wizards had separate nations from the muggles before they went into hiding. I find it far more likely that the muggle Kings and Emperors of the time all signed a treaty to due to some kind of widespread societal unrest, or that European wizards independently went into hiding during the Spanish inquisition.

** I've always thought, just because the muggles draw national borders in a certain way, that doesn't mean that the wizards do, too. In my mind, North America is still a patchwork of competing wizarding nations, the biggest of which are the Union, Louisiana, and the Aztec Empire. A lot of Native Shamans took their tribesmen and disappeared into hidden pocket dimensions like Diagon Ally (but with more countryside and less shops) when the European wizards started invading, but the Aztecs are still fairly conspicuous and a force to be reckoned with. Hawai'i was still forcibly annexed into the United States, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaumualii][Kaumualiʻi]] managed to escape [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamehameha_I][Kamehameha]] with the help of the Kahunas loyal to him. They managed to hide all but two of the islands that he ruled.

*** OMG yes about Hawai'i!!! I'm kanaka maoli, which is Native Hawai'ian and we always get left out. Reckon theres still ongoing wars between Kamehameha's magical descendants and Kaumuali'I's? Personally I like to think with European invasion even magical kanaka joined together. I also could see the magical kanaka population going to Niihau, that's why the legend of the 'Forbidden Island' emerged. But I also met there's a magical area like Diagon Alley in Honolulu. Just north of the main drag in Waikiki, Kalakaua Dr., off of Kuhio Dr (its the shady street in Waikiki) is the entrance. The Honolulu magical area has more muggle born and also magical from China, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Samoa, etc. all the backgrounds of "local" muggles. As such there's a distinct local magical culture that's really different than full on native kanaka magical culture, just like with muggles.

**** I'm as white as they come, but I like to be inclusive.

I was actually thinking, for Hawai'i that there was more than 8 islands originally and that Kaumuali'i was aliʻi nui of four or five islands. He lost Kauaʻi entirely. Niʻihau became some kind of secret entrance or maybe a diplomatic embassy, and that's why so few people are allowed to visit.

Kaumuali'i was probably a muggle (? no-mag? whatever) himself. His descendants still rule over all of the kanaka, both magic and muggle, that live on their hidden islands. They aren't in any wars at the moment, but you can bet they had one with Japan after they were invaded during WW2.

But I love the idea of a mixed culture magical district in Honolulu! Do you reckon they're part of the Union or are they their own thing? Either way, it's got to have a unique blended culture with both magic and muggle influences from all over the place.

***** That's so great you mention aili'i apparently my ohana was once aili'i of Kaua'i! A long way to poverty stricken in Waian'ae (the Compton of Hawai'i). I can kind of see what you're suggesting.

I think in the days of Kamehameha and Kaumial'i muggles and magicals. Kahuna and hunas, witches and wizards, worked together. Magic was rejected by the mālie, or mundane. It wasn't until European contact in the very late 18th, mostly into the 19th centuries. The nonohi or royalty were supported by strong kileas, both kahuna and hunas until the European intervention.

The royal ohana became Christian. All tradition practices from kilea to the sacred hula were banned. But some kanaka both mālie and kilea, fled to the isolated islands. Ni'ihau became the center of this traditional culture, with the top kilea and aili'i. The culture expanded to Kahoolawe, Kau'ula, Lehau, Molokini and Nihao. Some young people who grew up here might go to Magical Honolulu. Other kanaka from the mālie islands like O'ahu or the Big Island, come seek their roots here.

As far as ICW, Magical Honolulu is a very active participant. The Aupuni Mōʻī o Hawaiʻi, the name of the name of Hawai'ian kingdom prior to the illegal deposition of the Queen by the US, is the name the magical Hawai'Ian sovereign community claims today. They believe they are the natural and uninterrupted continuation of the original Hawai'i where mundane and magical kanaka worked side by side.

..... WOW I spent a lot of time thinking about this LOL

** There was a fic I read awhile back (can't remember the title, sorry) that had America as a cultural paradise being a Pureblood trap for immigrant Muggleborn so they could take slaves. It wasn't something I particularly adopted as a headcanon or anything, but it was an interesting direction to take it.

I imagine Magical China being significantly centralised and still influenced by old Imperial culture and practices. Magicals there would probably be raised within a monastic order-like setting (both as part of an official 'Imperial Court' type faction and as part of rural sects) and most likely relate magical practices to animals in the same vein as their martial arts.

I remember someone had a minor Chinese character from a rural group of assassin/mercenary types that'd retreated into a hidden place I forget the name of that came off a lot like the Camonna Tong from Morrowind.

** I have a kinda odd one for the U.S. where there are four main systems. Especially for schools.

The east coast has the traditional European system but more removed from muggles like in fantastic beasts (due to the Salem trials).

Then there is the midwest/plains area that has many small magical hubs like hogsmede, but is less strict than the east coast.

Then there is the west coast which was largely developed in opposition to the strictness of the east coast and is near completely integrated with the muggle world, where students have both a muggle and a wizarding education (as a sort of home tutoring or after school lessons and rigorous summer school). The west coast and east coast are perpetually at odds.

Finally there is the wizards of the american south, where they group up in covens and act as a magical nomadic RV caravan and is responsible for many crazy redneck stories that muggles would see in the news.

*** What about the Southwest and Mountain West? Like NV, AZ, UT, MT, CO, WY, etc. I can see it's mostly controlled by magical Native American tribes. UT might be different, maybe all the magical left because of the Mormon immigrants and their violence. Maybe in the mountains theres small areas of homeschooled mostly European witches and wizards, the descendants of trappers and miners. There's probably a lot of overlap and interaction with Native tribes but they still hold onto some European roots and ideas about education.

**** That would make sense. I admit I'm least familiar with those areas so I didn't think about it. Indigenous peoples would be complicated because they would have a unique relationship with the statute of secrecy since the statute happened before (or about the same time as) Native Americans entered the history of western civilization.

***** That's okay. I'm half Native and grew up on Western CO and have lived in southeast UT and AZ. I've also spent a lot of time in MT and WY.

While the muggle Natives fell to Europeans I like to think the magical Natives were able to stand up to the European magicals, thus preserving their original trbanal areas for magicals using traditional cultural approaches. Very matrilineal and nature, spirit and animal based. For more modern young magicals or no-maj borns, major cities like Denver and Phoenix have magical areas like Diagon Alley. I like to think they're based off 19th century western areas because that's when they formed making them unique from the no maj city.

I can see UT outside some very hidden Native magical tribes in the SE like in Canyonlands and down at the Four Corners being non existant because of how vehement the early Mormon settlers were against magic which they perceived as being from the devil. They retained northern UT and the SLC/Wasatch Front while magical Natives kept traditional practices hidden, something their no maj brethren couldn't succeed in.

** I think there's a ton of ways to do so in an interesting way.

One that I personally enjoy thinking through is with older national/political entities still around. For example in Europe, having the main powers be Britain, Revolutionary France, and Rome/Byzantium would make for a fun dynamic, with the rest of it being more split up like at the time of the statute of secrecy and some further developments (eg, lots of German principalities, some French satellite republics in Italy, some older Italian states, etc). Different forms of governments, rivalries, etc, with a lot of it revolving around the French Revolution in this version of it.

For the rest of the world, I like having more variation as well, with different (and equally powerful, if in different ways) schools of magics and ways to use magic. I just haven't fleshed it out in my mind as much as the political one in Europe ;)

*** Ooh i like that idea always love the mythical or hidden cities idea for magical world. Do you see the outside world having a influence for the magical world after they became a hidden city?

Like for example. In britain it looks like wizarding world asthetics arent very effected by the muggle world. It looks distinctively different. So its less likely the muggle world has a strong influence at least not the modern muggle world. While wizarding paris in the movies looks very similar to its muggle counterpart.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
