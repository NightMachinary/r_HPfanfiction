:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all,

So I'm looking for an older fix that I haven't been able to find anywhere. Hoping someone else knows what it is so here it goes.

The fic in question I believe is post Voldemort, by how many years idk. But in the fic, FemHarry (henceforth referred to as Harriet, even though I don't think that's her name) is training for her masteries. I believe she went for charms and dueling? I don't remember much, however I do remember that Deadpool makes an appearance later on in the fic, idk if it was a crossover or just Deadpool breaking the dimensional fourth wall. Harriet also visits the icw I think. She also boards with other people in Canada while doing her mastery.

Peace out, JJ

#+begin_quote
  Rose travels the world in an effort to get away from Britain and its remaining Death Eater problems. Through her journey, she encounters a number of remarkable individuals. Will not be strictly Avengers. Some OCs. Pairings finalized. Fem!Harry M because it mentions adult things. No lemons.
