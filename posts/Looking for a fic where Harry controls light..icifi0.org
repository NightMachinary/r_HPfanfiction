I've seen fics where he controls darkness, fire, every element you can think of, but for some reason I can't find any that have him controlling light.


** Can you please give me some good fics where Harry controls an element?

** Wait, what does that mean? As in he can just generate photons whenever he feels like it? He's a human laser pointer? Can he just kill Voldemort with an extra high dose of radiation? Could he transmit his own radio signals to communicate? Where would he get this power?

I really hope you find what you're looking for cause I'm already interested in seeing that played with

** I've never found an elemental Harry fic that's completed however linkffn(Harry Potter: Lord of Darkness) is a completed fic where Harry is a darkness elemental but it's not the major focus of the story. Linkffn(Triton) while not completed is the best proper Harry elemental fic I've ever read.
