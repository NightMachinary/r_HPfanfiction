I've recently read Unexpected by oeuvre24 on FF.net and I love it! Basically any fics where Draco and Hermione become friends and begin a relationship in HBP prompting Draco to take Dumbledore's protection in the Astronomy Tower, or before. Thanks!


** linkffn(7326932) has the premise of Draco's task, most is an AU take on HBP

** linkffn(Eccentric Order by itsraa) is heading in that general direction, though it hasn't been updated in a long time.

*Edit:* It looks like the story has been taken down. Too bad.

** Someone asked a similar question a couple of weeks ago so if you check old posts, maybe you'll get some more suggestions. This story is probably something along the lines of what you are looking for.

*I Spy* by gnrkrystle

Edit to add: Not quite exactly what you wanted. He takes Dumbledore's protection first in this story, then they become friends.
