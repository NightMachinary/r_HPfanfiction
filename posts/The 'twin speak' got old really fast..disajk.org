I-

don't know-

if anyone-

else-

agrees with-

me-

but reading-

multiple short lines-

spoken by two people-

to denote 'twin speak'-

isn't very clever-

anymore-

and hasn't-

been for-

a while!

​

Honestly, I get it. I do. Fred and George are twins, they're close, they like to annoy people but do people really think the 'we know what the other is going to say and we have to do this every time we open our mouths even in super important situations where we could get the information out a lot quicker if one of us kept our mouth shut and just let the information get out!' is the least bit creative anymore?

It's been a while since i've read the actual books or watched the films but I don't remember it being so prevalent in canon. It's quickly become a very annoying trope to me.


** They never really did twinspeak in the books. They would trade back in forth in conversation saying whole sentences, often breaking out into miniature conversations between themselves to comedic effect while speaking with someone else, but they never traded back and forth words in a sentence between them. They came across as funny, and so in sync with each other that others couldn't keep up, but never really telepathic in the fanfiction often portrays them. They disagreed just like regular people and they had two distinct personalities and thought processes. One was more cautious while the other more reckless and headstrong, (I can't remember which is which) traits that were best exemplified in the goblet of fire when they attempted to blackmail Batman, one of them cautiously advocating a more diplomatic approach, the other determined to get results no matter the cost. Although it is worth noting that they never seem to let anyone see them arguing, always presenting a united front as evidenced by the same dealing with bagman, in the twin who had previously been advocating caution proceeded to enact the blackmail without hesitation when it became clear that doing otherwise would not only arouse suspicion, but also present division between them.

*EDIT*: please switch out any and all occurrences of the name "Batman" with "Bagman". Thank you, and no I won't remove the mistake as its really funny.

** If you cut back and forth every other word, it's probably just bad writing. Or satire, sometimes it's satire. Or both.

It can be good, it can be annoying, it can be annoying for a good reason story-wise. But a lot of the bad examples come down to arbitrarily breaking lines mid-phrase in an attempt to mimic something you saw in a movie once without really understanding the characters or what they're up to.

The trick to doing it well is to remember why they're doing it.

Fred and George are Slythindors. They're also a beater team.

They make a habit of doing the twin-speak thing to drive people nuts, sure, but more because doing it all the time like a tired prank lulls everyone into assuming that they're just doing it to be annoying. Then they can relentlessly tag team and disorient people whenever they want someone to tell them things or agree to something.

It's less twin-speak than a weaponized comedy duo act, which lets them use ambush tactics to control conversations and get things they want, with "we're prankster twins thus it's a twin thing and probably just to be annoying" as a smoke screen.

There are lots of ways comedy duos can operate, whether you want to look at Abbott and Costello or Chinese crosstalk or Japanese tsukkomi acts. Trying to integrate this more instead of switching arbitrarily would make a whole lot of sense, especially if you had a multi-year fic which showed them exploring or improving at it over the course of several years, when they'd have been more arbitrary and inexperienced about it in third year. Or you could get a fun scene out of giving them books on nonmagical comedy duos, since so many fics like to do gift-choosing chapters.

It's still a twin thing, but that part is more about how it presents a united front against everyone else. Nobody can get between them if they're always obviously on the same team, to the extent that most people aren't even sure which one they're talking to, and if they force people to talk to them as a pair instead of one at a time.

But it's also equally significant to show when they're not doing it, instead of making it a kneejerk thing all the time. If you sneak off to make potions with them or something, they're probably both going to have questions, but they're more likely to take turns working and talking and in general be more relaxed about it than if they were putting on a performance in the Great Hall or trying to get you to spill your secrets.

** I totally, absolutely, vehemently, completely, utterly hate it.

It's cheap, a bitch to read, unnecessary, idiotic and overused.

I usually can forgive it, but it always grates on my nerves. They are their own people. I don't know if any of the authors met any twins in their lives for fuck's sake. It's obvious they didn't. Most twins are like Padma and Parvati, different interests, different life goals. Even if the Weasley twins were unnaturally close, they wouldn't speak that way.

It's just painful to read and serves no purpose, apart from proving the author is a douche.

EDIT:

P.S. It's mostly the parents that try to dress their twins the same way solely for the reason of not having an excuse on the fly for why they have different clothes and things. The overwhelming majority of twins are annoyed by that and hate each other and their parents just for that fact.

*** Older sibling of twins here. When they were growing up we met lots of other twins or relatives of twins (it comes up a lot in conversations with random strangers -- my sisters are /really/ identical) and my mum always asked them how they were raised and if there was advice they could give her.

The answers were insanely diverse.

We got a lot of: "our parents assumed we'd like the same stuff and bought everything in twos and we only ever played with each other since our parents used us as babysitters for each other and all wanted was just to get *away* from each other!"

But we also got a lot of: "we really enjoyed dressing the same and playing pranks on people by imitating each other and people kept trying to separate us and it was painful when they did!"

My sisters fall into both categories, ironically. The younger twin likes to match, but the older twin likes to differentiate. They hang out together a lot, and share a ton of interests, and sometimes finish each other's sentences, but they also drive each other nuts and bicker and have subtle personality differences.

I can see if there's a magical link between them due to their personalities being more similar than different as well as being twins they'd create a kind of twin speak that would be completely incomprehensible to anyone else. I mean, good grief, in my conversations with my siblings we almost never finished our own sentences, and we weren't twins or even the same personality! It kinda came with being in an insular large family.

It wouldn't sound like the bad examples seen so often in fanon and what the OP was complaining about, though. That's just lazy. It would likely be more like:

F: "Woah, did you see...?" G: "Oh yeah, we're totally gonna go get the... thing..." F: "Yup, the watchamacallit, definitely. You think he'll..?" G: "Naw, he's too, you know" F: "Yeah, you're right. What if we added in that other stuff from when Ginny-" G: "Oh! Right! That'll do the trick."

They might also supply each other's missing words (maybe one knows more about history, the other more about magic), and they fill in each other's blanks. It would give a feel kinda like what people are going after with the alternations.

**** Heh, your experiences are different than mine, that's possible and expected. Cultural differences, and environmental differences can shape things in ways we could not foresee. People are also unpredictable by nature. All the twins I've met in my, fairly long, life were usually resentful of their parents' expectations. They wanted to be their own people, not a part of a duo. But that's just trivia (fun though it is).

The issue of this thread is Fred and Georges' "twin-speak", which I find absolutely atrocious from a writing perspective. It's painful to read and serves no true purpose in most fanfictions, apart from irritating the reader. I could probably be more tolerant if it was actually a plot point, but it's very rarely that.

Molly was more interested in trying to tell them apart than make them similar, lol, which is also totally reasonable and realistic.

And I totally concur about the poorly done twin-speak, heartily. :)

** Twin speak is an actual thing in canon, there are loads of times when one of them cuts the other one across. However, it isn't as annoying as the fanfictions make it out to be, they're supposed to say an entire sentence rather than something incomplete (unless they're listing things).

#+begin_quote
  ‘Harry!' said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. ‘Simply splendid to see you, old boy --'

  ‘Marvellous,' said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in turn. ‘Absolutely spiffing.'

*** The difference between this and fanfiction is that in fanfiction, most authors just use about 10 lines of dialogue, with no intermittent narration about how they are saying things, what else is going on, etc.

The sentences are also split and cut off at reasonable points. It wouldn't make any sense if they'd said,

“Splendid to see-“

“You old boy-

“Marvellous. Simply-

“Spiffing.”

But unfortunately fanfics do it like that.

** I'll be honest, the first time I read someone complaining about twinspeak, I thought I would never be able to unsee it and most fics would be ruined for me forever.

But honestly, I kinda like it. It's overdone, sure, but if the line lengths are synced and they each get out a decent portion of a thought per line, then it's a kind of entertaining way of simulating the feeling of verbal whiplash that talking to the twins should evoke, as well as forcing amateur authors to do something interesting with sentence length and rhythm, which many of them barely bother to try, normally.

Either of the twins thinks faster than most of the cast, so when both of them are together it should feel like they're only bothering to give a truncated explanation so the rest of us /might/ catch what's going on while they pull a prank or blow something up. No one's supposed to be able to comfortably keep up with the twins unless they know what's going on beforehand. They're two brains in one, after all.

**** Not literally, unless you believe some fan theories about how magical twins work or you really preferred that supposedly-leaked manuscript for a twins-centric book from a few years ago.

But the twins have always been so much on the same wavelength that they operate a lot like one person. One's rarely seen without the other, they can finish each other's thoughts, and nobody can even tell who's Fred and who's George. It's not surprising that people would have trouble keeping up with that in a conversation, and twinspeak manages to give you that feeling of being slightly uncomfortable and out of your depth with a conversation purely through text.

“Oh, and we'll also need to borrow your girlfriend.”

Good, he hadn't objected to the theft, which meant he'd agreed. “Why not?”

“Because... Because she's a person, is why not. You can just ask her. I'm sure she'd love to help. She's no fan of Rowle. He called her a... a bad word.”

Twin-speak can be done well and in an enjoyable way. This is very rare. People have no idea how to use it, so they just spam the fuck out of it and think it works out. The twins shouldn't be using it every damn conversation, and they're never going to bounce back and forth many times in a row that way. I wouldn't say I know exactly how to use it, but I know that isn't it. That's what we usually get though, and dear god is it horrible to read in several different ways.

She goes into the best ways of doing twinspeak and how they actually do it in the books, and how best to not smack people in the face with it so it becomes annoying and irritating.

** I agree, I only use it when the Twins are purposely trying to confuse people, like if one of them were activating a prank and the Twin Speak was distracting others so they wouldn't notice. But it just gets tiring if they are CONSTANTLY doing it

** It's overdone, and it's badly done. If I wrote something, I'd do a ridiculous version of it. I think I remember a conversation in a Terry Pratchett (?) book where a clairvoyant witch consistently was ahead in a conversation. It was mind-boggling. It'd be fun to write the twins like that.

***** I don't know how you read (or anyone else really) but I tend to imagine what I read in my head and if I imagine different people each saying 3 words or so that really breaks the flow. Yes I can consciously ignore punctuation and line breaks for a while and just read the words as if they were written normally, but at that point you I have to wonder why it's written like that in the first place if I am supposed to just ignore it? Besides, I'm probably already 3 lines in by the time I realize that it's twinspeak, so I have to make the mental switch to ignore punctuation, go back three or so lines and read it again, so it still breaks my reading flow.

No probably not, but it still annoys me so I will comment when I see it mentioned even though I would not make a thread for it.

Maybe I should start writing fanfic, I seem to have a talent for abysmal writing and it's not like you need a plot when you have clichees.
