Doesnt matter what, as long as it is primarily Het, has a good plot and good writing overall. I just want quality fics. I dont mind smut or OP characters, angst, triggering content, etc. Throw any good fics at me please!


** - linkffn(11111990) ... tear jerky sad (Harry mourns dead Ginny), but really well written
- linkffn(9566537) ... probably the best Harry/Muggle-woman story
- I still like Northumbrian stories

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I am going to hit you with my favorite fics that revolve around a pairing (or at least they are important to it). A caveat though: these are not all the fics with good relationships depicted, but rather ones that are significant to the plot /and/ well written/memorable.

- linkffn(Contractual Invalidation): obligatory Harry/Daphne fic reference here, but this fic is one, if not the only one, that depicts a Harry/Slytherin relationship that depicts the Slytherin character in a human and reasonable way within canon (i.e. they may think blood supremacy is a thing, but its not just because of misinformation or power craving, and they don't just drop their beliefs because someone comes along who challenges their views).
- linkffn(Equal and Opposite): possibly the best example of a dark Harry relationship. Long story short, Harry meets himself (or herself I suppose) from another realm and it taints him.
- linkffn(Protection from Nargles): not much of a plot per se, but this fic is a what-if style story with Luna kissing Harry in OOTP instead of Cho. Fluffier than cotton candy, but there is something...cathartic about it that I admit is charming.
- linkffn(Delenda Est): possibly the only good/decent depiction of a Harry/Bellatrix relationship, involves a lot of time-travel, politicking, back-stabbing and plotting. If anything, the best part of this fic is that it embraces Bellatrix insanity and admits its not something that will ever really be gone.
- linkffn(gone was any trace of you): annerb has a writing quality that is difficult to explain precisely (maybe its her prose?), but she undeniably manages to hook you into every Harry/Ginny story even if you aren't a fan of the pairing. This one may be in my top ten oneshots in the fandom.

Thats it for now. Maybe more later.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

*** I really like “Protection from Nargles” (and its sequel “Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor”) ... I have never believed Hunna can be written but this (and surprisingly “The Accidental Animagus” by White_Squirrel) persuaded me that it is possible to be faithful to the Luna character and still make the pairing work.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2920229/1/]])

Has a female OC but a better written character than the majority of fanfics IMO. Biggest problem is the first 30 or so chapters and like 300k words was written 10+ years ago so those are lesser quality. It really started picking up around chapter 40 for me and the later chapters are especially great. The interactions between Harry/OC are among the best I've read in a fanfic particularly one that's an action fanfic first and foremost.

The author just started posting a Harry/Daphne story around 70k words, I'd say give that a shot and if you like the writing in that it's worth reading Eclipse of the Sky.

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, & Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Harry/OC (Being revised)
