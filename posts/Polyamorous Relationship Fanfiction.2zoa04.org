I've been looking/craving poly relationships with in the HP world. I suppose harem ones would be fine but I rather like the idea of just 3-4 people per relationship.

It doesn't seem to be the most popular thing to write about and I've found all I could personally find in the mean time.

Could anybody else recommend something?

Thanks!


** i have similar interests but found nothing - most fics that try doing that become either entourage fics, where MC just has a harem sort of hang around, or just a score listing of scenes "had sex with A then B, then C, than AB, then D, interlude for 40 pages of mansion/trunk description, sex with E, F, A, goblins waging holy war on Dumbledore for being a thief, sex with ABCD, Voldermort gets mentioned so we don't forget he actually exists in this story..."

I never realized until now how true this is. Why is it?

** What initially came to mind (aside from my own works) was [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4757373/1/Heart-s-Home][Heart's Home]] by Aealket

Description: After the final battle things are tense and Harry finds help in and old magic. Harry/Luna/Hermione

Rated: Fiction M - English - Romance/Friendship - Harry P., Luna L. - Chapters: 5 - Words: 79,175 - Reviews: 287 - Favs: 1,166 - Follows: 611 - Updated: May 22, 2010 - Published: Dec 31, 2008 - Status: Complete - id: 4757373

..which brings up the corollary thought: search for 'Harry Potter Lunar Harmony' and you'll get a number of Harry/Hermione/Luna fantasies. 'Flaming Nargles' I think is associated with Harry/Ginny/Luna trios.

[and really, any day you legitimately have cause to write 'flaming nargles' can't be a bad day]

** [[http://www.triofic.com/index.php][Table for Three]] The site is shutting down and transferring fic to AO3. You can check the fics out on their site, or AO3 (if they've finished transferring everything).

Also, check out [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Harry/Ron/Hermione][fanlore]].

** probably should add Firebird's Trilogy in here. First one is amazing, YMMV on the rest of the series though.

** Polyamorous relationship fics are my guilty pleasure. My OT3 is Draco/Harry/Hermione but unfortunately there isn't much out there featuring those three ficwise beyond drabbles. That said, I read a great series last night featuring them called [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/37166][Raging Sensation]].

Another beautifully written threesome story that I can recommend is [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=23170][Snow Turns the World Deaf]] (SS/HG/RL).

Edit to add: You can also check the HP section at Adult-fanficton.org. They have a [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/main.php?list=2003][threesomes/moresomes]] category.

** Okay, the one I've been enjoying a lot lately fits in in a weird way.

The main fic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10544835/1/The-Die][The Die]]) is just Hermione/Draco. But there's a scene at a cottage and Theo is there, and so basically the author has started a new fic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10747169/1/After-the-Sea][After the Sea) that branches off at Chapter 32 of the old fic that's Her]]mione/Draco/Theo. It's more a triad style fic, but kind of starts as Draco/Hermione & Theo/Hermione before starting to explore Draco/Theo's relationship. And I'm really enjoying it, because it felt kind of perfect in terms of it all coming together. It's still a WIP but it got updated like last week so the author is definitely still working on it. You technically don't need to read The Die (the author sums up the story at the beginning of After the Sea) but I feel like it would make more sense & add more depth to the characters, unless you don't want to read 30 odd chapters of Dramione.

**** Yay! So glad you enjoyed it. Hope you signed up for chapter alerts for After the Sea - new one today! They come out with pretty decent regularity which is nice because I generally hate WIPs.

** "Fixation, and other stories" by Elizabeth Culmer is excellent, albeit difficult to follow without mapping the chapters. HP/DM/GW is a really interesting ship.
