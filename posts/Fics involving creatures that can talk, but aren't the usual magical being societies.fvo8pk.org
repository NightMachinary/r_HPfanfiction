So, I'm on the hunt for fics involving non-Magical-Human creatures - this thread is specifically for anything that talks and is sapient, but *isn't* a Werewolf, Vampire, Veela, Goblin, Merfolk, Centaur, or Dragon. That could be Trolls (like that fic where Harry was raised by Trolls - again, don't remember the name), Acromantula (maybe Aragog features more heavily), or that Chimera from Rune Stone Path.

So, yes. Please. Any fics involving a society of creatures that *aren't* a Werewolf, Vampire, Veela, Goblin, Merfolk, Centaur, or Dragon that features as more than a footnote somewhere - they need to be a significant presence in the fic, please. I'm looking mainly for fics with culture and world building.

EDIT - I'm realising these may be a mite specific, so I'm opening them up to include any fics with characters that *aren't* a Werewolf, Vampire, Veela, Goblin, Merfolk, Centaur, or Dragon that are prominent in the plot.

Rune Stone Path - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path]]

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** Ummm maybe try linkffn(Outcast's Alley) I hope I did the link right....

This fic is finished but the sequel will probably never be....

*** Ah, yes. Hello again, Milo. You've recc'ed your fic to me before, and it's moving up the list to actively-reading about a dozen fics from now. I'm looking forward to it more and more as I hear more about it - it's been recc'ed for a lot of stuff since you put it on my radar originally. :)

***** Eh. No biggie. I don't pay much attention to Usernames either - they're almost impossible to remember unless I interact with the person regularly. I only remember yours because we talked before and it's on all the Bot-Links for Basilisk-Born. :D

Nio, huh? I look forward to seeing those interactions for myself. :)

I was trying to say that you enjoying writing those interactions is good, but I couldn't find a way of expanding on that point without sounding immensely patronising, so I'm leaving it at 'interaction fun, writing good /does cheesy finger gun motions/ cool beans'.

**** The creatures are not cannon, here's a description from the fic about a "bloodbeast"

"Bloodbeasts were half humanoid creatures that lumbered upright but easily went down on all fours, bounding along at great speeds. They often grew very big and this one was exceptionally so. Muscles bulged at its haunches and shoulders. Murderous red eyes peered out from its face, under peaked ears. Hair melted into fur at its neck, short and fuzzy around the upper torso and long and shaggy near the rear where a tail with a tuft on the end whipped back and forth. The claws where the crowning glory of the beast; they were large, shiny, and very impressive."

There are also "silents"

Most of them are just people with wings,Harry is one of "cursed" silents.
