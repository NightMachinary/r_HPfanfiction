Definitely read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12447494/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Adventure-of-the-Seventh-Safeguard][Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard]] by Charlotte Ann Kent if you're into well written mystery type of stories with a magical twist.

Basically, BBC Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (both are completely muggle) helped the trio find the horcruxes from the Deathly Hallows in a Conan Doyle detective style story. I don't want to spoil much, but there are other muggle â€˜aquatints' that help as well. (Plus, the author somehow incorporated helicopters... as amusing as it sounds.)

Don't let the first person POV style derail you from reading the story. This is one of the rare stories that was actually written like an art form. When I say it's like a Conan Doyle book, I really meant it. The suspense and mystery is all there from John's relatable, yet insightful, perspective.

** The author's on the subreddit somewhere, I remember her posting the chapters a while back. It was disappointing how little response they seemed to get.

** Will /definitely/ have to check this out. I've seen a handful of decent Sherlock/Harry Potter crossovers, but most of them seem to stall pretty early in the story. This already looks more promising than most of them.

** This is a great rec, because you touched on possible reasons someone might back-button right away and miss out on a good fic. Thanks!

*** All true, to be honest. However, what really appeal to me about this fic is the manner of how Holmes solved it. Not to mention, this story is all from Watson's eyes. There's just a certain wonderment to see magic again through a person who can't do magic themselves, but appreciates it all the same. The story itself is unique since the author makes the story their own. How the author ended was a surprise nonetheless.
