I'm looking for fics with Harry going through his Gringotts vault(s). The more absurd and wealthy the contents the better. I don't really care what happens in the rest of the fic. I pretty much just want to see descriptions of what is in the vault(s).

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.
