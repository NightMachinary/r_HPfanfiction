Im interested in fics where harry beeing a parselmouth has a bigger impact on the story, such as dragons speaking dragontounge, (4'th year?) Spells/wards in parselmagic, and such, where harry uses it as a gift instead of a curse.

Additionally, is there any fics where harry works with dragons using parseltounge? Prefer no slash.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** Found it!

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/272696/chapters/431154]])

Contains parselmagic spells, and Harry using his new found skills to help him in the Tri-Wizard tournament (even hits your speaking to dragons criteria!)

Fair warning, its HP/LV slash, but if you can deal with it it really is a good story.

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, and spells are learned or created... (Canon-compliant except for the aforementioned tweak in lineage.)

** Yes, because dragons can obviously speak the language of snakes. Snakes, dragons, they're all the same.

I doubt you'll find any good fics where Harry used Parseltongue in the First Task, but if you don't mind crappy cliche stories where Harry teaches Draco a genetic language...

*** Ahem. While it's probably not the case in HP, dragons as snakes is not a crazy idea it all --- the word dragon is literally derived from the Latin word for "snake". As for teaching Parseltongue, being a Parselmouth gives you innate understanding of it, but it can still be learned, as evidenced by Dumbledore being able to understand it and Ron being capable of pronouncing a word, proving that neither abilities are purely magical.
