It's Harry/Ginny and at one point they go to his vault and find like rare dragon armor and stuff.


** That is the most generic description I've ever seen. You're going to have to try slightly harder than that.

*** I think it was on ff.net. Harry is super focused on beating Voldemort. I believe that it is pre horcrux. There are plenty of rare books and a lot more money. He gets this when he becomes of age. I think it may even be a soul bond fic but other than that I'm hazy. It's been a while since I read it.

**** There are thousands of fics that fit that description, unfortunately. You'll need to be much more specific.
