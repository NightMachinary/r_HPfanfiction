** That would be BajaB who wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry The Hufflepuff]]. I cried laughing at some points. It also refrains from any bashing which is rare.

Champion's Champion by Driftwood1965 is fun if your into bashing as basically everyone is bashed in that.

Jack Thorne also wrote a satirical fan fiction that I heard gained some attention.
