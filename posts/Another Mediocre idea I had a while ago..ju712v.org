Since several of you liked the previous mediocre idea I had, here is anotehr one. It is a crossover with the SCP Foundaton.

Basically, the Foundation discovers the Wizarding World, and at first assumes it to be a Keter-Class anomaly. However, they attempt to use a Scranton Reality Anchor on it, only to discover that it does not work on it. They decide to treat the Wizarding World the same as they do the muggle one.

The Foundation realizes that they need several MTFs for policing the Wizards. They attempt to ask the Ministry for some aurors, but are rebuffed, being referred to as 'strange muggles', with the MTFs ending up obliviated, which the Foundation manages to reverse.

In case you aren't aware, the Foundation is /extremely/ powerful. In some canons, its more powerful than any other faction in fiction.

Anyway, the Foundation hears reports of the Order and Death Eaters. The Head of the British Foundation suggests to his superiors that these two groups would make excellent MTF Units. They just need some training, and the Foundation has turned less willing people into, in some cases, the pride of the Foundation's MTF.

His proposal is accepted, with reservations, and the Foundation kidnaps the DEs and Order. They are then taken to the Greater London Containment Center, and are trained to become MTFs.

The story would focus on these two groups, now known as MTF Unit Sigma-9, and Sigma-12, as they deal with various threats to humanity and the Foundaton.

But they would also suffer from PTSD and depression, due to them being essentially taken from their homes against their will and trained to become something completely foreign to them.

What do you all think? I'd like to know if this idea is good or not, as well.

EDIT: I am talking about the SCP foundation, sorry.


** What Foundation is this? It's not the one from Asimov.
