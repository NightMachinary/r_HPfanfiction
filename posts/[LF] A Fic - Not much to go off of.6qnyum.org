Looking for a fic, there isn't a great amount that I remember about it. I do believe that it was a time-travel fic, based on Harry going back to the start of his Hogwarts schooling. The only other piece of info that I remember is that Harry made small changes to the timeline to "improve" them. One of those changes was that during the graveyard scene (which he chose to let happen again) Malfoy Sr. (I think) cut Harry's arm for the resurrection, but Harry filled a pouch full of I think acromantula blood to be cut instead so Voldie would be deformed. Sorry thats really all I can recall. Thanks for all the help.


** linkffn(5695544) I think this is it

*** I don't think this is it. I think it might have been one of Sinyk's stories, Three to Backstep or Angry Harry and the Seven, maybe?

I'm not entirely sure either, as Reptilla28's challenge has been done by quite a few authors, Sinyk and dunuelos included.

  My own response to Reptilia28's challenge. Harry died in the battle with Voldemort. What happens when he meets the Grim Reaper? Especially when the Reaper isn't happy with him. Rating changed to more appropriate one. HHr. Other pairings as they come.
