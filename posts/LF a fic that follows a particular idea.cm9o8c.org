** Does linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) count? Harry pretty much thinks he's amazing from the get-go. Additionally, linkffn(The Mind Arts) might also meet your request, but the grammar is just above par and Harry's characterization is a bit SI frankly (from the author).

To be honest, their aren't going to be many fics like that without some gimmick (ex. time-travel). There are two big reasons for this:

1. The type of person you are describing here? This is not a sympathetic or likable person. People never really write genuinely "evil" or "self-serving" main characters, because both the author and reader don't like that. Sure they can be ruthless or cunning or driven - its even encouraged. But the problem is that most people want to have their cake and eat it. They want to make Harry or Hermione or whoever both an introvert and extrovert - the smartest in the room and the one everyone follows or respects. So rarely will people depict that type of main character.
2. To be frank, this is actually not to far off from Voldemort's characterization growing up. Sure, he enjoyed stringing rabbits by their entrails and overpowering others as a child. But his philosophy was always seemingly that only power really mattered. Being the best was all that mattered, and if you weren't first you might as well be last. And a lot of authors hedge away from depicting a Harry as truly like Voldemort, for much the same reasons as #1.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** I think this fic fits your criteria quite well although Harry may be too powerful for your liking. And it also has a manipulative Dumbledore and the whole Magical Nobility trope. Otherwise it's quite good. And Harry is also at least friendly with Neville I don't think I've ever seen a fic that bashes him...

** So basically big stronk, cocky, asshole Harry. Don't worry there's lots of those...

+linkffn(Harry Potter and the Daft Morons)+ - edit: Forgot its a Multi Fic.

linkffn(Deprived by The Crimson Lord) - This one is actually alright because Harry isn't a dick, but he is a pretty fucked up person thanks to some fucked up people. He's a bad-ass though.

*** I wouldn't say so no, I never said he has to go around ripping draco and his goons a new one every day and pissing on ron and Seamus when they piss him off. I just like a harry that simply "doesn't care". He believes the weak isn't his responsibility to defend, he goes on with his life uncaring about those people and believing that he must be strong in this world. Thank you for the recommendation tho, I'll check it out
