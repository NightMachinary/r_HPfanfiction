** 1. It was fanfiction, therefore it was not leaked.

2. There were numerous fanfictions that were passed off as a leaked versions of DH.

3. At least half of them involved Ginny going with the trio.

4. Like all fanfiction, the majority of these had countless spelling and grammatical mistakes.

Therefore you'll probably need to give more details in order for someone to narrow it down.

*** "Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks"

From the "Online leaks and early delivery" section.

EDIT: Never mind, I misread, thought it was an unfinished version that was leaked.

** Are you talking about the one where harry has to fight voldemort by the veil after being dosed with a minute amount of draught of living death, draco helps him beat volemort by shielding his mind. The second chapter ends with harry making out with ginny at bill and fleur's wedding. Also umbridge makes the aurors try to "peacefully" settle problems with death eaters before getting torn by werewolves at a gathering?

** At first I thought you were talking about carpet book!! Which you aren't, sounds like you're talking about something that was actually a fic judging from the comments. Who else remembers carpet book??

**** We must have been on different parts of LJ -- I don't remember that much of a negative reaction to it (other than the fact it existed and seeing spoilers from it/etc)

** I remember reading one where Ginny went with them. I specifically remember them shagging(it used that word specifically) a lot throughout it. Younger me thought it was surprising that the series took a more sexual turn.

Edit: I also remember Hermione threatening the Dursley's after finding Harry's cupboard
