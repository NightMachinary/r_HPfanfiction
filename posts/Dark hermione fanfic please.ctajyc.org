I've been looking for a dark hermione fanfiction. One where she eventually becomes ruthless. It could start with her being in Slytherin. Must have pureblood supremacy.


** Not to be an ass or anything, but it's been asked [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=%22dark+hermione%22&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all][to hell and back]]

/Surely/ one of those posts has something for you?

*** A similar [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/csav9i/recs_for_hermione_slowly_descending_into_madness/?sort=new][post]] was literally asked two days ago. I don't get why people don't do a search before posting.
