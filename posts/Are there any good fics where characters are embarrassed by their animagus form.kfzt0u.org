Cute animals, wrong gender, embarrassing markings, etc. Just as long as the character is less than thrilled, at least at first, with their form.


** In linkffn(Weeb by Andrius), Harry's form is a cockroach.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** Harry and his friends take a potion to turn into their Animagus forms. The results are not quite what they had hoped for.

  My collection of silly HP one-shots. Often HHr. Now with Chapter 4, "Harry Potter and the Evil Mokeskin Pouch": Why doesn't Harry simply put Slytherin's Locket with the Horcrux in his Mokeskin pouch instead of carrying it around his neck all the time? Here's why.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
