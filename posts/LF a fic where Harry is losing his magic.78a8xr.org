If I remember right it's after war and Harry is losing his magic/dying. His magic hurts him the more he uses it. He tries to hide it from people and moves into Slytherin.

**** Isn't that the one he donated bone marrow for his aunt or cousin? Kind of a ridiculous premise, that.

***** Not really harry may hate his family but he is a very forgiving and loving person. I dont think hed want any of them save for maybe vernon to die especially if he rationalizes that his mom would do the same thing for Petunia
