So, my last review, for Pr****ss of the Bl**ks, got nuked by the AutoMod, because any mention of it in a post is instantly flagged for deletion due to rule 8. I thought discussion of it wouldn't run afoul it, but apparently it has been recommended so much that the mods have specific rules just for that one fic. Which mostly consist of "don't".

Nothing I can do about it, I guess. I'll salvage the parts of the post that weren't about it, and integrate them in this one. It will be remembered as the hidden masterpiece you'll never read, my magnum opus of literary criticism (spoilers, it's not that good).

If I have to scrape something from that post though, it will be this: go read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13510736/1/Spells-in-Silence][Spells in Silence]]. Same author, a lot of tropes in common that are generally handled better (Fem!Harry, disability and abuse especially) but with less questionable stuff, and it's a much lighter read and absolutely fantastic in execution. And Hazel is a much more likable main character than Jen. Go read it. Reeeead it.

​

Today, we're doing lightning round! Instead of reviewing a single, long fic as I have done until now, we'll take a look at a few short ones without going into too much depth into any of them. Some of them will be new reads, but I wanted to take the opportunity to go through the list of what I already read and see if I find something short and interesting to talk about. Since it has been years since I read most of them, and I probably forgot they even existed, it should also be a nice trip down memory lane for me.

And hopefully you'll have found something interesting to read by the end.

It should also be a shorter process, since I spent the last couple weeks writing a review that has evaporated, so I can maybe keep something resembling a sensible schedule. I'm trying not to go dark for a year again.

Previous reviews of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ebv6rt/a_subjective_review_of_core_threads/][Core Threads]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fa4r2f/a_subjective_review_of_the_archeologist/][The Archeologist]], and most recently [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/n9zhe4/a_subjective_review_of_luna_lovegood_and_the_dark/][Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary]], for those interested.

Standard disclaimer, which I forgot last time, applies, being that this review only comprises my own opinion about the fics in question. My own subjective standards and biases are certainly there, and I can't guarantee any such thing as quality writing or interesting insights. I try my best, but my best is probably not all that good.

The fics I'll be talking about here are *Dichotomous Centre* by WaskeHD (previously attached to my PotB review), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6655313/3/Something-Like-Your-Family][*Something Like Your Family*]] by Luan Mao, *The Chamaeleon* by Darklooshkin (chapter 18 of 'The random crazyness file'), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10639968/1/][*Negligentia*]] by Murkatroyd, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][*Sisyphus*]] by esama, *Ground Hog Day* by Rorschach's Blot, *Lifetimes of Repetition* by Racke, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10971855/1/The-Magic-Bullet][*The Magic Bullet*]] by MinuSeveN, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4128667/1/Three-Interviews][*Three Interviews*]] by Owl Writer, and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hermione-granger-the-mage-complete.686239/][*Hermione Granger the Mage*]] by RedAlert.

Some of the fics are without links, mostly to be sure not to run into one of the sub's rules. Nothing /too/ out there - DC I just don't know whether it will have explicit scenes later on, 'The random crazyness file' is a snippet compilation so it's just in case. Ground Hog and Lifetimes both have allusions to sex in them, and both feature primarily underage characters, but they are pretty tame, mostly off-screen depictions all the same. Just covering my ass here.

Going through my list for possible picks, I ended up with around two dozen fics to choose from, and mostly picked randomly between those that caught my eye. I tried to get a decent spread - certainly, talking about a half dozen different time travel/loop one-shots wouldn't be the most compelling read I could offer. Three is already kind of stretching it.

I also wanted to add a few crossovers, but I didn't really find any that are short, completed and interesting. The only one in this list is The Magic Bullet, a very short Worm crossover one-shot.

Considering how short most of those fics are, I'm not going to bother with spoiler warnings. Each sections /will/ go into spoilers for that specific fic. I also won't bother making a summary for each of them, since that would take more space than I want to. Just a look at the tropes and we'll move on with the next one.

If you are really concerned about spoilers, you can skip to the last section (Closing Thoughts) for a shortlist of which fics I would recommend and which I would not.

​

* Dichotomous Centre
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: dichotomous-centre
  :END:
This is a Harry/Tonks fic, which I found randomly on this very subreddit described as

#+begin_quote
  It involves a sexually confused Harry, a Gender confused Tonks.

  Even if you don't like to read slash, you can read this because of how the relationship is portrayed.
#+end_quote

To be frank, maybe overly so, I think that's bullshit. The story is cringe-worthy and the few interesting elements are drowned out by bad writing. I stopped reading at the start of chapter 8, so I don't know if things change drastically after that, but I doubt it.

If you removed the romance elements, it would be a fairly standard Indy!Harry fic - starts after GoF, he realizes Dumbledore is shady and tries to distance himself from him and the Order with the help of... /\/spins roulette wheel** Sirius and Tonks, unprecedented powers (he kills one of Umbridge's dementors with an anger/love-fueled patronus), the shopping trip for new, cool clothes, studying previous years' material but with not-occlumency to make it easier, styling on the ministry at the hearing... As I said, pretty standard stuff. Not exceptionally well-written, but on the upper end of mediocre as far as entertainment value goes.

/But/, and the but is pretty important, the author doesn't write good romance, in my opinion. People shit on JKR's green monster, but this is pretty much at that level, and the novelty of seeing a male/male relationship with Tonks doesn't outweigh the fact that I want to die every time those two are in a scene together. The author is obviously gearing towards a big confrontation when Harry finds out Jack is actually also Tonks and feels betrayed and all that, but I just wish it had already happened so that we could get a real relationship, rather than this precarious card castle of lies. I came here for a romance, but it's more akin to soap opera than anything.

Here is some choice quotes, for your enjoyment.

#+begin_quote
  His (Harry's) emotions swirled around inside of him.
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  The charcoal grey mixed with the emerald green with a cut that made Harry seem taller and fit had Jacque almost salivating. A sense of smugness filled Harry as Jacque almost forcefully tore his eyes away from him.
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  "Fucking hell... Fine!" Jacque huffed. "I'm attracted to you too. There... you happy?"

  The only answer Jacque got was Harry's strong arms wrapped around his waist and Harry's soft lips on his. Jacque panicked for a second before he relaxed into it. A soft moan escaped his lips. All too soon the kiss ended and Harry pulled away.
#+end_quote

It's not like there isn't /anything/ good, or I wouldn't be talking about it. It's the betrayal of my (perhaps too high) expectations that garners it a place here.

In the very first chapter, if you go past the seen-it-a-million-times scene of Harry ruminating in bed about how shit his life is, there is a really sweet part about his relationship with Cedric, and how it relates to his confusion about sexual orientation. That was nice.

But there is also stuff like this

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter - Boy-Who-Lived, Defender of the Philosopher's Stone, Basilisk Slayer and Victim, Godson to an innocent mass murderer and now Surviving Tri-Wizard Champion.
#+end_quote

in that first chapter, which almost made me drop it on the spot. I kept reading because I was promised a good romance, didn't find one.

I generally avoid male/male slash fics - I may be biased against them, but a big part of it is that most have horrible pairings. Remus/Sirius? Not my cup of tea, I don't like Remus that much, but perfectly fine. But when you get into the mountain of Draco/Harry, or even worse Harry/Snape fics or Harry/Voldemort, that's something I just can't stomach to read. And the less said about mpreg the better.

So, yeah, I was kind of pumped for a M/M fic with someone that isn't twenty years or more Harry's senior, or goddamn Draco Malfoy. And I generally like Tonks, plus the novelty in that interpretation of her is good.

Wouldn't recommend this one, if that wasn't clear enough. If anyone has a good Tonks-centric story do tell, any kind is fine, not just slash. Or, unrelatedly, a good vampire fic, since I have Castlevania on my mind a lot this period.

Next!

​

* Something Like Your Family
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: something-like-your-family
  :END:
So, this fic. This fic is about how literally everyone bullies Harry, and how he then takes revenge by sterilizing a good portion of the male pureblood society and impregnating their wives with his children to father a new generation.

Yes it's that kind of fic. No, it's not smut.

If I had to put a label to it, I would call it misery porn. The amount of bullying Harry suffers through is just slightly over the ridiculous threshold, but the fic is so short that it works pretty well if you aren't put off at the start. It's a tale of triumph over the horrifyingly corrupt pureblood society from the disenfranchised muggleborns, but it doesn't really explore much of anything.

It feels almost like a prototype of those malicious compliance fics I've seen floating around lately, only, you know, actually justified rather than Harry just being a dick to people and feeling superior about it. But it does have almost that same feeling, of a spiteful Harry coldly taking revenge against the world. It doesn't have the best resolution, or even the most satisfying really, but I guess it's fine for what it is.

A decently cathartic read, worth the twenty minutes it would take if you don't mind the fragmented writing style. It probably wouldn't work nearly as well if it was a longer fic, both from a stylistic or a thematic standpoint, but it's short so who cares.

​

* Negligentia
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: negligentia
  :END:
This one-shot follows a Harry in his twenties, happy in his engagement with Daphne Greengrass and his job as an Unspeakable, who is contacted by a Sirius Black trying to reconnect. He's the twin brother to the Boy-Who-Lived, Jacob Potter, and lived his life neglected but not abused, always looking for his place in the world and striving for recognition.

It's really good, teetering on the edge of great. The narrative framework of Sirius and Harry talking is used to give space to a number of flashbacks to pivotal moments in Harry's life - a conversation with Dumbledore, his funeral, moving out of his parents' house, his sorting... Sometimes the transitions between those sections feel a bit too short, but otherwise the conversation with Sirius is fine.

Fine in that it starts a bit slow, but really picks up emotionally towards the end, while the flashbacks are just really good. If I had to really find some fault in it, it would be that it's a bit long-winded at times, most obviously in the Sorting flashback.

There are a lot of little nice things in this fic, but for the sake of expediency I'll just go with the big one - Dumbledore is great. I literally can't remember the last time I read such an unambiguously positive representation of him, and it made me feel all fuzzy inside. I would recommend reading it for that alone, but I don't have to because the rest of this fic is also good. It's nice not having to cherry-pick.

There are two more one-shots following it, which I haven't read yet - I'll leave those for another time. I'll probably keep them tucked away for when I next need a palate cleanser. I'll have to check out the author's other works at some point too.

​

* The Chamaeleon
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-chamaeleon
  :END:
Yes, I know there is a typo in the title. It's written like that in the original.

I have mentioned this one-shot back in my Luna Lovegood review, not in connection with anything about that story, but while talking about other ones that had caught my eye with similar themes.

I seriously wish this was a full fic. There is just something about it, be it the abuse of time-turners or the half-dozen separate identities Harry takes on that just tickles something in my brain. The time travel is mostly incidental to the real strength of this piece, that is the strong feeling of wanting an escape and the themes of loss of self that we only just see before the end.

Nothing else to say about it, but I highly recommend it.

​

* Sisyphus, Ground Hog Day, and Lifetimes of Repetition
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sisyphus-ground-hog-day-and-lifetimes-of-repetition
  :END:
So, I've grouped those three up, for the obvious reason that they are all variations on the 'Harry is stuck in a time loop' trope. I thought it would be nice to see how they compare, and especially contrast, to each other.

In case it wasn't obvious enough, that's one of my favorite tropes. That, and time travel, and dimensional travel. And Gamer fics, but I'm also aware that most of those are trash - more than usual.

Let's start in order, with Sisyphus. This is a fic of extreme nihilism - pretty much the darkest possible take on the time loop trope, where there is no end in sight, no hope of salvation and where nothing matters.

The fic itself is plain, almost crude. Years, decades go by with barely a mention, because they don't matter.

Closed-system loops are usually pretty interesting, since the point of them is that accumulating information lets the character advance just that little bit further each time. It's an incremental game, where all the variables are accounted for at the start, and the only obstacle is lack of knowledge.

Harry is stuck in a closed system, but one where deviating from his given path only brings him death faster. There is no end in sight, no objective to fulfill. The loop is an end unto itself.

It's a good exploration of time loops, in a meta sense. Bringing the trope to such an extreme that it removes any possibility of happiness or fulfillment.

That said, I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you hate yourself. Or if you really like grimderp stuff, same thing.

On the completely opposite end of the spectrum, we have Ground Hog Day. It's crack, pure and simple, and doesn't pretend to be anything else.

From the very start, Harry quickly goes insane by repeating the same, single day. He goes through a cycle of asking people close to him what they would do in a time loop, doing it, then he realizes he should probably take the opportunity to kill Voldemort and goes through another cycle of trying to kill him, failing, and studying/working on something to rectify what kills him.

It's pretty brainless. I don't recommend it, really. It's not very good, as either a normal story or a time loop one. It just doesn't have much of interest going for it.

Now then, we'll complete the trifecta with Lifetimes of Repetition. It's a much more serious take on time loops than Ground Hog Day, but not a nihilistic one. There is hope at the end, and even before then there is some degree of happiness to be found, unlike Sisyphus.

It's a Fem!Harry fic, featuring a romance between her and a (also looping) Gabrielle Delacour. Rather than looking at them slowly figuring out a time loop and how to exploit it and all that stuff, we see two experienced loopers manipulating the setting to their advantage, while they work towards their own ends.

They are set in their way. They have their rituals and traditions, they have already gone through that initial phase of exploration and exploitation, and are just refining their methods in hope of breaking the loops.

Finding a time loop fic that has more than the one person looping is kind of rare, finding one where they aren't enemies is rarer still. The romance aspect of it, if you can get past the fact they are old people in the bodies of preteen girls, is handled decently well.

It's also a bit of a slog at times. The author really likes his philosophizing, making it perhaps slower than it could have been, but he mostly uses that time to explore what happened in past loops pretty well.

There are a few characters taken from the Negima! series, of which I know practically nothing about, but they are integrated in the story fairly well if you go past the initial jarring feeling you get when a character is introduced as Chachazero. It's not that bad, really. And their interaction with Harry felt very... earnest? Sincere? I'm not sure how to describe it, really.

​

* The Magic Bullet
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-magic-bullet
  :END:
Now, for the obligatory crossover episode, we have The Magic Bullet. It's a Worm crossover, but since only a very small part of that is important I'll just give you a brief summary of the relevant things and move on.

Worm is a web serial, featuring a dark, even grimdark view of a superhero setting. Powers are granted by an alien entity to people in their darkest moment, a 'trigger event', and tend to reflect the anxieties and neuroses of the person in question, with a long-term goal of promoting conflict. This fic more or less gives Hermione the powers, and partly the backstory and trauma of, one of the characters.

Miss Militia's power, primarily, is that she has a shapeshifting weapon that can assume the form of any mundane, man-portable weapon from knives, to guns and rifles, to grenades and even to small tactical nuclear devices. Aside from that, she has an aptitude for wielding those weapons, doesn't need to sleep, and has perfect memory (this last one is actually fanon, but it was included). She had her trigger event as a child, being from a war-torn country and forced to walk at gunpoint in a minefield. Hermione gained these powers, or an equivalent magical version of them, being held at gunpoint by a teacher she trusted. Who she then killed.

But back to more lighthearted things, this fic has a bit of a sense of humor to it. It's like, think of the first year of Harry Potter, its stations of canon. And the solution to each problem, is Hermione pulling out a gun or something like that.

#+begin_quote
  "Light a fire!" Harry cried.

  Hermione hesitated, frozen in indecision. "Ah- How!?" Maybe this was it, maybe this was when she was supposed to reveal her power.

  Ron exploded. "Oh, by Merlin's- ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT!"

  Oh right. She could use her wand. No need to break out the incendiaries.
#+end_quote

It's as if someone heard that trite phrase about every wizard and witch having a deadly weapon at all times, except it's literally that. My favorite is when she shoots a flashbang at the teachers' stands to stop Quirrel and Snape.

Other than that, it has some fairly interesting parts to it regarding Hermione's trauma, and her opening up to Harry towards the end. It doesn't go anywhere, because it's a one-shot, but I would still recommend it - it's a short read, and you don't really need to know anything about Worm for it. The tonal shifts are a bit messy, but still.

Also, since it seems at least mildly related, I wanted to remind you all that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA-ayM5I4Jw][Harry Potter and the Deathly Weapons]] is a thing that exists, and it's amazing.

​

* Three Interviews
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: three-interviews
  :END:
This is just pure fluff. A short and sweet fic about Luna interviewing Harry for three different publications, each interview revealing different details about the relationship they started after Hogwarts.

I don't really have anything to say about it, I just wanted to include it because it was nice reading it and I wanted to share. Lovely read.

​

* Hermione Granger the Mage
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: hermione-granger-the-mage
  :END:
Saving the best for last. Disregard what I've said previously about not being concerned with spoilers, at least for this fic. If you are in any way interested in it, even vaguely, you should read it before you continue reading this review - the start is nothing to write home about, but I guarantee it gets really interesting at some point I won't specify.

Spoilers from this point on.

​

If I had to sell you this fic, with spoilers this time, I would say it's an unholy mixture of Harry Potter, Doki Doki Literature Club, and JRPG worlds' tropes. If that doesn't spark your interest, I don't know what will.

The basic premise of it is that a young Hermione Granger is given Dragon Quest 4 by her uncle, becomes obsessed with it, JRPGs and fantasy, eventually discovers that magic is real and drives her parents up the walls, and finally finds her way to Hogwarts where she has magical adventures while dragging a mostly unwilling Neville Longbottom behind her.

This is a lie. The first few chapters may be like that, they have a feeling of light crack to them, but things really take a first strange turn when Hermione is killed in the Forbidden Forest.

From there, reality starts falling apart. The crack becomes cosmic horror, the plot picks up again following Harry as he deals with the strange new status quo.

I'm not going to tell you how it ends.

​

This fic is not perfect, especially on the writing front. The layout is a bit messy, there are quite a few typos (I don't think Prefect is /ever/ spelled correctly), and it's kind of meh on a technical level. What elevates it is definitely the sheer 'what-the-fuckery' of its contents. I highly recommend it.

I also has a sequel/rewrite/alternate continuity (it's complicated), [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hermione-granger-the-mage-you-can-not-redo.700267/][Hermione Granger the Mage - You Can (not) Redo]], but it seems to have been abandoned pretty early on. A good portion of it was pretty much lifted straight from the original, but the few new parts are a rather interesting take, in how it follows up on what happened in the previous one.

​

* Closing Thoughts
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: closing-thoughts
  :END:
An even 10 fics seems like a good place to stop.

Here is the recommendation TL:DR:

Would recommend - *The Chamaeleon*, *Negligentia*, *Three Interviews* and *Hermione Granger the Mage*.

Would NOT recommend - *Dichotomous Centre*, *Ground Hog Day*.

Your Mileage May Vary - *Something Like Your Family*, *Sisyphus*, *Lifetimes of Repetition*, *The Magic Bullet*.

​

I wrote in the PotB review that the next one was probably going to be Delenda Est, but we'll see how that goes. Maybe I'll find another fic that agrees with me more. I also have another 6/7 old short fics I want to reread that I haven't yet done, so I could also do another one of these with a few newer ones to add. Actually, if anyone has some nice short fics to recommend feel free - I'm not particularly picky about the subject, both pure HP and Crossovers are fine, just keep them under 30k words.

Discussion about anything and everything is welcome - it's a big part of why I write these, after all.

Hope this was at least interesting to read, have a good day.


** Upvote for the helpful reviews - easy to understand and helpful to pick out what I might try reading.

But OMG “grimderp”!!!! This one word is what I will hold on to for a long while. I generally /hate/ grimdark stories... except where I don't, and I could never say what the distinction was. Now I know thanks to you. Thank you!

“Grimderp” is exactly what I can't tolerate. It is such a relief to have this in conscience awareness rather than some sort of subconscious minefield.

*** Glad to be of help. I'm also not much of a fan of it, but for Sisyphus I was mostly interested in the time loop over anything else.

Probably shouldn't have re-read it, in hindsight. It's the kind of fic you remember for years on end, and not in the good way.

** Oh man, this was a fun read. I'm always fascinated by the tastes of other people. Especially because I love timetravel stories as well, although rarely have I found a closed loop one that I liked. I have read so many, I think at one stage it almost affected me personally because I got so jealous of the opportunity to go back in time and change things and fixated on what I would do if I woke up tomorrow and it was the year 2000. It was almost unhealthy.

Not being into anime or JRPGs at all, I'm not sure H the Mage is for me but you definitely caught my attention with Negligentia. I don't think I knew any of the fics you reviewed and that's always cool
