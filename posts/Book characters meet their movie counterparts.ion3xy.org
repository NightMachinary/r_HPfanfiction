I think it would be a really cool experiment to have the book characters meet the movie characters. Would be a cool way to explore the differences between Harry, Ron and Hermione, and Dumbledore, etc.

**** I don't think she mentioned any of her conspiracy theory in the movies, and they probably removed a cryptid or two.

***** They took out heliopaths and...come to think of it, I don't think the Crumple-Horned Snorack got mentioned either.

"Nargles" became the default, but that makes sense because "Nargle" is a funny word.

*** Movie!Luna is actually a fair bit different.

She doesn't mention any conspiracy theories.

She is much less argumentative...largely because there's far fewer of her conspiracies.

There's no Luna commentating the Quidditch match.

She also has her shoes stolen so she has to walk barefoot--In the books, Luna is never described as barefoot. Her clothes are sometimes stolen, but the implication I always got was that it was stuff that could be easily missed--a hat, gloves, a scarf, etc.

**** Oh, okay. I've been reading fanon so long that I sometimes write off the canon books as fanfics I'd read, long ago.

Thanks for the correction :)

***** Book Luna is also social akward aside from her conspiracy theories. There are moments in the book where she laughs at inappropriate times and much to loud. She doesn't seem to have a internal understanding of things which are appropriate to say and which are not. The dreamy Movie Version of her had cut much of the characters substance that I really loved in the books.\\
Edit: Oh, and Neville isn't her love interest in the books like in the movies.

** There's a fic like that. Can't remember the name, but the book characters show up at Dan's home and ask for the actors' help with a new problem.
