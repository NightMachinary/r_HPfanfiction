Because they are my greatest weakness, and I fear I may have missed some of the good ones. It can be quite frustrating searching for them. I'm trying to stick to the ones I enjoyed, but feel free to suggest others. I don't care from when to when, everything allowed, including reincarnation rather than the same body etc. These are ordered according to LAST UPDATED because it's the easiest way for me to go through them on ffn.

- The Past Isn't Set in Stone: This has been going for a little while and I'm enjoying it. Basically, Hermione goes back in time, becomes ultrapowerful but has yet to tap that power. linkffn(11574914)

- Six Pomegranate Seeds: An incredible idea. Hermione is sent back to first year as a different character under totally different circumstances I don't want to spoil. Easily a top 5 of any type of story I'm following right now. Really, really love it. It's extremely well written. A kind of Slytherin!Hermione without her being Hermione. Hard to explain. Read it! linkffn(12132374)

- Red Right Hand: Hermione goes back in time to adopt Tom. A little bit /too/ much love drama for my liking but the flashes of badass Hermione/creepy little Tom make me want more every single time I finish a chapter. linkffn(12304702)

- Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance: I was kind of hesitant of adding this, because it's not Hermione who travels through time, her body is essentially taken over by Salazar Slytherin and she sets out to fix Slytherin House. Interesting premise so why not. linkffn(10991501)

- The All New Adventures of Hermione Granger in... The Chance of a Lifetime: Old Hermione goes back in time to first year. The reasons are multiple and intriguing, and I like /most/ of the shenanigans that have been happening, and some of the changes so far. She also tries to fix magical society at the same time as attending school. linkffn(11453335)

- The Truth About Death: Death takes Hermione back in time, time set about going to Hogwarts with Tom Riddle. Pretty good! A lot of worldbuilding around death, Tom's early adventures and innocenlty psychotic tendencies as a child. linkffn(11739841)

- Champion: Hermione gets sent back in time to save Tom's soul. Has had some incredibly strong scenes, and an interesting take on Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Hermione is super badass in this in a very cool way. She basically fixes Slytherin a little bit as well. linkffn(11790377)

- Falling Through Time: Hermione goes back in time and falls for a certain Weasly, I like it. Can't say it's been incredibly memorable so far, but sweetly written. I'm having difficulty remembering details. Linkffn(11418202)

- In Silence Sealed: Hermione to Marauders era, but she doesn't attend the school exactly. Some of it shows her being the badass that she is, a lot of tension with Sirius. linkffn(12104273)

- The Ark in the Storm: Interesting premise with Hermione something akin to a werewolf, but not. Goes back to marauders era and goes to the school there. Has had some very funny moments, some sad ones, I've really enjoyed my time so far. linkffn(11779160)

- Somewhere in Time: 1981 fic where Hermione goes back and saves the Potters. It's been quite enjoyable but a little angsty for my tastes. linkffn(12243418)

- Requiem for War: Doesn't update anything near often enough for my liking, but a very intriguing story. Hermione Goes to 1974 to change the course of /that/ war after the second one goes pearshaped. Includes adoption to Dagworth-Granger and elder Potters. Really hope they continue writing! Linkffn(12243561)

- Addendum: He is also a Liar: Not Hermione doing the timetravel, but she is still a major focus for Tom Riddle. I just find it very interesting with the possibility of some serious stuff going down. Linffn(11562871)

- Quantum Entanglement: Everything went wrong, Hermione goes back in time. Reincarnated Hermione, not many of those in this list so far even though it used to be the leading trope in this genre?! Anyway, she's now a Black, and has a serious axe to grind. Lots of action, Severus Snape ship. I like it when they're the same age! Linkffn(11405979)

- Butterfly Effect: Hermione goes through an extremely traumatic experience, goes back in time to just before year 1. She's been shipwrecked and basically trained into some sort of superbadass. Actually really enjoyable! Linkffn(11556766)

- Two Things are Infinite: Marauders, a fair amount of angst so far. I'm expecting big things though! Linkffn(11961026)

- Tempore et Spatio: Not really sure this qualifies. Hermione reincarnated as McGonnagal's daughter, a toddler that just kind of appears from a different dimension. Funny! And interesting Scottish brogue. Linkffn(12242852)

- A Bit of Sky: Hermione and two others go back to 1981. Good fun so far, but not very long yet. Has some pretty serious scenes already though! Linkffn(12273702)

- Bookshelf Sturdy: Really needs to be longer and have an update, but my hope isn't strong. It's not the /best/ writing so far but enjoyable idea of going back to Fantastic Beasts' world. Linkffn(12330599)

- /Honourable mention/: Butterfly Effect (a different one with the same title). Luna goes back in time, drives everyone there crazy. Linkffn(12078704)

- Fool: A little bit worried about this one ever continuing. Hermione goes back to Newt. Linkffn(12236050)

- In Noctem: Hermione goes back... a little bit further than 1st year but does not go back to her younger self, instead she is all grown up. nice writing, I hope they update. Linkffn(12117515)

- Give them Triumph Now: Hermione is sent back. This is already at 78K words so not a short one like a couple of the ones previous. A bushy-haired addition to the marauders, a fair amount of angst included as well as sweary fun. Linkffn(12055716)

- Midway State: Reincarnated Hermione in Marauders era. This is an okay fic. Linkffn(12151469)

** Well, you've made my day, thanks! I'll also recommend linkffn(11047955). Interesting fic where Hermione ends up growing up as a Black. It's a bit heavy on the evil Dumbledore, but overall worth reading.

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Noble and Most House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** My favorite Hermione time travel fix is Pride of Time, where she accidentally goes back twenty years during her sixth year, lives her life, takes a deaging potion when she catches up and slips back in her own time stream. I like it because time travel works exactly the same as it does in PoA in that you can't change anything because anything you go back in time to do already happened. Anyway. I don't know how to use the ffbot, but I'll try: linkffn(Pride of Time)

So much world building, so many cool ideas, and a concept that is at least a little different than the norm. Follows canon without talking about it much at all. Very good!

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her.

** - Three's the Charm: All three go back to redo their hogwarts education. It's quite an old one - started in 2012 but still updated in November 2016! Certianly can't count as an unpopular fic or anything, so you may already have heard of it. It's pretty good! Linkffn(8326928)

- Bonds between Lost Souls (Completed!) + The Bond Servant (sequel being written): What a wonderful and especially memorable little series. Unlike with some of the others so far, I haven't had to skim over past chapters to remember what this fic actually even is. Hermione goes back in time for reasons, I recommend not spoiling it too much. Basically, she is out to sway the Death Eaters away from Tom Riddle, starting in Slytherin and the series continues well into adulthood now. She's had some very rough patches, poor girl, but she is strong, smart, and above all willing to sacrifice. I seriously recommend this, at least the first part if you don't like fics in progress. Linkffn(11758961; 11975546)

- Attempt to Tip the Scales: Hermione goes back to Marauders era. It's quite a good fic over all with some weird and cheesy parts, and the dialogue leaves quite a lot to be desired. She gets adopted by a Black squib, which is quite funny. Give it a go, you might enjoy it! Linkffn(12045789)

- The Gates of Hope: Probably dead in the water. Hermione goes back to 1945, immediately spills many beans to Dumbledore. Stilted dialogue but has some Je Ne Sais Quoi. Linkffn(12115622)

- The Future isn't Set in Stone: Hermione goes back in time, becomes Lucius Malfoy's sister. Is for James Potter's enemy for some reason, can't remember. It's been a while since an update but at 28K words we can live in hope of an update. Linkffn(116043139)

- Paradox Witch (complete): A really sweet HG/SS story that is quite short. I know I enjoyed reading it, and recommend it. Does have one rather immensely frustrating amnesia moment. Linkffn(12158816)

- The Death of One: A fun little story with hermione, Harry and Draco going back to Tom Riddle's schooldays. Not finished but a good little chunk to read anyway. Maybe the lack of reviews didn't help, it's really nowhere near as bad as some fics. Linkffn(11300892)

- Of Ticking Clocks and Beating Hearts: A little too "whackyrandom" at times but otherwise a good bit fo fun. Hermione goes back to Marauders era, is a Slytherin, etc. Linkffn(11212346)

- The Blessings of Dark Rituals: Hermione goes back to that night in 1981. Unfinished and not updated for a while, but her battle with Voldemort is really, really cool. Linkffn(12053592)

- Fair Fortune: This is really well written Hermione is Lily's twin story, enjoyed everything so far but it hasn't been updated in a while. I really like the style. Linkffn(11376508)

I realised recently I'd deleted a lot of the completed fics out of my favourites, so I'm sorry if that's what you wanted. To be fair, a lot of these seem to get started, then quickly fall flat and no longer get updated. Anyway, have fun!

** We Found Wonderland by scarecrowing.

If you read this one, don't be put off by the poor formatting at the start. I volunteered as a beta, and I hope you can spot the difference between chapters 1 and 6.

It's a good story but hasn't been updated in ages. I've asked the author a couple of times and he says it's not abandoned, but I'm beginning to wonder...

** Thanks for the Six Pomegranate Seeds rec! The characters don't really feel like kids, but that's a common failing of Slytherin stories, and besides that the story's really fun to read.

That said, I genuinely have to wonder whether The Chance of a Lifetime was written by a Scientologist or somesuch. Dedicating the entirety of the first chapter and the majority of the second to /really, really weird/ depictions of/monologues on psychologists is... off. Does it get better later on?

I think HP fics generally drop the ball and portraying kids realistically in any way shape or form. I've grown used to it and often forget we're talking about 11 year olds a lot of the time.

  The war is much larger, far longer, and much deeper than they could have imagined: fought on a scale that baffles the limits of human understanding. In such a world, perhaps it isn't surprising when Hermione Granger is sent back in time to rescue Tom Riddle's very soul before he has the chance to destroy it. Rated M. Next update Sunday April 9th.

  Voldemort won. The last of the war criminals Hermione Granger is about to be publicly executed. Except - it doesn't quite work out that way. Hermione is thrown back 20 years in time. She enters Slytherin as pureblood Hermione Druella Black - with one thing on her mind: Revenge. The more brutal and vicious the better. \\/ My attempt at the tired old time-travel trope. SS/HG.
