** Not subconsciously. I sometimes do it to figure out what a writer is saying.

"She scrunched up her face in a slack disbelieving smiley frown."

Okay, face, do your stuff.

** Not personally, but it is a thing - I've read some journal articles on mirror neurons through the written word, and there are people who do the same thing.

**** Indeed. Psychology is fun!

But yeah, it's one of those brain things. Most everyone does it with face-to-face stuff - you're more likely to laugh when other people do, for example - but there's enough people that do it with writing to be statistically significant. :)

** I do it when I'm writing. I'll find myself making a face and be like “how do I describe that?”. I don't think I do it when I'm reading though.

** Yeah, I am ashamed to admit this but yes, I do this and much worse. I have to say when Voldemort came around I almost always had this weird smile on my face.

And of course, when I got too excited based on a story, running, jumping and screaming weren't uncommon...

** This is a very good indicator of when a story is very well written. Usually authors don't bother with describing what a character facial expressions or what they are feeling during dialogs. When they don't do this my mind just makes up some for the character instead

** dear god yes! whenever im reading an evil/dark character and they do some kind of feral, cruel smirk i always try to do it myself or when its some roasting scene and the character is winning while they talk about his expressions i talk out loud while narrowing my eyes or what else i imagine they would be doing while talking.. overall yes i do that a lot
