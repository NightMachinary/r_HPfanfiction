Like, not just the limit time turner, but something like Doctor Who, where he has a time machine/device and he adventures throughout time. I'd prefer long and ongoing fics, but as long as it's at least 60k words, I'm good. Thanks. Bonus points for Doctor Who references in the story.

*** Time to put your galleons where your mouth is is not a lone traveller fic.

***** But that isn't even the point of the lone traveller series. The lone traveller doesn't live different lives, just one. He doesn't die, he just essentially teleports around fixing stuff. The galleon one is born and dies multiple times, is master of death, and apathetic to the idea of fixing stuff at first.

Also, saying an unconnected story is the most famous part of another story is very misleading.

*** I like the premise of Basilisk-Born, but I can't stand the writing. I try not to be picky, but the grammar issues...

**** Being German I believe the author of that to also be German (or speak German). Ebenbild is a German word and the grammar inconsistencies would be valid in German - which makes them easy to ignore for me, but I agree there are some very obvious ungrammatical constructs all throughout the fic.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** Maybe try the hero series, found here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991]]

I read it a while back and I think it may have some of the qualities you're looking for. The writing is decent, there is some time travel, and I know I stayed interested enough to read all three, which hover around 30 chapters each.

** Young Adventurer's Club linkffn(9993319)

Has what you're looking for. Although it's a lot of people besides Harry who time travel and it's a Hermione/Snape main pairing.

** O.k. This is only 50k words, but it's complete, has 2-3 entire chapters based on Gallifrey, and he even get's his own companion.
