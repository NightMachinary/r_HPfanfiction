** Either Cedric, Sirius or Tom Riddle(pre horcruxes). They are the only guys referred to as handsome in the books.

Edit: also Lockhart, Grindelwald and Firenze the centaur

*** Harry as well in the sixth book. Hermione even comments on it.

And I think Gellert Grindelwald as well... Though my memory might be bad, but I remember him being described as handsome.

**** no she doesn't call him handsome, Hermione and Harry barely got along in the sixth book. I think you mean when she warned him about the girls attempting to to give him a love potion, but she doesn't call Harry anything.

you are right about Grindelwald, he is called handsome by Harry twice.

***** “Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable.” .... “And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer either,” Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.

****** I guess fanciable can be considered handsome, but I rather took it as him being popular for the reason of being the chosen one in addition to being tall.

******* Well, the "never been more" and "grown about a foot" seems to show he's at least handsome to Hermione, who is pretty intelligent and self-aware. While I agree it's pretty weak proof of Harry being very handsome, it seems to indicate it he's definitely above average.

******** To be fair for a guy just being tall makes you more attractive, but not really what I would call handsome. and to the "never been more faniceable" We have also seen the same in goblet of fire, how Harry suddenly became popular with girls, after he was successful against the dragon.

Not to say that Harry isn't attractive, It just doesent seem to be for the reason of being actually handsome.
