I dont usually see much reference to harry being the Master of Death except for a few instances of just giving him a power boost, a few fics where Death sends him back in time, and some where he's just immortal. I'm looking for fics where being the MoD is a primary facet of the story, preferably with some responsibilities. This desire was brought about by recently reading a fic where Harry became the Eldrich embodiment of Death. Once I'm at a computer I will link the story if no one else has already.


** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/32183310][Resurrect the Living]] (59k+ words, frequently updated), being the "Master of Death" is more of a /Sixth Sense/ style curse than a power-up.

In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11235039/1/Turned-Around-in-Time][Turned Arround in Time]] Harry's new title grants him the misfortune of getting pulled through time to any occasion when someone tries to summon Death.

  Harry became the Master of Death but it's not perfect. There's no eternal youth and invulnerability, and the time travel is cool but pointless, because change is impossible in his universe. But there's another universe - it has superheros and mutants and perhaps enough flexibility to change time. This story meshes HP with the entire MCU. Will deviate from canon. Not OOC

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. But when the remaining resistance breaches the Magical Curtain guarding Voldemort's empire, he suddenly resurfaces and offers to guide them through the new Europe where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. But why hasn't he aged a single day?

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said as he stalked closer. “is you.” He backed Harry up until the cool wall of the common room was brushing against him. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely amused. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro is a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer. “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.
