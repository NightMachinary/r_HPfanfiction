A while ago, I read a fic in which Hermione/Ron made it official around the time of Dumbledore's funeral, but didn't tell Harry or anyone else because there was too much going on and Harry had enough on his plate.

It was all canon compliant, it just supposes that, unbenownst to Harry, Ron and Hermione had already passed the will-they-won't-they stage and moved into the actual couple stage.

So when Ron/Hermione dance at Bill's wedding, fall asleep holding hands at Grimmauld Place, have conversations that end abruptly when Harry walks into the tent, escape the Malfoys', go down to the Chamber of Secrets, kiss in the Room of Requirement, etc., they're doing so as a couple rather than an almost-couple.

Does anyone know of a fic like this? I've read plenty of missing moments fics where there's lots of sexual tension and close calls, but none where they're actually in a relationship.

If anyone knows of a fic with this premise, or knows any other fics with a similar premise, that would be appreciated.


** Do you remember what site you read it on and around what year it was published?

I've seen the secret relationship scenario for OotP and HBP but not Deathly Hallows.

*** FF.net, though I have no idea when it was published. Certainly post-2007.

**** I don't think I'll be able to help you quickly out quickly. Too many fics to sort through on ff net to be done quickly.

If you want I can give you some similar ones where they start a relationship */before/* or during HBP, or even during the Horcrux Hunt.

And I'll ask around to see if anyone knows the one you are looking for.

P.S. I have a community on ff net dedicated to Ron/Hermione with a few hundred stories on there, and if it interest you I can pass you the link.

***** Yes please. :) Link is probably easier than making you link the stories individually, unless they're not in the C2 or you know them off the top of your head.

****** D: My large response got deleted when I clicked on a link. Here's a shortened one. Link to the C2. I've personally read all of the stories on there(since I'm the only staff) and know this premise has to come up at least a few times.

******** Hello! Yeah most of these authors have well written and engrossing stories. I enjoyed all of the ones I linked very much. Even the other stories they've written.

OP, if you see this, SoulxxBondz has also written some of this ship. Haven't read all of them myself since I have a massive backlog but the ones I did were entertaining.
