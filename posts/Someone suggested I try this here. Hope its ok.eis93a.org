So the scene opens to a beautiful (slightly over grown, in the best possible way) garden and panes up to the wrap around porch where a young girl (maybe 10) is sitting at the patio tables (which is set for a casual lunch) looking down at her lap worriedly. Just off to the side we see a tray being set down with drinks. The girl (still looking down) says "But I still don't understand." From inside the house we hear a woman's voice say "Oh sweety, you're going to be wonderful and amazing! Listen I've told you about my younger years, how I was born into a family completely unlike me, who couldn't understand me, who just weren't meant to be my family. And how a year after I started school your grandma and I found each other, how we knew we were family. But I've never really told what happened after the magic started." We see the little girl look towards the door as she sets a letter on the table. We see another tray floating towards us followed by Mara Wilson holding a wand towards the tray to set it on the table. She then says " You see love, when I was your age, I too got a letter." Then scene cuts to an 11 year old Matilda getting her letter telling her she is a witch and has been accepted to Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the movie that follows is Matilda's adventures through wizarding school.


** That would be so cool
