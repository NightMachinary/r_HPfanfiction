Does anyone know of anything like Across the Time as it was a super good fic when it was available to read does anyone know of anything even remotely close (btw Across the Time was the fic that had both harry and fleur travel back in time to their fourth year meeting eachother all over again while retaining their memories from when they got married and grew old together) If anyone has any fics id be delighted to hear about them. Cheers!
