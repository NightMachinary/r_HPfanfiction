I'm not sure if the author deleted it or something, but perhaps someone here has an archived/cached version of it.


** There's been a few with Tom Riddle having a twin sister. What else can you remember about it? Anything to help the search can help you find it quicker.

*** It was around 100k words long, his sister was named Mary and she was adopted while he stayed in the orphanage. There was no weird time-travel soul-shifting stuff like some fics where Harry is reincarnated into Tom's sibling.

****** I found something that /may/ be the right one, but it was on ff.net (maybe was also on AO3?), deleted, and is being rewritten/redone (with permission) by another author. It wasn't archived by Wayback Machine, and I'm uncertain if it's archived elsewhere or not.

****** The story might be The Riddle Twins by coconut oil shots, but, as I said, it was deleted. What I /can/ find are the summary and word count, which was 123,979 words at 17 chapters.

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
#+end_quote

The rewrite is being done by Cordoue and is being cross-posted on ff.net and AO3. It's currently at 18,305 words at 5 chapters; it was recently updated on the 25th of this month. There are some noticeable differences, though, as Mary was never adopted and was sorted into Slytherin instead of Hufflepuff.

  Tom Riddle knows love very well. How could he not? He was never alone at the orphanage, for she was always by his side, every day and every night. She was there even at the very beginning; indeed, they were created in the same womb. For his twin sister Mary, Tom will stop at nothing to gain the world.
