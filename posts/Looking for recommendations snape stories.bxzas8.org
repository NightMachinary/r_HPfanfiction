** I'm doing this on my phone so can't add links, but if you are looking for Snape POV, then I have written a long fic Snarity pairing which is PoA Canon compliant and explains the scene "Severus... Please... Please." its called The Uneven Orbit by LadyofToward on FFN and AO3. There is a sequel in WIP.
