Hermione/Twin Marriage Law and A Time Travel Fox

Im looking for two fics that have stuck with me for the past six years. They were so good, and I can't find them agains.

The first I read at least 6 years ago on FF.net. It was a marriage law fic. Hermione is paired with George. If I remember correctly, its DH compliant in the fact that Fred is dead. They have a hard time connecting, because George is consumed with grief. They eventually make it work. As a side plot, Ron is paired with Luna and they have a stillbirth. Luna says something along the lines of “I always knew she'd be a quiet baby” or something like that. I had just lost my daughter to a stillbirth, so it stuck with me. It was such a beautiful story.

The second one, Hermione is in Weasley's Wizard Wheezes after the war. She's helping in the back room and some sort of potion falls on her head. It sends her back in time and Fred and George finds her in the back room. From her reaction, Fred realizes this is future Hermione, and he doesn't make it out of the war. They hide her out while trying to figure out how to get her back to the present, and during the searching, she and Fred fall in love. When she gets back to the present, his headstone is changed to loving husband and father, and it turns out they were married in the forbidden forest during the war and she was pregnant.

If anyone can help, I would greatly appreciate it!
