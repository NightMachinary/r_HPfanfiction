Fics that have Harry married with Ginny (or any other female partner), but somehow he gets sexually interested in males. He maybe questions his sexuality and starts hidden affairs (homosexual) or maybe confronts ginny with it, who is suprised, but accepts this "new side" of her Husband (bisexual).....with a possible option for a Threesome (but no necessary).

Same goes for Ron. I would also be open for a bisexual session between Ron and Harry (with the possible option of a Threesome with their Spouses.....Yes, including Ginny and Ron as well) and i would also accept Cross-generation Fics. So Harry/Ron gets attracted to Boys/teens/adolescence whatever and their Spouses know and accepts about that.

What i am not really open for is Harry/Draco, because the Malfoy has already a "unglory" reputation Among the Maincharacters, so the Spouses wouldnt be appreciate it, i guess.


** I like Harry/Hemione/Ron pairing a lot, but NOT in the context of cheating on Harry's spouse. I want them to openly and proudly declare their relationships, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771).

If you are looking for explicitly bisexual scenes, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/955771/chapters/1870387][No Boundaries]], linkao3(No Boundaries), is pretty good.

  Harry, Ron and Hermione missed out on a lot of sexual experiences in school because of their adventures on their quest to stop Voldemort. Now that the war is over, Hermione decides its time to change that. And she has books!

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

*** That isn't really... logical. "Being Open and Declaring" as if anyone cares? I could just imagine Neville simply shrugging and going back to his potted plants, but the rest of the Gryffindor common room didn't even acknowledge that they said anything.

** Hmm not many that I know of where Ginny is cool with it or accepting - in most fics they either don't get married or get divorced because of Harry being gay or bi. Also it's a plot in a lot of Drarry fics. But here are some that kinda fit.

One that you might like is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/67770][Stilllife]]. This is a canon-compliant Snarry that, if it wasn't so sad, would make some good head canon for a Snarry shipper. Snape, more or less, mentors and then befriends Harry while he is stuck as a painting in the limbo between life and death. They become friends and in a very unlikely way, fall in love. The plot has very little to it, but the writing is so well done and the characters felt so real that I loved it.

You also might like [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/105318][The sketchbook]] . This fic is really unusual. Most basically, Teddy brings Sirius forward in time through a magical notebook and sleeps with him. When Harry finds out, it causes him a lot of emotional distress because he was (unrequitedly) in love with Sirius before his death and is now married to Ginny.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/391011][Together]] is a really unique and smutty trio-fic. It's a one-shot but there is a little bit of plot there too and a dark look at what could have happened if Harry had a certain type of spell damage after the war. Some non-con elements.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5519225/1/The-Abysmal-Dating-Life-of-Harry-Potter][The Abysmal Dating Life of Harry Potter]] is a Harry/Ron I really liked. No ginny or Hermione romance in it though. It's a really sweet and funny Ron/Harry get together fic set a few years after the war. It is a Ron POV fic and this author writes a hilarious internal monologue for Ron. I was smiling the whole time I read it

  Sketching portraits of Sirius Black had been Teddy's way of avoiding life in the present for years. He never expected one of them would come to life, but then, he might have known that interacting with any kind of magical parchment invented by a Marauder would only open up one epic can of worms.30,800 words. NC-17. Sirius/Teddy. Past Sirius/Remus. Past unrequited Sirius/Harry. Entirely canon- and Epilogue-compliant, including deaths, marriages and offspring. Teddy is 19. Written for bigbangblackout. Summer 2009.

  Dating's tough when you're Harry Potter. Ron watches his best friend go through some very bad dating experiences, while going through some awkward ones of his own. H/R slash. Please note the rating and warnings inside.

***** I must admit I fell in love with the fic at this point because this is TOTALLY A HERMIONE THING TO DO:

#+begin_quote
  I wasn't with Hermione very long, but frankly, I never wanted to have sex with her. She was an attractive girl and all, but I always had this terrible fear that halfway through she'd pull out Sex, a History and say, "No, Ron. See, on page 113, it clearly states that the thrusts should start much slower, then increase in pace at the properly spaced intervals. This is why I bought you that study organizer!"

*** Oh, sorry i forgot to mention. Beside Draco, Snape isnt also very fancy to read with Harry (Snape with Harry is even more unlikely than Draco/Harry), but the main thing, that let me avoid is that Snape is much older than Harry.

Hm, ok, if its that hard to find Fics, than i will also accept Fics with Ginny (or Hermione) find out (or Harry/Ron confess) and she divorce. But the Core of those Fics should be epilogue-compliant (or atleast to some degree). I like to read Stories with Harry/Ron are happy married, but then after Years somehow detect a new "sexuality" inside.
