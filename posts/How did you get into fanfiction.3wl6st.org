I'm honestly curious how different people get into the world of fanfiction. I had read a few things a long time ago. Then a few years ago my roommate at uni who got me started on Naruto and then my love of Harry Potter led me to the stuff I read now. I've even wrote a few things.

For Mods why did you become one?


** I was deeply unsatisfied by the HP canon epilogue so I wanted to read about alternatives, or even what happened in those 19 years.

***** I agree with you on all of them playing a significant part of Harry's life but what about Ginny and Ginny's life. What about the people Ginny loved, lost and was inspired by. If there's one thing we know about the Weasley family it's that they care deeply about family. The idea that Ginny wouldn't have anyone she wanted to honour or didn't want to honour anyone is (to me) absolutely ludicrous.

This bugged me when I was seventeen and it still bugs me today.

****** Ginny's not someone who would agree to something she didn't want, so I've always assumed that Ginny, out of love for Harry and out of respect for the fact that he had no siblings to pass on family names, agreed to the names. I like to think she suggested Luna. We do see that George's son is Fred and Percy's daughter is Molly, so some of the names Ginny might have considered have been used there.

For those who don't know, Worm is the heartwarming story of a girl who gets superpowers and decides that she's gonna become a hero. She makes lots of new friends and defeats lots of villains with the help of a beautiful angel who loves to sing.

** Firefly was cancelled.

I went looking to see if more stuff was available in book form and stumbled onto a Jayne/River fic on literotica. Searching for more brought me to Browncoat, Green eyes which is a crossover to HP. This story was much better than most of the Firefly fanfic, and I reasoned out that ~300,000 fics for the fandom would give better odds of finding good stories than ~2,300.

** I had read a couple Harry Potter oneshots over the years but never really got into it. Then last year I binged 5 seasons of this show called Chuck on Netflix in 2 weeks but was very unsatisfied with the ending. On this one blog about the series finale I saw someone suggested this long fanfic that was written to help some people get closure with the show and I gave it a chance. The next month I read a whole bunch more Chuck fanfics but eventually read all the good stuff and got bored. I really liked fanfics by this point though. I read a few about different shows I'd watched and books I'd read. I've always been a Harry Potter fan and had read the series several times over but tried to move on and focus other stuff which I did for about 2 years but that all changed again when I realised I should check out Harry Potter fanfics. I was dumbfounded by the amount that I saw out there. I started out reading post DH stories, then H/G missing moments, then full on H/G AU, then finally broke down and tried other pairings, time travel fics, dimension travel and everything else.

**** Not specifically but I can probably find it again. Ikr! My favorite show of all time. Watching the episode Chuck vs Sarah drove me crazy. I came to terms with the ending eventually because it was hopeful but the first time I watched it I died inside. So many seasons of will they wont they. Finally to have them overcome the odds and then it's all ripped away from us in the span of 2 episodes. When they first realized that Sarah was losing some memories, all I felt was dread. I'm like they wouldn't do that to us would they? They won't end the show like this? Anyway, I can rant about the ending forever. At least one good thing came out of it. I got into fanfics which lead me to this amazing subreddit.

** About four years ago my youngest sister (I'm five years older and the eldest) started getting into Percy Jackson fanfiction. The only exposure I'd had to fanfiction before that was through The Weird Kid at school who wouldn't shut up about it, and I was a little worried for my (at the time) 11 year old sister. So I checked it out a bit and ended up getting hooked myself. Never got into Percy Jackson myself, but I spent a few years jumping from fandom to fandom - anything where I was familiar with canon - then was pretty into Sherlock for a while, and finally moved to Harry Potter a little less than a year ago.

I left it alone for awhile and then I really got into the idea of dramione, and ended up branching into fanfics for like eight or nine different fandoms. Like one commenter said I also read chuck fics, and I am now really into PJO as well. It's hard to read fan fiction and not get into HP, it was actually reading some early fan fiction that made me want to go back and actually read the series all at once as an adult back in 2011.

** Everyone here is making me feel ancient. My first fanfics were in the Star Trek fandom, ffs (Next Generation, though. I'm not quite old enough for original Kirk/Spock). I read them on /Usenet/. I think I found them simply because the fanfic group was a sub-group to the regular fan discussion group, and easy to discover.

Then there was a several-year break until I discovered Buffy fics. And then I learned to search in every fandom that sounded at all interesting.

** I got into fanfic a few years ago after I discovered JKR had "endorsed" a new series called The James Potter Series. She hasn't really endorsed it, but she did mention it something along the lines of being compliant with her series. Anyway, I loved the first two books but fell out with the third one.

Then a while back I offered the then top mod here CatholicGuy any help for his subreddits if he should need it. He automatically made me a mod here in addition to several other HP associated subs. It was a huge deal and no one liked me. It made me sad and I almost left, but ended up sticking around since [[/u/denarii]] was very kind and encouraging. I mostly just do behind the scenes mod stuff. My most recent fic was finishing A Difference in the Family which I LOVED! I've asked for more canon compliant fics, but got super busy with work and haven't gotten around to them yet, but I will soon since school is going on break meaning there are no more papers and exams to grade. I'm not sure which I'll read next, but I have a bunch saved. Link me to your recommendations if you wish! I like canon compliant and wanna try something marauders era next. =]

** First there was Methods of Rationailty. I merely stumbled upon it and didn't even realize I was reading fanfiction till a good dozen of chapters in. It really is more of a parody and comedy than a fanfiction in its purest sense.

Then, well, I became curious. Despite what people think of HPMOR, its an entertaining read and current fantasy releases bored me. So I began to read Vox Corporis, The Firebird Trilogy and Harem Wars (yea... I know).

Never finished the third, but I had a blast with the former two. So now, I'm here.

Unfortunatly I feel like I already read everything by now. 700k fics and so little that I find interesting.
