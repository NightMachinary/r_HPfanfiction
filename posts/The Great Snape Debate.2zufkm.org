Your position? The HP community is divided on this.

EDIT: So my opinion that Snape was actually in love with Lily IS, in fact, unpopular?

EDIT: Also, what do you think of his relationship with the Malfoys?


** I think my views are mostly in line with this section of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4798208/1/An-Interview-with-Justin-FinchFletchley][An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley]] (which is a fun read, if you haven't read it yet.)

#+begin_quote
  LEE: You've read it more carefully than most of us; what do you make of Severus Snape?

  JUSTIN: I think he took Dumbledore's charge very seriously, to protect the students as well as he could. He's still a man you find very difficult either to like or admire, because you get a very strong sense that he was holding his nose all the while at this unpleasant duty to preserve our worthless lives.

  LEE: A lot of us still haven't gotten over the shock of Harry and Ginny naming their last child "Albus Severus."

  JUSTIN: I suppose, Snape used to be the man who hated Harry's father, so he couldn't be forgiven anything; then he was the man who loved Harry's mother, so he could be forgiven everything. But I think of it this way: he was a double agent, a spy for Dumbledore against Voldemort pretending to be a spy for Voldemort against Dumbledore. So he had a choice in how he could present himself. He could have said to Voldemort, "In order to do my job, I have to convince Dumbledore I'm on his side, so I'm going to go easy on Potter and his friends, unpleasant as that is", or he could do the opposite, tell Dumbledore he had to constantly persecute all the 'Mudbloods' and their supporters in order to keep up the front for Voldemort. He chose to play it the latter way. Why that choice? It seems obvious he found it easier, more natural, to act that way, found it more pleasant and rewarding to be a malicious bigot.

I'm unconvinced at the reasoning here. Harry saw a memory of James bullying Snape in OOtP and was very angry with his father despite knowing that James also /loved Harry's mother./ There was no rush to forgiveness there. It sounds more poetic than factual.

#+end_quote

"Dumbledore, I have to be mean to the muggleborns so Voldemort doesn't suspect that I may actually be soft on them and less than loyal to the cause." "Ok my boy, do whatever you need to do! Lemon drop?"

"Voldemort, I have to play nice with the mud bloods and blood traitors so Dumbledore doesn't suspect me of being still loyal to you." "Does it look like I give a crap what Dumbledore does or doesn't suspect?! Crucio!"

Of course, that's probably an exaggeration, I'm sure that if Dumbledore were a real human, he would have more concern for the wellbeing of the students, and if Voldemort were a real human he would be more rational and understand the necessities of blending in, but regardless, I think Snape found that he would much rather let down Dumbledore, or approach Dumbledore about 'staying in character', than Voldemort.

Adding to that that Dumbledore was into second chances and redemption with morals and a reputation to maintain, and Voldemort was a paranoid, hunted terrorist unconstrained by conscience or the rule of law, and Dumbledore definitely becomes the safer to cross. As we can see, since he happily allowed Snape to keep on without even a word of temperance.

That considered, I think that saying he "found it more rewarding to be a malicious bigot" is jumping to conclusions. Whether it's true or not, the presented evidence doesn't support that statement at all.

***** +*sheer+

Well, I meant what Justin said about him making a choice, and the choice he made showing his internal character. The choice is presented as both options being equally suitable, and the only differentiating factor being personal preference, when that's not actually the case.

Personally, I don't think he should ever have been made a teacher and I don't think he /wants/ to be a teacher. If he had a choice between researching brand new potions, and teaching dunderheads the basics over and over and over again, I think he'd be out of there so fast he'd leave behind a Snape-shaped hole like in Deathly Hallows. But again, those choices aren't just based on personal preference, because he has to take his position in the war into account. Were he not at the school, he wouldn't be in a position to protect Harry, and he wouldn't be in a position to spy on Dumbledore as well as he can as a teacher. So, both of his masters' roles for him necessitate him to be a teacher at the school regardless of his personal preference.

** Asshole on a personal level, hero on a larger scale, so anti-hero. He did a lot more than just protect Harry. Maybe at 20 years old, Lily being in danger was the only thing to make him switch over, but even then he spied for the Light for months before the Potters were killed, when he could have returned to the Death Eaters at any point. He was clearly worried that a student had been taken to the Chamber of Secrets, tried to protect the students from the Carrows (sending them to detention with Hagrid was the example JKR gave us), saved Katie Bell's life, saved Draco in so many ways, risked his cover trying to save Lupin over Little Winging, and "Lately, only those whom I could not save" in response to "How many men and women have you watched die?". And he followed through with the plan to end Voldemort when he personally had the least reason to, when he found out that his commitment to Lily was meaningless (that Harry had to die), and that he had to kill Dumbledore (which he REALLY didn't want to do, despite being bound by the Vow, and almost backed out of even at the last moment).

Also, re-establishing his position as a spy in GoF was a major badass moment. He arrived to Voldemort two hours late, Voldemort intended to kill him because he thought Snape had thwarted him on the Stone ("“One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed, of course ... and one, who remains my most faithful servant has already re-entered my service.”). The first is Karkakoff, the last is Barty Crouch Jr, and the one who would be killed ("left me forever") is Snape. Snape mentions Voldemort's "initial displeasure" to Bellatrix in HBP, that most likely meant a bit of torture while being interrogated.

Of course it was reprehensible for him to treat Harry and the other students the way he did (though I'd say that with regards to Harry, his motives are understandable, but not excusable). But as far as assholes in this series goes, even on the Light side, he's up there but he isn't close to the worst. He was a petty, bitter and miserable man, which to me makes his heroic actions even more significant and his character more interesting.

On Lily, it was definitely an unhealthy sort of love and they probably wouldn't have been compatible, but for a person as isolated and emotionally stunted as he was, I'm not surprised it was what it was.

** An ode to Severus Snape.

He is my favorite character in the entire series. I hate him as a person.

I wish he had gotten more explanation behind his character, and in a series of reveals rather than dumping it on us all at once. Same with his motivations. I guess it was cut in favor of keeping the story simpler, which I can understand. J.K. Rowling wrote the HP series for children and young teenagers.

Snape ruined potions for about 1-2 generations of kids at Hogwarts who were in Gryffindor, and possibly for other houses as well. He was petty to Harry, and mind-fucked him without teaching a bit of occlumency. He allowed his house to run rampant in Hogwarts, rather than reigning them in through some clever manner.

But he turned spy on Voldemort, at great risk to his life, even if it was motivated by his obsession with Lily Potter. He spent the last years of his life spying and sabotaging the killer of the only love of his life. Let's make this clear: he would frequently stare into the eyes of the person who killed Lily, and somehow pass himself off as a loyal servant.

Does the good outweigh the bad? I don't know. The books were never very specific on what Snape learned as a spy, except for a few snippets of information here and there. All I know is that he grew up with a vicious upbringing, he got into the wrong crowd, he lost the love of his life, and turned bitter. He had to stare at a physical reminder of his obsession's death (Harry) in class. Everyone hated him, both through his own actions and actions beyond his control.

After Lily stopped being friends with him through his own actions, he stopped having anything pleasant in his life. His life was shit, and it ended violently.

Let's have a moment's applause for one of the best written children's character, Severus Snape.

** I'm going to assume that you're asking about how we feel the way Snape was portrayed in canon and not how we best like to see him characterized in our favourite fanfics.

I don't think his motivations really jelled with his decisions. Even though he was ultimately revealed to be Dumbledore's man through and through - just like Harry - I'm not convinced that he made the right choices before and after joining the OOtP.

Why did Voldemort attempt to spare Lily? If it was because Snape asked his master for the favour but did /not/ seek to extend the same courtesy to James then he's a crazy stalker who couldn't overcome her earlier rejection of his friendship (and possible romantic intentions).

His hyperbolic cruelty to the other houses and blatant favouritism of his own house don't have to go hand in hand with his decision to remain as an undercover spy. Why be so blatantly obvious? It just put a lot of pressure on JKR to eventually come up with a reason for Dumbledore to keep Snape around: the Prophecy.

My own opinion is that just because Ron was wrong about Severus /only/ being a 'greasy git' doesn't mean that Snape gets a pass for every other negative action he took.

I suspect it comes down to the reader's own values. For me, his behaviour doesn't balance. Other people feel differently and that's fine too.

*** To be fair to Snape, he was hardly more of a stalker than James Potter was. At least Lily and Snape were friends for a while, Lily /hated/ James for most of her life, but James never left her alone, going as far as to hold her friend hostage to get Lily to date him. Well, Lily does like her stalkers....

***** Lol, James in SWM we saw James ask her out multiple times, threaten to hex her and use Snape as a bargaining chip to emotionally blackmail her into a relationship ("Go out with me and I'll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again").

And even in Seventh Year, when he was Head Boy, he continued to bully Snape when he was in every position to stop their "feud" if he wanted to (and JKR called what the Marauders did to Snape "relentless bullying"), and if Snape was the main instigator James wouldn't have had to hide it from Lily.

Harry was so disturbed by James that he thought James had forced Lily into marrying him. And when did Snape follow Lily? After he apologized for calling her a Mudblood and she told him to fuck off, he fucked off. Apparently he was around her so infrequently that Sirius and Lupin never even made the connection that Lily and Snape had been friends. And if he had followed her around, you don't think they'd know that?

** I think that JKR ultimately failed in her attempt to make Snape a sympathetic and likable character. In the final books, we are meant to see him as someone brave, remorseful, and willing to sacrifice himself for the good of others; none of that was impossible, but his actions simply do not add up.

/Philosopher's Stone/ has the closest thing to a matching characterization with the ending. Snape is spiteful and cruel toward Harry, but we also see him as the red herring in the mystery of the stone. Snape saves Harry's life at the Quidditch match and is shown constantly harassing Quirrell. It is entirely reasonable, in light of the first book only, that Snape could become the sort of character that epilogue-Harry thinks he is: brave, self-sacrificing, etc.

The trouble is that there are quite a few books in between, and Snape only grows more hateful and petty as time goes on. Whether it is his continuing favoritism of Slytherin and Draco in particular, his ire toward Remus, or his hatred of Harry, he just gets worse with no parallel development either of an internal narrative or some related understanding on Harry's part. This dilemma is not confined to Snape; Ginny suffers from it, as does Ron. None of them get the sort of character development they really need to become the people JKR envisions in the epilogue.

Why does Snape so adamantly oppose Voldemort in book one, but expect to be accepted with open arms later? Why does Voldemort believe him? Why does he try to get his class to recognize Remus as a werewolf? Why does he display such hatred for Harry as a "contrivance," but could find no similar rationale for simply ignoring him? Why does he dismiss Harry's concerns at the end of book five, knowing full well that Harry has a link with Voldemort? Why the charade at the close of book six, when it would have been simple to let Harry know the truth?

Snape has problems as a character, but he's hardly the only one. Part of the fun of fanfiction is taking what we have and building an explanation that is consistent with what we see and what we want.

FWIW I hate Snape, in canon and in fanfics. But he could have been a contender, and JKR let us down.

#+end_quote

He wasn't accepted back with open arms, Voldemort meant to kill him when he returned to him in GoF, because he thought Snape had betrayed him on the Stone. Snape came to Voldemort two hours late, after the resurrection. At the graveyard, Voldemort said "One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed, of course ... and one, who remains my most faithful servant has already re-entered my service.” The first is Karkakoff, the last is Barty Crouch Jr, and the one who would be killed ("left me forever") is Snape. Snape mentioned Voldemort's "initial displeasure" in HBP and we learn, as he was telling Bellatrix, that he was interrogated over many things.

#+begin_quote
  Why does Voldemort believe him?
#+end_quote

Evidently Snape was a good enough bullshitter and Occlumens. And the fact that he was willing to risk so much just to re-establish his position as a spy speaks volumes about how badly he wanted to take down Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Why does he try to get his class to recognize Remus as a werewolf?
#+end_quote

That scene happened the day after Sirius broke in, and Snape sincerely thought Remus was helping Sirius into the castle (and told Dumbledore as much). He wasn't exactly wrong about that either, Remus, while still thinking Sirius was a mass-murderer, deliberately withheld critical information (that Sirius was an animagus, that he knew the secret passageways, the Marauder's Map) on him, even after Sirius broke in multiple times, attacked the Fat Lady, and stood over Ron's bed with a knife. He also thought that Lupin was in on the "werewolf prank" that nearly got him killed as a teenager. Note though that Snape also tried to save Lupin's life in Deathly Hallows, during the battle over Little Winging.

#+begin_quote
  Why does he display such hatred for Harry as a "contrivance," but could find no similar rationale for simply ignoring him?
#+end_quote

Because he is a miserable, damaged asshole. Harry was the mini-copy of James, who according to JKR "relentlessly bullied" him, and every time he looked at him he saw James's face and Lily's eyes. Not at all saying this excuses his bullying, but Snape himself was bullied pretty bad and abused by his parents (and he never got any help for either), and he took out his unresolved issues on kids. It should be noted though that he did care about saving lives for their own sakes, rather than just Harry because of Lily. Dumbledore asked "How many men and women have you watched die?" to which he replied "Lately, only those whom I could not save".

#+begin_quote
  Why does he dismiss Harry's concerns at the end of book five, knowing full well that Harry has a link with Voldemort?
#+end_quote

What, you mean when Harry told him Padfoot was being tortured at the DoM? He didn't, he just couldn't say anything in front of Umbridge. Dumbledore said that Snape immediately checked up on Sirius to make sure he was still at Grimmauld Place, that earlier he'd given Umbridge the fake Veritaserum when she was going to question Harry about Sirius's location, that he'd worked out that the DoM deal was a trap and immediately sent Order members there.

#+begin_quote
  Why the charade at the close of book six, when it would have been simple to let Harry know the truth?
#+end_quote

Sorry, but I have no clue what you're talking about here. Are you saying that Snape should have told Harry that he had to kill Dumbledore? In that case, the fault lies with Dumbledore, who didn't tell anyone that he told Snape to kill him. Dumbledore and Snape were the two most well informed people on the war plan, but for strategic purposes, Dumbledore was the ultimate mastermind and got to choose what to divulge and who to divulge to. Now logically, as few people as possible should have known about this plan (in case someone got caught and somehow let slip, through torture or legilimency, for instance), but apparently Dumbledore told no one that Snape was told to kill him. I'm sure Snape would have wanted someone to know (he also REALLY didn't want to kill Dumbledore), but Dumbles, for a variety of reasons, chose to keep that part of the plan completely secret.

From the way she speaks of him, I don't think JKR intended for Snape to be a likeable and sympathetic character. Pitiful and tragic in certain respects, and his bravery should certainly be acknowledged, but we're not meant to like him as a person (though on that note, somehow she expects us to like the Marauders as people). Although given her double standards and what some of her "likable" characters do, I personally am fine liking this asshole as a person.

**** With regard to the first two:

The trouble is, this does not answer why he is openly willing to defy Voldemort in book one, to Voldemort's face, and then turn around and expect anything but death. We know that Voldemort is an unforgiving, casual killer. The trouble is not that JKR gives us a few lines about how much it sucked to get back in his good graces; the trouble is that the explanation makes no sense given what we know about Voldemort. There is no explanation that would justify Snape's opposition in book one, or if there is, JKR was unable to formulate one.

Regarding Lupin, the issue is that Snape is not coming forward with this information; he's giving essay assignments instead. He believes Lupin is complicit in the prank back when they were in school, and further believes he's helping Sirius? I think that's entirely accurate, but it in no way jives with his reaction. I'm willing to accept Dumbledore saying he can do nothing if he brings it up, but the question is then whether he trusts Dumbledore's judgement or not. If he does not, then why does he never act against Dumbledore's advice or interests?

#+begin_quote
  Because he is a miserable, damaged asshole. Harry was the mini-copy of James, who according to JKR "relentlessly bullied" him, and every time he looked at him he saw James's face and Lily's eyes. Not at all saying this excuses his bullying, but Snape himself was bullied pretty bad and abused by his parents (and he never got any help for either), and he took out his unresolved issues on kids. It should be noted though that he did care about saving lives for their own sakes, rather than just Harry because of Lily.
#+end_quote

If this is accurate, then surely he is not a character one can really like, and certainly not one you name your kids after. I also take issue with this kind of justification. He had a hard life? So did Voldemort. So what? He makes Neville miserable every year, so much so that even Neville's boggart is Snape! This coming from a boy who fears being a squib and has to confront the evidence of Death Eater violence against his parents every day. Characters have flaws; I get that. Snape's flaws apparently manifest in child abuse when he's in a position of power. I cannot un-ironically like such a character or excuse this in any way.

#+begin_quote
  What, you mean when Harry told him Padfoot was being tortured at the DoM? He didn't, he just couldn't say anything in front of Umbridge. Dumbledore said that Snape immediately checked up on Sirius to make sure he was still at Grimmauld Place, that earlier he'd given Umbridge the fake Veritaserum when she was going to question Harry about Sirius's location, that he'd worked out that the DoM deal was a trap and immediately sent Order members there.
#+end_quote

The difficulty here is that nothing about what happens is immediate. Snape does not give them any assistance directly that they can see, and further he does not get things moving in anything like a timely fashion. This is another issue by JKR - the timing of the flight to the DOM and the battle, then the Order of the Phoenix showing up, is all wrong if Snape actually told them what was happening. Also, this is again an issue about Harry's connection with Voldemort. I can understand him telling Harry nothing, but this should be something he watches over personally. Based on what we see in book five, it looks like he's either lazy or incompetent.

The bit about book six is important, because it is the moment when Snape appears to validate Harry's hatred by going over to the enemy publicly. Pinning this on Dumbledore in no way changes the fact that Snape agrees to go along with it. Putting aside the various other issues with book six, there is no reason why Dumbledore cannot communicate this information to Harry directly or have Snape do it himself, and in fact not doing so is detrimental to the fight against Voldemort.

Snape is supposed to be redeemed by his love for Lily and his sacrifice against Voldemort. Harry clearly believes this at the close of book seven, and it is just as clear that we are meant to forgive Snape's trespasses as readers. I do not, and I believe I am not alone in thinking this. Snape does not show remorse; he does not care for Harry; his "love" for Lily is of a very dubious character. There is too much contrivance and too little development; Snape has no redemptive arc.

Nevertheless, that's fandom, and that's why we're here chatting about it. We'll just have to agree to disagree concerning Snape.

**** I can see that, certainly. Fan perception in Harry Potter is particularly interesting because of the timing of fandom entry for people. The long gap between books four and five bred a certain kind of fan; the film releases, which served to introduce new fans, bred another. In these latter days, when all the books and films are finished, approaching the series is a very different thing than it was fourteen years ago. Consequently, fandom perceptions are drastically different now, since all speculation has to be post-facto.

** Amazingly written character - will go down in literary history. Still in shock over that twist seven years later. Totally thought he was playing for both sides, just wanted to align himself with the winners. I love that he wound up having a softer side.

As a person...I hate him. He's an asshole. I'm so glad Lily had standards because he was horrible to her, and then he was a dick to children. As someone who works in education, you don't ever treat a child like that. I don't care if the child is literally a tiny Hitler, you don't act like that. Ever. I'm glad he's dead.

Also, I have a joke: "Why did Snape stand in the middle of the road?"

*** Going down in history is a bit much. Technically he *was* playing both sides. Up until the last possible moment he pretended to be loyal to Voldemort. Rather than lying and saying he was the master of the Elder Wand to make Voldemort falsely believe he holds its full power, he tried to claim he wasn't. While true, he was remarkably self serving.

** He has attachment issues. He fights for the 'light' side partially because he believes they can win and are safer in the aftermath. Partially because he knows Dumbledore is powerful and has a plan that is relatively sane compared to Voldemort's 'kill everything that says maybe or worse' policy. If Voldemort wasn't a merciless bastard to his own followers I could easily see Snape playing both sides for his own benefit or joining the 'dark' entirely once Dumbledore was dead.

*** That goes against pretty much all of canon. Snape was on Voldemort's side with no intention of switching until he started targeting the Potters. I highly doubt Snape gives two shits about morality; if Voldemort had targeted Neville instead he'd probably still be a loyal DE. Imo, his most defining characteristic is his love for Lily. Not that I'm defending him in any way, I still think he's an asshole, but I'm pretty sure the character you're portraying is nowhere near JK Rowling's Snape.

********** I guess that would be the point of contention. It was never framed in terms of his getting revenge? It was always his remorse for his role in Lily's death and opting to protect Harry from Voldemort to repent. I don't think he ever fully conceptualised how, or had confidence in, Harry being able to defeat Voldemort or Voldemort's downfall, he was just invested in Harry's protection and the ongoing resistance to him. He was also horrified that Harry had to die as dictated by Dumbledore.

********** If Snape was only focused on revenge, don't you think he would have taken on a more active role in Voldemort's downfall? Usually when a character has revenge as a sole motivator, they want to play the main (or at least a very direct and significant) role in the downfall of whoever their trying to kill. Snape had a pretty indirect role, most of his actions went towards supporting the Order. He knew that Dumbledore had told Harry how to kill Voldemort, but he never made a serious attempt to find out what it was or involve himself with it.

Also, he was horrified that Harry had to be killed in order to kill Voldemort. And he himself /really/ didn't want to kill Dumbledore even though it would accelerate the plan to take down Voldemort, and even tried to talk him out of it. He was still bound by the Unbreakable Vow too, I take it that he would died rather than kill Dumbledore.

As [[/u/zojgruhl]] said, there's nothing to indicate that he was particularily focused on revenge or that was his main reason for doing what he did (nor has JKR said that).

**** Well this thread is for our position, not strictly canon. I will however make a minor edit to my original comment. He definitely didn't give a shit about morals. However he didn't support the pure-blood philosophy and would generally prefer Voldemort not win whatever he was playing at both for his own safety as a half-blood and Lily was a muggle-born so I doubt he wanted them to be treated like vermin if possible.

Overall I agree with you, I just worded it badly the first time.

** Snape thought he was in love with Lily, but this was an "obsessive love" i.e. not really love, but a selfish obsession that was all about his own gratification, like a stalker. Note how he didn't care what happened to James or Harry, just Lily.

I believe that Snape fully believed in Voldemort's philosophy and outlook, he just had personal beef with Voldemort over Lily. You can see this in all his interactions in class, with Hermione, his choice of friends during and after school.

He was a petty, cruel man who took sadistic pleasure in others' pain, especially the pain of children.

He was at least highly talented, probably the third most powerful wizard we met after Voldemort and Dumbledore.

** Snape is a great character, he's multi dimensional and very interesting. He's believable.

That said, I fucking hate him. I can't stand this fucking character, and I don't understand why people like him. Let me lay out how much of a loser this motherfucker is:

He's a man whose entire life was dictated by his bullies at school, and by his eternal hard on for a woman who never wanted him. Snape is that pathetic, bitter guy from high school bitching about being "friend zoned" by the hottie who wouldn't have fucked him if her life literally depended on it. Even worse, he allows himself to be brought into a clearly terrorist group and clearly has no real problems with their actions as long as it doesn't affect him personally. Muggles/muggleborns being raped and murdered? No issue what so ever. His long lost "love" (read: woman he creepily stalks who wants nothing to do with him) is killed /because of his incompetence/, and suddenly the world is going to end.

Oh wait, but it's not a big enough deal to stop him from utterly despising this woman's son, and being terrible to him at every possible moment.

Sirius at least had some excuse for his immature behavior. He'd been locked up in a prison for 12 years, surrounded by literal depression machines. He really was never allowed to grow up. Snape had no such excuse, he had his chance.

Seriously, those people who swoon at the "always" line baffle me. You think /that/ was a beautiful moment? I look at that and wonder if Snape ever even kissed someone. It would be sad if Snape hadn't willingly put himself in the position of being incredibly pathetic in the first place.

Edit: OH WAIT, I'M BACK. Because you know what, Snape is even worse than those shitty cunts whining about being "friend zoned". Why? Because at least those motherfuckers acknowledged that they just wanted to get their dicks wet in the first place. Snape convinced himself that he was /better than that/. he /lurved/ Lily, he didn't want to just fuck her, he wanted to be with her, even though it was clear that he didn't even understand how to function as decent human being, much less as part of a family.

Seriously, Snape got the death he deserved. Fuck him.

*** Tbch, I'm not exactly sure why you're completely discounting any love Snape may have had for Lily?

I mean, he knew this girl since they were both little tiny children. She was the one person who accepted him as a human being, no matter what, who provided him first a refuge from his abusive home environment, and then defended him against vicious bullies that the teachers of his school were too enamoured with to stop?

His actions in protecting her by asking Voldemort to spare her life, changing his side in the war due to her death, and cherishing her memory would make sense to me even if there was absolutely 0 sexual aspect to his feelings for her and he found her ugly as a troll on the outside.

This is the one girl who ever treated him decently in his entire life. He would be enamoured with her and her "beautiful soul" regardless of whether he wanted to bang her or not.

Of course, that doesn't make him a good person.

But you making this inherently sexual and invalidating any love he may have felt really doesn't make any sense at all.

Additionally, she was his best friend for what, six, seven years? Calling her the hottie who doesn't want anything to do with him is a major stretch.

** Part of the problem in characterizing Snape lies in the fact that despite their depth, the books were ultimately written for children. There are literally no sympathetic Death Eaters or other villains except maybe Regulus Black, so JKR doesn't have to give Slytherins good qualities. This means Snape is free to divide the houses and the Slytherins are never responsible for their actions, except the one detention in book 1.

And although I believe its only officially in fanfiction, the idea that Snape is subverting the war for the light is probably true. He requires an Outstanding to go into NEWT classes, which we know is required for being an auror, and probably for being a healer. Only a few non-Slytherins probably make it into NEWT classes, which reduces the Ministry's and St. Mungo's effectiveness.
