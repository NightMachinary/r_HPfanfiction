So I did some rereads of the scene between Harry and Snape where he's "teaching" him Occlumency in book 5 and when Snape performs it on him after Harry does Sectumsempra on Harry. Nowhere in either of the passages is it described as him "feeling Snape in his mind" like I see so m any fanfics portray Occlumency.

in Book 6 "He strugged to block out all though, but try as he might, the half-blood prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making swam hazily to the forefront of his mind. and then he was starting at Snape again"

In book 5 it seems all that happens when Snape casts legilimency is that many images from Harry's childhood flash before his eyes. In the second Occlumency lesson we see, Harry does able to fight off Snape and it's described as his images becoming fainter and him being able to slowly see Snape in the room again.

There's also a strong implication that Lupin can do Legilimency. He's described as staring at Harry "as if he could read his mind" and the same thing again when Lupin is looking at Sirius when they init ally meet up again at the Shrieking Shack.

Since Harry and Voldemort share a soul, it's a different situation when doing Occlumency/Legilimency between them. Harry having a piece of Voldemort's soul has only happened once between them as no one else has made more than one Horcrux therefore, we can't extrapolate how Occlumency/Legilimency works from an interactions between them.


** My take on it is that you can tell someone's using legilmancy on you by those flash's and skilled occlumens are able to push the person out or lead them around certain memories and if we're going that route then in most cases Harry would know of legilmancy and make the connection this person is looking at me and I'm having these flashes. My head cannon if there is no argument that snape isn't teaching occlumency is that it is a) a truly difficult thing to master and b) a gradual degradation from brute force attacks to sneakier stuff. My thought has always been that legilmancy works off connections. A leads to b which leads to C which is what you're looking for so occlumency would be blocking those connections or keeping your mind and theirs away from certain thoughts without shoving things in front because doing that would leave a path. I think the biggest misconception I've seen is the mindscape, sorting thoughts, mind duels.

*** Indeed, those mindscape fanon feels shity to the extreme. The way I imagined legilimency is: the attacker wants an information from his victim, let's say Voldemort wants the prophecy from Harry for example. He would manipulate Harry's thoughts to lead him to thinking about the wording. First, make him think about the war, then about those who died. From there, Sirius's death is a simple leap for Harry to take. Now make him feel the guilty for his part in it, and about all the innocent people dying when the 'chosen one' could save them, when he is the only one who could save them. That's when he makes his final move to direct Harry's thoughts to the prophecy and its wording.

And the occlumency is the opposite, the mastery of one's mind and how he tends to think, what his thought process is, so he could recognise an outside attempt at manipulating his thoughts. If Harry gets over Sirius's death, if he processes the weight of the prophecy in a healthy manner, he'd stop associating the war with guilt. And if he's aware he wouldn't immediately feel guilty about the deaths, in other words if he's an accomplished occlumense, he would recognise the attempted manipulation.

It is actually pretty similar to an interrogation portrayed as a conversation where one person tries to make the other admit to something or reveal information without wanting to. Ä°t is pure manipulation.

**** Yeah but I'd go even further and say that a skilled occlumens would be able to manipulate the associations.i feel like emotions wouldn't be a good thing to rely on though because there's so much a person can feel an emotion towards. I'd argue Voldemort wants the prophecy so it would be like chosen one as the focus, the reason why, learning the prophecy would probably be a major point in his mind. Or even focus on the first 2 lines and learn the rest from there. I'd also say that a legilmens sees your memories the way you see them.

***** There has to be a way to manipulate one's own memories though. Otherwise Snape would never be able fool Voldemort. And we know manipulation of one's own memories without affecting the long term memory itself is possible from Slughorn's false memory.

****** I think it is a mainly avoiding the signs of betrayal. Block the memories proving snape as a traitor from showing up. And a false memory manipulation to lie is shown to be obvious though.

******* Perhaps a matter of expertise? Snape could simply be better than Slughorn, so much so that the memory he falsifies shows little to no sign of being false.

******** True. However I honk the safest bet in this case would be to use as few false memories as possible because there is always the chance that discrepancies would be discovered leading to torture.

********* Or Snape and Dumbledore could simply just stage things to create real memories with the fake info.

There's also the matter of all good deceptions being based in truth -- I don't think Snape ever used outright false memories, but I can definitely see him use memories out of context, outright staged memories, etc, to give Voldemort mostly (but not entirely, to make it seem legitimate) fake info.

****** I assumed that Slughorn pulled that memory out and then messed with it rather than manipulating it while it was still in his mind.

**** The fanon concept of a mindscape probably originated as simply being a false memory that you get used to forcing whenever you're attacked. This alone isn't weird, aside from it necessitating the premise that you can project false memories (which is itself fanon). The problem with it is that people ran with it and added the concept of very elaborate "mindscape fortresses" and where you have "mind wars" and similar which is nothing like how Legilimency/Occlumency is supposed to work. Really, a simple nondescript wall would be a much simpler setup and accomplish the same thing.

** Fanon Occlumency can create false memories and allow you to bypass Veritaserum. I don't think either is true (it's not explicit canon and I find both things doubtful).
