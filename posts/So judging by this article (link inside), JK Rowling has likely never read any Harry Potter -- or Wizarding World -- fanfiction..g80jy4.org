This article is about a different author, but it gives examples of the author tweeting about how they can't read fanfiction about their own stories. So judging by this, it seems we can guess that JK Rowling probably hasn't read any Harry Potter fanfiction.


** J.K. has at least some idea of what is happening in the fanom. She has stated her discomfort over the romanticization of Draco.

**** This should be an interesting read. Was it because she said he's gay or because of something else?

** And I know at least in 2016 she was appreciative of how many people were involved with her Harry potter characters she (like most creators) were concerned that fanfiction remains non monetary.

So If she has an idea of how big harry potter fanfiction is I don't think we can immediately assume she's never read it.

** Could you do it? Seriously read fanfiction of something you put your heart into. And then they work a plothole that cuts off a good chunk of your work? Especially when it fits into the story.

Most people couldn't do that. I would have a "Why didn't I think of that?!" moment.

And then there's the legal ramifications like that link.

** There is no hard rule /against/ authors reading fanfiction, a lot of them simply make a vow not to for the reason explained above. The most common objection (that they may find themselves unconsciously inspired by the contents of the fanfic, or come up with similar ideas on their own, and then end up with a potential back-and-forth copyright case if they put those ideas in their next book) is not only a flimsy one in the face of the best lawyers ownership of /Harry Potter/ can buy her, but also, she's done writing the books. There /is/ no next /Harry Potter/ book that could have legally-thorny similarities to a fanfic.
