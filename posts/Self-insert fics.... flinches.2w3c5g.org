So. Yes, I know. Self-inserts are generally horrible. But! - not always. I've been reading some pretty well-written/intriguing SI-fics in other fandoms (e.g., Naruto, DN). However, even the most recced HP SI-fics seem... /not that great/ (litote!).

I've read two pretty interesting ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me]]*

#+begin_quote
  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all. (Formerly titled 'Gilding the Son of Lily').

#+begin_quote
  Gilderoy Lockhart. The one person in the books who was there at a pivotal moment and could have made a difference but was utterly unable to. Until a dimension traveler took over his position.
#+end_quote

And I've glanced at the following:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]]

#+begin_quote
  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot!
#+end_quote

/CONTAINS: squealing fangirl; 'Oh, Mr.Malfoy!'./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]]*

#+begin_quote
  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister.
#+end_quote

/The OC's name is Desdemona Galatea Malfoy./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7434407/1/The-Visitor][The Visitor]]*

#+begin_quote
  A woman from the real world is thrown into the world of Harry Potter, and her foreknowledge of events can be used to save lives, as well as redeeming a bitter potions master.
#+end_quote

/SS/OC romance? Eh./

*INCOMPLETE

I'm reluctant to read them; they seem pretty /bleh/. If ya'll could tell me if they're worth reading....?


** I don't remember which Lockhart self-insert fic it was, but the one I've read turned rather disturbing. The protagonist began rewriting memories left and right, basically [[/blah][mouseover for spoilers]]. And "Lockhart" did all this in a completely self-righteous manner.

Edit: it was My Gilded Life, thanks for reminding me ^{^{now}} ^{^{I}} ^{^{have}} ^{^{to}} ^{^{try}} ^{^{and}} ^{^{forget}} ^{^{again.}}

*** My Glided Life is the one where he murders the Dursleys (even Duddley)

I havent read past this line

#+begin_quote
  I, on the other hand, was of a considerably stronger sort. I had already taken blows that had destroyed me and rebuilt stronger each time. My beliefs and faith in God had brought me through in spite of my trials.

I've known Fundie Christians who could totally convince themselves of the whole "righteous murder" thing.

This brings us to why so many SI stories fail: those who would write SI fiction are often the same kinds of people I cannot identify with nor wish to read about. If your main character sucks because you suck, there's not much that can rescue a story.

I've yet to come across a good HP SI.

If you don't mind my asking, what are some of the good Naruto ones? The only ones of note that I know are /Vapors/, /Dreaming of Sunshine/, and /Reincarnation Roulette/. I'd be interested in reading more.

Hands down best SI fanfiction out there. Even better than Vapors IMO.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9167197/1/Decaying-Bluebells][Decaying Bluebells]] This one is pretty good, one of my favorites.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9782748/1/Forethought][Forethought]] Alright I guess. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10406024/1/Laterality][Laterality]] This one is a bit on the angsty and family side, not much action. Still quite good. Not finished.

Hope i Helped

*** I'm a fan of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9841189/1/Heaven-and-Hell][Heaven and Hell]] which is an SI who's Madara's unfortunately younger sister.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9255749/1/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-no-Jutsu][Deja vu no Jutsu]] is super hit or miss imo. It's not the best written story, but once you force yourself into getting into it there's just so much to enjoy that the investment may be worth someone who particularly enjoys SI-OCs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9942718/1/Clearing-Mist][Clearing Mist]] was okay. Again, not the best, but it was worth reading because the OC was born in Kiri.

** A Curse of Truth isn't very good imo. The main character just turns into a Gary Sue and the conflict doesn't end in a satisfying way imo. The last arc has a big thing going with Hermoine figuring out his secret as the conflict, but she never actually figures out the whole thing. Not to mention the attitude of the SI towards the girls around him is kinda creepy. :/

** I read most of The Visitor. The story was okay but the relationship portion was a bit too angsty for my tastes, really, so I decided to stop reading it partway through. It also is incomplete because the author passed away before she finished the story.

Not sure if it can be considered a self-insert fic 'cause it's an OC and not the author (me) but it's pretty much the same thing, no?

I haven't read any SI fic though, I'd be happy to have some feedback from pros. :)
