I am greatly interested in stories where Harry is put into universes like Star wars, Mass effect, Warcraft and the likes and he builds up his own empire or army. Any such stories you guys have come across which are a good read please share I plan to devote the weekend reading them. Also there is no limit on the universes the above mentioned are basically the ones I have read a few if there are some other universe which has good stories of my liking please do share.


** If you don't mind abandoned fics search up "plums" in ffn. Something that pretty much exactly what you want is Same Song Different Verse by selector also on ffn but it has a lot of smut and the harem is big enough that the female characters stop mattering after the 5th member, this coming from a guy that loves harem fics, but otherwise it's pretty much Empire building in star wars.

**** Yeah I usually finish a chapter by the time he uploads a new one. I've been thinking about just sitting down for a day and catching up, but I haven't gotten around to it.

**** It only takes me 3 days to read a new chapter. I skim a lot in the first reading so I finish quicker. The second reading is where I sit down and read the chapter word for word.
