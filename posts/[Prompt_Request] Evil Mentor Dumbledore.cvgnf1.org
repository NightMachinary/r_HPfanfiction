** "You're an evil, manipulative old goat, old man!" Harry shouted indy-ly. "I won't take it anymore!"

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled, though they look sad. "Harry, I'm disappointed. Did you think I was being evil just for myself?"

"...what?"

"Harry," said Dumbledore grandfatherly, "what possible motive could I have to be evil for myself?"

"Power," spat Harry. "Glory. The ability to meddle in whatever you want."

Dumbledore laughed--a big, aching belly laugh. "Harry, I already have all of those. But you know who doesn't have any of those?"

"Not me!" said Harry indiely. "I went to Gringotts and got emancipated and now I'm /LORD/ Potter."

"Oh, bravo!" said Dumbledore. "It took me much longer to realize I could do that, though no one calls me Lord Gryffindor these days."

Once again, Harry was speechless.

"Oh, come on, Harry," said Dumbledore. "I would've told you to do that eventually. Everything I have done, every manipulative choice I have made, was to groom you as my natural successor."

"Why did you bribe the Weasleys to be my friend?"

"Can you honestly say that you could stand the full force of Ms. Granger without Mr. Weasley as a mediator?"

"Hermione's my friend!"

"No, she's your McGonagall. And can you honestly say you don't want to snog Ginevra?"

"W--what?" said Harry shakily.

"If you played your cards right, you could probably build a harem and have her be okay with it..."

"That's neither here nor there, old man, we're discussing your undue influence on my life! You pedophile."

"Harry," said Dumbledore, "I can accept a bit of teenage rebellion. Heavens, I went positively wild when I was a young man! But I do want you to know that I'm here for you if you need any help at all. Transferring to Ilvermorny, building a harem and making sure Ginny's okay with it, destabilizing a third world country--you name it! I'll help you with anything you need. Just remember-- you're a very bright boy. You will reach great heights even without my help--but together, you can go so much farther. Hear me out."

"...Alright, I guess," said Harry, "but one more wrong move, and I'll shove your wand up your elder ass."

Dumbledore chuckled dumbledorely. "I would expect nothing less, my boy. Now, here's a list of countries with high levels of oppression that could be destabilized with just a few confundus charms in the right place..."
