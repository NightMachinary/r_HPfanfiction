Hello! I'm thinking of writing a fanfic (my first), in the HPverse colliding with the MCU. The prompt basically is the two Earths collide, merging everybody's memories with their alternate universe for the normal people, while the wizards and people who don't exist in the other universe get dragged in the new universe. For example, after the merging, Fury learns that there is magic and whole communities under the radar, while trying to handle the international crises that arise from this event. So, my question is, is somebody interested in a fic like this?

*** I'm planning on using the trio and the original avengers as the main cast, all the others would be supporting characters. I also don't know anything about xmen etc so it would be strictly the mcu.

** I suggest not bothering with this world colliding bit. Just make them start off on the same world. The magical world is already shielded from Muggles, you don't need the dimensional stuff.

Either don't make the MCU magic work like it did in the films (where technically muggles could learn sorcery) or make the differences between HO magic and MCU sorcery clearly different. Like, MCU uses sorcery, where you draw the magic in from an external source or a higher being (like Dormammu) to do supernatural stuff, while HP magic is just the wizard's own power. The HP magic seems way more varied, though arguably less powerful in some areas.

** Yes! There are so many ho/much crossovers that have the same ideas overused (MOD! Harry etc.) but I haven't seen this before - would love to read this, please add a link when the first chapter's up :))

** I most likely wouldn't read it. Reason is that I don't like HP universe as a whole. I only like some of the characters. Rowling left too many unanswered questions and changing the tone of the series half way through did not help.

** It seems like a very interesting concept, I would love to read it!

If you're taking suggestions I would recommend not using overglorrification of the muggle world. Yes it is a big world with lots of good, but I speak as someone who actually lives in real world when I say that the world is not perfect. Making the magical world incapable of beating technology is a real bummer for me. Try to make magic capable of making some real damage, remember, Grindewald almost destroyed Paris with a cursed flame and it was magic, not technology which stopped him. Make Voldemort a real danger for the world as a whole instead of a fool living an illusion.

** Yes i'am but please dont use those tedious tropes.

Make Harry adept with technology, or at least know how to use it.

Dont nerf magic, buff everything else.

Give Harry some quirks, like damn he is a human not a soldier.

Dont make Fury say "TaIl ThE UnKoWn!" Have Harry be found by saving someone.

Dont limit yourself to HO magic only, I would love for Harry to study at the Kamar-Taj or have him learn Asguardian magic.

And finally if there is pairings dont do cross over pairings, their are only two I like in the vast amount of stories. Blood Stained and Child of the Storm/Ghosts of the past being both.

If you merge, might I suggest change the timeline.

Like have Chapter 1 go about Voldemort doing a ritual that goes wrong and the timeline is fucked beyond repair, or space time continuum paired with Thanos snap creates alternate pathway.

Maybe make Thor Harry's dad... like mess the fuck about its fanfiction and I love the MCU and HP!

Shit, I might wrote this now...

** This seems like an interesting idea. I would definitely read this. What's the title of the fic?

***** Thanks for your offer! I do want a beta, but I don't know how betaing(Is that even a verb? If it isn't it should be) works.

** Don't leave out the Sorcerers! I'm interested in the interactions between the two, like perhaps an older, Auror!Harry has learned to see the signs of dark magic, and instantly notices the source of the Ancient One's long life? Perhaps both of them team up, or the sorcerers are absorbed into the wizarding world.

How might the wizards react to (what amounts to) muggles being able to learn magic?

** As other have said, yes many would enjoy that. A few words of advice, it's OK if While the Trio and the Potter Extended cast is Involved don't make them God's compared to the Marvel heroes as well as don't make the Potter characters weakling in need of being saved by the MCU characters. Sure Harry can be a Hero or whatever and stronger or more involved than lets say Luna or George or even Ron, they shouldn't be getting mugged by a guy on the street.

Another thing is when everyone is introduced Harry and Team Potter/Wizard/Hex/Warlock should have their own adventure AFTER, Like Iron Man goes on to fight AIM and Thor goes on to fight The Dark Elves Harry and the team shouldn't be sidekicks where they always have to be around a Marvel Hero, helping and not really effecting the canonical story of those movies.

Finally you have 70 years of comics, there are Giant Monsters, Vampires and Werewolves, Villainous Sorcerers. You can easily take one and they can become villains for a short story for the Potter Crew. Modred the Mystic, Varnae, Fin Fang Foom all three can be very interesting villains for Harry, Hermione, and Ron

** It's certainly more original than the umpteenth "Harry the lone hero saves the MCU" so-called crossover where all of Harry's friends are ignored.

*** Yes! This is something I'm trying to avoid in a story I've had kicking around my drafts awhile, where Hermione is sort of skirting the edges of the law trying to help mutants find sanctuary from the regular humans. It seemed to fit, given her stance on House Elf rights. Other characters would do things too, it's not terribly hard to find something they might also do in a crossover.
