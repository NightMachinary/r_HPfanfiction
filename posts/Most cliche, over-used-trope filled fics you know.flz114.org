For the record, I'm not repeating myself in the title. While I'm sure most know all this, for the edification of those who don't (and I've seen comments made that I'm pretty sure mean some people don't - hopefully this is helpful to y'all), there are distinct differences between Tropes and Cliches.

Tropes are basically everything about a story that's been done before and at this point in time most things in writing are tropes (you could also define it as 'anything that has a TV Tropes page, but actually finding the page can lead to days lost in endless link-hopping so I'll save you from that :D). They're the patterns, archetypes, metaphors, reoccurring themes, etc, that your story is built upon like a house is built upon foundations, providing you a familiar thing to latch onto and relate to in order to ensure you follow along with the story. However good or bad a trope is, you can't write a good story without them, just like you can't build a good house without a foundation. They tend to fall down in brisk winds.

A story without tropes gives the reader nothing really to hold onto or buy into emotionally while you go about your plot. Harry 'leaving the farm' to go to magic school is a trope that introduces us to the world with a sense of child-like wonder and gets us to 'buy in' quicker. Without a trope like that and the metaphor/comparisons to modern British 'back to school' practices, you just get a rote sense of obligatory education, which would make her world introduction kind of dull or some culturally unfamiliar viewpoint that would make the scene impossible to relate to.

Cliches like 'Lord Potter-Black-Emrys-I-write-Sins-Not-Tragedies-Montpellier-Jones' or 'Be nice to a Goblin and he'll give you everything he owns' are just tropes that have been very, very overused and that we're kind of tired of now.

Anyway. Thanks for coming to my /moderately-unrelated/ TED Talk, but maybe someone will find that informative and interesting and useful for future threads. Now onto my actual reason for making this thread thing.

I'd like to see a fic that's utterly filled with tropes, cliches, and whatever other story-writing building block you can think of. As many as possible, good or bad. They can be done seriously, lampshaded, subverted, flipped, fried, or seared lightly over a low heat and covered with a home-made hoisin glaze. Whatever works, I just want to read some cliche shit, yo.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** I suffer from doing this

Linkffn(core threads)

At the start it isn't so bad but god fucking damnit does it get annoying at the end

MoD, god power magic, Lord Harry James too-many-houses, mindscapes, harem and some other things, like building islands, becoming the richest person on the planet in a week and creating the most powerful wardstone in existence in a single afternoon

ALL THIS BEFORE SECOND YEAR

**** Yeeeah, but like 82000 Galleons each are a good motivator for that if you can make thousands of them in a day, although at the start he can only make two

Oh also wandless magic, soul bonds, Goblins worship him for his wardstone crafting and he eats curses

Also food shenanigans

It got to the point where food without curses was bland and Harry had to put so many curses on it that the things became sentient to some degree

***** Sentient food, huh? I think I used that as a nightmare in a D&D game once.

Well, whatever motivates your boat, I guess. Personally, I'd get bored of that many galleons. I buy bugger all that isn't whisky, coffee, groceries, or steam sales, and filling a swimming pool with gold is a bad, bad idea.

Ah, Soul Bonds. Classic cliche fic thing in the HP Fandom. I'll definitely be reading that fic. :D

******* Heh. Have you tried the Lamb Sauce crossover with Gordon Ramsay in? If you like food shenanigans, it's the perfect fic. :D
