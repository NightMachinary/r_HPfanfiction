I just read some slash fics that made me go 'Whhhaaaaatt?' too many times. I just want some actual romantic buildup and not the typical 'I only knew you for a week and I would do anything for you' love at first sight thing. I read a lot of Humor/Adventure but any genre is okay and please no Harry/Snape or Harry/Lucius. Thanks! :)


** I read Drarry slash and a few fics I thought that had good relationship growth were:

*** I also highly recommend Turn. One of my favourites and one of the few fics I've read through more than once because I liked it so much.

Hell, I will probably read it again some day because that is how much I enjoyed it.

**** I'm reading it now and it is great. I didn't even expect the ending for the first chapter, a nice change from all the MoD kind of stuff that uses that plot device. I felt that I was watching a romcom or something.

*** I came across Bond and MLQ a few months ago but I never read them since I don't read romance centric fics. Thank you for your recommendations and for taking the time to link me the stories.

MLQ, TF and Secrets summaries are interesting. I'm gonna read those first. Thanks again! :D

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW01.html][Beautiful World]] by Cinnamon [Harry/Draco] (Be warned, it will break your heart.)

#+begin_quote
  Draco is afraid of living and Harry is afraid of dying, but sometimes the choice isn't offered. Draco's got to learn what it is to really live, while showing Harry how beautiful the world really is when you're not too scared to see it.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BY01.html][Beneath You]] by Cinnamon [Harry/Draco]

#+begin_quote
  Draco had no idea that the repercussions of stealing Potter's journal and shoving it down the back of his trousers would be so extreme.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/48782][Sirius is a Totally Helpful Advice Columnit 'verse]] by duva and fictionalcandie [James/Sirius] (Begins with a couple of Hogwarts-era one-shots, then gets going in "Dear Sirius", which is what the summary below is for.]

#+begin_quote
  Thrice weekly in the Evening Prophet's entertainment section, Sirius Black answers all your questions, from the mundane to the complicated to the just plain weird.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/plumeria/DID.html][Draco in Darkness]] by Plumeria [Harry/Draco]

#+begin_quote
  Following an accident in his seventh year, Draco loses his eyesight. At first he completely withdraws, avoiding any hint of pity, as well as any assistance; he is determined to succeed on his own. But after Harry elbows his way into Draco's dark world, both boys find themselves in a strange new friendship, and they each learn new ways to see each other... and themselves.

#+begin_quote
  Harry thinks "Why is Malfoy working in a coffee shop in muggle London?" is a much simpler question than, "Are you going to accept that auror offer and, if you don't, what will you do?"

Though, do you have anything else that isn't Drarry? :D

**** Heh, I'm hardcore a H/D shipper so most of my fics are them, and many others are Harry/Snape, but I do have a couple. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2052506/1/][The Arrangement]] by Maybe the Moon is Remus/Sirius, but it's only 6,000 words.

#+begin_quote
  Remus and Sirius aren't gay. They just sleep together a lot.
#+end_quote

Also short is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1213036][The Housewarming Party]] by dracogotgame, which is Theo Nott/Piers Polkiss (yes, you read that right) with H/D secondary pairing. It's labelled crack, but the style of writing /isn't/ cracky and it's completely believable story about two strangers meeting in a shop and hitting it off.

#+begin_quote
  Theo needs to find a Muggle gift for Draco's housewarming party. He finds a little something else.
#+end_quote

Oh, can't believe I missed this one the first time around. [[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/100371.html][The Rules of Being a Godson]] by copperbadge [Teddy Lupin/James Potter II]

#+begin_quote
  Teddy Lupin never gets too close or feels too much; his godfather's son never does anything else.

Seconding this, the first slash fics I read and probably still my favorite. /Turn/ by the same author is great as well.

** "Time Heals All Wounds" is incredibly well written femslash, with a somewhat unorthodox pairing - not giving it away.

** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524][Twist of Fate]]/ (700k words, last updated 2 years ago): Harry grows up as Tom's brother. (Hundreds of thousands of words into the story, Harry's friendship with Alphard Black begins to form a romance--but, IIRC, the affection is never actually acknowledged, as of the most recent chapter.)

** For a not so typical slash fic, I immediately thought of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/392764/chapters/645041][The Pure and Simple Truth]]. It gave me an entirely new perspective on certain characters and I love how the focus of the story is not so much on the romance but on the different characters' relationships with each other. It's worth a read.

For humor/adventure, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9771843/1/Kitty-Kitty][Kitty, Kitty]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10470538/1/Letters-From-No-One][Letters From No One]].
