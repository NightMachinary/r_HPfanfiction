Main Pairings: Viktor/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, Luna/Draco

The story follows Hermione in her 8th year of Hogwarts as things get turned on their head. The single woman referenced in the summary is Narcissa Malfoy, and she does indeed make a decision that changes the fate of the world. Features pureblood culture, Muggle-Magical relations, worldbuilding, characters making mistakes, and lots of other little good bits.

Things I like in no particular order:

- Letters feature prominently in this fic and do so wonderfully. They aren't used to rehash plot you've already seen happen; rather, they are used to further plot. The characters truly pour out their hearts into these letters and it's a deeper window into their thinking because they can truly monologue.

- A fair amount of steamy scenes between Viktor and Hermione, tastefully written and full of love.

- The tag "actual healing of war trauma" and the author's comment of "so much character development that you'll want to grow as a person just to keep up" is so accurate. I feel like a different person by reading this fic.

- I can feel how much the author cares about people in general through the way she writes this story. The emphasis on character development, the insight into the human condition, and the way she crafts this story just ooze empathy.

I hope you'll give it a shot. Hopefully you'll enjoy it half as much as I have.

  ... being a tale of the consequences of a single decision made by a single woman to change the fate of the whole world.There will be plot, there will be so much character development that you'll want to grow as a person just to keep up, and there will be lemons, limes, and beautiful steamy scenes.This is my gift of love to help counterbalance the fear of pandemic viruses.Keep calm and read on.
