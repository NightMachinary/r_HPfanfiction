If:

- A wizard, Steve, who is small and skinny, polyjuices himself into Alastor Moody;

- And somehow, Steve's skull is removed from his body while polyjuiced, without breaking the enchantment in spite of resultant death;

- And the skull is then given to one of those artists who specialize in recreating the faces of long, long dead people based on their skulls, like some Romans near a volcano;

What do you get? Do you get roughly the face of Skiny Steve or roughly the face of Alastor Moody?

In other words, if you do a cross section of a polyjuiced person, how far down do they look like the person they are polyjuicing as? Would a single cell from soft tissue be Moody's or Steve's?


** I'm guessing the imitation is pretty perfect, or else there would be an easy check, which from my recollection of the books there isn't. The only way to know is to wait for the transformation to wear off.

** Here's a Polyjuice-related thing I've been thinking about for a bit: if someone uses it to turn into Nymphadora Tonks, what would they look like? Moreover, would the person using the Polyjuice have access to Tonks' Metamorphmagus abilities?

*** No clue if there's an official answer, but there's really only a few outcomes of imbibing Polyjuiced Metamorphmagus that wouldn't be broken beyond belief.

1. Turn into what Tonks looks like naturally.

2. Turn into what she's currently morphed as.

3. It does nothing (ruining the potion from whatever magic is likely running through the bit of DNA.)

**** 4 - They turn into some kind of amorphous figure that most resembles a nightmare and doesn't wear off, similar to how Polyjuice with cat hair royally fucked up for Hermione

***** Even if it straight up made someone exactly like Tonks for an hour, including her metamorphmagus talent, I imagine that that talent takes a lot of practice to use, so the person would have no clue how to really do convincing disguises. They'd be flailing around, turning all different colors and shapes for that hour, and would be much clumsier than her. They couldn't even keep their legs the same length.

**** 4 - The potion explodes.

All difficult questions can be answered with "it explodes".
