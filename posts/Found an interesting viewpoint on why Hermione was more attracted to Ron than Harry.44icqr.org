*** Maybe it's because she is a cat person (strong, independent, blah, blah) that makes Ron (needy, always want attention) attractive?

*** Well the good news is that since HP magic is all pretty whimsical and works off perceived qualities as much as any physical ones... a spell that turned your dog human would likely produce a person that... well... I'm sure /Hufflepuff/ would be proud to have them.

*** He is a teenager throughout the books. The last boy from a family of super-succesful boys and the designated sidekick of the most famous person in the british wizarding world. I think its excused if sometimes that's a bit too much for his ego to take.

I'm not a fan of his character, I'll admit it. But as far as loyal goes, he was probably the most "realistic" representation of loyalty between teenage best friends.

**** Well said. I don't think I'll ever be 100% on the Ron bandwagon, but he's definitely the character that gets bashed the most often for little reason. It's particularly annoying when it happens in a 'romance' story as an excuse to get Harry and Hermione together.

There are several times in the series where he displays a supernatural level of bravery in the face of almost certain death. At other times his ego gets in the way of his decision-making abilities. I blame JKR, not Ron for that problem. There were times in her story where she wanted Harry to truly feel alone and her favourite way of doing that was to have his best mate blow up in a fit of jealousy. It felt like she was cheating her own narrative by giving Ron a rather drastic character flaw at one of the worst possible moments. He didn't appear to be jealous of Harry's addition to the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the youngest Seeker in a century. AFAIK Ron never blew his top at any of Harry's other successes either. The GoF incident felt like a bolt from the blue.

That being said, Ron doesn't exist in a vacuum. Hermione believed that Harry hadn't entered his name in the TWT. Fred and George didn't bear Harry any ill will for succeeding where they had failed. Even Cedric was kinder to Harry before the First Task than his best mate. This makes the gap in Ron's character harder to explain away.

***** I think Ron flipping out at Harry in GoF was simply another heavy-handed "I need Harry to angst" plot JKR wanted to introduce. After Ron was ready to die for Harry in PoA, when he faced Sirius with a broken leg, the sudden change comes out of the blue, and marks the point where Ron doesn't get to grow up anymore for a long, long time.

**** Isn't he?

I mean, I'm not talking typical H/Hr fic master manipulator, but the guy was overly careful when to tell what, how, to whom. I know that much of his behavior was for story reasons, but the guy could have been just straight-forward for once in his life.

****** That is a very good argument and I fully agree, given the definition of manipulative you gave.

However, I always knew the words "Manipulation" "manipulativ" (as I am Austrian, hence German is my native language) as something that means to merely interfere in order to make others do what you desire. It doesn't necessarily have to be to your advantage. Thats why I think he /is/ manipulative. Once again, he is not in the way fanon paints him, but way more subtle and less frequent. All in all he is a good man, a wise wizard and anyone could hope to have a grandfather like him.

Its a bit of a anticlimactic thing to blame definitions, but it is nonetheless true.

******** u/UndeadBBQ:
#+begin_quote
  While Dumbledore did actively interfere in Harry's life, I wouldn't call that manipulative, not when he's done it for Harry's good (happiness and safety).
#+end_quote

Ands some would argue that it is manipulative since he didn't inform Harry of it right away.

I really do think that I'm the wrong partner of discussion here. The german word is much less negative and actually describes these small influences, as you described in your example. The only condition that has to be fulfilled is that you have a reaction in mind before you try to steer your opponent towards it by your action.
