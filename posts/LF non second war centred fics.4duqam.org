So this sub is for Harry Potter, which I do enjoy, but I also enjoyed stories that take the world and create new stories inside it, like Alexandra Quick does. Where can I go to find stories like these? Canon compliant stories that don't change canon characters or focus on characters that yup, I already know very well from fanon.

So it's a bit unclear, but are you trying to avoid fics about the second war in general or those about Harry and co?

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

*** Forgot to say thanks for the fic, it looks really interesting, the whole witch hunt thing from the witch point of view. Plus, it's British, not USian, which is fantastic.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  At the end of the 18th century, Artemisia Lufkin became the first female Minister of Magic. She was a political genius, an Auror and a disciple of the Enlightenment. But behind closed doors, she was also a hedonist, an adulteress and guilty of treason.
