Come on! We are dealing with a world full of magic and a whole bunch of enchantments. And the only things JK can come with is Wizarding Chess, and Exploding Snap?

We can do better!

Give me some RPG games where the board can shift into the environment that the players are playing through!

Give me some new card games like a version of War where there are than two players, and we get a magical forfeit of some kind.

Or a magical board game. Like for instance, Dwarf Fortress ™!

Up to seven players! 1 vs 3-6.

You have the Dwarf (person playing against the other players.)

And the invading armies (wizards, goblins, elves, etc. The other players.)

A board game where the invading armies have to traverse a trap ladened board set by the Dwarf King. First one to have their armies reach the fortress Gates and break the doors down win!

Ages 9+

** Gobstones!

There's quite a few fics where the twins make different Gobstones sets based on Fudge, Draco Malfoy (they say "wait until my father hears about this!" when they lose), Voldemort, etc.

​

Edit: The Malfoy Gobstones are called Gobshytes. Or Gobshites. One of those.

** Victoria Potter has a great board game called Beyond the Veil. It's basically Clue, except you get visions from a crystal ball as clues to solve the murder.

#+begin_quote
  She looked at the ball, feeling quite silly, but the moment her eyes met its centre she could not look away. There was just something so fascinating about the way the inside swirled and shifted... her focus narrowed, the rest of the compartment barely even registering at the corners of her vision, and suddenly she saw it: a bloody dagger etched with runes, resting on top of a tombstone.

** I've tried to create a mockup homebrew DnD system once for a story, lemme paste it real quick

--------------

Dungeons & Dragons & Wizards & Witches

Developed by a small group of enterprising muggleborn, this is an enchanted and modified version of the popular muggle pen&paper game Dungeons & Dragons. All the archetypal classes have been replaced with variants of wizards, and the given quests are geared toward wizarding sensibilities, with wrong interpretations of magic removed and replaced by a mathematical approximation of the actual way magic works.

The classes are

Hedge Wizard/Witch

This wizard or witch was born far from civilisation, and has never recieved a formal magical education. However, they have still managed to tame their power somewhat, resulting in magic that's a little bit weirder than the ordinary kind. This class can ignore some limitations of ordinary wizardry, but does not have a wand and must therefore use reagents, music, chants, sacrifice, blood or similar to cast their spells.

Enchanter

This wizard or witch has specialized in enchanting, or the permanent anchoring of charms to objects and beings. They begin with an advantage to charms, but lack proficiency in other areas of magic. They can strengthen their teammates, enchant weapons and armor, and manipulate the enviornment. However, they have no way of directly damaging enemies with magic.

Healer

This wizard or witch has specialized in the healing arts. Subclasses are Mind-Healer and Body-Healer, and there exists a voluntary upgrade in the form of a binding hippocratic oath. Both subclasses have advantage and disadvantage toward their own and the other's spells. The binding hippocratic oath prevents a healer from damaging any living thing in any way, but triples the effecticacy of their healing spells.

Warlock/Auror

This wizard or witch has specialized in combat magic. They gain an advantage to defensive and offensive charms and transfiguration, but a disadvantage to healing magic. They can also use minor dark arts without suffering corruption.

Druid

This wizard or witch has grown up in a hidden grove, and learned the ancient ways of the druid. Like the hedge-wizard, their magic is weird, but more structured. However, it is solely based on nature in exception of everything else. They may only use a living staff to channel magic.

Dark Wizard/Witch - NOT CHOOSEABLE AT THE START OF GAME

This wizard or witch has dabbled in darkness, and it remains to be seen if they find the wisdom in themselves to turn back. They may use minor and medium dark arts without suffering corruption, but they are always at risk of falling to the dark and turning on the party. They also start with a set amount of corruption based on the strength of spells the player wishes them to be able to use.

Spells are grouped into various categories and subcategories.

They are generally colored into three:

Light magic, which encompasses most healing magics, most defensive magics, and the offensive patronus charm.

Twilight magic, which encompasses everything between the two

Dark magic, which encompasses all those magics which have a corruptive effect on the caster. Dark curses, the controlling of dark creatures, possession.

Black magic, which encompasses the darkest of the dark. Unusable by players. Necromancy, blood magic and the manipulation of souls are black magic.

Magic is then also seperated into two categories, active and passive, with active magic encompassing all those cast via focus, and passive all those taking effect through objects or substances.

Active magic is furthermore divided into rituals, charms, and transfiguration, with charms then being subdivided into curses and "true charms".

All spells have a class bonus or disadvantage.

Dark magic is subdivided into three levels of severity: Minor, median, and major. Minor dark magic are most low-level dark curses, like laceration charms or explosion curses. Median dark magic are more powerful dark curses, such as the waking nightmare curse, the entrail manipulation curse or the bone-shifter curse. Major dark magic is for the most powerful dark curses, such as unforgiveables or fiendfyre control. When any class except for the Auror attempts to cast dark magic, the severity level must be respected. A wizard without any corruption may not cast anything but minor dark magic, but once he gains some corruption through repeated use, he may begin casting median and finally major dark magic.

Corruption occurs when a character repeadedly uses the dark arts. The spells cause damage to their soul, causing their personality to shift into more and more sadistic mindsets. They begin to lose empathy and compassion, replaced by apathy and cruelty. Any wizard that reaches a corruption level of medium will have their class permanently changed into Dark Wizard, gaining immunity to the corruptive effects of minor and median dark arts, as well as the ability to cast major dark magic. Additonally, there is a chance that they will lash out and the selected median-dark spell by the player will be replaced with a major dark one. Once a Dark Wizard reaches a corruption severity of major, they are lost to the player and transform into an enemy, representative of the dark arts warping their mind into considering former friends enemies.

A compendium of balanced spells can be found at the back of this brochure, but any newly discovered, developed or private or fictional spells can be added by using the conversion chart in the back to integrate them seamlessly into the game. Please note that no real dark arts may be added to the compendium, and that it will destroy itself if the inbuilt dark detector detects the presence of dark magic inside the compendium. Please note that all dark magic currently contained inside of the compendium is completely fictional, and if not, that all dark incantations and wand motions were invented or scrambled, i.e. the incantation to the Killing Curse was changed into "Nunc Moriatur", and its wand motion is fictional. At no point should this game be used as a teacher for real magic.

And that was that was inside my text document. I think I had the beginnings of a story prepped out, which would basically have been a telling of a game of DnDnWnW played in the Gryffindor common room by the main cast of the books. However, I lost my hard drive a few years back, and the first five chapters of this nascent story was on that, and so it was lost to the sands of time. Ironic that I backed this doc up and not the story itself.

Pfft, you can't break down a Dwarven Atom Smasher without a bronze colossus or creature of similar weight. The Dwarf, having magma, always wins.

*** Ahh, I'm glad you bring that up!

Each race has their own way of bringing down the gates. And the player has to roll a certain number against the Dwarf King's number in order to break it down.

If they succeed, the fortress is theirs. If not, then they are knocked out of the game.

If no armies can successfully break the gates down, then the dwarf king wins!

** Probably something to do with making magical vows sealed to a game board (like the bindings of the Goblet of Fire). I imagine it being sort of a cross between Town of Salem (Werewolf/Mafia) and Ministers Cat (specifically the cumulative version) with an Ace Attorney vibe where the players essentially have to improvise a Magical Vow that they didn't do something and each subsequent accused or involved player has to add more and more bits on until someone adds in a contradiction or something that makes them break it while they investigate to find out who the criminal is.

Also, 'Pin the Target on the Fidelius/Invisible Object'. Essentially they have to touch an enchanted stick to an camoflaged object - perhaps they only get flashes of sight or perhaps it's a coop game where their partner acts as spotter to their jedi-style blind striker.

I bet the British kids probably played Slaps with stinging charms - you have to hit the other person's hand with the stinger before they move it/shield it.

** Victoria Potter by Taure

It has very good world building and has some pretty unique stuff in it, and it is a read I would definitely recommend. One game in it is a Mystery game in which you get clues from a Crystal ball based on what you roll, and whoever realises who the killer is first wins the game.

Just check out the fic, you won't regret it.
