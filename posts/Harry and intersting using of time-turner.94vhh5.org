So, I've just remembered reading one fanfic where both Hermione and Harry got time-turners. Hermione used hers for learning only, little obedient girl. Harry "created" another personality. He lived the whole day as Harry, then used time-turner and his metamorphmagus skills and lived the same day as a first-year Ravenclaw girl. This girl had her own friends, her own character. Harry treated his personalities so different, that Harry-girl could even chat with Harry about something. By the end of the year Harry "created" for about five girls? he lived six days instead of one.

So, anything interesting out there? By the way, Fic Search for the mentioned fanfic.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

***** It isn't a good fic but I'm slowly reading it just out of interest.

Still have not reached the fights part. Well, apart from the beginning one.

  Hermione soon learns why Harry Potter should never be let near a time turner. Now, his convoluted plot has become so convoluted that even he can't understand it. A CRACK PARODY TIME TRAVEL TALE, (inspired by Magical Me)
