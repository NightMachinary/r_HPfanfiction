I've seen a lot of fanfics out there where Harry and his friends go back to the Marauders era and meet his parents but I was wondering if there are any good complete fanfics out there where James and Lily travel to the future when Harry is at Hogwarts? Let me know. Thanks.


** I believe linkffn(Time revolution by kissthis) fits your request. Hermione centric though, but it does handle the whole 'Harry getting to meet and know his parents as they were' thing.

  Hermione's ritual magick brought back four people from the past to fulfil a prophecy, but they aren't exactly the four she planned on. Are the trio a prehistoric triumverate of power? Will Voldemort be defeated? Love for the Marauders? SBHGRL FIN

When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.
