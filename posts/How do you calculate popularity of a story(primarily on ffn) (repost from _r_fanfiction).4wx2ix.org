I just checked how my sttng/hp story is doing and including completed and uncompleted, it's the fifth most popular by follows and seventh on favorites. Excluding completed stories, it's the most followed and, if excluding a story that hasn't updated in nine years, it's also the most favorited(or those two metric might be reversed).

Sadly, the harry potter/star trek: the next generation X-Over choices are sparse so that's out of 38 stories.

But still, should i consider my story wildly popular in that sparse field or just doing pretty good? And how do you decide if your story is popular or not since the metrics on FFn are kinda crap(you can't see how many reads for your story versus others)?


** 1. Favorites

2. Followers

3. Reviews - not the number of them but the overall quality of them.

If you're asking if your story is good, then those are of course the wrong measurements. Popularity, however, is pretty covered with this I'd say.

*** So far I've had three bad reviews(just assholishness from one reviewer, one who couldn't read, and another saying 'old crusher and picard having a sex life is wrong'), lots of perfunctories('good chapter' or 'more' kind of thing), and a couple reviews that were pretty substantive with queries about how the story was going(which are being addressed in later chapters for the most part, they haven't brought up anything I haven't really thought of save for how the jjverse affects my story) and one review that actually made me rethink some stuff on vulcan tactile-telepathy but decided to keep how I had written it because 'magic.' out of 84 reviews.

Edit: also, I think it's the seventh most reviewed. Seven, pretty popular.

**** This may sound a bit arrogant: But if I read a negative review with a high percentage of spelling and grammar mistakes, I immediately see it as a good recommendation for the authors story. If the plebs can't handle it, its probably at least decent.

My threshold for this very subjective measurement is 1 well texted review that is more than 3 sentences long.

** Don't compare your story to anyone else's. You're always going to find something better/worse if you look hard enough. If you're happy with what you've written, then be proud of what you've accomplished. If you aren't satisfied, then tinker with it until you are.

Happiness is the only metric that really matters.

** Well, against itself, you have to gauge how many people are viewing the story, versus actually reading it through. Against others though, I guess you can just compare numbers (reviews, follows, favs). If they're similar, then you have to take into account when the story was published. The story that is newer but has similar numbers, likely means its more popular, though that can get skewed by chapter counts (but you can find an average count by dividing by the chapter count, and then comparing /those/ numbers against each other), and update speeds (letting a chapter sit for a few weeks will get more reviews than just jamming a chapter out every day.

So, for example, I have a really bad harry/rowena story that is about 7 years old. It's a rare pairing, with only 55 stories popping up on the filter at all, and that's not actual pairing, just where she's labeled as a main character. So I can look at it and see these numbers: Reviews: 660 - Favs: 1,813 - Follows: 1,777. Also, fifteen chapters (and half a million views). So, then I can look down the 55 stories, and I only see one that even comes close - it has about 80% of my numbers, with two extra chapters (while also being a little shorter), and it was published at the same time as mine. So it would be easy enough to say my story is the more popular of the two, and probably the most popular there (but that's not saying much since the story is shit).

But comparing it across the site can be difficult. I do have another story that I posted during the same timeframe as the previous example, except it is Harry/Daphne (and atrocious). These are the numbers: Reviews: 470 - Favs: 2,617 - Follows: 1,168, 16 chapters. Reviews and Follows being lower are easier to explain - this story is finished, while the other isn't. There's no reason to follow a story that isn't going to have any more updates, and the padded review count is at least partially people asking when the next update is. Perhaps the most telling number is the favorites, which is much higher. The explanation for that is that I don't thing the favorites system was around when the story first got posted.

So, then the question really is, is the story more popular, or is the pairing more popular? The answer to that is, the pairing is more popular. The Harry/Daphne story has 1.5 million views. And, amongst Harry/Daphne stories, that's not really remarkable at all.

** I posted about it in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4wxo1i/how_to_know_your_fanfic_is_popular_heres_my_theory/][r/Fanfiction]] a while back, but here's my opinion.

Here's the measurements I think you should be taking into consideration, and in /this/ order:

#+begin_quote
  1)*Favourites* - Favourites are public, which means that a person favourites can be seen by anybody. If I favourite your story, it means that not only do I like your story, but I'm also willing to let others know that I like your story. Its pretty much the ultimate show of approval.

  2)*Follows* - Follows basically mean interest. If I follow you, it means that while I may or may not like your story, I definitely want to see more of it. Not the most ringing type of endorsement, but a very decent endorsement nonetheless.

  3)*Traffic* - Now this is a bit of a doozy. How do you know what amount of traffic is normal for a fic in your fandom? You don't. But you'll get a feel for it if you write for a while.

  That graph ff.net has showing your traffic. Learn to read it, and you'll be reading your readers' minds. Some examples of such deductions are:

  ---> If your view stats for a day is more than 2 times the visitor stats, it means that you're getting new readers.

  --->If the graph keeps growing every time you post a new chapter, people are liking it more and more. This one is obvious.

  --->And if you see a lot of views but a much lesser amount of visitors on a day you haven't updated, it means that people are rereading your story, which is always a good thing.

  4)*Reviews* - And this is the dodgiest thing of all. Let me preface this by saying that I do think that reviews are good measures of how popular your story is. However, they also the most inaccurate. If I review your story, I might not be praising you. I might just be pointing out shitty grammar, or a plot hole, or how I dislike your OC, or how I disagree with something you wrote. Remember. Reviews are a way to give criticism and a lot of highly reviewed stories can be a dogpile of shit. That being said, they are a good way of knowing where a story stands, but only if you judge the quality and not quantity of them.

  Do you agree? Have you used these measures to look at your stories in the way I do? Do you know of any other ways you judge your story's popularity?

**** I don't. Most communities usually are more of an archive, used by readers to easily keep track of the stuff they read and share them with people. Its more of a reader's tool than a writer's tool.

And on the rare occasion that a popular enough community accepts my story, I'll get a bump in traffic, and I thank the community's manager.

For example, out of the 82 communities my story is currently in, only 11 have more than 100 followers.

So communities aren't really that good of a metric about your story.

I may have written a several hundred word review on a Mass Effect fanfic yesterday defending Ashley against the incorrect public opinion that she's a racist. I got to the end and realized I'd been ranting even though I actually love the story and had to end it with several sentences about how much I'm enjoying the fic. It was strange but the author responded within the hour saying they agreed with me and hadn't meant to portray her like that.

** I haven't managed three figures of reviews on any of mine. Favourites are all about thirty-odd. Does it hurt to compare myself? Yes of course it does. Does it mean my stories are shit? Probably yes. On the other hand at least I don't feel any sense of obligation to anyone else and there won't be howls of outrage when I delete them. It is a small consolation.
