I can't decide if I should if I should continue writing a whole Hogwarts story centered around my OC Carissa Wood (I've written five chapters) but I have no plot for most of the years and I'd be skipping a lot.

or

Should the story start when she returns to Hogwarts for the Quidditch House Cup (which her younger cousin Oliver is playing in)/The Quidditch World Cup in 1994? More of the plot is set after she finishes Hogwarts.


** You've posted a number of similar questions and its starting to feel as you don't have a vision for your own story. I'm wondering why you want to do this? Most of us write the stories we want to read. You seem to be trying to write by committee and I don't think it will work. You can't please everybody so work on pleasing yourself. If you don't believe in your own story why do you think anyone else will believe in it?

Write the story you want to write.

*** Should it start when she is visiting Hogwarts for the Quidditch House Cup (May/June 1994) or the Quidditch World Cup (August 1994)

**** I mean it really depends on your story and how relevant those events are to the plot. Basically the thing to remember, especially with OCs, is that people are reading fanfic rather than an original novel for a reason. They want to skip the slow build up, they know this world already. They want to get on with the story, and they don't have the patience to get to know your OF while nothing is happening.

***** She reconnects with Charlie (an old friend ) at the Quidditch World Cup. She finds her cousin Oliver in the Weasley's tent talking with Percy. Charlie begins talking to her and the twins suggest that Charlie and Carissa make a bet about the match and the wager is that if the Irish win they have to kiss. If that makes sense.

******* Yeah, I probably will start there and just add flashbacks/snippets of their Hogwarts years when appropriate.
