I've found that I dislike the early years in HP fan fiction the most for some reason and I want to read a fan fiction that skips past that. Preferably I'd like a story that has a Harry that isn't the BWL or atleast hasn't done the same things as in canon and perhaps has different friends. This is probably a little convoluted but I'll try anything that even loosely fits. 4th year and up is what I'm looking for but if something meets every criteria but that feel free to Rex it.

** I really like fics with an older Harry too, it doesn't have to be AU before 4th/5th year but since I like a Harry with a backbone and some skill, it's really difficult when some try to write an eleven year old like that. The Reluctant Champion: Linkffn(5071058)

While it's not exactly what you're looking for, you might enjoy linkffn(8730465) linkffn(2567419)

Do you have some recommendation of the kind of story that you're looking for?

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** All my stories so far start at 4th year or later. "Patron" might fit part of your request. It's an AU, starts in year 4, with a different past, and a different tournament. Harry's friends are not that different, but a number of characters are very different from canon - Lockhart for example is actually no fraud, but known as an author with lots of skilled friends whose adventures he writes about, and not exactly a slouch at magic himself. Daphne's a ditz, Pansy a cunning Slytherin and Hagrid a respected teacher and famous expert on creatures, since one of Dumbledore's first actions after becoming famous for defeating Grindelwald was to reverse his expulsion. Harry's still the BWL though.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  Harry may be a half-Veela, but there was no such thing as a destined mate. If somebody wanted him, they would have to prove their worthiness. And Draco's chances don't look so good when Harry guts him at the welcoming feast... HPDM, mpreg
