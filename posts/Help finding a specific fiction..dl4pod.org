It was a one-shot in a collection. It was based in 5th year during the chapter 'Snape's Worst Memory' Snape pulls Harry out of the pensive and Harry realizes that you don't keep memories that you don't want other to see in a pensive. He realizes that Snape is trying to show James in the worst possible light. It ends with Harry obliviating Snape of all his memories (like what happend to Lockhart).


** Chapter 4 of *Harry Potter and the things that could have happened* linkffn(8788731), most chapters aren't very good though.
