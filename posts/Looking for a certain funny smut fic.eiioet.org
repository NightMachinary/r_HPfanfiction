:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that it started with Harry in Privet Drive having sex with a lot of the women and girls who lived on the road, but I can't remember much more. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

**** I thought we couldn't do that due to rule 8?

Though to be fair, ffn.net's version doesn't have smut.

***** Hmm. You have a point. I guess I'll wait and see if I get dinged.

Edit: Well, according to the first page of the story, Harry is 16, which is the age of consent in England, so we should be fine.

****** Since it's Reddit's policy, that should mean anything lower than 18, I believe.

#+begin_quote
  Do Not Post Sexual or Suggestive Content Involving Minors

  Reddit prohibits any sexual or suggestive content involving minors or someone who appears to be a minor.

  This includes child sexual abuse imagery, child pornography, and any other content, including fantasy content (e.g. stories, “loli”/anime cartoons), that depicts encourages or promotes pedophilia, child sexual exploitation, or otherwise sexualizes minors or someone who appears to be a minor. Depending on the context, this can in some cases include depictions of minors that are fully clothed and not engaged in overtly sexual acts.

  If you are unsure about a piece of content involving a minor or someone who appears to be a minor, do not post it.
#+end_quote

Reddits policy is to not post anything involving a minor; no age is specified defining what a minor is. Since 16 is the age of consent in England (as well as the majority of the US), I am going to assume that it is ok unless someone can show me otherwise.

  Age of consent is irrelevant. Reddit's rule specifies minors, the age of majority in the US where reddit is located is 18.

*********** Ok, I was wrong.

Can we get that stated explicitly in the rules then, because I went looking and I can not find anywhere where minor is defined as 18. It certainly isn't in the rule about not posting sexual explicit material about minors.

************ As a rule of thumb, minor is defined as younger than 18, since we are talking about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority#Age_18][age of mayority]], and not the age of consent
