** Highest quality non-crack fics I've read that aren't one-shots? I'm also leaving out abandoned fics:

Hogwarts Houses Divided (fun, lighthearted, recaptures the feel of books 1-3)

Elizium for the Sleepless Souls (Superb thriller where Harry is sent to Azkaban and has to escape)

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin (Fantastic world-building and plotting, where the author takes a bunch of common fanfic cliches and works them into a quality story)

I have a bunch of thrillers and other fics that I like, but the above three are imo top quality.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** So these aren't Pullitzer-prize worthy, but they're still really good:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Dreams and Memories]]. A 3-part canon-compliant series featuring Harry coming to terms with the Dudley and Snape. Really good plotting, but loses points because two of the scenes are kind of headscratchers.

The Accidental Animagus - Harry accidentally becomes an animagus as a kid and runs away from the Dursleys to be adopted by Hermione's family. The world-building and antagonists are actually pretty good, but loses points because I dislike several of the characterizations (I really dislike the Grangers and Luna), as well as the beginning.

Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them - Harry raises himself in the woods and gets up to various hijinks. Docked points for sub-par sequels as weird as a poor beginning.

The Merging is unique in its own way. Here's few stories, that are unique on it's own way(I guess you have already read some of the list):

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë)

Linkffn(Building Bridges by Melethril)

Linkffn(A Riddled Universe)

Linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm)

Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth)

Linkffn(A Shadowed Soul by devilblondie)

Totally different type but I like this one for it's analysis of mind magic: Linkffn(Give It Your Best Shot by Zenathea)

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
