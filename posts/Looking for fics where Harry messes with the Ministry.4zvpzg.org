Basically looking for a fic where Harry uses his BWL status and all his cash to basically fuck with the ministry


** *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), fits your criteria very well.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

**** The new Ministry in this story, while not corrupt, is hilariously inept.

** I'd like to throw in Inspected by No.13. I know it's not quite what you are looking for, but Harry does accidentally mess with the ministry department of inspections and the Goblins. It's a nice, enjoyable fic. It's also completed, but I wish there was more.

Edited to the proper story name:
