** Date? No. That doesn't mean he never got some booty.

** Egh, people are attracted to other people based on all kinds of features. Snape has a hooked nose, yellowing teeth, sallow skin and lank, greasy hair... And none of those things are the end of the world, frankly. People tend to act like Snape is so cartoonishly ugly no one could ever be interested in him, but ugly people have sex lives, and ugly people date.

Snape is never said to smell especially bad, and he dresses himself well; he has a very dark, but well-developed sense of humour, and he has a relatively respectable position as the Potions Master of /the/ British school of magic. I've no doubts that even with his flaws, such as his acerbic nature and his ugly face, he could undoubtedly go on dates with men or women.

Except that he almost undoubtedly wouldn't. It's not a matter of whether someone would be willing to date him so much as whether /he/ would be willing to date them.

Severus Snape has spent pretty much his whole Hogwarts career isolating himself, with very few apparent friends. I doubt very much he'd be interested in romance.
