Looking for fics where Harry's parents are not dead, they dumped him off with his relatives and have been in hiding somewhere else. They come back and expect him to be happy........he isn't.

I thought the Lily and James are still alive would be enough.

Maybe off with their other kids or something.

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

** Basically every dark!harry wbwl story...

linkao3(Antithesis) springs to mind but big Trigger Warnings, it's dark and heavy. Very interesting and a great story but very hard to read so if your not into that dark, horror genre steer well clear.

If you are, this is fantastic.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

** Strongly agree with Who Dares Wins by OlegGunnarsson (already linked).

Others where the Potters turn out not to be as dead as previously thought:

- The Substitute by BajaB linkffn(4641394)
- The Fall of the House of Potter by Bobmin356 linkffn(7508571)
- Travel Secrets series by E4mj (time travel, third story unfinished). First story linkffn(9622538)
- Too Late by Lucillia linkffn(5785108)
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle series]] by flamethrower. This one doesn't quite fit your criteria because Harry IS happy to learn his parents are still alive. Time-travel, slash, extremely long series that's still in progress. First story linkao3(11284494)

And one token "HARRY is not as dead as they thought" story: Albus Dumbledore's Big Mistake by shineyma (Dumbledore bashing) linkao3(26177908)
