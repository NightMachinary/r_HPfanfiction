Like how the wizarding world might look like by 2050.

In the muggle world between the 90s and now there's already been massive change due to the internet. In the next few decades we will probably see more advanced AI, genetic engineering on humans (China already has Crispr babies), Elon Musk might be starting his Mars city, and climate change will cause a lot of trouble around the world.

I'd like to see a fic that explores how the wizarding world would change, how it would react to changes in the muggle world and how it might change on its own.

Would the internet (or a magical equivalent) change wizarding society like it has changed ours? Bigotry rampant on online forums, companies paying outrageous sums to push certain political agendas? Maybe paintings being equipped with speech to text software and used as improvised social media bots? Imagine if Walburga Black's painting spent all it's time posting on WizNet.

Would wizards do something against climate change secrecy be damned, and if yes how would they approach the problem of reducing the temperature of an absolutely insane amount of mass? That's Zettajoules of energy that we're talking about. Not a trivial task at all.

How would wizards deal with cameras and face recognition AI being everywhere? Pretty hard to remove a memory if it's encoded in matrices making up a neutral net structured completely differently from a human brain, especially if it's stored on a cloud server on another continent. Experts on muggle technology would be absolutely necessary to deal with this.

What would happen if a wizard, a startup billionaire and a handful of genetics experts with little regard for ethics start using anti-cancer potions to fix DNA damage and successfully manage to create designer babies? Rich people could get their kids with every bit of perfection, including magical abilities spliced in, and the wizarding world might not notice anything being off until a decade later there's an entire crowd of superhuman, supernaturally beautiful Ãœbermensch muggleborns all with ultrarich parents attending Hogwarts. This would give muggle billionaires, who are far richer than any wizards due to the muggle economy being far larger, a perfectly legit excuse to do business in the magical world and pretty much buy all the important companies. Imagine Jeff Bezos owning half of the entire potions ingredients industry.

How would wizarding politics react if some wizards join Elon's Mars city? Can't exactly send an Obliviator squad to apparate the twenty light-minutes distance if something goes wrong. And if some wizards decide to create their own spaceships in their garages, then suddenly the entire world has a massive power imbalance because anyone with the ability to travel around space at a reasonable speed also has the ability to push some rocks down the well and wipe a city off the map, that is unless the magical world pays them one hundred billion galleons (laughs maniacally). Unless someone figures out a way to cast a shield charm around the entire planet, that's going to be a problem.


** linkffn(annals of arithmancy) is somewhat focused on this. The only problem is it's an epilogue to the author's Arithmancer series, which is about a million words long.

linkffn(Muggle at Large) and linkffn(Snake Bites by sheriff1985) have some exploration of this.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.

  A muggle scientist stumbles upon the Wizarding World and refuses to let the discovery go. Technology meets magic in a dangerous adventure through the Magical Americas. She just might reinvent what it means to be magical... that is, if she doesn't get caught first.

#+begin_quote
  A first-year full of Weasley cousins in Albus, Rose and Louis takes its first steps into a wizarding world that suddenly feels all too close to the muggle Britain that's still clear in their new friends' memories. Meanwhile, a new Head of Slytherin finds himself meeting old friends and facing old enemies as the reputation of his House hangs in the balance (M for Language).
