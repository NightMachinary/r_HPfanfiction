In this other post, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/kazqht/when_his_child_told_him_of_being_soul_bonded/][this one in particular]], I had a crazy idea.

What if in an alternate reality where Voldemort is a girl, something happens to Tom (I don't know what to call her so I'll just call her Tom) that night and and becomes a wraith, but not only that, she gets sent into the future of an alternate reality where she's apparently male and died ages ago (basically cannon). Now, she's near Hogwarts, I don't know why and you don't know why, but we know she somehow gets there. She then decides "too well protected, I should go to Hogsmeade". She does this and she finds some kid in a secluded area. Now that kid, as you might or might not've guessed, is Harry's child (either James or Al, it's your pick, but I'm going to go with Al because I want to, but then again you can do whatever you want). She goes and possesses him-but wait, she doesn't! Instead she's trapped in his head and Al, freaked out because there's a voice in his head screaming profanities and other stuff, etc etc, asks "who the hell are you and how did you get inside my head?!?!"

Stuff happens, they learnt to cope, they get her out maybe at the end of the fic or maybe the middle, she finds herself de-aged, and she and Al become close friends. Or a couple, though that feels more than a little disturbing, so I'll go with friends.

As for Al, he can either have little to no friends, or have Scorp, Rose, and some others I guess, with Scorp and Rose (his besties) going, "what's wrong Al? You seem different lately"

And then, maybe for the epilogue, they can show the indestructible Voldemort-diary who rose to power and can never be destroyed because his horcrux is in an alternate reality.

Now in my comment on that other post, I included this quick bonus of Al introducing Tom to Rose and Scorp. Here it is:

In a secluded corner, at the Three Broomsticks, Scorpius was twiddling his thumbs, having nothing better to do. Rose, who was quite annoyed, spoke up.

"When is Al coming? He told us to meet him here at /this/ time, and he /knows/ that I have things to do and places to be." Scorpius stopped twiddling his thumbs and opened his mouth, most likely going to respond, when a familiar voice spoke up.

"Sorry I was late, guys!" Albus sounded out of breath, as if he'd ran all the way there. His hair was messy and his tie crooked, with wrinkles all over his clothes. The person with him, however, looked immaculate. She wore a Muggle shirt and pants, the former light green and the latter blue. No wrinkles on her clothes and not a single hair out of place. Her face was perfectly symmetrical, one could call it beautiful if it wasn't for the expression on her face. It was a cool, dissecting gaze, as if looking into your very soul. And then, as if she'd found what she was looking for, her expression changed into one of contempt.

They sat down, and it was quiet for a few moments. The uncomfortable silence was broken by Scorpius, who asked, a bit timidly, "So, Al, who's your friend?"

Al visibly winced, giving his companion a nervous side-glance. He opened his mouth, and when nothing came out, closed it again. The Slytherin took a deep breath, smiled a crooked, anxious smile. It looked like he was really regretting his decision.

He gestured to the intimidating girl next to him, and said, his voice only faltering once,

"Tom, meet Rose and Scorpius. Rose, Scorp, meet Tom Marvola Riddle."


** This is amazing, and such a cool concept
