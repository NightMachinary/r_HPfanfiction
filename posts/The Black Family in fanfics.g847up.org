A long time ago I found a fanfic where the witches of the Black Family (including daughters that married out of the family) formed a given and got custody of Harry. It was really good and expansive of magic lore. Unfortunately I lost it while reading other fanfic at the same time.

I'm looking for more fanfics that have more of the Black Family in their stories. It doesn't have to follow canon necessarily BUT PLEASE, NO INCEST OR PEDOPHILIA.

I don't care if the story is Dark or AU. I just want to see more of the Black Family, especially since they are relatives of Harry and I want to see if others have written their own versions of them well.


** I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but you could try "In the Black" and its sequel, "Black Mask." It's a Regulus lives AU that takes place in 1979, and it focuses mostly on the dynamic between Sirius and his parents.

  Regulus Black survives his adventure in the cave and brings the locket to an unlikely ally: his estranged older brother. The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety. Sirius Black is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing Walburga and Orion Black---who, to his surprise and dismay, decide they rather enjoy having both of their sons back, and very quickly scheme to make this temporary family reunion permanent.Or: the story of how one night completely changed the course of the war and Sirius's life.[AU of the First Wizarding War in which stealing part of Voldemort's soul brings a broken, dysfunctional family together - Winner of 2018 Shrieking Shack Society Silver Marauders Medal for Best Sirius Characterization]

  Christmas 1979---danger, secrets, lies and their shared history looms large over the Blacks' first Yuletide season as a reunited family. While life as a fugitive proves bleaker (and more boring) than Regulus could have imagined, a botched espionage mission at Malfoy Manor draws Sirius deeper into the Black family web---and his cousin Narcissa's social set.Meanwhile, Walburga hatches a daring scheme to restore her wild firstborn's damaged reputation in the family---finding him a suitable bride---while Orion grapples with the past, and the high price his two sons have paid for his inaction.[Regulus Black Lives/Black Family Witness Protection AU.

** Wind Shear linkffn(12511998)

The Blacks are very prominent in Wind Shear. A 20-year old Harry that accidentally went back in time to the beginning of the first war shatters the Black's world view when, as a half-blood, he curb stomps every pureblood he runs into.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Best one i've read is Black Sky-- it's admittedly a khr crossover, but the first half is all HP, with all the widarding nobility social manouvering and Slytherin politics you could want. It's over 300 chapters, and there's not really any of KHR in it until I think fifth year, if that part's an issue. I have to recommend it anyway, though, because it's hands down the best Black family fic I have ever read.

Edit: Also, I forgot to mention it has the most unique and interesting family magics i've ever seen collected in one fanfic, and by most, I mean in terms of quantity.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

** The Black Family in To Bow with Pride are interesting. Same with Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is and Delenda Est. All Time-travelling Harry fics, but pretty different applications of the idea.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]]

Pride - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6866113/1/To-Bow-with-Pride]]

Delenda - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]]

There are two Harry-becomes-a-girl fics where the Black Family is gone into quite a lot as well: Season of Change and Son of Potter, Daughter of Black. I'm not sure whether I'd really recommend either of them, but they're related to your request so I'm posting them here anyway. YMMV on these.

Season - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9928419/1/Season-of-Change]]

Son of Potter - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11653847/1/]]

I've got two Sirius Parenthood-of-Harry fics that go into some Black Family politics stuff - Wise One series and Marauder's Plan - but it's not an overly big part of the plot in Wise One, more relegated to prologue-ing Worldbuilding. Wise One is also three books though, so there could be more in there that I'm just forgetting.

Wise One - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming]]

Marauder's Plan - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]
