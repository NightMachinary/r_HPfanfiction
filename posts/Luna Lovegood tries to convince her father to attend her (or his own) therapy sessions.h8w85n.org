Luna needs therapy. As time goes by, I no longer see her as a quirky, so-random individual; instead, she comes across as either: a) a crazy conspiracy theorist, b) a deeply traumatised young woman.

I do think that Luna would benefit tremendously from therapy -- as well as several other characters, especially her father.


** I want to see someone write this just to demonstrate different family therapy techniques! ðŸ˜‚

Maybe /I'll/ write it, once I get some experience under my belt. "Be the change you wish to see", and all.
