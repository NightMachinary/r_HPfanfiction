I'm hoping someone here may now which fic I'm talking about. The most I can remember of it is that Harry befriends a snake he finds in the gardens at private drive. He is also saved by the snake Vernon tries to kill Harry with sleeping pills but the snake bonds with Harry or bites him forgot which one and makes it so Harry doesn't die. The snake is snarky and is taken to Hogwarts with Harry. I don't remember if there was a pairing for it, or where exactly I read it. Thanks for the help in advance.


** There's also a snake in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/427653/chapters/719529][The Well Groomed Mind]], which I will never not recommend.

#+begin_quote
  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.

Lutain is his familiar, who is a snake that is friends with Nagini. Isn't the story you are looking for, but Lutain actually has a pretty close bond with the MC.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** Unless there's a magical bond involved, don't call the snake a "familiar". It's a pet peeve of mine, but --- nowhere in canon is a wizard's pet referred to as a familiar.
