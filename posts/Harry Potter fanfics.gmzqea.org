:END:
Hi ! i'm looking for two fanfics I've read some time ago.. So, in the first one, i remember a scene where Hermione or/and Mrs Weasley?? scold Harry for being in Grimmauld's library pretending it's dangerous and he replies that as Lord Black and head of the house she has no right to tell him off and in fact she's the one who should keep out of it since most of the books would curse her since she's a muggleborn..

And the second, i think something about Harry taking his Lordships seriously and there's a scene where he's doing some paperwork in the common room and Hermione is whining about how it's unfair to everyone that he gets privileges just because he's a Lord and Ron tries to explain to her that all Hiers and Lords do so but she won't listen ..

I appreciate the help ＼（ω）／

Edit : the two fics have selective Weasley/Albus Dumbledore/Hermione Granger bashing..


** Would this be the story that you are thinking about: Story: Harry Potter and the Daft Morons [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12562072/]]

*** I've read it before. It's not it. The ones i'm looking for have Hermione bashing and selective Weasley bashing
