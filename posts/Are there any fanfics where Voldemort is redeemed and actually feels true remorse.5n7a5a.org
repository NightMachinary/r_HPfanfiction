** I would say that in "A Black Comedy", linkffn(3401052), [[/spoiler][the Diary Riddle was disgusted with what became of him. It was heavily implied that Riddle originally had a worthwhile goal, but lost himself when he made the horcruxes. Diary Riddle was able to repair his soul at cost of Neville Longbottom though. He later successfully sabotaged Voldemort's operations and made that dimension rather peaceful. But the low intensity war dragged on until canon Harry and Sirius showed up]]

** That's an interesting idea.

At the end of Deathly Hallows, Harry gives Voldemort a desperate last chance for remorse, but of course it doesn't work because that's not in the Dark Lord's character as we've seen built up through the series.

It would be incredibly difficult to redeem the Tom Riddle as written by Rowling; Voldemort's character is psychopathic and essentially irredeemable. After making so many horcuxes, he's an inhuman terror.

The only fic I've ever seen that does Light!Tom realistically, in-character, is linkffn(Rectifier by Niger Aquila). The divergence starts all the way back when young Tom opens the Chamber of Secrets; the change takes a large amount of work on the behalf of Dumbledore. The fic is abandoned, but it's worth a read.

Edit: Conciseness.

Harry figures out Voldie is insane because he split his soul so many times. Harry tricks Voldie into absorbing the soul shard in his head and Voldie becomes more Riddle than Voldemort. Riddle takes on a new persona and takes over the Wizarding world through politics with Harry's help.
