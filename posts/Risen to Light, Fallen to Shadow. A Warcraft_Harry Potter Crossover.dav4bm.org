With an, IMO, amazing piece of writing and style, the author of this fic draws the reader in the lore of WC before the games, before the Sundering. While the fic itself is still in its early stages, I can tell it will be an epic and one of the few gems of this particular crossover.

** It seems interesting. Good HP/Warcraft X-overs are rare.

(You did link the latest chapter though. Didn't noticed until I finished it.)
