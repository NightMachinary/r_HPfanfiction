As the title suggests I'm looking for a fic where Harry ends up in a historical setting. I just read "A Wizard From Earth" which has Harry in ancient Egypt. But I'm looking for a Harry Potter crossover where Harry ends up in a place that isn't governed by a fantasy story. Is this supposed to be a Harry/Original fiction or is there a good fic out there under a different category.


** It's not the same fic you're looking for, there's a cool recent story on SIYE called [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129984][Splinters]], and it kind of fits the bill. It's got a really interesting and clever plot, and the writing is good too. I really recommend it to you, it's a good read.

*** Fic sounds good but I absolutely can't stand that site.

There's not a white on black option that I can find which results in me not reading anything there.

Am I missing it, or is there actually not one?

**** Change the theme to 'ballroom' on left hand side of the main page. Although, I like the Dumbledore theme best.

** Not Harry, but definitely historical - muggle students from London end up in Hogsmeade as part of Operation Pied Piper, which relocated those in danger during the war.

  The war in Europe and a trainload of muggle children, sent as evacuees to the safety of Hogsmeade, receive more attention in the village than events in the wizards' school. Familiar names wear younger faces. Acts of kindness bring their own punishment.

** I'm not sure why the hell nobody recced this one, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] has sections of a female Harry in the past, Ancient Egypt, Medieval Britain, and a couple others interspersed with sections of the present. It's a really really great story imo.

*** Just tried reading West of Here a few days ago. Its a horrible written Gary Stu story and doesn't take place in a historical setting.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
