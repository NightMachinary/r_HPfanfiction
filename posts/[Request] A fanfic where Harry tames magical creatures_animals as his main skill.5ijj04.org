So many different creatures in the Harry Potter universe, I'm surprised I've never come across a fic where Harry uses them. Preferably not pokemon fics, but I'm not totally against them. I have previously read the transfiguration fic where Harry uses a few tamed animals, and does odd animal transfigurations on himself, but that's not quite what I'm looking for.


** I think what you really want is a 'fantastic beasts' fanfic but I you'll probably have to wait a while for good ones to come out.

*** I've found one decent one so far, but it's minimally beast-heavy.

  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.
