** You can try hpfanficarchive it often has stories that are not in ffn or AO3

For instance the author Selector has a story called the Witches' Secret on fanfiction.net, the story is also found on Hpfanficarchive under his RotaryFile name. However, his story called Our Lady o'the Bless'd do over is only found on hpfanficarchive and not on fanfiction.net

** Also don't forget to look on portkey-archive.org and fanficauthors.net for stories (though these are just repositories of old works (eg nothing being updated)

You can also look on wattpad, adult-fanfiction.net and hentai-foundry for stories though the last two sites are truly adult oriented.

A brilliant story where Sirius is expelled after the Prank and becomes an Art Theif. But there's so much more!!

It may be on Ao3 but I've only ever read it on Tumblr.
