Call me addicted. I need my fix guys... I have a love for Haphne that can only be sated by your recommendations. I have read the usual contenders.. so go outside the box if you can. preferably over a hundred words so i can savior it. Thanks in advance!


** When talking about Harry/Daphne I always end up recommending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]] it's dark and twisted and Harry is possibly out of character but I loved his film noir hard boiled detective persona.

*** Oh my god yes. This story is amazing. I haven't read the latest chapter but what was the final chapter was INCREDIBLE. I love this story, it's a little sad and angst-y but thinking about how much he must've loved that girl always warms my heart. No spoilers but when you get to that point you'll understand how amazing it is.

** And what exactly would be the usual contenders?

And I would have to say that my current favorite Harry/Daphne is the WIP [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][Days to Come by chris400ad]], which is a Post-Hogwarts fic, that takes place after Harry is suspended from the Aurors because of a *really* bad breakup with Ginny. Daphne is an Unspeakable, and they meet at a fancy Ministry party that a diplomat Hermione drags Harry to because Ron had to work.

**** You mean A Fine Spot of Trouble (and it was Malfoy Manor)?

Okay, I've got +three+ +four+ five more off the top of my head.

I'm assuming you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9415372/1/Beltane-Child][Beltane Child]], but in case you haven't. Not the greatest, but better than a lot.

There is the WIP [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9606120/1/The-Benefits][The Benefits]] though I'd hesitate at calling it good.

For a darker take, there is always [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6245561/1/The-Lies-that-Bind][The Lies that Bind]].

For a one-shot, there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185533/1/Uncle-Harry][Uncle Harry]] which is a visit to Dudley's family (Dudley POV) by Harry and his pureblood supremacist wife Daphne (though it is kind of implied that it is partly an act she puts on). And finally there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5071058/1/The-Reluctant-Champion][The Reluctant Champion]].

I know you've said you've read most of the ones featuring marriage contracts, but here's two I'm going to put out there anyways.

First is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487772/1/The-Amalgamation-Agreement][The Amalgamation Agreement]] by the same author as The Reluctant Champion. Sadly, only one chapter and I don't know when the author is going to start writing again (taking a break after finishing Reluctant Champion). However, this Daphne is hilarious.

Second is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contract Invalidation]] where Harry is kind of a dick. From the same author as Uncle Harry.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** AHAH one that I can actually do xP

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9570608/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-11th-Commandment][harry potter and the 11th commandment]] Harry has an uncle from his mothers side, him and his mum are elementals (lily fire harry electric/lightning) Daphne has a disease that causes her magical core to be double/mature faster than it should in exchange for half her life span.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9474009/1/Paid-In-Blood][Paid in Blood]] Harry goes back in time to get revenge after his wife (Daphne is killed) its a dark!slytherin!harry which makes use of the CoS.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11826429/1/Worthy-of-Magic][Worthy of Magic]] Harry snaps while living at the Durseley's and kills vernon and petunia. He gets sent to a juvenille facility and has control and practice over the void (magic) he also likes hurting people.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11260631/1/A-Different-Sort-of-Bond][A different sort of bond]] As the name states its an unconventional bond between harry and daphne. During 6th yr potions Tracey (atleast i think it was) slipped causing a bunch of potions to fall over and end up merging harry and Daphne's hands together.

P.S I would do the spoiler thing but it didn't want to work

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.
