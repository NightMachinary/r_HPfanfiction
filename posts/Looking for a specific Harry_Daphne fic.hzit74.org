I remember that (post 2nd war) Harry, Ron and Hermine were visiting a different country (maybe Albania?) and there was an imminent flood or landslide or some other natural disaster that was gonna hit a hospital.

They went there to try and rescue people and that's where they bumped into Daphne who had already evacuated the hospital.

There's more details I know, but don't want to spoil it in case other people stumble onto this.

Any help would be appreciated!

  Harry'd always had screwed up luck. So when he got dumped and dragged on a forced vacation, he really shouldn't have been too surprised when a Category 5 Hurricane leveled half the country. At least he got trapped in a growling shack with the girl of his dreams. Too bad he doesn't know her name, what she looks like, and is being forced to marry Daphne Greengrass instead. HP/DG
