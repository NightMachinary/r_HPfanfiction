That Fred and George charmed to do in the first book.


** It actually brings up a very interesting topic. Imagine actually living at the back of someone's head. It can get all levels of awkward, starting with sleeping and ending with taking a shit. Snowballs are probably the least embarrassing thing for Voldemort from that year..

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.
