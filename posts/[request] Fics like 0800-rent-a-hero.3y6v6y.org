  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** Very similar and somewhat recently updated: linkffn(Through the Looking Glass by James Spookie)

Very similar but incomplete and somewhat abandoned: linkffn(Harry from another world by Sprinter1988)

Similar and older, but complete: linkffn(The World Without Me)

Similarly anti-establishment but more humor based, and also complete: linkffn(A Black Comedy)

Somewhat similar and recently updated: linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel)

Vaguely similar but new and recently updated: linkffn(Potter vs Paradox)

Vaguely similar but recently updated: linkffn(Messing with Time by Nim-the-Lesser)

--------------

Potter vs Paradox has a major issue of wasted plot, and I think the author might have been flamed out of updating unfortunately =/

edit: nevermind, it wasn't PvP I was thinking of, but considering that I actually can't find the one I /was/ thinking of, it might actually have been deleted.

edit edit: Dunuelos's Lone Traveler series, especially Building a Better Burrow. It's all about wish fulfillment, so there's very little in the way of effective conflict, but it's a good read nonetheless.

  The Girl-Who-Lived won; Magical Britain never recovered. As their world grows closer to another war, the surviving DA members concoct an elaborate plan that will see Iris Potter back in time to guide her younger self and prevent the war from ever happening. Fate however has other plans. GWL BWL, dark!Harry, timetravel, canon magic.

#+begin_quote
  When things go wrong in one world, wizards seek help from another. Unfortunately what you want and what you get can sometimes be entirely different things. A tale featuring Harry, Hermione, Luna, Susan, Neville and a whole host of others. Loosely inspired by "The Meaning of Fear" by Rorschach's Blot. Rating for highly probable violence, and likely bad language.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
