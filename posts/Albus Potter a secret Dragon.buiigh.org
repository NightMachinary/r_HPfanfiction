:END:
Hey I'm looking for a fanfiction I read a long time ago, but can't find again.\\
It was about Albus having some sort of connection with a dragon because of a disease.

I remember that Albus has been purring at night wich smoothed his dormmates.\\
I'm not so sure about a part where a bird has been hurt in potions and Albus and Scorpius take care of it.

It could have been part of a bigger series or a excerpt from it.

I hope someone of you can help my.
