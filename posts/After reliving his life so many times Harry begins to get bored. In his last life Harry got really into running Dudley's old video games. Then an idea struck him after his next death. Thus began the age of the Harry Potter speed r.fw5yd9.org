** 11-year-old Harry started running, as fast as he could. Then he leapt forward. A wandlessly-cast muscle-strengthening charm helped him kick off, an air-displacing charm helped neutralise air resistance, a customized variant on a cushioning charm kept him from breaking his legs as he bounced along, getting faster with each kick.

A muggle police officer was puzzled when his speed camera registered something going past at hundreds of km per hour towards London; all he saw was a small blur.

The patrons were startled when the door of the Leaky Cauldron banged open and an unidentifiable blur whooshed through, before seemingly vanishing (or Disapparating) at the wall leading to Diagon Alley.

The Gringotts goblins in the lobby didn't bat an eye as a blur whooshed through and leapt over the minecart leading to the vaults. Time was money after all, and the tiny vial of blood labelled 'Identification' left on Griphook's desk was as good as a key in these fanfics.

Ollivander at his wand shop, Madam Malkin at her robe shop, and various other Diagon Alley shopkeepers blinked as /something/ short stirred up a whirlwind in their stores, taking what they wanted and leaving exact change.

Dumbledore tilted his head at the very odd magic-mirror-call he had just received, before wandering across his office and retrieving a particular thick book; 'A Guide to Bizarre Events & What To Do About Them (by Aurican Pulaparte)'.

A few minutes later, Harry came through a public Floo in Hogsmeade...and, screeched to a halt.\\
There, standing in front of him, was Albus Dumbledore, wearing a full bandoleer of potions, Fawkes perched on his shoulder, and, even more inexplicably, roller skates on his feet.\\
Seeing him, the aged headmaster smiled, before thrusting out a finger, "Harry Potter! I would like to join your party!"

** "Harry, why are you doing squats against the wall?"

Harry briefly stopped what he was doing. Looking up, he sees Hermione giving him one of those looks that is clear that she is questioning his sanity, again.

"Shush Hermione. This is a frame perfect trick", Harry snapped with annoyance. Backing up against the wall, he took another squat and then immediately tried to turn around.

It only succeeded in Harry getting his face intimately close to the cold stone walls of Hogwarts. Somewhere far away, Harry could swear the castle was beginning to laugh at him.

"Harry?" Hermione tried again.

It was clear that Hermione was not going to give up distracting him. Harry sighed.

"There's no death trigger behind this wall. If you crouch and then turn at the same time, you can go into the wall. Since we are also directly below the room where the Philosopher's stone is, the game will then place us into that room as it is confused as to where we are."

"In addition, since we did not go through the fire gate, Quirrel does not spawn."

"Harry, the what sto-"

"Since Quirrel did not spawn, the game then thinks that I have defeated him and moves on to the ending screen."

"I basically skip the entire first year with this trick here."

"By the way, I also end up with the Philosopher's stone in my inventory, but that's a useless item which we toss away in year 4 to a dragon."

"So please be quiet. I was on a world record pace but I may need to restart if I fail this attempt."

"Harry, what are you talking about? The Philosopher's Stone? Isn't that a legend to make you immortal?" Hermione's eyes went wide as she tried to comprehend the flood of words that just rushed at her.

"Also, I'm sure if you can fly through walls, it would have been in Hogwards: A hist-"

Hermione stopped mid-sentence.

Harry Potter had disappeared.

*** "Harry, can you at least pretend to care about the Polyjuice potion? This is a very dedicate potion that even renowned potion masters consider difficult to create!" Hermione chidded Harry, as she looks through her notes to decide the next ingredients to add.

Ignoring her, Harry went to the nearby wall with a book in hand, and began jamming the book into the wall.

"Oy mate." Ron exclaimed. "Have you lost your mind?"

Realising what Harry is trying to do, a look of realisation slowly dawned on Hermione's face. She quietly puts her ingredients back into her bag.

"Ron, Harry did this... thing last year. I don't know what he did, but the school year immediately ended."

"Have you lost your mind? I thought we were going to brew the polyjuice and get proof that Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin!"

"This game. Seesh.", said Harry, as he continued to jam a book into the wall.

"This is just so inconsistent."

"For those of us who are watching, confused, do you mind explaining?" asked Hermione, ever the bookworm.

Harry stopped what he was doing, and looked at his two friends.

"What I'm doing is called "Prop clip". Long story short, I'll go through this wall here since this is the first time I get access to Myrtle's toilet, but the event trigger to open the door isn't activated yet."

"However, we can still go through the door, go straight down to the chamber of secrets."

"Since we are still on chapter 10, Hermione isn't petrified yet. So the trigger for Ginny to appear in the chamber doesn't exist."

"Wait, Ginny? My sister?" the volume of Ron's voice growing in the same pace as his concern.

Ignoring him, Harry continued.

"Since Ginny doesn't spawn in the chamber, previous Voldemort doesn't spawn as well. This skips a 15 minute dialogue which I had to previously sit through all the time until we found this clip"

"More importantly, this means that the Basilisk's spawn cannot be triggered. With no Basilisk in the chamber with me, the game thinks that I have defeated it, and thus the final cutscene is triggered."

"It's all posted in our very friendly discord.", finished Harry, as he turned around and began slamming the book into the wall again.

"Uh mate, did the girl's loo scramble your brains?" Ron sputtered. Looking for help beside him, Hermione gave none as she simply shrugged.

"Look mate, Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin! I know it! That slimy snake..." Ron stopped mid-sentence as Harry suddenly disappeared through the wall.

A sense of deja vu slowly crept up Hermnione's neck.

"Harry, can you PLEASE take the practice seriously? The snitch is no where near the tower. This is Oliver's last chance to win the Quidditch cup before he graduates!" Ron moaned.

"Also, if he doesn't win the cup, I'm sure he will fail his exams on purpose and I'll never get a spot on the team."

"Harry, are you... Doing that thing again?" Hermione asked, catching on a lot quicker this time.

Harry let out a grunt of frustration.

"The what thing?" Ron asked

Harry looked at Hermione, waving his hands to allow her to explain.

"Harry is doing that thing where school suddenly ends. Again."

"They got smarter and placed the end triggers in a place outside the castle, where you cannot get to until the event with Sirus Black getting kissed by Dementors happens." Harry complained.

"That's a good thing!" Hermione said. "He was a mass murderer!"

"He's also my godfather whose innocence will only be known to the world when he is dead."

"Wait, that's terrible!" Hermione exclaimed.

Harry shrugged, before continuing.

"The only time we get out of the castle is during this one Quidditch practice before our one match. If I fly at a precise angle straight into an angled wall, I will go straight into the room where Sirus Black is supposed to be."

"Flying at a high speed towards a wall? Won't that kill you?" Ron asked, concern for his best friend clear in his voice.

"Nah, it's a sloped wall." Harry dismissed his issues.

"I'll have a quick set of dialogue with my godfather. He then flies away because the Hippogriff that was supposed to be there, isn't. We then watch the ending cutscene of him flying majestically in the sky by himself, and then we are done for this year."

Hermione nods.

"That makes sense."

"What? How?" Ron looked at his friends as if they were insane.

"Anyway, what do you say to your godfather, Harry? This is the first time you are seeing him right?" Hermione asked.

"No idea. I typically take a sip of water or read my mails when he is talking."

"Well, good luck Harry. I'll be packing my stuff. Let's go Ron." Hermione turns to leave, dragging an extremely confused Ron with her.

As Hermione and Ron were approaching the castle doors, a familiar voice boomed across the school.

***** For fourth year, you might be able to clip into the quiddich pitch, then go to the center of the ungrown maze, which is allowed because normally the tournament officials have spawned by this point and they stop you from entering the maze early. Then it's just a matter of summoning the cup immediately, which takes you to the ending cutscenes and skips the boss fight entirely.

​

For fifth year, the final event happens in Dumbledore's office, and no other events take place in there (that I remember), so clipping into that should end the year. Actually, now that I remember it, you see the entrance to the DoM really early on, so clipping into it then quickly exiting it might trigger the Dumbledore/Voldemort cutscene and trigger the end of year like that.

****** aha, but the cupkey triggers the scripted event of Voldemort's resurrection. Even if you manage to break free of the binds, both Wormtail and Voldemort are just an animated setpiece without collisions until he's reanimated. The flash of light from the cauldron actually marks the transition from the animated model into two NPCs, and that's the earliest you can defeat him.

And even then, you can't truly kill him even if you exploit the restoration loop to get a wand with +2784573483864% to destruction magic to get around his invulnerability keyword. He doesn't drop anything, and he's not dead forever, as the game actually has multiple instances of the Voldemort character that is activated at different points.

You can save Cedric, though. There's actually a cut conversation between him and his father that gets activated at that point, but it only happens if you grab him and clip through the headstone. The physics projectile of the AK hits the stone instead of him, and he lives.

For fifth year, you can trap Umbridge in her office the entire time by pickpocketing her key and wand and then locking her inside. This way, you can run the halls by bunnyhopping without being forced into dialogue with her inquisitorial squad, and she never discovers the RoR. The ministry map is easily the most exploitable, you can just take the first chair you find and then propglitch through the wall, fall into the cell's water level and then swim into the Department of Mysteries. However, you can also swim to the northeast from the central room and find the secluded setpiece chamber where the vision with Sirius in it happens, and all the NPCs are actually there. If you use your resto-boosted wand against the death eaters there you can actually rescue him and end up with two versions of Sirius. It's wack.

If you exploit the petrificus totalus and the mobilocorpus spell. You can paralyze all the death eaters and fling them through the arch of death, which is an instant kill for anything, regardless of level or health.

Sixth and seventh year are the worst. In sixth, you just need to glitch through dumbledore's office door after he sends you out, and that triggers the next memory scene. However, the horcrux hunt is actually just a series of levels. There's nothing you can do but skip through the dialogue and then boost people to the position the next script fires using Flipendo. Then you do the quicktime events using your macro and destroy all the horcruxes.

** This prompt reminds me of this one fic I read a while back where Harry beat canon so many times he turned it into a speed run until the hat offered him the chance to go to a harder universe. Then he ended up in a world where the school rivalry was between Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff rather than w/ Slytherin. Then Cedric Diggory released the "monster of Hufflepuff" and the experience was so horrific that the surviving members of Hogwarts ended up transferring to Beauxbatons. (Putting this up here in the hopes that maybe somebody can rec it so OP and others can enjoy, but also because it was an absolutely crazy plot.)

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS
