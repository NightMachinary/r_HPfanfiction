I'm looking for an AU where James's parents adopt Remus when they are children. But, I'm not completely sure if it was like they adopted him as a child or a servant. I do remember Remus acted like he was their servant - through some kind of guilt for them taking care of a werewolf - but I'm not sure what the angle of the adoption was.

Anyways, so the fic has James go to Hogwarts and Remus is not able to so he stays home. Eventually, James brings home Sirius and Sirius is like, uh, why this kid sleep in yalls basement?

There was a scene of a Christmas party (or some kind of party) and the rest of the Potter's family does not approve of Remus so he just stays down in the basement and Sirius is like wtf again.

But really, I'd take any Remus adoption fic you've got. Thanks in advance.
