** Looked for it but saw this from the author:

"Regardless, I would appreciate if anyone who has copies of my stories please not distribute them online. Please respect the time and effort I've put into my writing and respect the fact that I've been dealing with a lot of negativity due to what I've written, and keep the stories to yourself."

Just for what it's worth.
