The character of Hermione: boring, goody-two-shoes, intrusive moralizer. No real perception or insight of her own, reputed to be intelligent and bright due to mostly rote memorization. No original or controversial opinions to speak of. Bossy and arrogant, which is somehow made up by her caring about the only friends she has (?).

The character of Ron: obnoxious slob, lazy in all things in life. Supposedly has some talent (chess, strategy) but never applies himself and almost never manifests it in any meaningful way. Defining trait is his friendship to the MC (Harry) and his loyalty, but after several years of friendship throws it all away in a pique of jealousy, showing a severe lack of intellect, perception, or loyalty.

The character of Harry: is the hero, but does all he can to avoid being the hero. Only has any success or recognition due to either luck or some talent, but never due to personal determination. Utterly without conviction or any definite goal, a proverbial piece of literary driftwood. Actions are completely predictable, thought process is simple, does not act, is almost totally reactionary. Only defined desire in a limitless magical world is to be "normal". Sees corruption, but does nothing.

The character of Ginny: Fangirl. But somehow not a Fangirl anymore because she has more of a reason to be a Fangirl, because she was rescued from her own stupidity. Dates, possibly fucks other men to make the target of her supposed love jealous. Is supposed to be a "firecracker" and "tough" from growing up with many brothers, which, alongside her attraction to the Hero, become her only two defining characteristics.

The character of Voldemort: is supposed to be incredibly smart and cunning, but thinks the best way to win power is through terrorist acts. Supposedly holds ideals of blood purity, but ends up causing the deaths of more magical people than anyone else. Is clearly intended to be an easy target to hate and a simple villain, without any legitimate or justifiable cause or agenda. Is simply evil because he was born evil.

The character of Fudge: the high of the extreme representation of the stupid politician. Except here it's taken even further: he has no agenda, no goal, is completely selfish. Seems to only pay attention to money and scandal.

FIN.

Maybe it's because I've spent so much time immersed in both the Canon and Fanon of Harry Potter, having read millions and millions of words of fanfiction (and boy is that sad).

But the more I read, the more tired I become of these same characters popping up again and again, the more I learn to hate Rowling's canon.

The two-dimensional characters whose defining traits aren't even likable or realistic, the cartoonish dichotomy of "good for the sake of good" and "evil for the sake of evil", the complete lack of any character development to speak of. The characters as they are introduced stay the same.

Think: is there any meaningful difference at all between 11 yo Harry, Hermione, and Ron, vs. 17 yo Harry, Hermione, and Ron? Absolutely nothing. They have hormones and they fight more often. That's literally it. Do you hold the same ideas you do now as 5 years ago? Are you the same person? I know I'm not, I'd hate myself 5 years ago.

Anyway, this is a rant, I know, I'm just tired of the same old tropes and the same old characters doing the same old shit. The fics that do anything of significance different are so far and in betwey, it's depressing. Depressing that I've spent so much time time in this fandom and that I hate the source material and most of the Fanon, and depressing that I'm still looking for something fresh within it.

I know I'm going to get a bunch of shit for all this.

Maybe I just need to get off my proverbial ass and write my own shit.

That's pretty much all fanon... Take your first point, that he's lazy in all things in life, and never applies himself. In his third year he took over Buckbeak's appeal, and worked and researched, and did his very best to help out, and he volunteered to do this, he didn't have to. Not to forget how he helps his friends whenever they have problems, and considering the problems usually are life threatening, that's a pretty huge deal. And his grades are good, he and Harry are pretty equal in all classes but DADA. He also has Prefect duties, and was on the Quidditch team.

And him throwing away his friendship in a pique of jealousy? Not really how it happened... In GOF he and Harry had both talked about entering the tournament, they both seemed to think it would be cool, Harry even mentioned how he would do it during the night so no one could see him, and then Harry is chosen. Ron is trying to be supportive, congratulating him, wondering how he had done it etc. Harry says he didn't enter himself, Ron wonders why anyone else would have entered him (remember, they thought this was all fun and games and a chance for glory, so why would someone enter Harry instead of themselves?), Harry decides NOT to tell Ron that it was because someone was trying to kill him, Ron wants him to tell the truth, Harry gets angry and calls Ron stupid. During their fight, Ron seems to have tried to talk with Harry, but Harry was angry because Ron interrupted his talk with Sirius, so he threw a badge at Ron's head, and so the fight lasted longer than it might have.

If you meant their fight in DH, that was not because of jealousy either. First we need to remember that Ron was splinched, he lost so much blood that he fell unconscious, his arm was in a sling, he was already skinny and six foot something, and now he had to recover while eating meagre amounts of food. That's not ideal conditions, and then we add the horcrux to the mix, because Harry had the genius idea to wear it instead of putting it Hermione's beaded bag. Then they heard that Ginny was sent to the forbidden forest, and that that the Weasleys didn't need any more injured children. Harry seems to be relieved, and Ron seems to think Harry doesn't care because he has been through worse stuff. They have a fight, Harry yells at Ron to leave several times, they both reach for their wands, Hermione stops them, and Ron leaves.

** I think perhaps you need to read canon again, because the characters you describe bear little resemblance to the Harry, Ron and Hermione found in the books.

**** It says more about the people who use those characters in fanfics than about characters themselves. It's possible to pick any trait and focus on it, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the characterization in canon is bad. There are flat characters in this series, but they can be found anywhere. And children were her primary audience, so there definitely is a distinction between the bad and the good guys.

** Hermione definitley grew up. She went from "or WORSE, expelled" to "let's lead Umbridge into the forest where she will either be squished by Hagrid's half-brother, raped by a horde of centaurs or eaten by giant spiders", hell she torched Snape for the sake of saving her friend a month into her friendship with Harry.

Ron is more tricky. He has his mature moments, but his actions have no lasting consequences. I was discussing this issue with [[/u/deathcrow]] a couple of hours ago and we agree that it makes him a bad literary character because nothing bad comes from his mistakes. Harry gets tricked by Voldemort and Sirius dies. Or he and Hermione nearly get eaten by Nagini. But Ron fucks up and... well, no long-term consequences. Harry and Hermione take him back, he doesn't get anyone killed, all they do is give him the silent shoulder for a couple days.

Yeah, but that's not so much a real change or growth in character in any significant way - she still believes all the same things at the core, it's just a minor change in how far she's willing to go.

Doesn't that go against your idea that she grew as a character? I mean, if you define growth as any change in behavior past one of the first lines a character utters... Like, ok, but it goes to show she was exactly the same with the same values from Book 1 to Book 7.

That's ridiculous and obviously untrue. Not only does she quickly begin getting over her blind faith in authority (immediately suspecting Snape was jinxing harry), she does so because she values her friendship with Harry over the childhood naivete. To say it's just a minor changes is laughable, it's literally the polar opposite of how she started off.

This is why I didn't like the OP. It's only making true statements if you construed everything as simply as possible and ignore a lot of things. The Hermione stuff is just particularly silly since she had actual, provable growth. Harry wasn't quite as developed as her, but even he has clear instances that can be pointed out (year three versus his adulthood, for instance; I'll elaborate if asked).

Like, whatever, if that is what you consider deep and meaningful character growth, I can't really help you. To me that's such a shallow and superficial thing that doesn't even really change from Book one even.

****** You aren't making any sense. If the change is substantial, how is it superficial? It's not up for debate if the change was substantial, because she went from "Those in authority are king" to setting Snape's robe on fire, breaking past magical defenses set up by all yhe teachers. And then in book 2 making disallowed Potions to impersonate other students, using the Time Turner illegally and attacking Snape in book 3. Hell, by OoTP she willingly led Umbrige into a trap that would have likely resulted in Umbrige's murder at the hands of centaurs and had already ran an illegal defense group she herself suggested.

But I'm totally sure Hermione as she started out would have done those things too...

** Judging by your comments I can tell that you will disagree, but I thought I should comment anyway. I've read very few fanfics, so I can say my opinion isn't influenced by them when it comes to Ginny's character. She stops being a fangirl in book5. She openly tells Harry he's lucky to have forgotten she's been possessed by Voldemort. That part shows, at least to me, that she is unaffraid to speak her mind, and for someone who's been affraid to talk in fron of Harry that's something (though I know you'll say it's not a big development, but for her character it is). Moreover, when Harry breaks up with her, she doesn't spend her time weeping, but reunites the DA, and later fights in the battle of Hogwarts, and these actions have nothing to do with fangirling, she would have done those things anyway. She becomes independent, at the end she doesn't need Harry to save her. But in the end everything is a matter of interpretation, so to each their own.

******* Every normal human wants to work. At least in the sense of not being idle all the time. So that really doesn't work as an pro slavery argument.

I see it like Starfox5 it is extremley unlikley that Hermione overlooked sch a bond. So to include it in a logical way one would have to really bend out the plot to include that: a. The bond thing is not mentioned in any litterature on the topic. b. Allows for Dobby to be free without serious effects for quite some time.

I think the more rational assumption is that, if canon does not mention a bond, Hermione does not find a bond in her research and Dobby can go without it for several years then the bond does not exsist.

A funny way to play with this is for all elves to belive there is a bond but for it to just turn out to be an addictive effect that is part of the magic that enslaves them (likley some magical contract based on a lost war and ritual way back). So once a freeded elf managed to get through the detox without being pushed to take a new master/mistress they are good.

That's quite literally the least controversial thing I can possibly imagine. I moreso meant controversial in that there's 0 variance from what she was taught in 'muggle' grade school. Certainly it's not very controversial in the sense that it completely agrees with Rowling's "Good Guy (tm)" paradime.

And now that you mention it, this is a perfect example of her lack of any deeper thought or opinion on a subject. She just hears about thing X which on a semantic level goesinst what her grade school teachers had taught her, then goes out in search of information to memorize that supports her initial knee-jerk reaction. It backs up what I said about her being a shallow moralizer, as she doesn't care about anything else - even if the elves /like it/ or not - and thinks she knows better than they do.

It's one of the things that Fanon did much better, as sometimes she's forced by the author to stop and think for a moment.
