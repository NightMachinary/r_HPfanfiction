** A boy from a neglectful family discovers that he's a wizard, and is taken by a jolly giant man to a wizard school where he gets to eat whatever food he likes, learns all kinds of super-duper magic, and manages to fight off a really powerful and dangerous evil bad guy? Also, he's secretly famous?

*** This is a really great point about quality writing. 99% of novels with this storyline ARE awful, but JKR did quality writing and it shone through. Nice to know you don't necessarily have to have an off-the-wall premise to write a great story.

*** What are you talking about? The OP asked for unusual premises... JKR's premise is super cliched and has been done a million times. It's not crazy or off-the-rails at all. As you said, it's based on "your typical bland coming-of-age novel". Her writing certainly elevates it above that, but a common fantasy formula is definitely not something that I would categorize as "shouldn't work, yet does".

Maybe I'm not getting the joke here.

At least /almost/ everyone has read the books and watched the movies on this sub. On [[/r/HarryPotter]] I'm pretty sure less than half of the active posters have done both with some of the ridiculous stuff I've seen.

I'm sure there are plenty of very casual fans that go on that sub because they saw a few of a later movies, while not many people that aren't serious Potter fans are very likely to be reading fanfiction based on it, much less subscribed to a sub dedicated to that.

******* Definitely. Not to mention fan-fiction can be a rather time consuming hobby if you are a slow reader, so it sort of has that intimidation factor as well, given that there are stories longer than all seven books /combined/.

You should go over there and read some of the discussions. I read one post chain where the same person said the following things. (paraphrased)

1. /Where did you read that? Minerva McGonagall was never married!/

2. /Neville didn't marry Hannah Abbott. What are you talking about? Who is Hannah Abbott anyways?/

I was mentally cringing the entire time. I didn't have to check the front page of reddit for political cringe-posts for once!

** linkffn(Blurring Reality)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10868642/1/Blurring-Reality]]

The premise is very silly and you would think the fic was either a badly written cliche non magical AU or a total crack fic because can you really expect a fic about Hogwarts being a ballet school to be any good?

But it just works so well and it's not really what you expect from the summary. The story draws you in and gets super intense at times. It's somewhat of a psychological thriller like the movie Black Swan with a blurring of different realities, a good plot and great characterizations.

It's about a dance school putting on a performance called "the prophecy" thats basically the plot of canon events. It's a story of double meanings and parallels between the plot, the characters performing the play, their canon counterparts, the events going on in the dance school and canon universe. As time goes on, the characters start losing their grip with reality and the parallels between them and their canon selves become more apparent. Focuses on Harry and Tom Riddle who are both great in this fic.

It's not complete though and the updates are extremely slow.

** This fanfiction is incredibly busy, lots of moving pieces, but everything came together so fluidly and I don't understand how? I'm also real shitty at describing fanfictions, but basically Harry is the messiah and Ginny is some hardcore powerful Egyptian God who ended up in Slytherin instead.

Really weird, brilliant writing.

*** This is quite good so far. Thanks for posting it! I usually only search for new fics on fanfiction.net and ao3, so I miss out on a lot of stuff like this that's on other sites.

Edit: I got a few chapters in, and it definitely starts to spiral off into ridiculous Mary Sue land, but the beginning at least is really solid, and the premise is interesting.

** linkffn(Core Threads) is the end-all of "Harry gains god-like powers and crushes all opposition". By virtue of not having any conflict, and using magical cores in its worldbulding, it /should/ be yet another boring, obnoxious OP!Harry story, but somehow it's one of the most enjoyable things I have ever read thanks to a mix of humor and worldbuilding, and fits the "highly unusual" part by going lightyears further in overpoweredness than literally any other fanfic ever.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake) and linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild) both have a highly unusual premise that it would be very easy to muck up, but end up being some of the most hilarious ongoing Harry Potter fanfictions, in the vein of linkffn(Seventh Horcrux).

** I'm not certain if it qualifies as highly unusual, but I've never seen it done by anyone else. I'm writing about Pandora Lovegood, Luna's mother, in her school days, as well as detailing her strange friendship with Severus Snape. Pandora's canon background is quite scant, so I'm attempting to flesh out the character and give her a history in a believable way.
