:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic that I read probably five-ish years ago, on FFN. The pairing was Harry with an older Zabini girl, I think. I remember that she liked Quidditch, I think playing beater, and was poisoned at the end of the first book, leading into the second on a cliffhanger about whether she would survive. I remember very little else about the story but I think it was a very early work, with the first probably at least started before HBP was released. I think the poisoning may have had something to do with rice or paella, which is a weirdly specific thing to remember? But that may also be from a different fic. The fics were moderately long, somewhere between 70k and 200k words, and they were probably titled as "Harry Potter and the _______", perhaps with a labelling of numbers as well.
