*** There's a fic (abandoned) where harry makes his own broom model using feathers (Abraxian at first and later hippogriff) instead of twig bristles, so they look like feather dusters.

**** Yeah the Temporal Beacon is an incredible fic, that's what I was thinking of since it's the only one that actually explores the topic as an iterative project instead of him just magically coming up with a god broom on the first try. While the fic was abandoned, I felt like it could have just ended in a completely satisfying manner a chapter or two before that (it's been a while, I don't remember exactly how many 'extra' chapters there were).

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Honestly, I'm surprised they're still stuck on Swiffers when other witches have been riding vacuum cleaners for years now (see also: Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Discworld, the Zelda Oracle games, The Sims 3).

Someone really needs to get on that, no wonder every other magical community is calling them backwards.

(For real though, I'd love to see more stories where the Wizarding World innovates in its own way - flying vacuums or Swiffers instead of brooms, that kind of thing.)

EDIT: I got so tickled by this, that I've started making notes of a "slightly modernized Wizarding World" AU and its rules on flying cleaning implements:

- Swiffers are more maneuverable than equivalent broomsticks but have a lower top speed, owing to their shape. They'd make excellent Keeper "brooms" if the International Quidditch Confederation hadn't banned them (similar to how Muggle formula-1 racing has banned active suspension and traction control, both of which are common as heck in production cars).\\
  Hobbyists still play pick-up Quidditch games with Swiffers sometimes, and stunt-fliers are rarely seen on anything else.
- Vacuum cleaners don't take to high speeds very well and handle relatively sluggishly, but can be fitted with seats and steering implements more easily and retain the basic flying enchantments for ages. They're marketed for long-distance flights, reliability and comfort rather than sports.
- A steam-cleaner has been tried as a flying implement, but scrapped due to the impracticality of protecting the rider from the hot steam.
- Brooms are still the go-to for sheer speed, owing to their aerodynamic shape and relative lack of frills.
