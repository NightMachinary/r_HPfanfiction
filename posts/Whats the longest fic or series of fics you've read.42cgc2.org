** The longest series I've ever managed to read the whole thing wasn't HP, it was LOTR - 'The Mellon Chronicles.' No link, as the site's out of commission, or was, last time I checked.

I find it hard to stick with any HP series of fics/long fics, as they always seem to me to get caught up in their own hype and start taking themselves too seriously. As a result, I tend to stick with fics that are longer than ~5k but shorter than ~300k, unless someone gives me a very compelling rec, or it's incomplete and eventually goes past the arbitrary mark and I'm still enjoying it.

Okay, can you give me a bit more information about it, the summary doesn't say all that much. No detailed spoilers, just.. what it is about (except Hermione fighting..) and what kind of story to expect.\\
I haven't read any german stories in a long time due to the bigger amount and ffnet only being able to sort for one language. And I don't like ffdes search/sort feature much..

Funnily enough, the longest story (as opposed to series) I remember was linkffn(3631219) , so also a german one. (and appearently I'm too stupid to use the bot :D)

** Not sure if it is the longest, but Bobmin's Sunset/Sunrise duo of stories totals over a million and has the benefit of being excellent and complete.

Both on Fanficauthors.net rather than fanfiction.net, so you may need a login to read. It's worth it.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
