I vaguely recall an unfinished fanfic, and I was hoping others can help me remember what the titles was. The fanfic follows the typically trope where Harry Potter time travels, maybe even dimensional travels, to a point where his parents are alive.

Since Voldemort was still at large and whatnot, he adopts a pseudonym and stays at Hogwarts as, I'm guessing, a professor but maybe not.

There's eventually an attack on Hogsmead, I believe, which causes Harry to perform a ritual or some other dark magic in the chamber of secrets. (I think it was in the chamber, at least). I have a feeling the chamber mightve been used to evacuate everyone, or at least one or two people, during or after the attack, but maybe confusing that with another fanfic...

I can't recall, but I believe Dumbledore, McGonagall, Sirius, Lily, James and maybe even Severus, Remus, and others where there, or at least confront Harry in the chamber after the fact. I believe most, if not all, were against what Harry did, despite the good that came about it. I believe James and Sirius, maybe even Lily, were among the anti-Harry crew during that scene. At least 1 or 2 of them were definitely against his actions, since I recall Harry being upset his family didn't support him. I feel like Lily and/or James does come around eventually, though that mightve been wishfull thinking on my part. I also think there was at least one who was at least understanding of Harry's actions, which was a stark contrast to what his so-called family thought of it. Whether his family knew who he was at that moment, I am unsure; and whether they ever knew who really was before the last posted chapter, I also don't know.

Its not much to go on, but I hope someone knows what the fic is called and can tell me where to find it.


** Oh, I remember this. The ritual was necromantic, right? He killed the basilisk with an Inferi Chicken or something, and did another one to turn a stick into a wand?

*** That sounds familiar, though I can't definitely say it's the same fanfic. I vaguely recall reading a fanfic with 'inferi and transfigurated' chickens to defeat the basilisk, but I couldn't tell you if its the same fanfic I'm asking about or not...

Do you happen to know what that's called?

**** Not even a little. But if I remember it exists, I can try hunt it down. I'm relatively good at finding stuff.

For some reason, your prompt is also reminding me of a few scenes. Particularly Harry being proposed as a teaching assistant (which nobody is in favour of, including him) then dueling Moody (who was teaching defence) and then him meeting Lucius, Bellatrix, and the Minister who were inspecting the castle and playing the Pureblood Dickwomble the whole time. Not sure if it's the same fic, but the association is there in my head for some reason.

***** That also sounds familiar. I do believe the scenes you mentioned were, in fact, all part of the same fanfic. Whether it was separate from my unknown fanfic or not, well, hopefully we'll find out soon xD.

****** Okay, the one with the chicken and the wand I've found - it's called Adrift in a World. Not entirely sure if it's the one you wanted, but it's the one I thought it was, at least. :D

******* I definitely read that one before. It was a good one. Though, it doesn't quite match what I recall. At least, in the fact that there is no Hogsmead attack where Harry performs magic the light side is against and somehow using the Chamber to help out. (be it where he relocated people or where he performed a ritual at that location, I don't remember)...Maybe I read Adrift in a World at the same time as whatever that scene is from, and getting things confused again??? And now I weirdly recall another scene (likely from a completely separate fanfic) where Harry somehow calls forth either multiple different pratroni (of the marauders and the like) and/or a huge pratronus to deal with a death eater/dementer attack on Hogsmead...all th while being in (or on the way from) the hospital wing I believe...Dang memory v.v

******** That is that one! It happens in the first few chapters or so. He calls forth three patroni from the hospital wing.

********** Sure. I'll keep an eye out for the Chamber evacuation one too. Haven't found it yet though. Might be worth trying for another What's That Fic post with just that element of it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is thrown into an alternate universe due to archaic rules of magic. Hiding under the alias of Chris Collins, he tries to find a place among the suspicion of those he knew and some he never did, as Voldemort's power grows.

So very many fics that start great and are never completed
