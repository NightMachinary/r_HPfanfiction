I can't believe that kids raised by magical families wouldn't find the first year or two of Hogwarts really boring. They have had at least a good five or six years that they could be using to learn spells and potions before coming to Hogwarts. So my prompt is - the sorting hat not only sorts the students into their houses but what year level they should be in. I could see the pure blood families competing to see who's heir can be placed in the highest year. Any student who shows up at Hogwarts and is sorted into first year is looked down upon. This is part of where the prejudice against muggle borns comes from. Imaging the shit storm when Harry Potter shows up to Hogwarts and is sorted into first year like a common muggle born.


** It should be Year Level in each core subject.

"Malfoy, Draco," McGonagall called in clipped tones.

The hat was on his head for only a moment when it said, "Slytherin, Second Year Defence, Third Year Potions." It was rare to see a wealthy pureblood that was not at least a fifth year in history. It was especially inauspicious this year as a muggleborn, Hermione Granger, had been placed in third-year history.

Eventually, the person, "Potter, Harry", that everyone had been waiting for was under the hat. The shout of "Gryffindor," was expected. The silence that followed was not. No advanced placement, like a common muggleborn.

McGonagall glared at Dumbledor. Snape smirked smugly. Hagrid winced. The rest of the staff stared in shock.

McGonagall recovered and the final two students were sorted. Ron Weasley's "History Second Year," was not commented on. And Blaise Zabini was placed into the third year for all but history (fifth year) and Herbology (not mentioned).

*** They may not be able to cast magic but that doesn't mean they won't pick up a stick and learn the wand movements. It doesn't mean they won't read all about the theory. They can learn everything there is to know about potions, runes, astronomy and arithmancy without casting magic. These kids don't have tv's or tables or smart phones. They're going to read books if they don't want to be extremely bored. Those from pure blood families have all the time between buying their wands and when they go to school to practice all the first year spells. There's no reason they couldn't easily make it into second year at a minimum.

******* Some of the responses you're getting are pretty bizarre, but I think that's how more kids are being raised these days. You've got:

- More kids living in densely packed housing, so less exploring in nature

- Hyperawareness of kidnappers/molesters/etc, so more parents unwilling to let their kid run around unsupervised

- Digital distractions galore, the most "powerful" of which (consoles, PC) require one to be inside to use

- A growing style of parenting that lets kids grow up accustomed to being entertained by devices, rather than free play

All those combine to make a generation that's more likely than ever to stick indoors, make friends online instead of on the street, with parents that see nothing wrong with it.

*********** Some of my opinion comes from the younger generations I've met, but also from more observable trends. More and more kids are developing allergies, and not just food allergies, which strongly suggests that kids aren't spending as much time outside as they used to. The upward trend in childhood obesity similarly indicates a decrease in overall physical activity. And, of course, the average time a kid spends in front of a screen is ever on the rise.

It all points towards more kids growing up spending more time indoors.

******* Different person here, but it's pretty accurate for my childhood.

I grew up in the middle of nowhere. Internet beyond dialup (except wireless hotspots) didn't reach my hometown until like 2015. There was 1 other family with kids and they weren't allowed out to play usually. I had friends from school, but they all lived a good 20+ minutes away so playtime had to be scheduled in advance. We had TV, but I was really only allowed to watch PBS and TV time overall was restricted.

So I read.

I read math text books. I read readers digest. I read my homework. I read every book I owned. I would check out like a dozen when I went to the library.

Depending on the parents the pure blood kids had, they might have been similarly not allowed to be rowdy and not able to meet up with other kids. Maybe there are magical kid toys to entertain them or other forms or entertainment (we know Wizarding Wireless exists, for instance) but I could see reading being a past time, too

Let's remember that many purebloods implied they knew each other from before school in the books (like Pansy and Parvati, or Malfoy with Crabbe and Goyle or the Weasleys with the Diggories and the Lovegoods, etc.).

I absolutely agree that reading is an option. What seems insane to me is thinking that's pretty much the only way kids could grow up doing without smartphones or tv, which is what started this exchange.

As for spells - even if somehow the 'no wands till 11' rule is strictly enforced they still can practice from the moment they get their Hogwarts letter (as we know that canonically trace doesn't work before going to Hogwarts).

And as for some theory or whatnot - it would make sense if they knew at least some of it. I mean, maybe not the intricacies of high-level cursbreaking, but stuff like Gamp's laws? It's something a child would learn naturally about if they grew up with magic.
