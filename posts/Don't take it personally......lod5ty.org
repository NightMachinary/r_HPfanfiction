There are many folks out there who like muggles over wizards....and I think this is because they think that it is them being shown as inferior,they see the muggle characters and relate to them. but that's the thing, some people, subconsciously consider them muggle and are therefore jealous of wizards....so try to consider yourselves as wizards(sounds absurd,but still) not muggles because otherwise you won't be able to relate that much with the wizarding world or the world of Harry Potter. I'm not against anyone who likes the so-called modernization of the wizarding World,but that's the thing.... the wizarding World and it's culture is unique , it's old culture gives it the aura of mystery and wonder...so don't take offense when something outdated happens in fics,try to establish it with the story and enjoy


** I never understood how some people could truly consider Muggles superior to Wizards. I mean, the only difference is Magic, Wizards can litteraly do everything a Muggle can do, *plus* magic. Magic could be the shittiest thing in the world, only able to make someone hairs grow that it would still give the Wizards an advantage.

*** I think it's mostly that Wizards seem quite unintelligent by most standards. They make looooots of really stupid mistakes throughout the series. Plus the whole 'Wizards are backwoods savages' cliche thing vis a vis the slavery and generally simplistic and low-tech society.

Just my guess at their reasoning - personally, I honestly don't think either of them are better. They both have their strengths and they both have their weaknesses. You play your resources well and smart and either side can at least hold their own against the other.
