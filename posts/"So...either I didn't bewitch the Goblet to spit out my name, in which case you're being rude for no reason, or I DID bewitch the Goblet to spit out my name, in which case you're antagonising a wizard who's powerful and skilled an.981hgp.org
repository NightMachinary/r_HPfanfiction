"Or, third option, I got someone else to do it for me, in which case I'm still friends with someone powerful and skilled and willing to break rules."

Does anyone know a fic with this kind of scene in it? One where Harry or another character points out the problem with antagonising someone because they supposedly did something bad, when they would need to be extremely powerful, competent, or well-connected, as well as willing to break the rules/law to do so?

Addendum: I'm more thinking of 'Harry says this to students who are bothering him after being selected over the next few days' rather than 'Harry says this to everyone in the room immediately after he's selected and people are accusing him'.


** Is he talking to the Ministry people (Crouch/Bagman)? Because the Ministry has people to deal with wizards who are powerful and skilled and aren't concerned with rules. They're called Aurors.

*** If he isn't, then he's talking to Karkaroff (a death eater in the inner circle) or Madame Maxime (esteemed headmistress of famous wizarding school).

Or Dumbledore.

Seriously, why would they be worried about someone who tricked a goblet?

** Something like this happens between Harry and Percy in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past).

#+begin_quote
  "Very impressive, Percy," Harry said. "How long did you have to argue with the Sorting Hat to avoid Ravenclaw? Of course you conclude that I'm a dark wizard and then decide to confront me, alone, without a wand in your hand." Harry moved his right hand forward as he finished, and the wand he'd removed from his sleeve jabbed the older boy in the stomach, making him flinch. "Maybe you really do belong in Gryffindor after all," Harry concluded.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

He cant really do much to them since if he did the ministry and/or dumbledore would be on his ass for it.

Even Tom Riddle knew to be sneaky and charming so nobody suspected him. So yeah harry should never be stupid enought to say that shit in public, even if he is powerful enought to do so.

** This happens in /The Mind Arts/ by Wu Gang:

#+begin_quote
  Harry ignored any stares he received and no one seemed comfortable confronting him. Perhaps the lesson that challenging him was a bad idea was finally starting to sink in.

  Or perhaps not. Tuesday, outside of the Hogwarts express, Harry clawed his fingers and the brave seventeen-year-old Gryffindor, Alicia Spinnet, who had challenged him, choked on nothing when the air around her stopped responding to the movement of her lungs.

  He took a deep breath to show off that he could as her hands went to her chest and eyes bugged out slightly.

  "Either I didn't trick the Goblet and my name came out, indicating I am the greatest possible champion for Hogwarts. Or-" he took another exaggerated inhalation of fresh salty air as Spinnet finally fell to her knees, "-or I did trick the Goblet, making my magical puissance far greater than yours." He paused again before continuing slowly. "Neither of which you can be particularly upset about." On his last syllable he released her and strode towards Beauxbatons.

It's a really good story, one of the 3 that I'm currently actively following. The Triwizard Tournament take's place at Beauxbatons in this one. linkffn(12740667)

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
