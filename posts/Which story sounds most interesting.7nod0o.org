Petra Hendrix has an interesting last two years of Hogwarts ahead of her with her friends Marcus Flint and Arielle Chambers. Throw in a proposal and a wedding, two twin sisters who share everything except one thing, the possibility of becoming an animagus, N.E.W.Ts and a budding romance with her friendly academic rival Roshan Shafiq.

(0C/OC, eventual Marcus/Oliver, mostly finished, Light and Stone)

--------------

Deirdre is the beloved little sister of the bassist of The Weird Sisters Donaghan Tremlett. She has a lot on her plate--telling her brother's crazy fans that no, she does not give out his autographs, or no, she won't introduce them and even no, she does not fantasize about snogging her brother, what is wrong with you people? Luckily, she's got a loving boyfriend to support her through it all. Well, it'd be lucky if she didn't have these persistent feelings for a certain ginger prefect and Quidditch star named Charlie Weasley who is certainly not her boyfriend.

(eventual Charlie/OC, Untitled, Romance/Drama, about 20,000 words written)

--------------

When Josephine Cracknell got the job at the Romanian Dragon Reserve she doesn't expect to reconnect with childhood frenemy Charlie Weasley who she hasn't seen since they were sixteen. She doesn't remember him being so attractive instead she remembers him annoying her with his dragon obsession. She wonders why Charlie is being so nice to her when she was under the impression that he didn't want to see her anymore.

(eventual Charlie/OC, Romance/Drama, 2 chapters written, Untitled)

These are all rough summaries of the stories.


** If you are writing to appeal to an audience you are doomed. Write what you want. If you force yourself to write something just so that others find it interesting you are doomed. Just my two cents.

*** This is the best advice. I wrote a story about a female Lord Voldemort that had I listened to what people said was a total waste of time and there was no way I should ever consider writing it because it sounded just terrible.

It is now routinely called my best story and those same people are begging for updates.

****** Why do you put little notes in the beginning of chapters comparing fanfiction characters to celebrities and including a word count?

I feel like you really need to work on length and dialogue. The whole thing is super choppy and doesn't really come off as relatable or believable in the context of the story or the universe.

The whole 'I got knocked up by a guy who lied to me and said he was infertile and I believed it but I'm going to keep the kid because why not he looks like a guy I liked years ago' just makes the MC come off like an idiot.

The total indifference to the whole situation from a person who's life is about to be royally different. And the whole, "Oh I'm not even going to tell the father" but is gag inducing. What should be serious and life-altering decisions are handled very poorly here. There's a lot of stacatto sentences too that should really be flushed out. "Charlie's job was to recruit foreign wizards. He recruited his Romanian buddies" sounds like middle-school level writing.

******* I do the word count thing because I get to a certain amount each month. As for the characters, I like having face-claims.

I admit I didn't know how to write this drama and I just wanted the guy to a disposable so she could end up with Charlie

******** Then describe them in prose. The most glaring 'fault' as it were with what I read here was that it reads far more like a script to a play than it does a story. There's a lot of 'prose' that reads more like scene directions than anything else, which can be very jarring.

You should also pick a nickname. Having every character call her something different is more annoying than cute and I have a very hard time imagining a person tolerating that. Consistency with things like that are hugely important. You also don't really need to list out ages and heights and what not. It's pretty pointless to the actual story. Do it through description. Describe someone as shorter than someone else, and then taller than someone unrelated, build i that way, rather than just saying, He's 5'9. But do it when it matters to the plot.

I freely admit I think I got through six chapters and have no vested interest in either of the characters. The guy is a prick that told a girl he was infertile to get out of using protection? Something that magic has likely made easily available? I mean sure, we were drunk, we fucked, I'm pregnant, I want to keep it for reasons, fine. But instead you go Snidley Whiplash level villainy with it. He deliberately told her he was infertile presumably so he wouldn't have to wear a condom. I'm not even sure I can express in words just how awful that is.

But she's just is bad. She has no real interest in the kid. She's daydreaming about a childhood crush, refusing to tell the father about a life-altering mistake, and not thinking at all about the consequences. She's a 22 year old pregnant woman who doesn't think about her future, her life, the child's life, or anything. She shows no regret or real interest in the parasite that will be residing in her for 3/4ths of a year. Nor does she show any joy to the thought of possibly bringing new life into the world.

IT gets worse too, in chapter one you have her aware of Cedric Diggory but not aware he's dead. And while the ministry did try to cover up the whole 'Voldemort Murdered him'' bit, he still died in what we could assume is a widely publicized competition. It would have made news in the states. Worse is it's implied she was friendly with him, so she likely would have been at least aware of his progress. Not knowing he's dead is fairly unbelievable, but then her reaction is literally, "she was sad." She reads like a robot. Kimi Raikkonen shows more emotion in press conferences than she does at finding out she's having a kid. It reads more like a fantasy than a plot.

She does not read like a 22 year old who is coming to terms with the fact that her life goals and ambitions are going to have to be put on hold for a time for another person.

It also does not help that no one along the way goes, "You don't seem like you have your shit together. Maybe you should abort it" Not saying that's the decision that should be made. But it is certainly something that should be talked about.

I don't really mean to be harsh. There's just really a lot missing from what's there. I mean 900-1500 word chapters are incredibly short as is. But then they're mostly dialogue that doesn't do much to build characters. The Charlie thinking she's a veela bit at the end of chapter 1 is a nice touch and actually establishes something. A lot of the other dialogue does not. There is just way more that should be going on there than what is.

Again, we never really get her telling us how she feels about being pregnant. Instead she's too busy fantasizing about Charlie. I'm sorry but I have a very hard time picturing her actually more worried about that than figuring out what she's going to do. There is certainly a story to be had there, but what you have presented comes off as a fantasy rather than an imitation of life. The people in it do not act like people.

If you don't know how to write it, then play around way more with it. Sit down and write a list of pros and cons, explore what every aspect of it would mean, and how a character would react to it. Get inside their head so you can present their arguments, their thoughts, their feelings, to the audience. She never comes off as terrified, happy, worried, or anything and it makes it extremely hard to relate.

********* She doesn't have to put her life on hold for a child she can still work. Though, that doesn't come in until later. She does tell the father and they used protection..

********** An adults life is a lot more than going to work.

And sure, she tells him and his reaction is immediately 'oh the guy that knocked you up looks like Charlie'. Almost verbatim. He then completely dismisses it and everything is happy. That isn't life. Literally the sentence after learning that the father will not be in her life, her father switches to 'oh he looks like Charlie'. That's eye-rollingly cringy.

That is more how I would expect a stoned addict to react than a caring, loving father. He expresses no real concern for his daguther's well being and immediately drives the conversation elsewhere. This is a monumental life-changing event that they discuss like they're browsing Facebook.

No one in the story seems to care about the main plot point of the story.
