** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose]] - probably the best example of a Dumbledore that manipulates. It's accurate and likely how Dumbledore would manipulate, through subtlety and the insidious exercise of his power for the good of Harry instead of "hahaha blocking magical core".

  “Blood of the friend, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your ally.”\\
  Voldemort is resurrected. It doesn't go exactly like in the books. This is what happens when I read a bunch of 'good Voldemort, evil Dumbledore' stories, and then try to imagine what it would actually be like for Severus Snape in such a universe during the thirteen years spent alone at Dumbledore's side. Here's a hint: Voldemort is not easily getting his spy out of Dumbledore's clutches. And saving Harry Potter may be a bit of a trial as well.
