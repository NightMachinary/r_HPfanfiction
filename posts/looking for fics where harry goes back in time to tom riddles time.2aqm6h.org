** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favorite]] and it's prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player][Past's Player]] are decent.

Fate's Favorite was written first and I recommend reading it first. A warning to you, it's NOT slash, but Harry's relationship with Riddle is 'odd' to say the least. You'll know what I mean if you read it. I think it's worth the read, even if it is a little 'off'.
