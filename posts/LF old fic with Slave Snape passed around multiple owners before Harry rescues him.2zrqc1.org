- starts off with Snape becoming headmaster after the war
- arrested due to decree to enslave all death eaters
- sent to a slave re-trainer, tried to escape in bat form
- order tries to buy him at auction but fail
- at some point owned by a couple who has a son at durmstrang
- also owned by some sketchy drug organization that requires him to be tortured a lot.
- Harry finds him while being owned by a German farmer who is using him as manual labor.\\

No idea what the name of this was. It wasn't super good (are any slave fics?) but just sort of curious as to where it went.

** It's called Unwell by SocksForDobby [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5248423/1/]]

And yes, BetterAngels by lmk05, which I had the honour of beta-reading, /is/ super-good - one of the best fanfics out there, of any kind. There are a few other very good slave-fics - Proof of Life and Ashes of Armageddon by Emily Watson; Cambiare Podentes by Jordan Grant; Bondsman 2541D by Allocin and two called Clipped Wings and The Fourth Year whose authors I forget. The Emily Watson ones are fraught but ultimately positive, Bondsman 2641D is sweet but tragic and The Fourth Year is a comedy.
