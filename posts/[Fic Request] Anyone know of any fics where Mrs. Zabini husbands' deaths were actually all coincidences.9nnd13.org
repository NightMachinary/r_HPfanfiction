** I recall a fic somewhere that had the slightly NSFW-ish idea that she was basically a high-class escort whose thing was that she'd offer her hand in marriage to dying wealthy wizards for a few months of passionate romance and lovemaking, and be "paid" with the inheritance.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11145058/1/][Daphne Greengrass, Side Character.]]

Warning - I haven't finished this story, but it has what you're looking for. In fact, in my mind it takes the "Slytherins are all misunderstood" a bit too far - they're all practically saints who're bullied and put-upon by the rest of the school.

There IS some very interesting introspection where they all claim to say "mudblood" ironically, and how they're always making jokes about joining Voldemort and how THAT may influence how the rest of the school treats them, but I can't guarantee that that interesting line of thought is carried through the rest of the story.

*** Haven't read it, so I can't legitimately criticize, but the "I'm not racist, I'm saying it ironically/as a joke/I have ____ friends who are cool with me saying it" has never really held water with me.

**** I agree - and that's touched upon in the story. If I recall correctly, Daphne and Blaise make a pact to never say 'mudblood' again precisely because all the claims of "ironic" muggle hatred seem like justifications.

And I'm not kidding about the author making the Slytherins into saints - Draco Malfoy turns out to be tutoring the first year girls in potions, and Snape's blatant favoritism is just to counterbalance how the other teachers and students oppress them.

So it's a very entertaining mixed bag, and I recommend reading it.

***** The Draco thing is definitely something I don't see much, but the Snape thing I see in basically every fic that even slightly features Slytherins

** u/panda-goddess:

  death is in love with her but he's jealous and kills her husband's over and over

Or maybe to have the opportunity to interact with her (like in The Sims)
