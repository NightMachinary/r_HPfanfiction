:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Years ago, I use to use Fictionalley Forum to find old and new fanfics. While its no longer useable at least since 2018, I did find out its still available to look at old posts. I thought it was kinda neat looking at the old posts, so figured others might be interested in looking through it. here's the link: [[http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=19]]

EDIT: I'll also include a few post post for finding fanfic that were never found in fictionalley. feel free to ask about others yourselves!


** While looking through it myself, I figured Id ask about a few of the posts I was curious about.

The first is [[http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/showthread.php?s=&threadid=161007]]

"Help harry potter time travel fic/AU Ok so a while ago I know I read this fic but I cannot for the life of me find or remember the title. I think it was an FF.net but I can't be too sure, basically I think it was a time travel fic similar to midnight blues' the mirror of maybe where harry goes back in time to teach defence during his own years at Hogwarts. I remember Snape also being a teacher and that Harry freaked him out by using parsel-tongue to talk with his snake. i remember that they decide to give Snape some of the snakes' venom as an apology ad that the process take a while. I think the snake was the opposite of an ashwinder but again not really sure..."

Ironically, I think I recently read a fanfic just like this. I cant remember what it was called, but I am pretty sure it was Snarry, and that Harry dated him before he went to the past. Whether it was the same or not, I don't know, but thought I'd post it here in case others know about it and can remember what it was called.

*** It's been a long time since I read it so I can't be sure if it's the right fic, but No Way Back by Meri Oddities uses the premise from Mirror of Maybe (with permission). linkao3(101475)

**** Not sure if that was the original one, but the one I remember was a multi-chap fic I believe. If I recall correctly, Harry made it his mission to befriend Snape and it annoyed Snape alot in the beginning. There mightve been a valentine's day scene as well....Thanks though!

** The second is [[http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/showthread.php?s=&threadid=150769]]

" Harry travels back in time to his parents Hogwarts time. Death Eaters kidnap the Marauders and Lily. Harry has a vision showing where they are and goes and rescues them alone. When they are in the hospital the Marauders chat and Harry overhears them. They speculate that he might be on the dark side. He runs off and hides in the room of requirement which changes into a cupboard under the stairs. "

I also remember reading something similar. I didn't think Lily + Marauder were in school, but otherwise sounds familar. I don't know what it was called but the one I remember I recall Harry doing some dark magic to help during/after Death eater attack. I think there was a whole confrontation within the Chambers of Secret between Harry and the "light side" (professors, maruaders, Lily) about his dubious means; I think some did accept him though.

" ï¿¼ Unicorns and Harry. I read a story, in which Harry is abused by the Dursleys. I remember one of the chapters, in which Hagrid was away, and professor Grubbly Plank was taking over CoMC. She had some unicorns to teach about, and one of the unicorns went over to Harry and gave him its horn. After this, Harry was sent over to the Headmaster, because he was accused by the teacher, or his classmates, of using magic to make the unicorn go over to him. Dumbledore asked to touch the horn, which ended up on him being hurt. After this, Dumbledore became kind of sad, at not being pure enough to touch the horn. However, Harry could touch it and not become hurt by it, meaning he was really pure.

I'm not sure but I think it was a Severitus or Sevitus story. "

I never read this, but I was and still am curious if others know what it was.
