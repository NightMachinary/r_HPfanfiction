So, what im looking forward are no [[/r/Hr][r/Hr]] Fics, atleast not completely. They can be together at the Beginning. But then, due to some action, may it be an argueing....they separate and dont see each other for Years. Maybe Ron might be working for an Organisation that consumes a lot of his time, same as maybe Hermione whith her Work in the Ministry. It might be, that each want to contact or meet with the other to apologize, but due to the lack of time, their attempts are fruitless and since the other dont try to contact (in their eyes), they get angry again.

However, after Years due to some event (a celebration or maybe even a new big Fight) they meet each other again, but its embarassing, because its unexpected. Also its embarassing, because both of them have come over their Past and there is nothing more than Friendship that connects them. I would like it, if Ron having a new Girlfriend and because he took her with him, the whole situation gets more embarassing. As for Hermione, i would like her to be Single or with Harry. Im not rejected to H/Hr Fics, but i would like her a single or in a "temporal" relationship. I guess, i would even accept her with Draco, if thats the only Fic that fits into my Request. Hermione getting introduced with Draco to Ron and his new Girl, but with the later ones assume the Blond one to be Hermiones new Lover is also fine.
