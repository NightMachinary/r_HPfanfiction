The problem with most fics where Harry's an asshole is not him being an asshole - it's that the narrative bends over backwards to make him right. The people he's a jerk to always deserve it and he's somehow the good guy.

Give me stories where he's an unapologetic jerk and isn't presented as always right. Where running his mouth off has consequences and where he doesn't have five lordships and an immense magical core to back it up.


** Or where at least somebody calls him out on being a jerk despite his five lordships and infinite magical core. I still haven't got over “Augurey” (linkffn(The Augurey by La-Matrona)) ([[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][my review]]), where Harry literally gets away with a murder and Hermione's only reaction is that she drools over his big good heart.

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

** There's one where Hogwarts is actually the equivalent of University and Harry plays off the books as sanitized kids books to rake in cash while the fic is basically Animal House.

I can't remember the name of it unfortunately.

**** Yeah, it's definitely a product of its time (it's quite old). But I appreciate it for the criticism Harry and Hermione both get. Ending was pretty shit though, so you're not missing much at the end of the day

  COMPLETE: An AU Fifth Year fic written pre-OotP. Sword fights, apocalyptic battles, new kinds of magic. Love, betrayal, angst. Doing the right thing, doing the wrong thing, and doing it in style. This is epic. This is dark. *This* is TTK:Reloaded.
