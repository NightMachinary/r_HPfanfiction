** A decent lawyer (solicitor) might try to work some magic with this. He has the Dark Mark from his Imperiused days, he got the summons from the Mark, he put on the robes and went to see what exactly was going on. He was afraid that a failure to answer the summons immediately may put his and his family's life at risk. He had every intention of discovering if Voldemort could really be alive and reporting back to Fudge. He was biding his time to try and save Potter and take him back, when Potter bolted for the portkey Lucius grabbed a hold of him so he could travel back with Potter and report what had happened.

**** I mean, I don't think he actually does anything wrong at the Graveyard. He's not present for the Diggory murder, happened before he was there. He watches Voldemort crucio Harry, but he can just say he was trying to find the best opportunity to get him and Harry out alive.

Honestly this is motivating me to see a story about a slow reformation of the Malfoys after Lucius is forced into choosing to go against Voldemort because of a situation like this.

***** I think the danger here is that ministry doesn't want to believe Voldemort is back. So they could try to blame everything on Malfoy alone.

****** Except a large part of that is Lucius supports and pushes that lie with Fudge. Fudge might still decide to be an idiot and not believe Volds is back, but he would then be without his campaign funding and maim source of income. And this may effect how many people really believe Dumbledore vs the Ministry, especially since it seems likely that Lucius bribed the Prophet to keep running smear stories on Harry and Dumbledore.

It seems just as likely that he would bribe them to keep out of it, or maybe even smear Fudge.

******* Yes, that is possible. I honestly don't know if Lucius would rather denounce newly reborn Voldemort try to save himself from Azkaban or go to Azkaban, knowing he will probably be broken out soon, hoping to win some points with him.

******** Yeah this is a good point to consider and he obviously does make this exact decision after he is imprisoned at the end of Order of the Phoenix.

One way to look at it is when Lucius made that decision at the end of OotP, Voldemort was fully back. He was envoying with the Giants, he was amassing followers, they had been smearing Dumbledore and Harry in the papers for a better part of the year. Voldemort had proven that he was back on the rise.

Now imagine Lucius has to make this decision back at the end of GoF. He just saw Voldemort return after a good (14? I'm never great at my HP timeline) year hiatus. First thing he does is gather his followers to watch him kill Potter, and he botches it again. Not only that, Harry shows some considerable power in the Priori Incantatem that binds him and Voldemort the way it did. Maybe he realizes the bind he's in and decides maybe Voldemort isn't the best bet. We know Malfoy is first and foremost all about what is best for the Malfoys (him specifically, but sort of his family as well). Maybe at the end of GoF he's not so sure he'd get out of Azkaban so he turns then.

Well, this is kind of damning. Granted it's movie dialog, but...

#+begin_quote
  Lucius Malfoy: My Lord, had I detected any sign; a whisper of your whereabouts--

  Voldemort: Oh, there were signs, my slippery friend, and more than whispers!

  Lucius Malfoy: I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways! The face I have been obliged to present since your... absence -- that is my true mask.

****** Well yeah, but that fits right in with his story that he was simply going there to see what the deal was and was going to report back to Fudge and the Ministry ASAP.

Malfoy had his money deep in the pockets of the Fudge administration. He was the Minister's invited guest at the Quidditch World Cup. Knowing what we know about Fudge, he'd almost believe anything to avoid a scandal in his direction.

*** Exactly. Plus Lucius could use Cedric's murder to justify fleeing the graveyard. He could just say that once he realized Voldemort's first action after returning was to kill a child and try to murder another one, he had to defect, no matter how risky it was to do so.

**** Good point! He could even make it more believable by keeping a bit of his pureblood superiority reputation and emphasize how appalled he was at Voldemort killing a pureblood child. Yeah this won't win him favorites with Harry, Dumbledore, and the Order, but would probably play well with a lot of the Ministry and the Wizengamot.

***** That's a great point, I forget that Cedric was a pureblood. Plus, Draco is at Hogwarts and so are a bunch of the parents, so conceivably, Narcissa could have been there too. He could make a show of having ran straight to his family to make sure they were safe from Voldemort now that he had seen him return with his own eyes, killing an innocent pureblood child just because he wasn't of use. If Lucius Malfoy himself is trying to flee with his family, I'm sure Fudge wouldn't be able to contain people's panic, and while Harry would probably not believe Lucius, Lucius could also make a show of denfending Harry against murder charges.

  Mercenary, bounty hunter, assassin, and now apparently a bodyguard. That means having to go back to a place and deal with things I don't want to. WBWL story. Pairings as of yet are undecided. It's kind of a slow burn.
