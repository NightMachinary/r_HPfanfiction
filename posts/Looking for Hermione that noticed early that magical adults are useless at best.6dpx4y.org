Hermione is a girl that grew up with a strong belief in authority. Probably because during her pre-Hogwarts time adults were helpful (teachers stopping bullies, telling her stories and so on). Then she comes to Hogwarts and nearly dies within two months, sees a teacher bully a student, sees a teacher curse her friend's broom what resulted in his near death (even if she suspected the wrong one), sees someone hatch an illegally obtained dragon egg, her friend has to fight magical Hitler who is mysteriously alive and no one cares. Then she meets the supposed ministry expert on non-magicals, who is an idiot who does not know how to read an encyclopedia.

In her second year she nearly dies to a magical snake, her friends are advised to walk into a deathtrap, a teacher is a fraud, there are no consequences of the entire mess and a +known terrorist+ upstanding member of the society tries to kill her friend, again without consequences. Someone with her intelligence should have by then figured out that the magical adults do not live up to her standards. So are there any stories where she does realize how useless they are?

Please no canon pairings, Dramione, or good Snape and Dumbledore.


** That's actually super rare...

Here Hermione really doesn't give a shit about anything except her Harry and books. Authority figures are an obstacle that need to be put in line...

This one sort-of fits, but Hermione behaves differently for other reasons than the ones you proposed... she certainly doesn't offer any real respect to "authority figures" and there's a glorious payoff at the end of Book 1 - that I don't want to spoil.

**** That's certainly true. Let's just say she doesn't respect traditional authority figures (you should respect me because everybody does)? Harry earned her respect and confidence... but you're right, he's totally an authority figure.
