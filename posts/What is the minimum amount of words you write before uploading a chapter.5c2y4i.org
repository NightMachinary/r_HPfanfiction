** Its always comfortable to have several chapters done before uploading to make scheduling easier. If you wanna keep a, for example, weekly schedule, you should have, I think, at least 2 months worth of chapters done (of course depending on how long your story is).

If you don't care, upload whenever a chapter is ready. I like to keep it around 5000 words.

** I'm writing the entirety of my fic before I post any of it. I don't want to get discouraged or make readers wait too long. Some people post chapters as they write them, whenever that is. Or they publish on a schedule and try to just keep up.

In the fic I'm writing now my chapters are on average 3500 words. The shortest is around 2100 (I'll probably add a bit though!) and the longest is nearly 4500 so far!

Do what feels best for you. If you do well under pressure it'll be different than if you'd rather not be stressed about getting it done on a certain timeline.

** I write until all the scenes that need to be in the chapter are finished.

In less abstract terms, my minimum is about 7k.

** When I started, 3000 words. Now it is 5000-8000 words.

** When I began, 1000 words. Then I learnt that it was way too little. Like some says, write everything before publishing, because you can notice that you made a mistake -an unanswered mystery perhaps, or a plot that went nowhere- and have to fix it. Now I write around 3000 words, but I write since 3 years, made a long pause, and don't have much experience anyway.

** Between 5,000 and 10,000 is the best, over 15,000 is too long. But it depends on where your natural stopping point is for the chapter most of all.

** It depends. I try to find a natural break in the story rather than trying to hit a word count, but that usually ends up being about 3,000 words at least. It partially depends on the schedule you have for uploading your chapters- more often you can get away with shorter chapters, but if you are going to have huge wait times, go for longer chapters.

** My chapters are 1-2000 words at the moment and I am just writing them as they come to me. However, i plan to change that once I have the plots better fixed in my mind and move to more like 5000 words.
