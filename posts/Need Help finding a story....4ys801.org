So a (long) while ago I read a story which I now can't find anymore. Add to that ff.net's horrible search filter and I could use some help. I don't remember to much anymore. In the story they make use of some kind of rune-chambers that use leylines to channel magic. The teacher is also jealous of his natural understanding of it and later betrays them. An later ally is an ancient head of a pureblood (death eater?) family. He's not really evil but I think he still was a bit of a bigot. The rune chamber magic also had different "flavors" like celtic and other.\\
That's all that I can recall, hopefully somebody can recognize my jumbled thoughts and knows the story.
