As a writer of FF or anything really, what do you strive to do? Is there a chapter length you like l? (I prefer 5k+ minimum) how much planning do you do per chapter? Music or quiet? Just wondering, a Knut for your thoughts 4 I think


** Generally with a fic I set a specific goal myself as a writer. Past goals have included: post a 700-1000 word chapter a day no matter what, deconstruct consent issues inherent in the Veela trope, and see how much of modern US politics I can incorporate into the plot while writing in real time as events unfold. My current project is working to utilize narrative fragments told in different tenses and voices to create a cohesive whole. It's also the first fic I've ever written to a beat sheet, which is interesting.

*** Your current focus sounds like a cool challenge. Do you find using the beat sheet helpful at all? I've had informal bullet points, but I almost never refer to them.

**** It's interesting. I've used them for original work before, but never for fic. I still just pants the plot, but it gives me a framework of ‘this is the spot you should be hitting the first threshold' and perhaps that will help with pacing issues, especially at the end. I tend to get complaints my endings are rushed.

** Are you seeking advice for yourself? If so, you should simply start writing, and you'll learn what works for you as you go. Everyone is different.

For my part, I've had the broad strokes planned, but much of the rest is inspired while I write. I'm sort of methodical; I follow the logical course of events until I come to a natural stopping point for the chapter. This causes some variance, but they remain on the long side. I prefer silence or miscellaneous background noise---music distracts me.

** Some tips that worked for me:

Never start a story until you know the ending. Write a minimum amount of words per day, no matter what. Keep a regular update schedule. Finish your story.

Personal style: When I write, I focus on the characters and let them act and react according to their means and goals. I keep the overall ending in mind, but the plot can and generally will get altered as the characters develop. I want to avoid the "plot induced stupidity/OOC-ness" where characters are reduced to plot devices so the plot doesn't get derailed. I aim for 7-8K per chapter on "main fics", and 5K for side stories, and weekly updates.

** This is just something I do because I know what it is like to be on the receiving end of inconsistent updates. I make sure I have a few chapters finished before I post the first chapter. Then I provide a timetable for updating to the readers and make a writing schedule as if I never had those previous chapters written. So whenever I need a break or something in real life pops up I will have a chapter ready to be posted that week no matter what.

One of the best things to do is go over what you've written and see how many sentences/details you can cut out because they aren't important. Sure, sometimes it is good to provide useless details for worldbuilding purposes or to set the scene (are they really useless then?), but make sure you don't bog down your reader.

Edit: Forgot the most important tip. Best thing to do is just start writing and get reviews on it. Good luck.

** I decided long ago that submitting by chapter length was an unfulfilling way for me to go about. Instead I submit when the chapter "feels" finished. I can't properly explain it.

Overall I've been quite happy though some have called me "The Queen of Cliffies" (a title I don't really agree with) but still amuses me.

** Tips for writing: Just write, and write, and write, and eventually you'll start to get a feel for where you're at. Even if it's not very good at first, just keep going for it, try new things, experiment with your style and different ideas. Maybe go for something short first, don't go right into writing an epic. Put your stuff out there, don't take critics to harshly, but remember that people often do provide good opinions.

​

For myself: I personally don't listen to music, very rarely do, because I can find it distracting (although I know some authors thrive on it, like Brandon Sanderson). Chapter lengths vary a lot for me, although I like putting out at least 6k, but I've had a few reach over 15k. I'm more of a gardener in my approach with only a few major plot points/cool ideas that I work towards. However, I do plan to experiment with a more architect approach in the future. Overall, I aim to put out an actively engaging and entertaining story with well rounded and developing characters, that improves with each update. At some point I plan on attempting my own original work, and consistently working through the medium of fan fiction is a way of reaching a point where I'm confident enough to do so.

*** Pants the whole thing. Usually I have a decent idea of ‘how it ends' but the road between start and end is a mystery I discover as I go. About 2/3 of the way through, I generally reread and make a list of all the plot threads I need to wrap up in the climax.

This is probably not an optimal working method, but if I have an outline I get bored.

*** I have a very broad outline - basically where to start the story and how I want it to end. I wrote about ten chapters before beginning to post them. I normally have at least two chapters finished before I post one and I have the rough outline of scenes that I want to happen for about two or three chapters. Everything else comes to me as I write it.

** My Story: LinkFFN(Wolf Lord)

​

I like music when I am writing. Start an AMV in a genre I like and let the youtubes run away with autoplay.

I was shooting for ~500 words a day and a chapter every two weeks before I started my edit phase on the story. Just a chapter or two on that before I can start really writing again.

Planning... Almost none. I had the inital scene. I had plans for the First task, and i have a plan for a final showdown with Greyback at some point. Since then, as I have been writing things have filled themselves in.

As I have gone I have asked my how would this work if it was real and tried to keep the characters realistic as people and the effects of things happening as realistic as I can while still serving the story.

Some things I know are going to happen, others have completely surprised me when they happened:

[Spoilers] Spoilers beyond here for the story!

Hagrid is going to kill and injure some werewolves with his crossbow

Katie Bell is going to be kidnapped by Weres over christmas, be bitten, and be saved by Sirius Black, who at the time was her "pet."

Peter Pettigrew is going to be treated as a competent if cowardly individual.

Someone will die each task in the GOF arc

Hermione Granger is crippled and attending Beauxbatons. She will appear in the GOF arc and perhaps run into James/Harry at the airport over Christmas

Debating doing 5th year almost entirely from Katie's perspective because James/Harry has nothing to force him back to Britain that year.

From there it get nebulous as to just how James/Harry gets dragged in and how the HarryxKatie pairing I have planned will play out.

[/Spoilers End]

​

Most of all though I shoot for my writing to be enjoyable to read and the story to be engaging.

** Personally I strive for 3K chapters, however I've been trying to write more. I tend to post chapters as they're written but really wish I could get in the habit of writing most of the story or like several chapters ahead before posting so that I could post on a more consistent basis and be able to make the story better with foreshadowing and stuff.

I don't really write with music. Tend to have a million little notes on my phone or computer from pieces / scenes that come to me throughout the day. Then it's a matter of joining then together into chapter and stories. I usually have pages and pages of backstory and details that never make it into the stories. Right now I want to write a GWL story that fleshes out the extended Potter family (Eg Fleamont is her grandfather and Charlus is a Great Uncle) but have come to the realization that the story I've started has no clear plot and I think I'm about to tear it down and start fresh.

I like to try to write the ending or part of the ending ahead of time so that I have something to work towards.

** I approach writing fanfiction in the same way that I go about writing original fiction: ie, it's finished, edited, and betaed before posting, and I do my best to have a solid, coherent plot with plenty of layers and foreshadowing and reasonable pacing. The main difference is that my fanfiction doesn't go through as many drafts. Maybe three or so.

Having said all that, it isn't the best way to attract attention to a fic because fanfiction readers aren't generally looking for the same things as readers of original fiction. So great, unplanned, rambly slice-of-life things or colossal shoot-em-up action stories with popular pairings will usually do better. Most people don't seem to mind stories that go nowhere and never end or are abandoned. Maybe that is the point.

In short, when it comes to writing fanfiction, avoid doing it the way I do.

** Some goods things have already been shared here. I'll put in my two cents: I have a basic idea of where the story will end but have a very vivid scene of where the story begins. Only then will I start writing. With my current story, I've aimed for at least 4,000 words per chapter not because I care about word count, but more in that anything shorter feels as if readers can't get a good sense of the scene(s) and/or characters I've presented.

For planning, I write several bullet points on some scrap paper around my house and nothing more. Most of what's planned is in my head and I go from there. As for music or quiet, it depends really. If I do like to listen to music when writing, it's usually white noise-type music (e.g. a thunderstorm, rain on bamboo, rainforest, etc.). That's actually how my current story began: I turned on white noise to write and a picture came up with the video of a messy bed in front of two windows with rain and thunder. I took a long look at it and my first scene of a completely new story came to (and I abandoned my old one - I hadn't published it yet though).
