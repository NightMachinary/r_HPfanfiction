** Okay, you're gonna have to elaborate. I don't get what kind of OC you mean at all.

**** But if there aren't any limitations then literally anything could happen, right? I am sorry if I am being dumb but maybe you can give an example scenario. That would really help.

***** You're good, I'm just seeing what kind of original Character could change up any of the Harry Potter series adaptations from Fantastic Beasts series all the way to Cursed Child. Anything can happen

****** Yeah, like [[/u/XeshTrill][u/XeshTrill]] said, it's really pretty easy to fuck anything and everything up with OCs, that's like half the fun of the self-insert fics. So the question is too open ended.

It's like if someone put a blank canvas in front of everyone and asked them to draw, hardly anyone would draw anything because it feels too daunting. The way to cheat this is of course what we've been doing with prompts and challenges for quite some time.

Edit: BTW, I really do like the kind of vibe you were going for. I was pretty excited to answer until I realised there was just too many ways this could go.

** That depends: do you mean in universe (i.e. able to change the world but without considering the wider storyline of the HP books) or narratively (i.e. on a meta level it would ruin the story being told by the seven books and all its themes and arcs)? Considering how broad your categorization for an OC is too, thats really tough to answer on both parts because most OCs in such a case are usually SI as well, which invariably affect (and dare I say ruin) most fanfics.

In theory, the more meta/narrative level ruination would be in Deathly Hallows, since most of the story had already been laid out and has arguably the most reliance on chance and circumstance out of all the books (perhaps tied by Chamber of Secrets).

Within the story, that really depends on the OC you want. If, say, you had someone in the first book, for example an OC death eater, find Harry's location and simply kill him before he goes to Hogwarts, it would drastically affect the HP universe. In this case, the ripple affects are nearly unpredictable, which makes the premises behind so many time-travel fics of repeating canon so ridiculous in the first place.

I guess the obvious point here is that you might want to constrain the question a bit more if you want a more interesting discussion.

*** Made some edits. But the point is that it's your original character applied to any one of the movies, books, and plays. I want to see people's creative ideas and discuss it.
