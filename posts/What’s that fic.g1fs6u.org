Looking for that one fic where powerful wizards are described as “Mages” or something like that, and Dumbles teams up with an Australian mage to kill a Nudu. I distinctly remember Dumbles using an AK to kill it, and being rather distraught about it. Any ideas?


** linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) and it is truly excellent story (but long, with its sequels we are now somewhere around 150 chapters).
