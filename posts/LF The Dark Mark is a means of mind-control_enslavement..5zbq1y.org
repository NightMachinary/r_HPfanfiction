Think about it. From what we see of the Dark Mark, it's responsive to Voldemort's magic (darkening when he's returned to a body), and it can directly access a marked Death Eater's mind (feeding them apparation co-ordinates to the Little Hangleton graveyard, for example).

And, the fact that it's a mark on the skin, is evocative of the concept of branding slaves.

Has anyone used the concept that some of the Death Eaters were innocent, and Voldemort branded them with his Dark Mark in order to gain a vector of mind control over them? Considering how many influential members of high pureblood society were in his Inner Circle...

The only problem I can think of with the idea is that Snape, Narcissa and Lucius all turn against Voldemort at some point. Except that considering how the former loves Lily and the latter two love Draco, it could be another case of Power of Love beats Power of Dark Arts.


** My headcanon on the dark mark is that it has to be taken. The initiate must do something, generally akin to rape or murder to 'earn' the mark, and then they will receive it. I think that is highly unlikely that Voldemort used it as a tool for enslaving people, purely because he wanted followers who agreed with him, and if they did not, it would be incredibly easy for them to turn on him at a moments notice such as Karkoroff did.

*** What about both? The Dark Mark is a means of mind-control, but the rumor is spread that you have to commit supreme acts of evil willingly in order to receive it; family, friends, and law enforcement who believe that a Dark Marked individual committed murder or worse to get it, are more likely to sever ties or treat them as enemies, thus undermining any love the Dark Marked victim has for others in turn and reducing their ability to resist the mind manipulation.

**** That's a possibility, but I don't think it's ever been defined well enough to go off of. I'd love to hear Rowling thoughts on the Dark Mark, and what was required to obtain one

  COMPLETE. AU to HBP and DH. Snape and his apprentices form a bond which may never be broken, not even in death. And at the end of it, Severus Snape is able to perform a spell that he has never been able to do before. Ok, it's not a million words. I tried.

*** This looks awesome! Is it told in a similar style as canon (i.e. mostly from HP's point of view, or at least split equally)?
