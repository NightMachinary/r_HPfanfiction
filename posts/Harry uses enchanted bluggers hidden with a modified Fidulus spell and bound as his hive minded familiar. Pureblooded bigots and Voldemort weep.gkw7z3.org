So, pretty much the title. Harry in first year becomes interested in how the enchantments on both the bluggers and snitch work. He in some way finds a spell to artificially create a familiar bond, and tries it on a blugger, hoping to use it to keep him safe during the summer, but, unknowingly to him, bluggers are hive minded when near each other. So 1 becomes 2, then 4 and 8 and so forth.

As a writer, consider how a oc necromancer would use and modify his minions. Then put Harry in the driver's seat with bluggers instead.

Ideas?


** Closest thing I think of is this chapter of Renegade Cause with Dumbledore and bowling balls - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/43/Renegade-Cause]].
