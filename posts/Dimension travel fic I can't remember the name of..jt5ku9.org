:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There is a dimension travel fic I am been looking for a few hours and I can't find it or remember its name.

The fic was one where Harry land in a dimension where he died in Halloween 1981 and his parents survived. So far, so normal. However, after his death, James quickly stopped loving Lily, somehow blaming her for what happened. James started cheating behind her back while Lily got pregnant again, this time with a girl. Soon after their daughter was born, James and Lily divorced.

A few years later, James died and didn't leave anything to either his ex-wife or daughter. Lily became a teacher at Hogwarts and raised her daughter there because she just doesn't have the money to live anywhere else.

In that dimension, purebloods are more premanant, and so is pureblood supremacy.

When Harry arrive in that dimension, he come with a trunk filled with all his Gringotts money which he share with both remaining Potters. I think Harry arrive during his seventh year and Dumbledore choose him as prefect because he is willing to fight against the pureblood ideology.

Harry being a dimension traveller is a public fact and he become friends with that dimension' Hermione when they meet. I think it is also a H/Hr fic but I am not sure. Before Harry, Hermione doesn't really have any friends, if any.

That's all I can remember. I would be very grateful if that description meant anything to anyone, I want to read that fic! :) (i had discarded it when I first encountered it because it wasn't what I wanted to read at the time)

  Harry has won the war and lost everything he held near and dear. In desperation he gambles everything on a dimensional jump. HPHG Bad Weasleys good Dumbledore. Rated for language and implied sex
