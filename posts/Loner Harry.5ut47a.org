I am searching for a fic where Harry makes no friends and pretty much alone.


** In linkffn(11585823) Harry's indifferent to most anyone around him until late in the story.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** linkffn(for love of magic)

Self-Interested Ravenclaw Harry. Definitely a loner for the first few years.

linkffn(A Deal with the Devil by Silentlywatches)

One character Dresden Crossover. Lash is in Harry's head. They have awesome pre-Hogwarts adventures, but once he gets there he's definitely a loner. Pretty sad actually.

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

**** He goes to Hogwarts and get sorted Slytherin. No one in Slytherin likes him and everyone else immediately distrusts him. He decides he doesn't really want to play the game and ends up a loner, but a pretty sad one. I forget how year one went down exactly. Year two was shaping up to be different, but I think the author rushed the conclusion after deciding not to continue the story. It wraps up with Hogwarts closing down and all the students needing to decide where to go next.

I mean there are so many fics where he is super smart and more cunning than Salazar at age 11.

Not really. I haven't read Dresden but have read several Dresden/HP crossovers. It gives enough background on her that it shouldn't matter.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
