Any good fanfics where the Weasleys and the Dursleys meet? Looking for a good one.


** I like this one shot where Harry and Ginny go to Dudley's wedding and Aunt Marge is there...

  Ginny persuades Harry to attend Dudley's wedding. Unfortunately, both of them forgot that Aunt Marge would also be attending. Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best General (One-shot).

*** I've already read that one and I love it. It's actually one of my favorite HP fanfics. I love how everyone in it is pretty much in character, even Dudley inviting Harry and Ginny to his wedding is in character, considering he's somewhat redeemed at the end.

** It's not a big focus or anything, but the second Weasley Girl story (from the Weasley Girl AU, where Ron was born a girl) has a few scenes where Dursleys and Weasleys interact. The first chapter starts at the beginning of Harry's second year, but instead of Ron, Fred and George coming to bust him out from the Dursleys', it's Ronnie and Ginny... and it doesn't go as smoothly since the Dursleys wake up.

Dudley's really only in the first chapter and one of the epilogues, Vernon and Petunia get SLIGHTLY more focus. The second chapter has Petunia briefly visiting the Burrow... Fred and George aren't impressed by her... and both she and Vernon play a certain role in the plot, even if they don't get very much screen time.

Oh, and Marge shows up for a brief cameo towards the end, and immediately gets on the wrong side of the present Weasleys (Ronnie, Ginny and Molly),

  AU, Sequel to "Weasley Girl." In an alternate universe where Ron Weasley was born a girl, and where Harry's first Hogwarts year turned out a little different as a result, the famous "Potter's Gang" are back for their second year at Hogwarts and hoping perhaps for a calmer year... ...but with a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light, it looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.Second novel in the "Weasley Girl" Trilogy. Fem!Ron, everyone else is their canon gender.
