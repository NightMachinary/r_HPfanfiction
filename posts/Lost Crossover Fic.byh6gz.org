:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Details I can remember: -Harry was trapped/sleeping underneath Stonehenge for a very long time

-Crossover with Avatar, I think

-Harry couldn't do big works of magic without feeling incredibly drained

-there were cultish people who tried to kidnap Harry

-Scene where Harry makes an illusion and shows the cultists a vision of Hogwarts/a forest

-Stone from Pandora powered his magic for a while

-He had a widespread killing circle event where he absorbed their life force

Thanks in advance,

#+begin_quote
  Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom. Sealed away until next he was needed, the Wizarding Saviour slept through the fall of his race, of magic and almost the world. Now he has been woken, the last avatar of a dead species and a being whose purpose is so old that only the bones of the Earth remember. Gen. Adult themes.
