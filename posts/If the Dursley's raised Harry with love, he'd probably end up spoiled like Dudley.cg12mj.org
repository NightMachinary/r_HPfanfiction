Let's face it, Vernon and Petunia didn't know how to raise a kid properly in either direction. It'd honestly be very interesting to see a fully Dursleyfied Harry come to Hogwarts and force his whims on the Wizarding World.


** There's a difference between being raised lovingly and being raised a spoiled brat. Additionally, the argument of nature vs nurture comes into play.

^{There's a chance that Dudley was spoiled so much just to spite Harry. Maybe?}

Definitely. If nothing else, an equal treatment would force Dudley to behave appropriately with Harry and face the fact that people other than him have worth.

There are more than a few examples in the books where the Dursley specifically set up a disparity of treatment to either spite Harry or make Dudley feel better.

** Huh... I was considering (Yet Another) HP AU, though one where the abuse of the Dursley's actually 'affected' Harry, instead of his Plot Armor immunity to a lifetime of emotional (If not physical) abuse. But this... this would be 'more' interesting... I wonder if it's ever been done?

*** If you consider his mother's sacrifice, it makes sense in the abstract.

**** Meh. That protection was already abused to a larger extent than necessary. I wouldn't want to add more to it. ;P

** In a Hogwards context, his school mates would consider him like a Draco 2.0 or something.
