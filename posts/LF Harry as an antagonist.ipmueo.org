And I don't mean dark!Harry or Harry bashing. It can be a story from a dark side/death eaters/slytherins' perspective. Or it can be dark!Harry but from a light side/his former friends/Order's perspective. Not a crack. Doesn't really matter if Harry is really wrong/evil/misguided or the narrator is super biased. I legit want to feel angry at Harry on behalf of the character(s) about whom I'm reading.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

** I'm working on a canon-compliant epfic from a Slytherin perspective. The main character is a gifted healer, and 1 year above Harry, and actually never interacts with him directly, but she's close with Snape so /of course/ from that perspective Harry is an infuriating twat. Here's a sample that might stand ok on its own. This snippet is set at the end of the first day of school in HBP (Sep 2, 1996), a couple weeks after she had already met Aragog and gave Hagrid the dire prognosis.

I apologize in advance for Hagrid's accent. I hate writing it, but I always figured it would come out more when he's upset. None of my beta's have gotten this far in the fic yet. Happy to get some feedback on that.

--------------

Liz's last class on Mondays was Care of Magical Creatures. There were only three students at this level: Liz herself, Katie Bell, and Gwen Hedgeflower. The three of them were on a first-name basis due to this class, but not outside it. This was something of an unspoken rule they had developed amongst themselves. Not friends, exactly, but willing to unite for Hagrid's sake. There had been a mass exodus shortly after Hagrid started teaching, and Liz honestly couldn't blame anyone. She had chosen to continue because of the time outdoors, and with such a small group, it was a lot easier to handle Hagrid's less-than-safe inspirations and wild mood swings.

Today he took one look at Liz and immediately turned away to sniff.

Gwen was the one who approached and laid her hand on his arm. "Professor Hagrid?"

"Did something happen?" asked Katie.

Liz knew what was happening. There was a certain monster of a spider dying somewhere in the forest. But she wasn't going to be the one to say it.

He didn't seem to want to talk about it, either. "Could the three of yeh do a special project this year?"

Adrenaline rushing, Liz and the other girls all cast nervous glances at each other, but Gwen said, "What do you have in mind?"

"I want you girls ter meet my brother, and ter look after 'im if summat happens ter me."

Liz's eyebrows shot sky-high. The existential crisis made sense, considering Aragog, but, Hagrid having a brother was news to her.

Katie said firmly, "Don't talk like that, Hagrid, nothing's going to happen to you."

"What's his name?" Liz asked quietly.

"Grawp."

A giant's name. Oh gods. Liz didn't take her eyes off Hagrid's sad face, but she felt Katie grab her arm for support. Liz dared to ask another question, "And is Grawp, erm, about your height, then?"

"Oh, no, 'e's a little runt of a giant."

Liz cleared her throat, and she saw Gwen draw back with fear. "That's sweet, Hagrid, and how tall is that, exactly?"

"Well 'e's fifteen or sixteen feet, maybe."

"Right, okay. All right. Erm," Liz stalled for a second and then said, "Hagrid, why don't you prepare to introduce us all on Friday, when we're back for our Double Care session, and that will give the three of us a little time to research giants before we commit to providing that care."

"Aw, thanks, Liz, I knew I could count on you."

Well that wasn't quite what she wanted him to take from this offer, but at least he wasn't whisking them away to meet a giant right this second.

"Yeah," said Katie sarcastically, drawing her hand back from where she had clung to her. "/Thanks/, Liz."

But Hagrid was weeping now, and Gwen reached out to him again. "What's really going on?"

He gave a great sniff and shook his head.

Liz finally stepped into his space and took one of his great hands. She gasped. It wasn't the grief over Aragog that she had expected. It was something much more recent and much more raw. "Hagrid, did something happen /today?/ This mark on your soul smacks of betrayal. What happened?"

He snatched his hand back and looked at her with suspicion. "How could yeh know that?"

"You know I'm a Hand Healer, but this isn't about me, it's about who would dare to hurt you this way."

"Yes," said Katie. "And how we can get back at them for you."

Gwen was giving her a curious look. "So you're the True Healer."

"Of course she is," said Katie, as if this was old news. "You've seen the work she does in this class." She smiled at Liz. "And you're a Soul Healer, to boot, if the way you sing is any clue. And that's why you can sense that fresh betrayal." Liz sputtered, even as Katie gave her full attention to Hagrid and asked, "So who was it? If it happened today, they must be here at Hogwarts, and we can still get some justice served before supper."

Liz collected her composure as Hagrid's fell apart, and he sobbed. "It's, it's... Harry."

Oof. Liz knew, from some comment or a few in the past, that Hagrid had a major soft spot for Harry Potter. No doubt Katie and Gwen understood it, too. What had that little wanker done to Hagrid?

"I know 'e's got more importan' things ter do..."

"He dropped your class," Gwen deduced. "And let me guess, you didn't find out until he didn't show up today?"

Hagrid sobbed again and covered his face in his hands.

"That rat bastard," said Katie, offering the best sneer Liz had ever seen on a Gryffindor. "I'll see him in the common room sooner or later, and I'll hang him by his toenails."

"I would help," Liz said, "but I'm already on Professor Snape's shit list today, and if I get involved with Harry Potter's shenanigans then he'll hang /me/ by the toenails."

"No one is getting hung by the toenails," Gwen insisted. "Hagrid, I'm sorry to hear that your favorite student quit, but we will not interfere unless you ask it of us."

With a great sniff, Hagrid lifted his head and produced a handkerchief that Liz could have used as a blanket. The girls all covered their ears as his nose trumpeted.

Gwen continued, "There now, that's better. We will not abandon you. Right girls?"

"Right-o," said Katie.

"Of course," said Liz.

"In fact, we will take care of /you/ today." Gwen gave Katie and Liz a meaningful look. It wasn't the first time they escorted him back to his hut to make sure he rested and thought things through. Gwen would take point with Hagrid himself, settling him into his favorite chair and making tea. Katie got on famously with Fang, ensuring that his food and water dishes were fresh and giving the dog some affection. Liz lingered outside, checking all the usual places that Hagrid might have stowed a new pet.

And she wasn't disappointed when she found the hippogriff.

Luckily, she had paid attention when Hagrid had this beast in a lesson three years prior. She was fairly certain it was the exact same one, actually. Those eyes judged her just as harshly as they had the first time, but she bowed in the way Hagrid had taught them, and she was able to approach and assess his living conditions. There was just enough space where he was tied up, and she cast a spell on the knot to be sure he could pull free in a real emergency. A pair of rabbit skeletons lay next to his water dish, which should have been sufficient sustenance for the day. All in all, Liz was happy to see that Hagrid's troubles were not preventing him from his duties as Gamekeeper.

But she was still relieved when she stepped out of range of that tie-out.

When she went inside the hut, she didn't hesitate before asking Hagrid, "Who's the hippogriff?"

"Ah, that'd be Witherwings. Did all right checkin' on 'im?"

Liz smiled brightly. "You taught me well."

Hagrid sipped his tea and said, "Thanks, Liz. Thanks, all yeh girls. Sorry I'm such a mess."

"Don't you worry about it, Hagrid," said Gwen softly. "You just take it easy, and we'll see you at supper, and we'll be back for class Friday."

After the three of them left, and they were walking back up to the castle, Katie said, "Hermione Granger warned me that Harry Potter is also the reason Snape's been such a git today. They had it out in front of the whole sixth-year Defense class this morning, and then I had the bad luck of running into Snape after lunch, literally, and I lost ten points for Gryffindor for that accidental bump in the halls."

"Merlin," hissed Gwen, taking Liz by surprise. Gwen never had a sour thing to say about anyone, and her displeasure was much more alarming than Hagrid's emotional state, "That's why the House points are already out of whack. I was in the Great Hall during my free period after lunch, watching /all of them/ go down."

Liz kept her peace. She had said enough with her toenails comment.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
