I'm looking for Harry Potter Fanfiction where Harry creates his own faction that rivals Voldermorts and Dumbledores. Basically, if Harry formed Potters Army out of his followers, not Dumbledores Army, and created a third side to the war.

Thanks

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) is a pretty incredible fic that I'd call one of the fandom's true epics, with Harry building his faction up to eventually conquer the world. Not a fan of some aspects of it, but mostly it's written so well I really can't complain.

  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.
