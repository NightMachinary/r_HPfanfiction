Most of my stories are dark, like Lilith Halestorm, Never Cross A Potter, and Sadistic Bastard. I usually put some good moments in them, but they are mostly dark as they are my most popular fanfics. What type of fanfics do you guys write and put the title please, I love finding new stories.


** I prefer "general" fics which have a base level of "normalcy", interspersed with moments of darkness or light. For me it's the contrast that's interesting -- you can't properly appreciate darkness unless you have a level of non-dark normalcy to compare it to -- and fics that have a single emotional tone tend to be overly intense.

*** So your type of reading/writing of neutral fics with levels of either peace or chaos to lead your stories along. Interesting.
