Looking for something good and wholesome since I've been having a tough week.

I do prefer completed fics, but I'll take ones that aren't. I also don't have any preferences on when or where they take place.

Thank you for the reccomendations!

Also, if I used the wrong flair please let me know! I normally don't do posts like this.

  Sirius chose to raise Harry instead of taking off after Peter. He just really, really wishes that people would stop telling him how to raise Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Between school, the war and its aftermath, Hermione hasn't had much time to connect with her family. A family wedding seemed a good of time as any to introduce her family to her boyfriend and her best friend. But when her parents invite her out for tea in the days that followed, Hermione is woefully unprepared for their opinions on who she's better suited for.

** Linkffn(Realizations by Wishweaver) is a very wholesome story about Harry finding a family complete with parental figures and a little sister. It's been abandoned for about 10 years. Which is only a little frustrating because it was only a chapter or two from finishing, I think.

  10-year-old Harry and Draco are evacuated from London during the Blitz, and through a logistical error, end up sharing not only a home but a bed. Follow them as they grow up against the backdrop of the war, discovering who they really are and slowly falling in love. WWII Muggle AU. Mild smut, warnings for some thoughts of self harm/suicide.

  Every story begins with a stage. Every stage begins with a moment. For two young boys, their story began with a snake and a kiss. A kiss that would act as a ripple in the water, sinking deeper and deeper as the years go by and the boys go through moments and stages that strength and test their friendship *Features Veela Draco, mate-Harry*

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him.
