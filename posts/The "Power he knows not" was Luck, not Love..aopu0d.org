​

He won because he grabbed a wand from someone.

​

Of course, that's an oversimplification. We'd have to consider that the author didn't want to write a cerebral battle of wits. She wanted a layman who'd been forced into an impossible situation with no hope of coming out of the other side alive. Harry was an underdog who never wanted any of this. So, while I know it seems cheap, I'd say Harry deserved the victory he got even though he didn't earn it.

  (So it becomes everybody at Hogwarts win over Voldemort, rather than just Harry/an individual. That is difficult to write well, though
#+end_quote

I have an idea that could keep with the "Harry's greatest strength is his love for his friends" theme without having to write the somewhat cliche, cheesy "all the school kids band together and save the day" ending.

So Taure has talked before about how he sees it as very rare for wizards to reach Albus/Voldemort level, but there are numerous wizards at an "almost-Dumbledore" level. And in a fight, if you have three or four of these "almost-Dumbledores" up against one full Dumbledore, the almost-DDs would win.

Problem is, Voldemort, before the first wizarding war, went around Europe and killed any potential almost-DDs in one-on-one duels. Thus, Dumbledore is the only one left to oppose him, and in any fight they pretty much end up in a draw.

Now, my idea would be to have Harry, Ron, and Hermione develop, together, into a trio of "almost-Dumbledores" and then defeat Voldemort as a team. You still get the family, friendship, and love themes, but it'd feel more earned.

Three powerful wizards defeating one super powerful wizard is much better than Harry's weird wand trick. And you still get the "power of love" because Harry's love for his friends is what keeps them together and pushes them along the path to become a powerful trio.

Hell, you could even have one of the trio die in the final fight for an extra gut punch.

******* I like a lot of the horcrux ideas you're putting forward here. I think it gets a bit iffy when talking about taking a person's magical essence to enhance your power...it would be pretty hard to write that without, as you say, turning things into a cheesy magical core aspect. I'm not discounting it, but I think it'd be very difficult. Maybe, before he kills them, he steals their memories and has a repository for several different lifetimes worth of spells/spell uses/useful potions/ rituals -- all distilled for easy access. He's just getting several lifetimes worth of research without having to do the work (other than killing, lol).

I can really dig the idea that creating a horcrux puts the soul of the murder victim into a purgatory. That just enhances their evil. If that purgatory ends when the object is destroyed, it makes Harry (or whoever is destroying the horcruxes) even more heroic. Though that leaves some possibilities: is Lily's soul trapped within the scar horcrux...

Requiring horcruxes be bound to either a magically powerful or magically significant object is a very good idea, and helps put to rest a lot of the "why did Voldemort not act logically" complaints that people have upon reading the series as adults.

The stuff with the 12 virgins is just perfect examples of the cool stuff I wish I'd see more of in fanfiction. Instead of trying to quantify magic, or explain things scientifically, or reduce it to something easy like magical cores, I'd like to see more weird shit. Rituals require the blood of 12 virigns, or the tooth of a werewolf collected during a full moon, or ash from the pyre where Merlin was burned alive with Fiendfyre -- all these things are cool magic stuff. I'd like to see HP fics lean heavily into mysticism and magic rather than science and logic.

********* *Tree of life (Kabbalah)*

The tree of life is a diagram used in various mystical traditions. It usually consists of 10 nodes symbolizing different archetypes and 22 lines connecting the nodes. The nodes are often arranged into three columns to represent that they belong to a common category.The nodes are usually represented as spheres and the lines are usually represented as paths. The nodes usually represent encompassing aspects of existence, God, or the human psyche.

--------------

*Hermetic Qabalah*

Hermetic Qabalah (from Hebrew קַבָּלָה (qabalah), meaning 'reception, accounting') is a Western esoteric tradition involving mysticism and the occult. It is the underlying philosophy and framework for magical societies such as the Golden Dawn, Thelemic orders, mystical-religious societies such as the Builders of the Adytum and the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross, and is a precursor to the Neopagan, Wiccan and New Age movements.The Hermetic Qabalah is the basis for Qliphothic Qabala as studied by left hand path orders, such as the Typhonian Order.

Occult Hermetic Qabalah arose alongside and united with the Christian Cabalistic involvement in the European Renaissance, becoming variously Esoteric Christian, non-Christian, or anti-Christian across its different schools in the modern era. It draws on a great many influences, most notably: Jewish Kabbalah, Western astrology, Alchemy, Pagan religions, especially Egyptian and Greco-Roman (it is from the latter that the term "Hermetic" is derived), neoplatonism, gnosticism, the Enochian system of angelic magic of John Dee and Edward Kelley, hermeticism, tantra and the symbolism of the tarot.

*Icelandic magical staves*

Icelandic magical staves (sigils) are symbols called Galdrastafur in Icelandic, and are credited with magical effect preserved in various grimoires dating from the 17th century and later. According to the Museum of Icelandic Sorcery and Witchcraft, the effects credited to most of the staves were very relevant to the average Icelanders of the time, who were mostly subsistence farmers and had to deal with harsh climatic conditions.

--------------

*Galdrabók*

The Galdrabók (Icelandic Book of Magic) is an Icelandic grimoire dated to ca. 1600. It is a small manuscript containing a collection of 47 spells and sigils/staves. The grimoire was compiled by four different people, possibly starting in the late 16th century and going on until the mid-17th century.

--------------

*Runic magic*

There is some evidence that, in addition to being a writing system, runes historically served purposes of magic. This is the case from earliest epigraphic evidence of the Roman to Germanic Iron Age, with non-linguistic inscriptions and the alu word. An erilaz appears to have been a person versed in runes, including their magic applications.

In medieval sources, notably the Poetic Edda, the Sigrdrífumál mentions "victory runes" to be carved on a sword, "some on the grasp and some on the inlay, and name Tyr twice."

In early modern and modern times, related folklore and superstition is recorded in the form of the Icelandic magical staves.

**** I love this point, and I'd even say Harry earned it, and I'd like to take your point a bit further. Harry wins the wand because he grabs a wand from someone, but /why/ does he grab it? What does it say about Harry that he grabs those wands in this moment? What was he trying to achieve in grabbing these wands? How is this different from why Voldemort grabbed the Elder Wand? These differences is why I feel the way Harry wins the wand is so poetic; their actions exemplify their character and reveal their powers. It is not just about love, but how one feels about death.

Needless to say I'm a big fan of the Elder Wand subplot.

*** Picture this: Harry and Voldemort are circling each other in the Great Hall. Everything up until this point has gone according to canon- Harry sacrificed himself, the last horcrux is gone, and Voldemort is mortal. Harry speaks of remorse and sacrifice, his words throwing Voldemort off balance. The sun rises, both of them cast their curses.

All of Harry's friends and teachers watching the duel take that brief distraction to hit Voldemort with everything they can. Voldemort is a skilled wizard, but even he cannot stand up to a rain of spells from dozens of enemies from all sides, especially with Harry verbally throwing him off his game. Harry dodges Voldemort's killing curse, and Voldemort falls to dozens of spells at once.

The "power of which he knows not" was never obscure wandlore- all along, it was the love of Harry's friends. Voldemort has no friends, only subordinates- Dumbledore said so himself. Voldemort can't understand friendship, while Harry has friends willing to risk everything to help him, just as he was willing to sacrifice everything for them. /That's/ the power of love.

  becoming The Power of the Obscure Wandlore the Dark Lord Knows Not.
#+end_quote

I don't know, it didn't really. Harry had already won at that point, but this information was somewhat obscured in order to maximize drama. It /feels/ like his success depended on the fluke of the Elder Wand, but it certainly didn't have to depend on it, even up to the point Harry and Voldemort are circling in the Great Hall; it was just that at this point Harry realized it was the easier way to win, but it definitely wasn't the only way. If his wand hadn't conveniently broken, then he could and probably would have used his own wand against Voldemort (considering it recognized Voldemort as an enemy). Although I suppose in that case, you could still criticize the victory for being about wandlore instead of love.

This is a bit of a tangent, but I agree the Elder Wand functions very similar to a Deus Ex Machina, and yet I do not think it fits the name totally accurately. Deus Ex Machinas come out of the sky and introduce entirely new concepts to save the day, but the Elder Wand's powers were introduced and established throughout the story; the end merely explains how those bits of information applied to the plot. But we technically had the ability to glean it all from earlier in the book. A successful mystery novel gives us all the information, but intentionally obscures it so that we have to work to draw the right conclusions. This is how mystery novels are usually structured, and while I see HP compared to mystery novels quite a lot, I don't usually see this applied to the end of the series, but I think it fits perfectly. We know Draco disarmed Dumbledore, we know that it's possible Bellatrix's wand abandoned her even though Harry stole her wand from Draco's hands (meaning we know transfers can sometimes happen this way, but it's not necessarily a certainty). We know from Ollivander how the Elder Wand works and how murder is not necessary, so we could already glean that Draco is the master even before we realize that Snape was on the good side; these are the aspects of the wand we learn before we even get to the end of the story, and these are the aspects of the wand that are important to Harry's ownership of this wand. Less important, but still relevant, Dumbledore never intended the Elder Wand to play the role it ended up playing - there were other options available to Harry to win, they were just hella hard, so Harry went with the easiest option. But it wasn't the /only/ way to win, and it certainly wasn't how Dumbledore /thought/ he would win. Having said that, I consider my first point more important: the mystery-style structure of the book disqualifies it from being called a pure Deus ex Machina.

I know I'm fighting a losing battle though, but I do feel strongly that the book is outlined like standard mystery novels and that we had all the clues we needed, we just didn't realize how to apply them to the story because the writing intentionally obscured this for dramatic effect - again, just like how mystery novels work.

edit: this is a different point than my previous one, but I think the Elder Wand's role enhances what the rest of the books were about; Voldemort was so terrified of dying that he sought a magic that resulted not in his own success but instead in his enemy being able to kill him more easily. This goes back to my other post elsewhere in this thread about why I think it wasn't love that was the most important power, it was how each viewed death and mortality that mattered so much more. But how we interpret this is extremely subjective and depends on how each reader interprets so many other parts of the story, so I don't think you're wrong, I just wanted to share my thoughts on it and maybe you would enjoy reading it.

#+end_quote

I'm not quite sure I understand you, but I'm interested in understanding you, and I also realize it's very very difficult to articulate these types of thoughts. Sometimes something just works or doesn't work and we don't necessarily know why. I can't really explain why I like it either, but I think it's because it feels like a mini version of the entire story to me. I should first say that the Deathly Hallows are my favorite part of the plot, including the Elder Wand, and yet I have no hesitation saying they could have been removed with only the tiniest restructuring and nobody would have felt the story was missing something necessary. I tried to figure out why I liked them and what they added to the story and I found an answer that suits me and has made other parts of the story clear in ways they had not always been. It gave me a new appreciation for this line

#+begin_quote
  “There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!” snarled Voldemort.

  “You are quite wrong. Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness ---”
#+end_quote

This is not the only time this is speculated by characters in this book, when the kids are trying to figure out what Voldemort's "weapon" is,

#+begin_quote
  “But there can't be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?” said Ron. “What's worse than death?”
#+end_quote

I think Ron, despite his statement, does understand what's worse than death, he's just not aware that he knows this. But I think it's important that Ron's question mirrors Dumbledore's statement to Voldemort, almost down to the word. "What's worse than death?" and (paraphrasing) "failure to understand this is the greatest weakness".

Voldemort destroyed his soul because he tried to escape death, he killed Lily because he could not understand that she saw Harry's death as worse than her own, he used Harry's blood because he still believed Harry might destroy him someday, he went after the Elder Wand for the same reason. His main motivation is escaping death, and this is his greatest weakness. Obviously love is still important, exemplified in Dumbledore's line,

#+begin_quote
  "But then, if he had been able to understand [love], he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all."
#+end_quote

I would never say love isn't important, but I understand from this that love is important in this particular existential context because of how it prevents us from destroying our souls. While love and our feelings on death are clearly linked, it is still the feelings on death that are more relevant to Voldemort's destruction.

Each time Voldemort acted on his fear of death, he inadvertently gave Harry a tool that made it easier to dismantle Voldemort's power. That is to say, even ignoring the Great Hall confrontation, Voldemort was already killing himself each time he tried to do the opposite, and each time he kept accidentally giving this boy more power. The Elder Wand, as far as I can tell, did not introduce new aspects magic, but gave a final example of magic favoring those who do not destroy their souls, something consistent with all the other magic between Harry and Voldemort. The Elder Wand allows us to to realize "it is the love that matters" does not fully cover what is important between the two characters and allows us to consider "it is the understanding that there are worse things than death" that was more important all along.

#+begin_quote
  “ ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death'. . .” A horrible thought came to him, and with it a kind of panic. “Isn't that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there?”
#+end_quote

And Hermione, in all her convenient wisdom, tells us,

#+begin_quote
  “It doesn't mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,” said Hermione, her voice gentle. “It means . . . you know . . . living beyond death. Living after death.”
#+end_quote

I guess what I mean is the Elder Wand's presence in the story was useful because it allows us to narrow down what it really was about Voldemort that led to his destruction.

Looking over this explanation, this is only the tip of the iceberg of why I care so much about the Elder Wand, and I wouldn't blame you if what I've said so far doesn't mean anything to you. I won't get into it, but I think the Elder Wand and the Hallows add so much to understanding Dumbledore and while I realize he is a secondary character, I still feel strongly that understanding him is incredibly important to the story and that the Deathly Hallows make the most sense when comparing them to how Voldemort, Dumbledore, and Harry all reacted towards them. I'm not a big fan of the "Dumbledore is Death" theory because I think it overlooks Dumbledore issues with accepting the mortality of others, and if one overlooks this aspect of Dumbledore's character, then they overlook what his relationship with Harry was throughout the series, which just guts me. This is at the core of why I think many fans demonize Dumbledore, because they do not incorporate his ability to master the Elder Wand and his instantaneously inability to master the Resurrection Stone into their understanding of him.

  Referring to the interesting romanticist archetype Rowling alluded to in DH when it comes to Grindelwald, not the way he's portrayed in Fantastic Beasts ... as like a boring proto-voldemort/hitler copy
#+end_quote

Starting with this because I too only care about their characters from the original series and don't care about how they're portrayed in Fantastic Beasts. No blood oaths in my interpretation (at least not until the final FB movie is done and we have the full context of how the oath fits into the story, and even then, it's really unlikely I'll care)

#+begin_quote
  apologies for the late response =).
#+end_quote

Not at all! Thank you so much for responding, this has been a really great conversation!

#+begin_quote
  I just think that could have been handled much better than the perfunctory way JKR ended up with; where you're also only able to really glean the interesting themes behind the Elder Wand if you do an almost esoteric reading of the text.
#+end_quote

You're phrasing makes me think there's another reason besides the esoteric reading that bothers you more (which I think you get into later).

But concerning the esoteric reading as the only way to glean this information.... We'd have to analyze this more to know for sure, but I find it hard to believe that the Deathly Hallows are somehow hard to understand thematically, considering there is a fairytale that lays out what each Hallow stands for, how they function, what is said about the people who use them, and even how Death feels about all this. And then these items show up in Harry's world and act just as they do in the story. And on top of that, Dumbledore spends a half chapter's worth of exposition telling us what to think about them. I would sooner criticize the Deathly Hallows for being too obvious than not obvious enough. I think most fans understand the Deathly Hallows theme, even if some have thought about it more than others (like us), I wouldn't call this part of the books difficult. But I also think I might have misunderstood you, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, but the Elder Wand's allegiance is not determined by your understanding/comfortability/acceptance of your own mortality and humanity
#+end_quote

I would say it is determined exactly by those things. The Hallows exploit human weaknesses that help lead to the human death, because that's what Death wants, but sometimes a person's weaknesses are exploited without anyone necessarily dying (like with Gregorovitch and Grindelwald). But the Elder Wand still has a fantastic number of deaths to its name. And if the Resurrection Stone had been given a more opportunities to tempt people, I think it would have led to many more deaths than just Dumbledore's.

#+begin_quote
  but it's determined by a loophole - namely that it was Draco that disarmed Dumbledore and not Severus
#+end_quote

I'm not really sure how this is a problem, or why you see it as a problem. I don't see it as a loophole, so maybe that's why I don't understand. Out of curiosity, what do you make of Harry's decision to talk to Griphook before Ollivander at Shell Cottage? I find it somewhat related, but I don't want to explain why because I don't want to push your answer towards anything.

#+begin_quote
  To rephrase it, what really matters isn't that Voldemort tries to reject his own mortality and lives in hubris, but instead this obscure bit about wand ownership.
#+end_quote

But it was his rejection of mortality that lead to the wand ownership making a difference. I'm not really sure what you're saying. This isn't exactly how I interpret the books, but the easiest way to describe my thoughts is to act like Magic and Death are both dieties and in cahoots with each other. Magic and Death both attacked Voldemort's life from many angles, not just with Horcruxes - they got him with a Hallow too. They tricked him and used his human folly to make him their prey, and it worked. Through this understanding, we could say they created Harry to be his bane; Voldemort was trying to destroy his own soul and Death said, "nooooo way is he coming into MY afterlife like /that/" and Magic said, "don't worry so much, Death, Magic sorts this stuff out, you'll see". The wand chooses the wizard so we know wands have their own version of thinking and feeling. It stop becoming a mathematical equation when wands have thoughts of their own and can make their own choices about wizards. I think Ollivander's line "the wand chooses the wizard" is extremely important to remember here, but I also think that JKR could have hinted at the different personalities of wands more clearly in the books.

#+begin_quote
  It would've been much more meaningful if the Elder Wand's ownership was dictated on whether you understood/accepted/comprehended your own mortality, your own humanity, that is worse things than death, etc, not whether M disarmed D first instead of S.
#+end_quote

I /do/ think the Elder Wand's ownership is dictated on those things, but I think I finally understand that it's not really that that bothers you, it's that Harry just happened to grab the wands from the person who just happened to have disarmed Dumbledore, that this event was so unlikely and yet ended up being the only way Harry won. But I think I'm less offended by this happenstance because I don't believe that the Elder Wand was Harry's only way of winning, so it doesn't exist as a pivotal plot point for me as it maybe does for you. Even as late as the Great Hall battle, I believe Harry /could/ have gone a different route; his sacrifice already protected the occupents of the castle, and this ended up being hardly relevant at all; Harry /could/ have just jumped up in the forest and done his little Elder Wand speech there and nobody in the castle even needed to reented battle (now I'm thinking about it, why does he wait to do it in front of a crowd? Oh probably because in the Forest he's be surrounded by bloodthirsty Death Eaters, and in the castle he has a better chance to escape their wrath, and also because Narcissa let him live only to get to the castle, so.... okay, it makes sense), and they maybe could have stormed Voldemort with spells until he succumbed. But Harry didn't need to contemplate these other options because he realized he'd wound up with this wand and adapted his plan in his favor. I do not see it as pivotal to Voldemort's defeat. I just pictured Neville's final "HA!" to the boggart in Lupin's classroom. I feel like the Elder Wand is as useful to the plot as Neville's final "HA!" was to defeating the boggart. The boggart was already being defeated by everyone's collective laughter anyway, Neville didn't /have/ to laugh, and yet his laugh reinforces the boggart's weakness.

--------------

I couldn't fit this in anywhere, but I have a theory that nobody can ever steal the wand from Harry again. Or at least it's unlikely. Harry is the master of the Elder Wand because he stole the Blackthorne wand from Draco's hands. This means that the Elder Wand cares about the other wands that witches and wizards own; that it evaluates the power of someone based on that person's relationship with their other wands. Harry owns the freaking phoenix-feather wand that is so incredibly loyal to Harry it will literally throw flames at Voldemort even when Harry isn't capable of doing that himself. I suspect that the Elder Wand has mad respect for Harry because of his relationship with the phoenix-feather wand in the same way that the Elder Wand does not have respect for Draco because of his inability to keep his own wand. I also suspect that the phoenix-feather wand would feel completely betrayed if Harry ever abandoned it. Therefore, because Harry /doesn't/ choose to use the Elder Wand instead of his own, he is more powerful because of it. If he ever did decide to abandon his own wand, then the Elder Wand would take note of the loss of power, and be significantly more likely to abandon Harry too. It's possible this is wrong, but then I can't think of a better explanation for why the Elder Wand cared that Draco lost the Blackthorne wand.

*** Nooo.... it was totally love (partial sarcasm). Harry loved everyone, so was willing to sacrifice himself, thus allowing the whole "choose to die or not" scene. That was the real victory; the part about him winning the duel because of wands was really because /Snape/ loved; his love for Lily meant that he didn't "defeat" Dumbledore (because his love for Lily drove him to Dumbledore's side), thus allowing the whole who disarmed Draco Malfoy thing. The obscure wandlore takes second place to the fact that Voldemort didn't know/underestimated Snape's ability to love at a critical point a long time ago. So Voldemort underestimated Snape's love and Harry's love /and/ Lily's love! But yeah, it would have been cooler if the love was a stronger/realer, less hamfisted element there.

  The "power of which he knows not" was never obscure wandlore- all along, it was the love of Harry's friends. Voldemort has no friends, only subordinates- Dumbledore said so himself. Voldemort can't understand friendship, while Harry has friends willing to risk everything to help him, just as he was willing to sacrifice everything for them. That's the power of love.

** I /sort of/ disagree with this. Obviously Harry has an absurd amount of luck, and he is even aware of that (telling people at the first DA meeting that he's just lucky), but The Power the Dark Lord Knows Not is still Love, IMO.

Two reasons for this. The first is really simple, Voldemort most likely understands luck. He's aware of what love is, but doesn't really understand it, which is why the line says "the power he knows /not/."

Second reason: Voldemort's biggest defeats come about because of Love, not luck. But wait, you might think, Voldemort died because of luck/deus ex machina crap. The Elder Wand allegiance thing was pure luck on Harry's part, and that's what allowed him to win! Well, yes and no.

The Elder Wand stuff is what caused Voldemort to die, but I'd argue it's not what caused his /defeat/. Voldemort lost the war before it truly began, when he used Harry's blood in the ritual. Because of this, Harry could not die at Voldemort's hand, even post-ritual. Lily's love-protection stayed alive through Voldemort's blood, making Harry immune-ish to Voldemort himself. This was kicked up to 11 in the Forbidden Forest when Harry walks to his death. He does the exact same thing that Lily does, and ends up protecting all of his allies because of it. This is something that, as Voldy put it, he should have forseen. It happened to him once, and it happened again because he doesn't really understand love.

Let's assume that Harry dies post-Forbidden Forest through a non-Voldy mean. Let's assume that Harry is hit by a stray lightning bolt while he's in the courtyard, despite the lack of rain. Now Harry is dead, but his protection lives on. Harry has protected all his allies the same way Lily protected him, so Voldy and the Death Eaters cannot harm the good guys. Even though Voldy is way more powerful than anyone there, it's just a matter of time until he is defeated if he isn't able to permanently harm anyone he's fighting.

I agree, well said!! I think it's because we aren't told yet that Harry can win until he wins with the Elder Wand, so we associate that as /why/ he wins, but it's not actually why at all. Harry has already won by the time he faces Voldemort in the Great Hall. And another angle to consider is Dumbledore planned for Harry's sacrifice but not for the Elder Wand. I think Dumbledore expected Harry to use the phoenix-feather wand because of it's relationship with Voldemort from the Priori Incantatem stuff and there's just no reasonable way Dumbledore could have accounted for it breaking. But even without this useful wand in play, there was still a way to kill Voldemort post-Forest without the Elder Wand or the phoenix-feather wand; Voldemort power was formidable, but still greatly weakened. But why do anything else when the "flaw in the plan" so fortuitously worked in Harry's favor? Therefore, Harry kills Voldemort with the Elder Wand, but he certainly didn't /have/ to.
