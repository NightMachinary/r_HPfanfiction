Hi, I don't know if sharing a fic like this is the most appropriate way, but I'll be glad to share it someplace proper if it's wrong :) I'm also sorry to members of the [[/r/HPRomione]] sub who get to see this post twice.

The fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13266636/1/The-Art-of-Disapparating-Without-a-Wand]]

It's an AU where Ron manages to convince Bellatrix to torture him first instead of Hermione at Malfoy Manor. I still only have the first chapter up, which only covers that event with the roles reversed (and all the changes that come with it) but things will branch out further in the future.

It's my first fic and English isn't my first language, so I'd love reviews either here or on the fic itself. Thanks!
