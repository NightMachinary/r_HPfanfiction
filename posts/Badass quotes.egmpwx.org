Just reread easier than falling asleep by JacobApples and damn chapter 14 kills it. It's a fight between dumbledore and Harry and wands get involved and it's one of my favorite fights from a fanfic. Harry winds up with the elder wand and destroys it and hits dumbledore with this quote. “Why?" Dumbledore asked Harry.

It should have been Harry's question.

'Why?' What a potent little word.

Harry gave the answer he had been given, "For the Greater Good."” And damn if that isn't the coolest thing I've read in awhile


** Am I the only one that can't get past chapter 1 of this fic? I see it recommended so many times, but the first chapter feels so rushed and terribly written. Is that just me?

*** Doesn't matter to me how good it really is, if the first chapter is about 30% copy-paste, I won't read it.

**** Doesn't help that I enjoyed reading the copy-paste more than the rest of the first chapter

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel.

** I just started rereading (and recommended it somewhere else) and damn some of the lines in there are so good. I love some of Luna's poetic descriptions about Harry in her diary entries. There are some truly great and beautiful lines in there.
