To the amazement of the entirety of the Wizangamot, Sirius Black was Acquitted of all charged. With begrudging acceptance The illustrious legislative body Had little choice but to acquit, But Walburga Was not so forgiving , With her eldest son free from Azkaban, she crafted another Less Gruesome but still irritating prison for him. As her last act as his mother, Walburga Surrendered her position as head of house To the last available heir in the line. Walburga With her final act Chained Her eldest son back to the ancient and noble house of Black. Condemning him to continue on the line.

With that last act, She condemned her son For the last time. Walburga went back To Grimmold Place and died, secure in the Knowledge the family magic would Compel Sirius to continued the family line .

Walburga Drew her last breath with a Vengeful smile on her lips. As She saw With her last moments a new silver line appear on the family Tapestry.

***** Am I the only one that thinks the way the female characters treat sex as transactional in nature is kinda gross?

It's been a bit, but I definitely remember being very irritated about that.
