Does anyone else think it's odd that the Daily Prophet reports on the lives of students inside a school? Like, we don't see the New York Times reporting on what happens in the daily lives of NYU students. The prophet seems less like an actual newspaper and more like a school newspaper.

So, does anyone else think she should've just replaced the Prophet with a school newspaper? Make Rita Skeeter some annoying Slytherin girl instead of a grown woman. There wouldn't be too much change. You could say that Fudge wouldn't be able to print propaganda but they could easily use the Daily Prophet for that. Just keep the Hogwarts talk to a school paper


** First of all, the population of magical Britain is apparently pretty small, so the Daily Prophet is more like your town's local paper than a national paper. And it's not uncommon for local papers to report on things that happen in the local schools, though they almost always stick to covering events and the accomplishments of students, not teenage drama.

/However/, you are forgetting the actual circumstances of Rita's reporting. Harry was already a major celebrity and he was participating in a major international competition. Of course the press is going to be all over that, even before you add in the fact that he was entered under suspicious circumstances and the fact that another competitor is also an international celebrity.

This isn't the New York Times reporting on the daily lives of NYU students. This is your local paper reporting on a world-renowned child actor, who happens to live in your hometown, competing in the Olympics against the most famous athlete in the world. Oh, and there appears to be a love triangle tossed in for good measure.

Now I will say that reporting on the supposed love triangle probably is going a step too far, but it's not entirely unexpected, and Hermione really should have known what she was getting into by very publicly going on a date with a celebrity. And other than that, I don't think that Rita did report much on the daily lives of students. I could be forgetting some articles though.

--------------

Now to look at it from a completely different direction, making Rita a student reporting for the school newspaper also doesn't work as well from a narrative perspective.

The first three books are just school stories that are almost entirely insulated from the wider world. In GoF, the narrative pushes Harry to deal with the world outside of Hogwarts, and Rita is a major part of that, culminating in Harry being both symbolically and literally ripped out of Hogwarts to face Voldemort. And then in OotP, Umbridge brings the outside world into Hogwarts and Harry is forced to deal with it. In HBP, Hogwarts is mostly insulated again, but the external pressures are a lot more overt, and again symbolically and literally invade Hogwarts in the climax. And in DH, almost the entire story takes place out in the world.

Someone could probably write an entire thesis around this idea, but I think I've said enough to make my point. And without Rita in the middle, the progression falls apart.

Also, if she's just a teenager, then her actions are a lot more excusable. And adult spying on kids is a lot worse than a teenager spying on other teenagers, so her comeuppance at the end feels deserved.

** It's a tabloid. The magical equivalent of the Daily Mail and NY Post. And it wasn't just random students. It was Viktor Krum, an international Quidditch star, and Harry Potter.

** It actually reports on Harry who is a celebrity... first due to a major event (The Triwizard Tournament) and then because he is disturbed. The article about Hermione is published in Witch Weekly and it's also more related to the kind of articles that are published on some celebrities' gf/bf.

** I just want to comment about the school paper, because I can totally see the marauders doing this...

...The marauders map...

"The marauders map? whats that?" Lily asked the four pranksters who were gatherd around a parchment.

"Map? What Map?" Peter asks looking nevously from Lily to the other Marauders.

"thats what I'm asking you" Lily looked between the four "Well?"

"Its a- umm" "A NEWSPAPER Idea we had" Sirius said quickly "yes a newspaper" nodding.\\
Remus leans into wisper in his ear "a /newspaper, REALLY?" "/It was the first thing I thought of"

Lily raises an eyebrow "a newspaper?"

James nodding "yes a newspaper, we thought we could, you know, keep people updated in the school, and stuff"

"and you want to call it the Marauders Map?" Lily asked

They all nodded, "Its an Aliteration, moony came up with the name" Sirius said.

"Yes" remus said "yes I did. I thought it was... Fun"

"WELL, we don't have timne for this, have work to do, on the... Marauders...Map, yup the Map. BYE" JAmes said pushing the rest of the group away from the redhead. "A Newspaper!? Padfoot? Really?"

"HEY, it wasn't that bad" Sirius defended.

Peters quiet voice broke through the small wispershout match "Shes going to expect a newspaper at some point quys, by now I bet have the school now about this Map/Newspaper Idea..."

Remus looked at peter "well shit... Sirius you'd better start working"

"WHAT, Why Me?"

"It was your /brilliant idea/"

Thats all I got, I'm not a great writer but I thought it could be fun.

**** I agree... I feel like it could have been anyone to find them Lily was just the first person to pop into my brain.... I can imagine pretty much the same senario happening with perfessor McGonnagal or Flittwik (who I imagine would be really excited about the concept of a newspaper) /shrugs/... but like I said I agree, I don't like how in so many fanfictions Harry cowers and hides when Ginny (who is his wife or girlfriend) is mad.... Like you, Harry, Defeated a /DARK LORD.../ are you really scared of ginny weasley? Nothing against Ginny, Love her, but really?

Edit: I forgot the point of me writing that - I feel them just needing to make a lie so people don't find out about the map.

******* Do you want short answer or long answer? The first (completed) part of the series follows Draco after the Death Eater Trials then Scorpius through a substantially altered version of Cursed Child. The second (active) part is about the rise of anti-muggle and anti-magic groups in the U.S. with a big focus on the idea of dark wizards viewing muggles as a resource rather than just indiscriminately hunting them for sport like the Death Eaters did.

**** Every January, there's a march on Washington DC, where pro-life Americans peacefully protest. It's called the March for Life.

It's a very large protest, but given that it's peaceful, it's not usually covered in the media.

In 2019, a group of white students from Covington Catholic High School, who had attended the March, were being harassed by a group of Black Hebrew Israelites (an extremely fringe group) while they waited for their bus. A man from another group for Native Americans approached the boys, while beating his drum.

Videos shot at such angles that did not show the Black Hebrew Israelites led to the impression that the white students were harassing the Native American man.

The mainstream media took the videos and ran with them and ran /dozens/ of stories smearing the reputations of the students. Nationwide. For days.

Even after full videos from security cameras were leaked, showing what really happened, very few admitted they were at fault.
