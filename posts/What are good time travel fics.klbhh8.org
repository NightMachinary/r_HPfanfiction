I want to get into time travel stories so what are some good ones? Preferably ones that either have little or no shipping or where the shipping isn't the main focus.


** I will always rec linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die)

linkffn(Far Too Many Time Travelers) is funny. Everyone in Harry's year is travelling back from a different alternate future

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

** I once found a good time travel story, unfortunately I can't find it again maybe someone knows it.\\
Harry is sent back in time, he travels several hundred years into the past.\\
I think it was between 300-500 years, but it could also have been longer.\\
He decides to attend the French school and then to live in France.\\
The school days are only briefly outlined, he then makes a master in runic magic.\\
The local ruler (France) wants to get him involved (and everyone else he gets) in his war.\\
Harry sends the emissaries away not very peacefully but effectively.\\
He is still looking for a way back in his time, but cannot find any and puts himself in stasis up to the present.\\
I don't want to spoil to much what happens there, he separates Snape from one hand and later takes Dumbel prisoner in rune prison.

**** No sorry unfortunately it is not, I know the fic it is a ok star wars / HP cross.\\
Except if it wasn't the fic you wanted to post?\\
You mention the runic prison, if I remember correctly that doesn't exist in the fic you posted.\\
The one I meant is not a cross and just a few hundred years in the past (at the beginning in France).

***** You sure? I did a reread after I linked it, chapter 24 seemed really similar to what you described.

#+begin_quote
  Oh now none of that" said Harry with false sympathy dripping from his voice like acid " I am not heartless. I would never send you in there completely alone".

  Harry then, and with a great deal of power, once again dipped into the Force and caused Snape's living husk to slam both into Dumbledore and force both men into the cell itself. "There. Now you can look into your favourite pets blank eyes until he dies and, after that, when his body begins to fail and starts to bloat and stink... when that smell reaches your nose, when you want to retch, remember that you are here because of me. Remember the cost of trying to manipulate me and hurt my friends. When he is finally dead I hope you look into the dark sockets of his skull and know that everything you wanted and dreamed is not just gone but completely obliterated".

  He paused and, though it was petty, he couldn't help but twist the knife as he added "Oh...do try not to eat him. He was your friend after all".

  With those words and a final scream of inarticulate rage from Dumbledore Harry activated the runic clusters on the prison. The runes caused a wall to instantly almost organically grow enclosing the old man and it instantly disappeared from local time and space.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

I feel like this one is really fun, It's a BAMF!-CureBreaker-Harry ending up in a female body... and not really caring, taking some aging-potion and ending up as a History Professor at Hogwarts.
