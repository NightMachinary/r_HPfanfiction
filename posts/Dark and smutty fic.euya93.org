It was definitely NSFW and the premis was that harry snaps after all his emotional abuse and people not believing him. He absorbed voldemort's horcrux or something and got the power to influence people's minds. He then makes daphene greengrass love him and makes her his slave.

*** While it is similar, Dark Discoveries are not that much dark and while Harry is manipulative there, he had not snapped that much (yet, as it's ongoing).

** I've actually been working on a story with a similar-ish premise you might be interested in. PM me if you want the google docs link; it's got 10.5 chapters at the moment, but it's not fully edited yet (though I'm working on that).

It's got:

- Incubus Harry (with stupidly strong but nonstandard mind powers)
- Dark but not edgy/angsty Harry
- Mind Control themes (although not quite the same as what you posted)
- No bashing
- Mild AU

  - Voldemort had Satyromania on top of his other issues.
  - A lot of people are bisexual, the world is generally more sex-friendly.
  - The events of the first three books/movies happened slightly differently.
  - Pansexual Harry, Bisexual Ron, and Polyamourus Hermione in a three-way friends-with-benefits relationship.

At the point it is in the story, there hasn't been much yet at the school itself, but I eventually plan to have him have his way with a good portion of the student body (and being set during GoF, that includes Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students too).
