James catches Harry in a broom closet with the school slut: "Hey, break it up!"

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

** Just curious if you were ever able to find other fics to read? I unfortunately made it through the 300k words only to find it got abandoned (at least the author posted outlines!) and so as always, I have a Haphne itch that MUST be scratched.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
