** BULLET LIST TIME!

â€‹

"This year, I wish everybody gets what they deserve."

- Harry's abuse is discovered by both magical and muggle law enforcement. Neither side is happy. Dumbledore's letter is discovered.
- Dumbledore gets dragged through the mud for literally dumping the boy who lived with magic hating muggles who abused him. (actions speak louder than +words+ intent)
- Percy notices a newspaper article when it brings up "all they could find with a finger". "Bloody Hell!, Scabbers is missing a finger!"
- Sirius gets freed and receives treatment. Grandpa Black isn't very happy about his grandson being illegally locked up for all those years, starts to shake shit up in the ministry and Wizengamot. Eventually gets mad at Walburga Black enough to pimpsmack her off the family tree. She dies of shock. Welcomes Andromeda back into the family.
- Snape gets thrown under the bus here.
- All of the "imperiused" Death Eaters get re-trialed and promptly thrown through the veil.
- Fudge's bribery, extortion, etc is discovered. His whole administration is investigated. Fudge goes to Azkaban, Umbridge gets thrown in the veil for murdering muggleborns. Mafilda Hopkirk gets thrown in Azkaban for prejudicial punishment against non-purebloods.
- Horcruxes are found.
- Spanish Inquisition shows up, yells at Dumbledore for not telling them anything. Dumbledore tries to tell them he didn't know anything about Horcruxes. Spanish Inquisition doesn't give a shit.
- Horcrux hunt finishes in less than 48 hours. They discover Harry.
- Yelling at Dumbledore 2.0 Electric Boogaloo. This time because of the dark magic "residude" in the scar. And rightfully so.
- One Inquisition member holds Harry in front of the Veil of Death while another stands on the opposite side of the Veil. The one not holding Harry lifts his Crucifix-shaped wand: "Accio Soul Fragment". Harry's scar bursts open, and a black goop shoots out like a geyser into the Veil. Harry gets treated by a waiting healers. No more scar.
- Inquisition heads off to Albania. Finds Voldemort in record time (three hours. walking in a forest sucks). Seals the wraith into Dumbledore's golden throne as an added message to Dumbledore to not take things into his own hands. Throws that through the veil.
- Sirius and Grandpa Black (forgot his name) show up and pick up Harry and head home.
- Harry picks up a new moniker: The-Boy-Who-Everyone-Screwed-Over.
- Dumbledore's hands off approach for students at Hogwarts is discovered. Board of Governors isn't amused. Promptly throw him out of position for actually hurting Magical Britain by allowing Snape to run Potions scores into the ground and letting the Junior Death Eaters get away with everything.
- Harry finally gets what he deserves: a loving family.

** Harry had been so happy today. The Drusleys were going on a vacation and had left him with Mrs Figg. He had been looking forward to them leaving. Mrs Figg always let him sleep on the sofa in her drawing room. She gave him a lot to eat and made him only do the garden and laundry. The day had been going great. The Drusleys had gone to the airport after dropping him off with Mrs Figg. She had called him to have lunch and he had gotten to as much as he liked. After lunch he had started to fold paper planes and playing with her cats. Then it all came crashing down.

Mrs Figg had just received a call that the Drusleys were too late to board the plane and were coming back. They were going to be so angry. He was going to blamed for it like always and would be locked in the cupboard for who knows how long. They would not give him anything to eat and make him do the same chore again and again till they think they have punished him enough. He looked at the last piece of paper in his hand and started folding it into crane like he had been taught in school. He wished hard that the Drusleys did not come back. That he got to live Mrs Figg and be free to eat as much as he wanted to.

He waited for the Drusleys to come. But they did not come back. He began to hope that they would not come back. The afternoon turned to evening and then to night but there was no sign of Drusleys. Finally Mrs Figg told him that it was time for him to go to sleep. That night as he laid on the sofa he briefly wonder why the Drusleys did not come but quickly put thoughts of Drusleys out of his mind. It looked like he was going to have a very good summer and he was too happy to worry.
