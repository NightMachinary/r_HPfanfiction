As title says im looking for fics where a male harry takes care of his female counterpart (usually includes dimension travel) No slash for harry. Prefer longer length fics, but short fluffs are fine too :)

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

***** Yeah. I read the beginning, noticed the fic was incomplete/dead, skimmed and came here to see whether or not anything good would come of it - apparently not - and then dropped the fic.

The initial premise is too infuriating for me to keep reading without some sort of comeuppance.

  In 2008, after a decade long war against Tom Riddle and his armies of inferi, the dark lord is finally destroyed. A pair of veterans from a conflict the likes of which the world had not seen since the darkest days of WWII, receive a second chance. They find themselves in a world similar yet different, where Riddle is still seeking new body and a tournament begins in Hogwarts...
