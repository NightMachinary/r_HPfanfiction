I like to read H/Hr, and a lot of what's been written since Deathly Hallows is, for me, overly bitter about the ship not ending up canon; you end up getting a lot of fanfic that sets out to "fix" the stuff the writer didn't like, rather than trying to build a world of its own. I also prefer "canon-style" fic---everybody in Hogwarts, one school year to a book, no weird self-conscious bashing, etc.---which became thinner on the ground after JKR finished the series.

So every so often I start looking for good fic that was written before each of the last three novels came out. (To me, the divergences get more interesting the further back you go, because suddenly the hallows or the horcruxes or the prophecy are just not a part of the universe.)

What are some of your favorites? I've always been partial to 2003's "[[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Years_of_Rebellion/Through_The_Looking_Glass/][Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion]]", even though it bogs down once he gets to school, is probably far too long, and will likely never be finished. A lot of what are now post-OOTP Indy-Harry cliches make their appearance here, but the inventiveness of the writing and the original characters makes it worthwhile for me. (Unfortunately, it looks like the FF.Net mirror no longer exists.)


** I really enjoy fics from that time period or at least written as though the books aren't all out yet.

If you are into H/Hr and have read a lot of stuff you have probably already stumbled across [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]].

Edit: I just recently finished this short AU story in which Harry is near a squib but more cunning to compensate. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib]].

*** You need to repost linkffn(3885086) as the bot doesn't recognise edits yet.

I also second 'Almost a Squib' - it's been a few months since I read it, but I remember it as being very well-written. It also manages the difficult task of being faithful to canon without slavishly following it.

On the other hand, I don't remember it being H/Hr and I think it was written after DH came out, so I'm not sure if it fulfills OP's requests.

**** Oh, H/Hr is only the reason I tend to look for these fics myself---I'm interested in any that people like from before the series was completed.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

*** Almost a Squib is really good. I enjoy characters that have to use their brains instead of just brute forcing everything.

** I totally agree about the effect DH had on H/Hr fanfic. More generally, people felt the need to write 'canon-compliant' stories, but I think this is clear demonstration of that. As someone who ships H/Hr, I've also found value in reading the old stuff.

For H/Hr, one I recently enjoyed is the (complete) [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6070][Off Balance]] by InsaneTrollLogic. Some really creative stuff there.
