I'm searching for a fanfic I read long ago, but failed to save it.

Harry and Ginny ate married and have 3 kids but she cheats on him with Oliver Wood. Harry is the the DMLE head (or mister of magic, I don't really recall). Harry knows but doesn't say anything, even when his children can't enter the Potter vaults without him inviting them in.

Oliver Woods wife (forgot the name) approaches Harry and she ends up working as his secretary, also falling for him in the end.

So Olivers 2 kids and Harrys 3 kids are now with Harry and Olivers wife.

Please lemme know if someone remembers it.

  The head auror Harry Potter wasn't feeling well, he decides to go home for the rest of the day. what he see's and hears shocks and hurts him deeply, but that moment changed his life in a way he never thought was possible. Warning: infidelity, some sexual content, no slash, Het.
