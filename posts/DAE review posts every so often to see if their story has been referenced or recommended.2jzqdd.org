Or is it just me? And no, so far mine has not.


** Guilty. As a matter of ethics I won't bring them up myself but will reply when they are mentioned.

*** Bwhahaha I'm clearly a dark!Author because I'll bring up my stories at the smallest opportunity. There is no good and evil, only viewing stats.

***** Maybe, but all yours with one exception have a description that ends in "- Complete."

****** Thanks! I'd offer a (metaphorical) tip of my hat but as this is a fanfiction sub, I somehow doubt [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2k26a7/harry_and_hermione_fan_fiction_help/clhidj9?context=3][it'd be interpreted in quite the spirit with which it was intended]]...

** If I directly ask you, will you link your stuff so I can see it? [[/u/just4read]] [[/u/truncation_error]] [[/u/wordhammer]] and [[/u/SilverCookieDust]], link me your stories.

I'm always interested in new stuff. I seem to be in a re-reading phase lately, and I want something new.

*** Profile links probably the more efficient route:

on [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1485356/][Fanfiction.net]]

on [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewuser.php?action=storiesby&uid=1432][HPFanFicArchive]]

Note that this site has more stuff, since they don't threaten to purge my account for inappropriate story content. If anything they encourage it.

This is also where I integrated 'Holly Evans...' with 'Spiral Tangents', making it an easier read.

**** Ah, thanks. (I didn't catch what "DAE" stood for; now I see.)

As I keep my writing identity separate from this handle, I'll just say that yes I do. Like [[/u/wordhammer]], I don't mention my own stuff (tempting though it may be).
