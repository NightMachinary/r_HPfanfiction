I've been starting and abandoning this story since I was 13, but a few months ago I finally became determined to finish it. And holy crap, you guys, I actually did it! I've just uploaded Chapter 1, and I'll be posting the remaining 9 (plus a brief epilogue) on a weekly basis to give me time to edit them.

This is the year of OotP from Sirius's perspective. Would love to hear your thoughts, both good and bad!

** Technically well written, but confusing. It feels distant, dream-like. Time references are ambiguous.

#+begin_quote
  Nearly a quarter of a century had passed
#+end_quote

How many years is that? The use of "century" exaggerates the time span, which is probably what you aimed for. I'd have used "decades". Still a long time period, but more believable.

#+begin_quote
  "Don't lose your temper," he put in abruptly as the words popped into his head. "Be polite and stick to the facts."

  The part of Sirius's mind that was responsible for mature thinking commended him for this very reasonable advice, even as he pushed aside the reality that he had never once taken heed of it himself.

  "Brilliant! Really excellent. I knew you'd do fine." Sirius beamed at Harry, shaking his hand buoyantly.
#+end_quote

Is this the same scene, or was there supposed to be a scene break in there?

#+begin_quote
  Figuring he ought to make a minimal effort to look for Kreacher, Sirius crossed the pantry and yanked open the small door that led to the house-elf's den.
#+end_quote

A minimal effort is to call him. You're using it as an excuse to find the bird cage, but it feels contrived.

#+end_quote

A quarter of a century is 25 years. 23 years-ish has passed. Seems perfectly reasonable to say 'nearly a quarter of a century'. Not ambiguous at all. 'Decades' sounds longer to me.

*** I think the "distant," quality of the writing that mention is probably just OP's writing style, honestly. I didn't mind it, actually i thought it was pretty fitting for Sirius and where he was in his mental state at this point.

Agreed that that one scene needs an act break, although that's probably just a formatting thing.

*** Thanks! I'm okay with it feeling dream-like, but I can try to loosen up the prose a little if the writing's too distant. It is supposed to be from his perspective after all, so that's probably a good note.

There is indeed supposed to be an act break there, but I can't get it to save that way for some reason. I've given up and posted to Ao3 and the formatting is working fine there. linkao3(10853391)

I see your point about finding the birdcage. I'll mull it over and see if there's a less contrived way to get to that point.

** u/honestplease:
#+begin_quote
  The imposing, dark-eyed man led the way up a grand staircase. Centuries of noble upbringing were evident in his haughty expression, and in his hand was a small item obscured from view by a swath of velvet.
#+end_quote

Whew! Quite an opening. It feels a little over-written. But mostly, if this is from teenage Sirius's POV it doesn't strike me as how he would describe his father.

#+begin_quote
  Orion Black's collection of Dark objects was, as far as Sirius knew, unrivaled, and a new addition could hardly bode well for his troublemaking son.
#+end_quote

If this is from Sirius's POV (which it seems to be) then it's redundant to include something like "as far as Sirius knew". Also, I think "unrivaled" should be "unrivalled". That's what my dictionary is suggesting, anyway.

#+begin_quote
  With a look of deepest disappointment at his son, Orion placed...
#+end_quote

"at his son" also seems redundant. We're already aware of the fact that Orion is (a) in Sirius's bedroom and (b) glaring at him.

#+begin_quote
  ...the lamps burst into light and the details of the room came into focus
#+end_quote

Need a comma after "light".

#+begin_quote
  His eyes fell on a patch of wall unobscured by banners or pinups. Here, a small photograph hung unframed and unassuming. Its position on the wall and the way nothing else had been hung around it made it seem rather more important than the room's other decorations.
#+end_quote

I feel like that last sentence veers a little too much into "telling" instead of "showing" territory. It's already obvious by drawing attention to the fact that it's "unframed and unassuming" on an empty patch of wall that it bears significance.

#+begin_quote
  Unlike his own likeness, this was James as Sirius remembered him.
#+end_quote

We've just learned not even a sentence prior that Sirius barely recognizes himself, so there's no need to mention it again here, particularly because it reads pretty awkwardly. I think it would be much more effective to just keep it at "This was James as Sirius remembered him".

#+begin_quote
  That unique blend of hopelessness and self-loathing, and bitter, agonizing remorse.
#+end_quote

This is a pretty awkward sentence, because there are so many descriptors. I think if you want to keep them, maybe a tiny grammatical fix, e.g. "That unique blend of hopelessness, self-loathing, and bitter, agonizing remorse." Then again, it might just be me who struggled with that particular sentence.

#+begin_quote
  A fiery burn appeared on the photo...
#+end_quote

Get rid of fiery; it comes off as over-written and redundant.

#+begin_quote
  "Bombarda!"
#+end_quote

I think you meant to italicize that, since other spells are italicized.

#+begin_quote
  to retrieve the antique birdcage, and held it up to the flickering light
#+end_quote

Get rid of the comma (unnecessary).

#+begin_quote
  And although it filled the room with crystal clarity, the Bird's beak did not open.
#+end_quote

It doesn't seem necessary to capitalize Bird here (and in the rest of the scene), but perhaps I'm mistaken. There's no doubt it's the transparent little cage bird though, so I wouldn't worry about making sure readers don't mistake it for some other bird.

Other than that -- the writing is pretty clean and easy to read. I like the creativity displayed, e.g. with the Vivisecting Vest.

#+begin_quote
  From inside their little paper universe, four teenage boys laughed and grinned, their arms around each other, looking for all the world like brothers.
#+end_quote

I like this sentence quite a lot.

I also really enjoyed the scenes with Order members and Harry & co -- those were done very well. People tend to exaggerate Molly's traits, but I feel she was written well here.

*** Wow, thanks for the detailed feedback! This is really specific and helpful. My background's in screenwriting, so if things are a little overwritten it's because I got too excited about not having to leave a ton of white space on the page, haha. I'll definitely incorporate your suggestions!
