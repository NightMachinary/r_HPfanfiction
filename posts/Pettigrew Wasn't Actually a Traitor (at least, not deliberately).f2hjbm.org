What if Pettigrew wasn't actually a traitor? What if the information was tortured out of him? The Imperious Curse? Veritaserum?


** It is specifically said in the canon, that it is not possible to get information from the Secret Keeper by any magical or non-magical means.

** The thing is though

you cant give out the information if you have /any/ hesitation or via imperius, veritaserum or legilimency for example

*** Torture. A sicko like Voldemort would make sure you have no "hesitation" by the time he was through with you.

**** Yeah that is true but would mean that he'd need to know the real secret keeper, if it weren't for peter running to him he would have thought Sirius to be the secret keeper

Although you could just have the secret keeper take an unbreakable vow not to tell anyone without asking the people hidden inside about it.

** I've always considered his betrayal to be somewhat linked to the McKinnons death. He was a traitor, but not really for personal gain, trapped in a never ending war he had no personal stake in, Order members dying all the time. Perhaps he was in love with Marlene McKinnon and when she died, he couldn't help but resent the Potters. He was a coward and prone to jealousy, but most people are.

Voldemort tells him that if he doesn't work for him, more people he cares about will die, that he will die. We don't know about his own family or if Voldemort had hold over them. Then the McKinnons die, including his maybe love interest, and he knows Voldemort is making good on his promise. What do the lives of James, Lily, & baby Harry mean when compared to all the lives given to keep them safe?

James & Lily don't notice him cracking, too busy with their perfect little family. Remus is withdrawing from the Wizarding World, to the point where even Sirius thinks he's no longer trustworthy and given into his werewolf side. Sirius is giving his all into the war that took his brother, kamikaze style, and focusing on godfathering. Who's to save Peter from himself? It becomes a game to him, sneaking behind the Orders back, secretly hoping /someone/ will notice before it's too late, that someone cares enough to notice...

Yeah I'm kinda obsessed with trying to write a realistic Peter Pettigrew.

*** That's cracking under pressure. What I'm looking for is a scenario where he really can't be held at fault. The amount of pain created by the Cruciatus Curse alone would make even the strongest men quail... Peter is not a strong man, and I'm sure the Dark Lord has many ways to torture people that make the Cruciatus look like a Tickling Charm.

** The only fic I've found like that is this one. Fair warning though as it's rather graphic, gut wrenching, and paints Pettigrew in a much more sympathetic if still traitorous light. Some scenes are uncomfortably close to rape with how they're depicted as it contains a lot of mind invasion.

** He was though. In PoA, it's mentioned that he had been giving information to the Death Eaters for nearly a year prior to his betrayal of James and Lily.

You don't give info to the other camp for an entire year by accident or chance.

*** I see what you are saying, but that's why I'm looking for someone to write a fanfiction. A skilled fanfiction author can make excuses for basically anything to make their story work.
