Are there any good long Catgirl Hermione fics, that are just slightly AUish? I would like to read one where the polyjuice couldn't be reverted or just partially. But the rest of canon mostly happens


** I've never seen a good one, all the ones I've seen are "awww she's a kawaii neko now" kind of fics that just fizzle out once the novelty wears off.

** I vaguely remember a post Hogwarts one with Harry getting Hermione a ball of yarn from somewhere foreign that she was really looking forward to playing with.

** Hmm, so there's Hermione's Furry Little Problem by Gandalfs_Beard

linkao3(2062614)

which is kinda bad and has the classic creepy underage sexuality, ew ffs

Also there's

linkao3(6318238)

which is pretty much identical due to being "inspired" by the above

linkffn(6624252)

The best of the three I've found, but still pretty dubious. It actually manages not to have explicit sex between children, and the writing isn't as bad as the other two.

In any case, you're pretty much out of luck. Those are the only three I know of and all of them are both kind of creepy and Hermione/Harry which will put off most people. The first two were all I could find for you on Ao3 and the other one I've run into before.

*** I knew about Hermione's Furry Little Problem and feared that there wouldn't be a good or decent fic. But thanks for the suggestions. Will look at them, but without great hope.
