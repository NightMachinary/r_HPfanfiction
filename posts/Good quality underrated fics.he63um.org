I've just finished reading through a The Life He Leads by generalstarfox and was completely blown away by the quality of it. It surprises me that this fic has not been recommended more often. It was the best fic I've read in a while and actually read through instead of skimming through to satisfy plot.

I've also already read through the International Triwizard Tournament by Salient Causality and A Beautiful Lie by MaybeMayba and thoroughly joined them both. Are there any other fics like this that are a bit more under the radar? Pairing doesn't have to be tonks or fleur, just a quality fic will suffice. Preferably long (100k+) too.


** I have no idea if it's really considered underrated or if I'm just not in the fandom loop enough, but I haven't really seen people talk about linkao3(Never Grow A Wishbone by ShanaStoryteller) too much. Warning, it is Drarry, but it's also an incredibly intriguing take on pureblood society, with excellent worldbuilding, and that's why I read it. Over 120k words, and completed.

Her other long HP fic is linkao3(survival is a talent by ShanaStoryteller). That one's more popular, and perhaps it's not quite underrated, but it's over 350k words at this point if you want something long to get through. It's still updating without looking like it's going to be abandoned, and it's one of my personal favorites.

  She almost smiles, and true alarm starts to build in his chest. “I'm afraid I'm not here for something so small. Professor Roberts has resigned.”“Good,” Draco says honestly, “Would you like a list of suitable alternatives? I know a number of competent potions masters abroad, but then of course you'd have to hire another teacher to act as the Slytherin head. I'm afraid you've dried up all the half decent Slytherin Potions masters.”“Not all of them,” she says quietly.He blinks. She can't be serious. “You can't be serious.”“Gravely,” she says, “Mr. Malfoy, I am not above begging.”What the bloody fuck. “I don't even like potions!”~Draco returns to Hogwarts. He has a duty to his blood and his name and his house, and he will fulfill it.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

** Starfox is pretty widely liked on here from what I've seen.

And I've seen international triwizard tournament a fair bit recently - I just read it last week and really enjoyed it.

As for reccs, I think James Spookie is an author a lot like Starfox in that it's generally well-written, but mostly been around long enough people don't think to suggest it that often. If you haven't read his stuff, my favorites are linkffn(legacy preservation act) and linkffn(things we do for love)

I also think linkffn(a different sort of bond by balder) is a really fun read, probably flies under the radar because it's abandoned though

  In which Remus and Tonks fight battles, arrest criminals, befriend werewolves, overcome inner demons and, despite it all, find themselves a happy ending. A love story, and a story of the Order years. (At long last, my Remus/Tonks epic, which has been years in the making!)
