I've been reading to many of those stories that try to add "nuance" to their characters by removing literally everything bad about them and usually pureblooded society in general.


** Our very own [[/u/Starfox5]]'s fics ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5]]) tend to be pretty unforgiving toward them, without descending into outright bashing, at least for Snape.

*** Actually no, Snape is generally good in his fics, but Draco is always a scumbag and usually gets executed by Hermione.

**** Snape tends to be a scumbag and an all around shitty person in [[/u/Starfox5]]'s fic, but one who fights on the good guys' side.

***** I think the OP asked for truly evil Snape.

It's actually rare. Most fics I've read generally portrayed Snape as a rampaging asshole fighting for the good cause, so pretty much the same as in canon.

**** I'd not say "good" - I assume that Snape hates everyone, including himself, but simply hates Voldemort more than anyone else.

*** Admittedly Draco does try to get a highly intelligent hippogriff executed after it attacks him after he insults it. And tries to bait Harry into going after Sirius Black when they still think he's a Death Eater. And Snape threatens to poison Neville's toad, tries to have Lupin given the Dementor's Kiss as well as Sirius, and when that fails exposes Lupin as a werewolf.

** So far, the worst Snape/Draco combo I have read is in "Unspeakable Things", linkffn(6473434).
