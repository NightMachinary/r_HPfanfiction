Think among the lines of the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc side of the Force]].

Ships (unless of the star/naval kind) should be at the most a background thing. Preferably longer stories (I read faster than your regular Hermione "deus ex machina" Granger); but short stories / oneshots are fine if they're good.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] by evansentranced. I know you asked for competent Harry, which I presume means older, but ... I thought of the two fics you mentioned and what came out was this. It's got a 100k sequel that is not finished, but its a fun ride and definitely humorous.

*** Can't recommend this fic enough. So much fun to read, I really hope the next chapter of the sequel is released soon. The previous one was rather a cliffhanger.

** If you liked the havoc side of the force, there's a relatively new one in the same vein called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I still haven't found what I'm looking for]]. The best description I can think of is "watch Harry snark at Jedi while derping around the galaxy making people's lives more... interesting" It's not done yet, but the author has churned out 80K words since starting the story in April.

Clarification: There is no murderhobo droid in this one yet.

Assurance: Dobby the mechanic is also awesome.

**** Also, check out Nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat Green Eyes]] as well. Harry joins the crew of the Serenity as their new pilot. Watch as he tries to cork the leak in River's brainpan while making life more interesting for Mal.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]. Crude humour, but I found it hilarious and exciting at the same time.

** These are both in progress but they're my two favorite, and somehow they both /remind/ me of A Black Comedy. Although they aren't overt crackfics, both authors are good writers who aren't exactly taking their Super!Harry seriously:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10714425/2/Messing-With-Time][Messing With Time]] and\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]].

Very excited to check out the recs in this thread, I'm looking for more like this too ;)

Just thought, you might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] as well, it's again not an awesome total crackfic like A Black Comedy but it has tons of humorous moments, it's quite long, and Harry ends up really competent.

*** I /know/ I've read Messing With Time, it's on my followed stories list... but I just can't recall what it's about.

...

Which is great cause It means I get to re-read it.
