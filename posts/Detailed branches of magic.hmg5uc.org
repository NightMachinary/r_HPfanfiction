In a lot of fics it says Harry has tons of magical abilities but he never uses them and I want fics where Harry uses or even abuses them or fics where the author goes into detail about the true nature of magic or dark magic like evative or for the love of magic pretty much I want fics where Magic is actually used to its full potential. A lot of people don't like fics where Harry has many magical powers that he usually finds out about through an inheritance test along with about ten million lordships but I don't care about that as long as Harry actually uses the abilities


** Well, there's linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane). Also, if I'm allowed to blow my own trumpet, my WIP fic is heading that way. linkffn(Our Very Own side). Worry not. None of these fics have the cliched and cringey magical inheritance

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have a lot in common. Both of them are Half-bloods raised by abusive muggles. Both of them are Parselmouths. Both are sorted into the house of snakes. What sets them apart is that one had friends, true, loyal friends, and the other did not. The story of a cold and calculating Harry. Slytherin!Harry. Grey!Harry. OC is the son of Sirius. No slash
