As the title says, who is, according to you, the character that is best characterized in most fanfictions? The one that is always on point?


** Typically the one-dimensional characters like Filch.

Complex characters tend to lose some layers in most fanfiction (Dumbledore, Snape, Ron) whereas much-admired characters tend to inflate to something barely resembling the original character (Luna, Draco, Ginny).

But isn't that just the inherent problem of fanfiction? All characterisations are 'off'. They'd have to be. Otherwise, you're just retelling canon. I don't see the point in that.

*** I was following your first two paragraphs but you lost me at the third. Keeping canon characterizations doesn't require that we retell canon. Keeping all the characterizations exactly the same, there's plenty of room to fill in the missing details of canon (canon-compliant backstories etc of all the characters) or describe how these characters would react to a change in the plot.

**** You think so?

Characters act, behave, think, and feel according to the subjective logic of their perception. Their 'history'.

If Harry would've had a different upbringing, he might not have made the same choices. But he would still be Harry. Even 'in-character'-Harry. Just a Harry with a different backstory.

My point was that since every meaningful form of fanfiction describes events not displayed in the original series, the character would be forced to experience something new which -- inevitably -- would lead to their character changing subtly.

Thus, any fanfiction is (over time) bound to change the characterisation of its leading cast. If I was provocative, I might even say that fictions that don't do this fail to stay true to the inner logic of their universe and how it diverts from canon.

***** No. That just doesn't make sense. You seem to be stuck on this idea that fanfiction has to either diverge from canon or repeat canon, which isn't true at all.

As an example, we know that there's some backstory involving Moody mentoring Tonks before Harry met either of them. There's plenty of room for fanfiction about their working relationship that leads to the two canon characters we eventually meet. There's plenty of room for fanfiction about Order activities that Harry didn't know about, so didn't get mentioned by Rowling in canon. All those fanfics require all the characterizations to stay canon in order to fit in with canon, but don't involve repeating canon.

****** Look, I'm not trying to be argumentative, and if this is what you people dig -- fine by me. I'm neither judge nor jury, and I'm certainly not presumptive or arrogant enough to say I'm the absolute authority on fanfiction.

That being said, I personally cannot agree. 'Filling the gap' is the exact same as 'changing canon'. If the story doesn't mention a backstory, that means it's not there. If you write one, you change canon insofar it now has one. The end result is the same: the world of canon is not the same as it was before.

Even disregarding that, I firstly propose you cannot write any backstory of significant length while truly staying in character. Not only because most people lack a) the craftmanship to imitate another author's style and at the very least b) because all reading is interpretation insofar comprehending something is only possible in comparison to established knowledge (knowledge feedback), meaning 'characterisations' will always be subtly different between readers. Author1 and Author2 may both write fiction, genuinely believing to 'stay true' to canon's Tom Riddle. Author1 is someone with a complicated family situation who wants to emphasise Riddle's upbringing. Author2 was recently the victim of a bully and feels vindictive. To a degree, both authors might follow canon, and (if they actually are decent authors) they might successfully argue that Riddle1 and Riddle2 both act within the range of Riddle*'s character.\\
The root of the issue is this: canon is only what's written down. But humans are incapable of objectively comprehending information, of objectively reading canon. Fanfiction is always fiction of fiction and can never be part of canon. This is axiomatic.

Secondly, there's the problem of assumed causality. Let's use your example:

AuthorA writes a backstory about Moody's and Tonks' rocky start, Moody's refusal to acknowledge a new and especially clumsy trainee, a dramatic twist which helps Tonks earn his trust, his promise to turn her into a fine Auror.\\
AuthorB writes how Tonks goes for a boozer to celebrate being accepted as an Auror cadet. A few rowdy foreigners get into a fight, and Tonks, trying to settle it before things escalate, gets hit in the ensuing ruckus by a little-known curse that will leave Tonks stumbling through her life, literally.

Now, I didn't check if any of these are conflicting with canon, but that's not the point. The issue is that if TonksA is, as you say, filling the gap, TonksB cannot also be filling the gap. You might now argue that both could explain her episode with the umbrella stand, but I would reply that any characterisation that is so vague to be explained by two vastly different scenarios lacks causality and accountability both. If a character with little background can be explained as, for instance -- a) a professional criminal with a past drug problem or b) a police officer who was working diligently on the anti-drug force -- the 'characterisation' is so vague that one might question its existence in the first place, because I boldly declare that no two people with two such contrasting pasts could turn out exactly the same. To a lesser degree, this problem is present in any character.

Truth is, we don't know if Tonks is clumsy. Truth is, Tonks gets maybe 3-5 pages in an opus as comprehensive as the Bible. An out-of-universe explanation might be that Rowling felt the need to introduce another light-hearted character once Sirius turns rather gloomy. A possible in-universe explanation might be that these moments stuck in Harry's memory because he thought it was funny, but he didn't really believe Tonks to be clumsy at all.

All we know is */how Rowling/* wrote *the invisible narrator* who /might or might not coincide/ with */Harry's personal, and biased perception./*

â€‹

So, in summary, no: I don't think you can fill the gap.

******** I never said it doesn't exist though? Or that it shouldn't. I was just trying to explain that it's impossible to write 'in canon'. I'm sorry that it took longer than one paragraph. I didn't anticipate the length of my argument to be a problem in this Reddit specifically.\\
I apologise if I trod on someone's foot.

*** Yeah that's what I meant. It just came to me this morning while reading yet another fanfiction that McGonagall is fairly consistent and every fanfiction keep tend to keep within range of her plausible behavior in regard to canon. Even fanfiction where her character is developed and play a more central role, she keeps the same air about her, the same heart if you will. Of course there are fanfictions in which she simply sounds off but most of the time she is on point.

** Tough question. I'd say it's those who neither get a lot of love nor a lot of hate. Because people tend to only focus on the positive with their favorite characters and only on the negative with the ones they don't like, when all characters have some positive and negative traits.

Perhaps Neville and Umbridge? (Not to say they are not loved and hated, but I don't see as many fics about them as about other people) I haven't read a lot of stories focused on Neville, but the ones I have seen seemed pretty in character. And Umbridge is just so terrible, it's hard to bash her.
