I like a lot fics with some of the characters depicted with their opossite sex than canon. But commonly its only done with harry. Only a few fics do it with other characters.

And for a while I have been thinking on how outright hilarious would be have females George and Fred winning an interest in Harry towards the end their six-seventh year.

Do youu know any fics like that?


** Only story I can think of that has female weasley twins is a pure smut fic where instead of house point loses they have spankings in front of the class and/or the whole school. But the twins dont show up til near the end.

****** One scene is all. Prettiest girls in their year apparently. I forgot the writer felt the need to write out every strike of a spanking. But yes fem twins would be interesting to read a serious take on

*** Is it canonical that Arthur & Molly were making babies long enough to have a daughter? Isn't it a fanon? Couldn't they just want to have seven children?

**** It is one of Ron's fears; that he was unwanted because his mother wanted a daughter. Whether it was unfounded or not is never clarified. It is canon that Ginny was doted upon by Molly while Ron was not.

***** Perhaps, but what I meant is whether it is somewhere explicitly mentioned that Weasleyes have that many children, because they wanted to have daughter so much (or because they meant it as a breaking of the curse, but that curse is fanon as well, isn't it)?

****** The curse is definitely fanon.

Ron believes that his parents were trying for a daughter because that's what the locket horcrux taunts him with in Deathly Hallows, so it is either based in fact or is strongly implied to him during his childhood.

  “I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible. ...”

  “Stab!” shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle's eyes.

  “*Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter* ... Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend ... Second best, always, eternally overshadowed ...”
#+end_quote

OK, so it was his fear. Of course, whether it was true, or the horcrux just lied (no surprise, if it did), we don't know.
