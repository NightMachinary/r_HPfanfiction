Looking fics about jealous or possessive Hermione over Ron. Wouldn't mind if Hermione's mean streak comes into play. It has to be Romione though. Don't mind smut.

As a prompt, (a dark one) Ron gets raped or something by someone like Pansy Parkinson and Hermione goes all berserk. She takes care of Ron until he heals but meanwhile Hermione makes a plan to make Pansy (or whoever it is) pay.


** Canon. Hermione made Ron bleed with a bird attack because she was possessive over him - she couldn't stand seeing him with someone who wasn't HER. I can canonically see Hermione abusing Ron during their marriage just so she can keep him around. Make him stay by making him too scared to leave.

** I know a few revengeful Hermione fics but none of them are due to possessiveness over Ron.
