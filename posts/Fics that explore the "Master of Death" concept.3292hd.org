For example, the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] has Harry in the role of Death.

That kind of thing.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]] by the same author as Lily and the Art of Sisyphus also is about Harry as Death.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

*** Galleons is a fairly good fic, but I do not recommend it to >anyone<. Tsume Yuki has to be the most infuriating person on the entirety of ffnet. Starts good fic after good fic, and writes really good, and then... goes on to the next fic. Its driving me insane!

**** Yeah, it's such a shame, really. I wish she'd finish as often as starting, but it is the writers choice... I probably won't recommend her as a favorite writer either, but at least Galleons is complete, and fits what the OP wants.

***** Yes, it is finished. There was some weird sequel thing that never happened, I think. I also think I remember the ending not being so good. Maybe it was rushed, can't recall.

** One of my favorite MoD fics is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]].

Dumbledore summons a hero to take care of Voldemort. That hero happens to be Harry from another dimension. Who happens to be Death. AlmightyGodlikeIEatSoulsForBreakfast!Harry kind of Death.

**** Yeah. I was reading through fringeperson's stories, and stumbled across it. Not entirely what the author was looking for, i think. But, as you said, cute enough that it deserved sharing.

Actually, the author has a number of descent short stories.

***** I recently read Mischief Managed on their page, and it was pretty good.

Also, I think most of those stories don't belong to the page's owner.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768][Whispers in Corners]] - A complete AU crossover of Sherlock and Harry Potter. Tells the story of a MoD Harry who has "stumbled" into a parallel world. Much better than it first sounds.

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC
