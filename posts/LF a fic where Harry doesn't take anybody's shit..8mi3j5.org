A fic where Harry doesn't give a crap about other people's problems and does not take on the responsibilities other people are pushing on to him. "BOY! Didn't I tell you no funny business!" "Alo, police? Can I report an abuse case?"

"Harry! Prof Snape is trying to steal the philosopher stone! We gotta stop him!" "Don't care. He can have it for all I care. I'm busy with this essay."

"Harry Potter. Our newest celeb-" "You get one step closer and I scream bad touch!"

"I'm afraid that Lord Voldemort is not quite dead, my boy" "Okay, that's nice. he can have this fucked up country. I'm going to France."


** "Harry would be expelled in his first year but Dumbledore still knows Harry has to fight Voldemort so gives him even more leeway than canon"?

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** What about one where he runs of to America, refusing to become a child soldier? linkao3(Rise Above by Straight_Outta_Hobbiton) and he and his friends find a better life, but in doing that they leave the British Wizarding world behind to burn. The story takes a lot of minor characters and flesh them out and introduces a lot of OCs and it /works/ the author is so skilled. Stylistically(if that is even the right word) once the trio leave British shores the story steps away from most fandom conventions and tropes and does not hold back any punches. I love it, so refreshing.

The second part really focuses on Britain turning on muggleborns and gets dark and gritty and /realistic/. A totalitarian regime rises and genocide begins and characters behave and feel like real flawed people slowly whittling their souls away in an attempt to survive. Collaborating. Death of the boiling frog. Killing children.

Maybe I'm over hyping it but I love seeing this new generation of fandom writers that goes at the possibilities from a new angle.

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.

  Time has passed and the Golden Trio is safe and happy. Their family--- or most of them--- is safe and happy with them. There is love, there is joy, there is expansion... The Potters, the Weasleys, and the Black-Lupins are well.If only we could all be so lucky.Percy is a Weasley in a farce called the Ministry. Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan are on the run. A Muggle detective named Rosier Bishop has a new partner who sees things and a series of murders that they just can't explain. Draco and his new wife Luna are stepping through a minefield of friendly Death Eaters who visit for tea after murdering children. Neville's working with crazy people to try and integrate the Magical world with the Muggle, and oh, yeah, Dumbledore's dead along with most of the rest of the Order.

*** No, that's not what he asked. He asked about a fic in which Harry would act like a normal boy and ask things like 'Why should I care'? Or something like 'if you don't want to get killed by a Dark Lord then fight him and his forces. Don't ask an 11 year old boy to fight your battles'.

Makes sense?

**** Yep! that is pretty much what I was asking. Even Hermione was doing it albeit without knowing it. Why the hell should an eleven years old boy care about a fancy rock? Do you remember when you were eleven years old? I remember those days and I sure as hell not wondering about things that the adults were responsible about. My worries were about toys and cartoons, not a madman and their plot to get immortality. And Don't ever give the excuse of Harry being special. That is just bad writing.

***** I'm pretty sure when I was eleven I would have realized the importance of “a bad guy” getting something which would grant him immortality and infinite money (to the point that the economy could stand it, anyway).

To be completely honest, Harry attempting to tell a teacher shows more maturity than most children that age, but the arrogance of thinking you could stop it personally definitely falls into the category of “shit kids think”.

**** There are definitely more Malfoys than Potters in this world. Though I suspect they are both vastly outnumbered by Rons.

*** don't understand how you come up with that conclusion. I just wanna read a Harry who doesn't care about other people's problems and doesn't let other people forcing responsibilities that aren't his on him.

**** Alright, so Harry Potter without literally the most defining character traits that make him Harry Potter.

Canon Harry is actually brave, curious and very very selfless. That is what makes the character. Maybe you could have him just liking to fly and liking treacle tart, but that doesn't make it Harry.

This is the reason all those power wank fics don't work out, as he's basically a selfish asshole in all of those, which doesn't fit the character.

The way you described the character fits closest to Draco Malfoy. Uncaring, brash and an ass.

***** Ok, we get that you are a Canon Harry fan but stop derailing this thread. I'm looking for fics. As in written texts that imitate the original plot but doesn't have to. The key word here is that, fics don't have to be word for word similar to canon. And, Draco Malfoy? Seriously? Just because I don't share your tastes in HP fanfic doesn't mean you have to be an asshole.

***** Dude, plenty of fanfiction (most of it) has Harry OOC. Who cares. You don't have to read it.

And there is much more to Malfoy than those three traits. Making Harry those does not turn him into Malfoy. You could say Ron is partly those things at times.

And there is such thing as character development, you know? Not only does Harry not need to have those traits in the beginning, but if he starts off with them, he doesn't have to end with them.

****** I don't get you people, the guy wants a Harry who doesn't care, but you shove your opinion upon them like "No, thats just Malfoy" or "Thats not like Canon Harry at all!!"\\
Seriously, who cares? Its Fanfiction, I've seen bloody Dementors having sexual intercourses with centaurs and other people in some threads, Let people read what they want instead of starting pointless arguments you could have in a Discussion thread.
