One would expect /Ravenclaw/'s Monster to be a Sphinx, not Hufflepuff's...

** I know that in linkffn(Behind the Veil by StycianLeo) a fem!Harry ends up fighting Helga's creature. It was either a chimaera, manticore, or a sphinx, but I don't totally recall. Probably not what you're looking for. Also, are you sure it wasn't Rowena's Sphinx instead? That would be more in line with her.

  After the final battle, our hero takes time to mourn the lost; for all his tribulations Magic itself gives him the opportunity to regain his loved ones and perhaps make a few more. For that opportunity, no price is too high. Rated M, FemHarry/TMR and more

*** I suppose it depends just how smart this Harry is, you can handle a Sphinx just by answering the riddles correctly, but if you're wrong it's fight to the death time (I guess you could try running, but that's not really going to solve the problem).
