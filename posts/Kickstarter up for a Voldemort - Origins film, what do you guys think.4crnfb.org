*** Dialogue seemed stilted as well. Looked interesting enough, but probably won't be donating.

** I'm a big fan of Riddle-centric stories, so I generally support this idea, but I have heavy doubts towards the execution. He's a very difficult character to tackle, especially in long stories. I think it would be best if the producers at least released the script, or a fanfic based on the script, before filming it.

Also, from my experience with LOTR fanfilms, they tend to suck hard.

** A very cool idea, not sure how you avoid being sued to death at trying to sell the film afterwards though, do J.K. or The Warner Bro studios not own everything with Voldemort attached to it?

*** Direct from the Kickstarter: "The campaign aims at collecting 15.000 â‚¬ to cover the production costs. These include: costumes and props, 3D animation and visual effects, music and sound design, photography and aerial videos, stock footages, make-up, locations and all the necessary to realize the film.

The film is a no profit project, all the professionals involved will dedicate their time and skills without receiving any payment, just a refund. All the money collected will be used to cover the actual costs."

**** Which is legal speak for being paid.

Also they're giving stuff out to people who donate certain brackets of money like DVDs and film credits which are products. Or that's what I would say if I was a Warner bros lawyer. ðŸ˜Š
