I often see Pure-blood culture depicted as very cold and proper. As an exaggeration of Victorian Era propriety. But that just seems so muggle to me when I sit down and think about it.

Surely the Pure-blood elite define themselves by their use of magic. Their mastery of it. Their natural affinity. To do something the Muggle way, to live my muggle norms would be a betrayal of that lineage they so prize.

The proliferation of magical ability allows for what is culturally and technologically a very tradition civilization to operate like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy][Post-scarcity Society.]]

Edwardian Ideals meets Post Capitalist reality.

Let's take the spirit of the infamous [[https://twitter.com/wizardingworld/status/1081242428105998336?lang=en]["No toilets tweet"]] and run with it.

Imagine a Wizarding culture that embraces all the fictional excesses of anti-Roman propaganda.

Feasts where peoples stomach contents are continuously vanished, allowing participants to indulge with out end.

People eating in a deliberately slovenly fashion because perfect cleanliness is but a wand wave away.

A world were Cheering Charms are taught as a matter of course would no doubt set the bar high for all manner of intoxicants.

Willingly Obliviating yourself so you can experience something for the first time over and over, then restoring all those memories all at once.

Transfiguring new organs and appendages just for the experience they send to the brain.

Violent games, blood sports all healed in a flash.

Old warlocks so fat they need to be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Harkonnen][levitated]] from place to place by Elves, polyjuicing into nubile young flesh whenever they feel the need.

Endless sensation so easily attained. So different from those muggles.

  Since the series was mainly geared towards children at the start, JKR obviously didn't wish to state some of the nastier, more abusive, kinkier, more lewd things, etc. upfront.

Oh certainly. I'm just curious why the fanfic community hasn't had more fun with it.

** This is an interesting point; I'm getting a Dorian Gray sort of vibe here; what happens when the upper class with access to too much time and magic on top of that gets bored? If you've not seen/read the Magicians, I'd suggest it to you as something that fits the criteria. It's definitely a facet of certain character's personalities in that series.

** You know this would be a great tie in to the real world ideas of why magic is evil.... Remember this; The Church of Satan in the real (modern) world is less about evil and more about free will, philosophy, Free speech and thinking. Then you have those minor off shoots which are about hedonism. These were all things common in the roman empire, but with the rise of Christians those were seen as Evil. With the rise of Christianity hedonism was often seen as one or more of the 7 sins. Now its basically seen in HP canon that the statue of secrecy arose sometime after the fall of rome. Maybe this is the reason why. I mean maybe the wizards lack common sense about danger is because of the fact that magic can cure just about anything thats not done with dark magic. And if we look at the feasts they clearly don't care about eating healthy or staying fit. The closest we see to exercise is Quiditch. Also when Hermione fixes her teeth with magic and straightens her hair in GoF We see that magic can fix faults in ones looks(Beauty is in the eye of the beholder {Hermione Thought those things made her look bad.}) So clearly magic can solve almost any body related problems. The only thing we see that can't be fixed easily is death and dark magic. Now maybe the whole GoF thing was not a problem either since the Romans did that often. Maybe Dying for Fame and Glory is worth doing in the WW. Similar to how some cultures believe the greatest death is on the battlefield. I could go on and on but I think I made my point.

** It's my headcanon that this kind of lifestyle was one of the ways that he drew people into his influence. Young men were drawn on by access to sex and alcohol etc, others were drawn in with human sacrifice dressed as a ‚Äòreturn to tradition', and powerful men of influence were drawn in by other forbidden things like access to children and imperioused sex slaves etc etc

Tom Riddle as a black magic Gatsby, if you will

your description is really spot on tbh.

and then I see the people who had either experienced that decadence with handsome Tom Riddle pre-baby Harry and these parties and then or heard about the stories and then he gets resurrected and it's just not the same. They're sort of like...why are WE the one's getting cruico'd this time? this isn't as fun as I remember and Tom looks like a motherfucking ghoul mates with an albino snake like...

** Purebloods being a bunch of magical Slaanesh worshippers is a pretty interesting idea, and one I'd like to see in a fic (though it would probably have to be rated M).

That said, I'm not sure if the Wizarding world is really a post-scarcity society. There are certain limitations on using magic for sustenance (e.g. food cannot be created out of thin air, although water apparently can), and there are pureblood families that are poor - the Weasleys or the Gaunts, for instance.

Besides, as of the last book, Magical Britain has seen three wars in half a century, one of them spanning at least a decade. That doesn't really seem like a good envinronment for such hedonism to thrive (well, except maybe in the immediate aftermatch of a war).

*** If you /are/ willing to consider the video games as cannon though I think there was a spell introduced in GoF or OoP (maybe) that was used to grow plants almost instantly, which would mean basically year-round one-day planting and immediately harvesting of vegetables and fruits, though meat would be harder to come by. Can't remember the name of the spell, so there might be the possibility of it being from a fanfic and I just forgot üòÖ
