So I have finally begun writing my story Flame Child that I have been mulling over for the last month or so. There is something very gratifying about just sitting down and write to your hearts content. So now I sit here at chapter 4 and 11000 words and wondering: Did I do it right?

I know there is no right or wrong, but still I am very nervous about what people might think about it, since this is my first story. I went a very alternative route, by drawing inspiration from my favourite fanfiction [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Harry Potter and the Lords Of Magic]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/883762/Taure][Taure]]. This means that I am taking on a whole different universe, and I am almost at my wits end worrying about how I am going to explain the differences. I have tried to let it slide in from time to time instead of going the Tolkien route. But did I succeed?

So now the question is, would a beta do me any good? What does a beta actually do, and where do I get one? :) What I would really love, is someone who can check up on my use of the English language, since I am a Dane, and therefore not a native speaker, and hopefully someone I can pitch my ideas to.


** One more suggestion for finding a beta, and then I'll stop spamming this post. :) Sign up for a [[http://www.livejournal.com][livejournal]] blog, and then join [[http://hp-betas-wanted.livejournal.com/][hp_betas_wanted]] and [[http://hp-betas.livejournal.com/][hp_betas]].

** A beta really just reviews your submission for spelling, punctuation and grammar mistakes. A beta also points out inconsistencies - for example, a character takes off her coat in Chapter 2 though you had her leave the coat at home in Chapter 1.

** If you want someone to pitch your ideas to, I would recommend joining Harry Potter fanfic communities. You will find other writers who like to throw ideas around, listen to each other and give suggestions. On the sidebar is a link to fanfiction archives, forums and sites that might get you started. Of course, there's nothing to stop you from pitching your ideas /here/ as well. :)

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/][Fanfiction.net]] maintains a list of beta readers. To qualify for the list, you have to have written and posted fanfic on the site. Considering there's no quality control to begin with, some people question this criterion as a good standard of beta quality.

** u/Bulwersator:
#+begin_quote
  This means that I am taking on a whole different universe
#+end_quote

I would just mention it in description or AN at the top - I see nothing wrong in deep AU story that is not explaining all changes from canon in the first chapter. And people may read story that inspired you.

#+begin_quote
  instead of going the Tolkien route
#+end_quote

I am confused - what was intended meaning of this phrase?

#+begin_quote
  What does a beta actually do
#+end_quote

Read story before posting it to the public to catch grammar problems, misspellings and other things like this.

*** Alright, thanks. As for the Tolkien thing. Tolkien spent ages on describing the world before going into the story itself.
