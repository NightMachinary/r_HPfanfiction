*** Why hasn't the bot linked these? Is it beacuse the whole address is there?

The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited linkffn(9708318) is an old favorite of mine. The problem with them is that they always just stop updating... I'm not sure I've seen a single compete one. I think the authors realize just how hard it is to keep track of everything and for it to remain fresh and interesting. Some others: linkffn(8052743), linkffn(10309134), and linkffn(10563477).

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

  After his self-sacrifice Harry is faced with a choice, stay in limbo or play a RPG game about himself. Enough to say that stories about a character that actually chose to stay in limbo would not be a popular one... Video-game fic.

  Harry Potter beat Voldemort but died in the process. In a strange place with options to replay his life in a world of either Light or Dark, Harry makes what seems to be the obvious choice and intends to use this 'Game' to ensure that he never fails his friends again. But there is more to this 'Inquisition' that will rock his beliefs to the core. Gamer Harry mild DA:InquisitionXover
