At the end of Harry's journey, we only hear that Harry and the gang *"helped to revolutionize the Ministry and reform the wizarding world".* What this entails we don't know. Here are the political reforms I would push for.

​

  *Wizengamot*
#+end_quote

Wiki describes the Wizengamot *"as a combination of court and parliament. It was made up of around fifty members. The process for selecting members was unclear, though the Minister for Magic appeared to have some power over the final selection."*

Fanon, puts forward the idea that Wizengamot positions are hereditary similar to the House of Lords. I recently read a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/8jai4z/the_wizengamot_the_most_ridiculous_part_of_a_book/dyy8r26?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][post]] curious about this, and someone commented that Wizengamot members probably elect themselves, Cooption. Anytime they is a vacancy, the Wizengamot will sit to choose a new member.

Reform the Wizengamot, making the members be decided upon by a public vote. Each of the 50 members shall be given districts which shall be drawn up from area of Great Britain. The members shall be subjected to an election every 7 years.

The Wizengamot will no longer hold trials for minor issues such as robberies and trespassing.

The Minister of Magic will be barred from sitting during Wizengamot trials

​

This is just my idea of reforming the Wizengamot which I will use in a fanfiction. Any other thoughts on reforming other parts of Wizarding Britain?


** This goes beyond Britain, but perhaps the new generation could advocate for a review and overhaul of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy?

They could encourage the International Confederation of Wizards to update the structure, organizational requirements (and, to a lesser extent, individual citizen requirements), and penalties with the goal of clarifying when and how the wizarding world is allowed to intervene in Muggle affairs. It could be restructured to allow the Confederation - and individual governing bodies within countries - to more easily analyze situations that involve war, human rights, human security, genocide, climate change, unavoidable societal change, etc, and when making decisions on intervention, require them to adhere to a more /modern/ set of guidelines on how to address such issues, and to what degree they should get involved (if at all).

This may, by design, also trigger a review of the wizarding world's relationship with (Muggle) states and nations, and require them to have a more clearly-defined identification as citizens or non-citizens, and if the former, more appropriately adhere to civil responsibilities as members of those states/nations in whatever way they can under the Statute.

*** I am working on something which is a political campaign where the goal is outright repeal sparked by Elon Musk running a "witchhunt". He had found about the flying car from Chamber of Secrets, because the paper got up on the internet, and somebody tweeted it at him, and MACUSA overreacted and executed some people, so public opinion has turned against the law, and he seeks to leverage it since Hermione's job enforcing the statute has come back to bite her hard, and she will not be reelected.

** A significant number of the people in the House of Lords are supposedly there because of special competency - they have some knowledge in an area that's important for reviewing the political stuff proposed by the House of Commons. The hereditary peers elected amongst themselves are about an eighth of the total numbers of the Peerage there.

Supposedly, the people elect the members of the House of Commons, who represent their opinions and propose legislation based on those opinions, which the House of Lords and various Working Groups (extra groups of politicians who deal with specific issues) look over to see if they actually make sense to people who actually know things about the areas they're trying to change.

Like all politics, it doesn't quite work as smoothly as the theory in reality, but that's the intention, at least. Members have to be suggested by people and people have beliefs that they'll act according to.

[[https://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/whos-in-the-house-of-lords/members-and-their-roles/how-members-are-appointed/]]

Anyway, to my actual point. Could be interesting to have a subset of the Wizengamot with a skill-based election rather than have them all appointed by the usual generic popularity contest. Gives a bit of a nod to the odd British Traditionalism of Politics (our politicians literally cast votes by walking down 'Aye and No Lobbies') and puts a slightly more interesting spin on the 'We Bring Democracy To The Wizards!' cliche.

** I highly doubt there are enough people in the magical community of Britain to justify having fifty electoral districts. Its unlikely you'd be able to field that many candidates for office in a given year.

Put this in perspective- going off the size of the Hogwarts student body, there are maybe 5000 witches and wizards in Britain, give or take, plus maybe a few thousand assorted squibs and sapient magical creatures. Now, I live in a municipality of about 18000 people. In our last municipal candidate election we had IIRC ten people running for six council seats, plus two candidates for Mayor. We obviously didn't have a different district for each seat- the way the Council election worked was that whichever six candidates got the most votes were elected.

I think you have to think of Wizarding Britian as like a municipality, population-wise, not a country. Fifty seats is already too much (or too little, if you're an advocate of direct democracy or Athenian-style democracy). You certainly won't have fifty separate electoral districts (actually, its around fifty, which fits nicely enough my headcanon of 49 seats- an odd number to avoid tie votes, and 7x7 is a highly magical number).

Honestly, I'd either shrink it to a council of seven elected in the manner I described above, or preferably expand it to a public assembly in which all citizens can participate (their population is small enough to make that workable, probably).

As to the Wizengamot no longer trying "minor" issues- that raises the question of who does. We have no indication that there even is an independent judiciary outside of the Wizengamot, and again, we are talking about the population of a small town here- there probably aren't a great many legal experts at hand.

I do absolutely agree that the Minister should not be able to sit on/preside over the Wizengamot, the way Fudge appeared to in Order of the Phoenix. Since the two primary sources of political power appear to be the Minister and the Wizengamot, having the Minister on/overseeing the Wizengamot means that there is no independent check on the Minister's power.

wasn't the number of student in Harrys years at hogwarts clearly affected by the war? JK has consistently been bad at numbers, but there has been stated atleast that there is around a 1000 students at hogwarts i belive, so population should be more than 5k. added that with the longer lifespan of Witches and Wizards i would logically have a population larger than what we belive

**** Even if we have a thousand Hogwarts students, that comes out to a bit under 150 a year on average. If the average wizard or witch lives to 100, that puts the population at around 15,000- still firmly in "small town" territory.

***** I think in general people don't get just how small the Wizarding World is population-wise. It feels bigger because they're scattered across a country and have all these grand magical buildings, but there's a reason magical Britain doesn't have a standing army, or a university, or more than one high school or hospital. Its /tiny./ Its completely possible that the dozen or so named Aurors in the series represent the entire manpower of the Auror office during that time period, or close to it. This is why one wizard can decide a war- sure, Voldemort, Grindlewald, and Dumbledore are exceptional, but they're not /that/ strong. They couldn't beat a hundred guys in an open battle, or a thousand. If they had the population and infrastructure for modern, industrialized warfare, no one duelist would ever decide a war.

Put this in perspective- About fifty defenders died at the Battle of Hogwarts. Assuming an equivalent number on Voldemort's side (with the defenders taking more losses in the first phase of the battle, and Voldie taking more in the second half), and assuming a population of twenty thousand- it would be percentage-wise like the US losing close to a million people in a single battle.

Honestly, the magical nations should consolidate into a single global government- they have far more in common than they have keeping them apart, and consolidating their population would actually give them enough people to maintain a modern infrastructure. I shudder to think what its like in tiny magical countries- they probably don't even have much of a formal government, hospitals, or schools, and rely on the generosity of their neighbors for anything the equivalent of the local village can't manage.

** Actually, the /entirety/ of the Wizengamot taking on a parliament role is Fanon. What we know for sure, going by the books, is only that it functions as a high court; the rest is extrapolation or speculation. As happens so often, you can't rely on the wiki, making it rather redundant as a source of information.

So you obviously can build that up to some quasi-aristocratic body and then reform it afterwards, but as far as the books go, what is meant with the quote appears to be what it says: Focused on the Ministry, where there is enough to do, if you want to rid it of bias, nepotism, and corruption (in that order: The only Muggleborn Minister was killed, the only department head a Muggleborn had ever the chance to reach was the irrelevant Goblin Liaison, from Malfoy to Arthur things constantly get done on a doing-favours basis); as well as changing the attitude of the world at large, which appears to be a-ok with implicit classism putting Muggleborns at a disadvantage, and purebloods at the top.

It's also very much a fairy tale fix-it, in my opinion. It's nice to think you could change all that; realistically, it needs /another/ revolution (a reverse-Voldemort, if you want), and that's neither nice nor pretty, see the various examples in history.

*** I am just going to point out that the assumption that "realistically" any substantial change requires a bloody, reign of terror-style purge, is not actually clearly supported by history. In fact a recent study showed that statistically, primarily non-violent uprisings are far more likely to succeed in toppling a regime than violent ones: [[https://bbc.com/news/stories-54142487]] (for those who are wondering, the success rate is about 1 in 3 for non-violent uprisings, 1 in 10 for violent ones).

This assumption, that a bloody purge is the only way to enact meaningful change, is too often simply repeated as (presumed) fact without questioning the underlying assumption. Its also an implicitly authoritarian argument, as its implication is that no meaningful reform can ever be made through the democratic or legal process, and that democracy and law should therefore be abandoned in favor of relying on strong men wielding force to bring change. And its an assumption that really should be questioned, both because of the incredibly high stakes involved, and because the notion that "necessary" evil will ultimately serve the greater good is one that appeals easily to our base instincts, and which serves the interests of those who possess the most force- and which should therefore be subjected to the most careful scrutiny of reason.

In my experience, those who advocate "necessary evil" rarely stop to seriously ask whether the evil they are advocating is actually necessary- it is just assumed that the more violent, brutal, and duplicitious one is, the more effective one is, which handily justifies the evil they already wanted to do.

Of course, this is referring to a real-world context- it is possible that in the magical world, common forms of non-violent resistance such as a general strike or other forms of civil disobedience would be less effective, as their infrastructure and economy is largely maintained by magic, not by human workers.
