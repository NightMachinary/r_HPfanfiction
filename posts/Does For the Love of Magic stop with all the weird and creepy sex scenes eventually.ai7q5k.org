I'm about 10% into the story and I'm just not a real fan of reading near chapter lengrh sex scenes. Especially when the author has to constantly bring up that Harry is like 12 or 13 during these scenes all the time. Or how Harry is having sex with these two older girls who are basically prostituting themselves and the author is trying hard to make it sound like that's not really the case.

I suppose they're decently well written as far as that sort of thing goes, but I find myself just skipping over them because they're rather uncomfortable. Do they ever end? Or does Harry get old enough where it's not quite so creepy to think about?

Linkffn(for the love of magic)

Edit:

Thanks for all the responses, I picked this up because I heard about it on the subreddit I think in a neutral tone somewhere. I didn't know it was so reviled, and I understand it completely. I did relatively like the stuff about Harry in first year and second year. Then it got very weirdly sexual and Harry became cringemaster-edgelord supreme simply because he had access to the internet and the author didn't seem to notice how stupid that was.

There was an author note I read at the end of the first year part that said Harry was unlikeable on purpose and that was going to change, but clearly the author's idea of "likeable" and mine are polar opposites because Harry was more likeable then. I really toned down how uncomfortable I found the scenes I described because I didn't want to be too quick to judge the author or anything, but yeah, fuck that guy.


** No. The amount of sex in the story increases over time until the author forgets they were telling a story and just turns the whole thing into an uninterrupted wall of smut, with the occasional bit of plot thrown in.

Dude, i wasted hours on my life on that fic..I really just finished to see where the guy went and I can tell you: it was not good. NOT good. Harry is just a racist, big dick jerk who goes on to fuck even the plants in his island. He ends up having to return to his island because his son has not a dick as large enough as his and Harry has the responsability of fucking all the life on that island, animal, vegetal and whatever.

He grows bored with his life as a ruler so he starts travelling. Then he grows bored with travelling and goes back to his island states or whatever. Then some bullshit excuse happens to end the story and kick him and his little harem into an ASoIaF universe. So I wouldn't say your description is entirely accurate. He goes back and fucks one of his past fuckmates because that's how porn logic works, not because he "has the responsibility" to do anything.

**** Harry has a problem with imigrants coming out of places like Africa and Middle East; he blames all muslims for Sirius dying in a sort of insurrection when they are visiting Egypt; he goes on to say that he wants/plans for the peoples in Middle East to kill each other and refers to them as savages etc. Keep in mind that he wants a whole section of the world to be wiped out because they are poor savages in his mind. The author admits to being racist and islamohobe and justify Harry also being because of his past experiences with muggles, even though in the fic he is never attacked by anyone of colour or of a particular religious stance( actually, in the fic, Hary does not even grow up in an abusive environment, he had problems with his adoptive parents because they are shallow, but hey, they are white and rich, so the author just let them slip out of the fic) he only notices during the fic how those people should not be allowed to immigrate to Europe because they are not worthy and wants borders to be closed.

Eventually his solution is to create his own island, where he go on to fuck any and each living being who happens to appear female ...he also mind rapes Narcissa and the author on later chapters keeps posting this increasignly disturbing notes blaming readers who decided enough was enough, calling them names etc.

I was honestely concerned by his mental health at some point; it was very sad, as he writes very well and had a good idea, but he , by his own admission, allowed the fic to be contaminated by all the hatred and anger that he obviously and admitelly carries in his everyday life.

** All these comments made me curious so i just started reading it... and what exactly do you guys mean with well written?

quote from the first chapter: "It should be noted that Dumbledore had aquired several cognitive deficiences over the course of his long life. The two that were relevant in this situation was his certainty that he always knew best and his unwillingness to understand that people could have any other feelings aside from love for their family. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Vernon and Petunia Dursley were none too pleased at the disruptive addition to their comfortable normalcy. They knew Harry was a wizard and loathed what he represented, which easily transferred to the boy himself. Dudley, being an impressionable child, picked up on this and emulated it.

To be fair, there had been a chance for things to go better. After all, Harry was only a small child and any person who was not completely soulless would have their heart softened in the presence of an innocent baby. Perhaps he would not have been treated quite as well as Dudley and would always know that he had been an unwelcome addition to the family, but he would have been raised with more kindness than many received.

But Harry was a magical child and things happened when he got upset. Small children got upset often and that was without the added trauma of seeing their mother murdered right in front of them, even if he was too young to understand what had happened or to truly remember it."

This sounds more like an essay trying to overexplain everything and everyones motivations right from the start?? How is that considered good writing?

The thing is that he presents himself in a way you can perceive him as a moderate among "hysterical" people and this wins him a lot of positive attention.

​

I would actually have given him the benefit of the doubt, but he went and stupidily came out with the whole thing about " let´s discuss why women wearing make up on their work palce might not be a good idea" and I was out.

**** All three of them say magic is the result of working with/for demons (Jinns in Islam), which led to a massive crack down on every "magician" across the places where these faiths gained dominance. Both the Bible and the Quran (and I assume the Torah as well) sentence the practice of magic to death. Europe in the Middle Ages is a prime example of that. I always envisioned wizards as being pagans, atheists, animists, or just anything but Abrahamic, and the fact that a lot of Muggleborns entering this world were Christian/Muslim/Jewish, was imo, one of the reason why pureblood families ended up hating them.

(As a side note, Im currently writing a fanfic centered around Grindelwald's rise to power and movement, and most of the old, pureblood families are pagan, either really practicing, or just claiming pagan beliefs for cultural reasons. But I have no intention of going on anti-Abrahmic rants, its more of a background, worldbuilding thing.)

Never thought about it like that, but what an interesting point! I also always asumed wizards wouldn't be religious (love fics where they use expressions like thank Merlin etc instead thank God).

** The smut and the anti-PC protagonist / narrative are intended major themes of the story almost from the beginning. If one of these isn't why you've started reading the story, I suggest just dropping it. There is some interesting plot and idea potential besides all that, but it's not worth slogging through if these things aren't what attracted your interest in the first place.

Not only that, but in the later chapters the story also drops in quality (if we define it through the "genre" description given above) because of author tracts and protagonist / author displaying more unveiled racism, Islamophobia and Christianophobia.

So my advice:

- if you've become interested in this story because of something other than the smut and the anti-PC protagonist, then drop it;

- if you've become interested in this story because of the smut, but can't stand anti-PC (and/or racist) protags / narrators, then drop it;

- if you've become interested in this story because of the smut and are indifferent about anti-PC / racist remarks, keep reading it until either you grow bored with it or you read through the whole thing.

I do not know whether he had a valid reason or not, but it must have left a sour taste in the mouth of quite a few readers.
