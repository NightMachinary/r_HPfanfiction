The Quibbler was the most popular magazine in Britain, of course no one read it in public or else people like Malfoy would ruin them.

It's conception was a plan devised by Cornelius Fudge and his childhood friend Xenophilius Lovegood. They invented a network of codes based on imaginary creatures, and then they would use Xenophilius observational skills to notice. The Rotfang conspiracy, that was code for, ‘There's a traitor in the Ministry, he is weakening its foundation.'


** “Don't disbelieve the Lovegoods; there's Fey in their blood.”

“The name Lovecraft comes to mind.”

“Like Potter and Peverell, or Gaunt and Slytherin, some families are just not ignored.”
