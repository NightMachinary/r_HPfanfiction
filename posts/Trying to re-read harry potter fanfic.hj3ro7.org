Things that were remembered

-He creates shops in Diagon Alley that are based on muggle shops

-I think he was in either Slytherin or Ravenclaw

-I think it involves Hogwart court which controls the school where there need to be 2 members from each house


** The one story that I have read that has a Hogwarts Court and has Harry in Slytherin (don't remember about diagon alley) is called Right Side of Hell by NeoMare

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore was sure he made the right choice when he sacrificed an innocent child. Too late he understood how terrible that mistake was. Harry Potter was not what he wanted him to be, he was not what the magical world expected him to be. He was not a replica of James. Instead, he inherited more of Lily... Far too much to be convenient.
