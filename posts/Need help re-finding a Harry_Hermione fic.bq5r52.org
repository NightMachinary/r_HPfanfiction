:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I read a fic a while ago and can't find it again, the arc was that Ginny and Harry were married but had a miscarriage and Harry slept with Hermione. Hermione became pregnant but chose not to tell Harry because of him being with Ginny, she stayed at Hogwarts with Snape. Eventually Ginny decided she didn't want to try again for a baby and her and Harry split up, Harry found out about the baby and I believe they all lived happily ever after. Any ideas?


** Sounds like your standard H/Hr fic but without bashing

*** There wouldn't be any real bashing if Rowling didn't have Ginny ask about love potions in Fred and George's shop. She was actually a good listener in canon, as was Luna, as well as being sociable later on. Love potions and house-elves were two issues that really weren't given proper attention in canon.

Frankly, I think Ron was a bit poorly treated by Hermione in the later years and his insecurities are understandable. Bashing him makes for a poor way to facilitate Harry/Hermione.
