We all know that Hermione does not take failure well. So what would have happened if she felt the same after being cursed by Dolohov as well?

Surprising everyone on both sides, she ambushed and began throwing off dark curses left right and center at the death eaters during the Battle of the Astronomy tower. Caught by surprised, combined with their shock that a mudblood was throwing such powerful dark curses at them caused them to fled and temporarily abandon their mission. Everyone else looked on with a mixture of awe, surprise and shock.

Voldemort was amused.

This is just another approach to Hermione secretly turning dark but not necessarily evil and does not join Voldemort. I dunno, just a shower thought.


** 'Voldemort was amused.'

LOL. That says so much about us as a Fandom that we all universally see Voldemort in such a way.

(Canon Voldemort would be furious and murderous but totally unamused, what a party pooper)

** /So Dolohov doesn't win/ is a much better reason to learn dark arts than Dolohov has.

** "Well, it all started with my rather poor showing at the Department of Mysteries. Mind you, I think I was the only one they were actually trying to kill, but my parentage isn't something I can do anything about...^{1}

"Anyway, after I heard that despite getting me into that whole mess and getting his godfather killed, Harry was getting private lessons from Dumbledore himself, I thought that maybe I could get some guidance as well, so I asked Flitwick and Snape for some books I could read. I didn't actually expect them both to agree to regular lessons!

"I thought I had overheard something about Harry needing a bodyguard, but that's ridiculous, since Harry is so much better at Defence than me!" Hermione looked around the hallway, strewn with casualties of her assault. "He still is, right?"

--------------

^{1} --- +But seriously, folks, (re)read the DoM battle. I don't know whether it was JKR's intent or a coincidence, but Hermione was the only one who was actually targeted with deadly curses. The others were targeted with Stunners and bone-breaking hexes, but nothing irreversibly lethal. Given that the others were either pureblooded kids (whom Voldemort was willing to recruit until the very end) or Harry (whom Voldemort wanted for himself), that actually makes a lot of sense.+

*Edit:* As [[/u/Revenant14_]] pointed out in an unrelated discussion, my footnote is not correct. After the Order had arrived, Dolohov did, in all evidence, try to curse Harry with the same curse as the one he had aimed at Hermione, and Harry was able to attenuate it with a Shield Charm. I apologise to everyone who reads this for spreading misinformation.

I think that I had not checked that scene as well as I had the one that had come before it, and interpolated it in my mind. It didn't help that in the battle at the end of HBP, Snape, as he flees Hogwarts, explicitly reminds the Death Eaters that Harry was not to be attacked, because Voldemort wants him to himself. It would make more sense than not that that standing order would apply in OotP as well. (My new headcanon is that it did, but Dolohov was mad after getting hit by the Body-Bind and forgot himself, just like one of the Death Eaters in HBP.)

Anyway, I'll leave the snippet up, because it's still funny, and, also, /Hermione/ wouldn't know any of this.

*** This could actually be developed into a full fic! Well done! :D

I think Hermione was the only one to use deadly curses was because the others didn't have much of a grasp on them. She was that one combatant with all the fancy gadgets whereas the others were just standard issue soldiers.

** "turning dark"... so... becoming a more interesting character?

idk. if she doesn't go evil, makes sense to me. it's already clear in DH that she and Ron would sacrifice their lives to make sure harry has a chance.

would the best time for her to learn all this stuff be during sixth year? or maybe while they're hiding in grimmauld place in DH.

alternative timeline: hermione becomes obsessed w the unforgivable curses after cedric is thoughtlessly avada-d and her first boyf gets imperiused -- long before she is submitted to torture herself, because she is hella empathetic like that. and she aims to understand as much as she can about dark curses (which of course involves mastery of the curses themselves)
