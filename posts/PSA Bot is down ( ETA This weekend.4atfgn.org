Hey, all,

The bot went down at the worst possible time (right before I'm leaving for a flight), and I'm traveling for the next ~24 hours.

I'll fix it this weekend.

** Is it a but in the code? I'll be happy to look at the source, if it is.

If it is a server side problem, then I unfortunately cannot help.

Enjoy your trip!
