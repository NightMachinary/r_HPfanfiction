:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I remember, Harry gets sent back in time to the Founder's Era. Rowena basically becomes Harry's mother figure. Due to various actions, Harry ended up being named the first Headmaster of Hogwarts, though he didn't find out until he was returned to the present and read up on some history, and listened to some ghosts who recognized him. One line significant to Godric, Salazar(?), and Harry was 'Don't tickle a sleeping dragon'. Would anyone mind helping me find this fic?


** Ooh, when you find out, could you tell me please? It sounds interesting and I'd like to read it!

** I'm working on finding one that has:

- Time travel where Harry goes back to just before or just at the founding of Hogwarts.

- Gryffindoor and Slytherin fight a dragon nearby and Harry tells them the line you mentioned.

- Harry isn't a teacher at the school, but he is technically the first Headmaster but is only known as so after he goes back forward in time.

- He goes forward in time after Albus sends Aberforth back in time to, essentially, kidnap him.

- Harry is named in documents as Ravenclaw's heir. The castle ghosts who were his contemporaries in the past still call him Headmaster even though he's only 13 or so.

- Emancipatory legal shenanigans.

- Harry leaving Hogwarts and starting his own school, but then the Triwizard Tournament happens.

I have found linkffn(2814526), which uses the same name for Harry in the past and as Headmaster, but while the story has the same basic skeleton of the one that I'm thinking of, it is fundamentally different and has a massively different ending.

  Harry awakens transported back in time over 500 years. Hogwarts is still being built and, amid the bustle, Harry finds the warm, nurturing parental figure missing in his life, in none other than Rowena Ravenclaw. Will Harry ever go home? Will he want to?

*** Now that I think about it, I believe we may be searching for the same fic. I also vaguely remember Harry getting kidnapped back to the present. I'm not entirely sure if Aberforth was the one who kidnapped him. From my memories, I believe there was also a secret room(?), where in order to enter, Harry must recreate the events of the dragon event with the symbols of each founder on a stained glass window. I don't remember what Harry's symbol was in that entire debacle, however. Does any of this sound familiar at all?

**** Yes! The secret room and a magical (duh!) cross-temporal communication mirror so that he can still talk to Rowena at least once.

We're looking for the original "All Through the Night" but I think it's gone in favor of the "updated" version.

** Is it Amulet of Time?

linkffn(844334)

It's been ages since I read it, but it's Golden Trio plus Ginny go back to the founders era, I can't remember what the interactions are like between Rowena and Harry, but he does bang her daughter and causes a bootstrap paradox by accidentally starting the potter family in the past. There's definitely an explanation of the "Don't tickle a sleeping dragon" line.

I don't recall if I ever read all the way to when Harry get's back to Hogwarts, there are like 5 books.
