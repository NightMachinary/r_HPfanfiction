** You and everyone else.

What I don't understand is this pairing is CONSTANTLY desired. It gets requested over and over and a discussion always ensues as to why there are almost zero fics showcasing the paring, much less good ones. And it's a pairing that would be perfect for a variety of scenarios. Katie is a quidditch player so good for quidditch fics. Shes mostly a blank slate so good for OC development. What little we know about her implies she would be a good match for Harry (close enough in age, similar interests, same house, a leader in the DA).

And yet... no authors seem to want to take it on. Seems like it would be a good way to instantly have a fanbase lol. Just write a moderately decent Harry/Katie.

*** I think your response showed the problem of the character, she is like an inferior Ginny:

-They both played Quidditch, but it's Ginny who replace Harry as the seeker and brings the Cup home in books 5 and 6.

- They both have been part of the DA, but it's Ginny who follow Harry in the Deparment of Mysteries and leader become one of the 3 leader of the DA during book 7.

- The only true difference is that Katie is a completely blank state while Ginny is not. But even in canon Ginny is not present enough to have a complete idea of her and her character unlike the Trio (not to mention authors can often or change a character to bring him in the direction they want and Ginny has already been everything from saintly lover from destiny to crazy love potion giver). Ginny also has an etablished big family that brings a lot of non Oc characters for your romance.

So yeah, Katie is like a Ginny without all big scenes like the chamber of secret of the Ministry, so when a author has to choose between Katie and Ginny, why take Katie?

#+end_quote

People say this but I have never really agreed with it. The fact that there are similarities is true at its most basic form. Connection to the DA, interest in Quidditch, and so on. But that can be true with a myriad of characters. Quidditch is a team game and both it and the DA were, by in large, school-wide. The biggest difference however that can not be ignored and is why I so vehemently disagree with the above-quoted statement is something you also bring up.

Ginny is much more developed (although arguably not as developed as she should have been). Ginny also has the downside of a "set family" in the Weasleys meaning she is heavily compromised by her association with the Weasleys. If you involve Ginny, she comes with the difficulties of the Weasleys unless you figure out a way to separate her.

But I think the most important thing is an oft-overlooked thing. Ginny is boring. Ginny is normal. Ginny is canon. And Ginny is often disliked (by virtue of her poor treatment by JK in terms of development and a pairing with Harry that felt forced at best). Katie is, quite simply, not (in the context of fan fiction). Say what you want about her similarities (which are VERY minor).

**** This is a concept I never got: for some reason people think Ginny's character is 'athletic female love interest' for Harry. That doesn't even make the top three of Ginny's primary character traits.

If anything, you could argue Katie niche would be filled by Cho...

Ginny is primarily defined by the host of stereotypical love interest tropes she represents (damsel in distress, hero worship, best friend's little sister, ~ a year younger love interest, etc.)

Besides the fact they both happen to play quidditch, they have very little in common for a pairing.

I think this is the main reason why most fan fiction authors haven't shown any interest in Katie. I'd say that one of the main reasons people write and read fan fiction is to put the /characters/ they know and love into new and exciting situations. People want to see what their favorite characters would do if things were somewhat different. You can't really do that with an original character.

And then there's the fact that writing an OC is a lot harder than just borrowing what JKR has already developed. If you simply use the already well-established characters, your task as an author is already a lot easier. Dreaming up and giving life to a complex, interesting character is a rather hard thing to do. It's a heck of a lot easier just to copy what's already been done.

The biggest counter example to this would be Daphne Greengrass; however, I'd argue that she now has a very well-established fandom characterization, so she's not really an blank slate, OC anymore. But even then, there aren't a whole lot of /good/ Daphne fics out there. Because again, writing an OC is hard.

As you yourself said, your first point is somewhat countered by your second. And your argument on your second does not really work at its core because at one point Daphne was NOT established (same as Katie currently) and yet she had the popularity to become established (and no one can argue folks don't ask for Katie/Harry fics).

Perhaps its simply that Daphne is an OC Slytherin while Katie is a Gryffindor, giving Daphne just enough of a "jump start" to get the ball rolling.

Of course, by that same logic, Katie has elements that should have helped her get a "jump start" as well, the most notable being that she was a slightly older girl on the quidditch team and could have very easily slotted into "mentor" style Qudditch fics, whether romance oriented or not.

It's interesting to ponder...

Also one more note. There are a decent number of good Daphne fics out there in my view. More than people realize I think. The problem is, they are often in genre's that get bad raps, such as marriage contract fics, or darker Harry fics, which, while popular in their own right, are often frowned upon or disregarded by large chunks of the fanfiction community who prefer characterizations that still stay somewhat closer to the "mainstream" if you will.

** I am in the Process of writing two different Katie/Harry Fics. One of them is kinda lost atm, but the other is just starting. I Really came to enjoy this pairing and alot of what is said above is why.

Katie is at her core an Athletic, Loyal and A good person. She has almost no history behind her which for me as a writer is a great thing. I like to have my freedom to create my own ideas. While I don't want to create an entire world I do like baselines.

There are so many ways you could take a Harry/Katie story. The obvious revolve around Quidditch, which is a great way to incorporate Action seamlessly into a romance or adventure story. Depending on when you decide to set your story, you have a lot of options for developing the characters first into slightly different versions of themselves.
