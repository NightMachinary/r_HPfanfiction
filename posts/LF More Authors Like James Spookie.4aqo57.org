I've pretty much read all of James Spookie's fics and almost all of robst's and Jeconnais' as well. Are there any other authors like that out there that you guys could recommend for me. I like these three (even though some of there stories are very cliche) because they both have multiple, long, well written, completed fics. I also like how a lot of there stories have a main feature on romance as well as a good plot (usually). I don't care if the authors write only one pairing or a variety. I myself pretty much like all parings but am not interested in slash.


** Just to clarify - you're looking for authors who have written exactly one plot line and just repacked it 10+ times?

*** Not really... more just authors who have written several long completed fics. They tend to know what they are doing at that point. Some people may feel that its all the same plot line (I know a lot of people don't like robst on this sub) but if I like an authors style I want to read more of them... even if it is similar. I'm just looking for good author recomendations that when I look at their profiles I'll have a large selection of completed stories to choose from.

**** Id recommend a TL;DR then, I didnt read through that and assumed you wanted an author that did the same pairing 10x as well.

I don't know how well-written you'd call these, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/769110/chem-prof][chem prof]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2918348/Stanrick][Stanrick]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2659698/Witherwings01][witherwings01]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1082315/broomstick-flyer][broomstick_flyer]] all tend to have long, completed stories that often focus on romance. I hope you find one that suits your needs.

** I quite like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318940/GrandeVanillaSkimLatte][GrandeVanillaSkimLatte]], who has many different stories featuring Hermione with various male characters. Mostly lengthy one-shots though. My favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4556057/1/Accepting-Defeat][Accepting Defeat]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/816609/provocative-envy][Provocative Envy]] writes emotions beautifully. She only has a few multi-length stories, but I recommend all of them honestly. My two favorite:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10402749/1/War-Paint][War Paint]]- Diary!Tom Riddle/Hermione- Focuses mainly on the slow forming romance between them.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8618289/1/Nightmare][Nightmare]]- Young!Tom Riddle/Hermione- This is heavy on plot /and/ emotions and does both perfectly.

I've read this until [[/spoiler][the retarded pregnancy. In which universe would Hermione be dumb enough to forget about contraception? How is she not just a witless bimbo in this fic?]]

**** Thanks for the warning. At this point, I want to see a fic where that happens, and Hermione shrugs, casts [[/spoiler][an Abortion Charm]], and goes to have lunch.
