No fanfictions, especially HP fanfics, will ever top My Immortal by Tara Gilespie. It;s our peak. A creative cultural commentary, a time capsule of the 2000's, and so good it inspired J.K Rowling to write Cursed Child with a very similar plot (I think MI is better though I do like CC way more than most people do)


** Not going to lie, if you wanted to sell this fic, prob should not have said it inspired Cursed Child. Automatically makes me biased against it üò¨

*** I figured everybody knows about My Immortal it's the most popular/ infamous fanfic of all time so I didn't bother trying to sell it

**** Is it still around? I haven't heard of it until now. Of course, I also don't read a lot of ships/tropes (just like everyone else, I suppose!).

***** It was deleted over a decade ago but it's always being re-uploaded and is archived and there are many dramatic readings and snakes of it

*** A glowing review of the most infamous fanfic of all time is obviously sarcastic

**** True. But I have had falls off of my snowboard that were more enjoyable than CC.
