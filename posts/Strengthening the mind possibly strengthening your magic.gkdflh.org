I once again came across the usual unlocking the mind can cause humans to unlock crazy abilities. Then I asked myself the question of 'can mastering Legilimency/ Occlumency make you a better witch/wizard?' Voldemort, who I believe liked to drive people mad by putting images in their head, and Dumbledore come to mind as great examples, as does Snape.

I also thought that mastering Occlumency, that I believe helps controls your emotions, can help with magic casting as well? I'd also imagine that being a master at Legilimency not only is helpful to view thoughts, but also let's you read a crowd/ situation/ atmosphere of the room, better.

Flaring this as a discussion to get more input, but also would take fanfics that delve into this more.

Thanks!


** I'm a strong believer in the idea that mind arts are one of the quickest routes to power in the Potterverse. While I don't ascribe to the idea that learning Occlumency turns your mind into a computer, I would say that it allows a wizard to separate his thinking from his emotions, which would make concentration easier.\\
On the flip side, knowing and using Legilimency would be an effective shortcut when trying to learn something from someone else, as their mental imagery would support and inform the words that they say. I'd even go so far as to say Legilimency makes learning languages tremendously easier.

** While I don't think they would make one extremely powerful on their own, Occlumency, at least, helps in a big way.

John Dawlish. He's confunded really well in DH. So much so they he feels it and it's noticeable at least six months later. He goes from a talented Auror to one that can be taken down by an old lady who failed her charms exam.

Tonks reverts to her base form in HBP due to negative emotions.

In GoF Harry struggles with the Summoning Charm because he's afraid he's going to die. The line goes something like "it was as if he had a block placed on him."

So, yes, an organized mind plays an important role.

** Personally, I feel 'strengthening magic' isn't as accurate as saying 'harnessing it's full potential'.

It is alluded that some wizards and witches have a greater concentration of magic than other, and although magical cores are a bit too video-game like in nature to be taken seriously, magical power levels seem to vary from person to person.

While fanfics like to toss around the word intent - seriously, it's overuse is annoying - there is canon proof that determination, concentration will-power and belief have a significant role in casting a spell successfully.

  “That doesn't matter,” said Hermione firmly “Just as long as you're concentrating really, really hard on it, it'll come. Harry, we'd better get some sleep... you're going to need it.”

Harry's Patronus and Neville's improved performances also indicate that faith in your own abilities play a major role.

Occlumency, as far as we can see, not only protects the mind, but also 'enhances' it. Snape and Dumbledore both show signs of eidetic memory, and so does McGonagall. While she isn't stated to be an Occlumens, she is said to have quite a good control over her emotions. From Snape's lessons, that is definitely one of the signs of being an Occlumens.

In any case, an Occlumens is more likely to have a much more determined, driven mind, given the amount of patience and will-power it is necessary to become sufficiently good at the art, or even have an affinity for it. Also, a fine control over one's own mind will help the caster to better focus on the spell, and better concentration yields better results.

This leads us to believe that both the process of learning Occlumency as well as mastery (to a degree) play a role in increased magical ability.

In addition to this, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape and Bellatrix are some of the best magicals in the books, and all of them are accomplished in Occlumency.

** Based on what little we see, Occlumency training is painful and stressful, and I think that that is its inherent feature: what a Legilimens can put into someone's head is limited only by their own imagination and personal squeamishness, so an Occlumency instructor has to be at least as bad to be effective. The best possible Occlumency instructor may be a highly intelligent psychopath or sadist who is on your side. This sort of treatment can't not affect someone.

The sort of dissociation needed to actually defend against a ruthless Legilimens whom one cannot escape may be a form of controlled schizophrenia. Trying to trick one may even require forming dissociated identities.

People---even people with secrets---are not exactly lining up to learn Occlumency. It's telling that none of the Occlumenses we see are exemplars of mental health.

I can even imagine Occlumency making someone better at some magics but worse than others, such as the Patronus Charm.
