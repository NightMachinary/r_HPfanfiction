I know it sounds pretty stupid. Of course all of you read! You're here, after all.

But im talking about actual physical books. Its pretty hard to admit, but a lot of fanfiction is mired in bad habits. Be it tropes, bad dialogue, or just getting used to terrible punctuation--these aren't qualities you should strive for.

Go through some real, published novels, and don't just read them--use them as a learning experience. When reading a Stephen King novel, notice how he describes the surroundings (I recommend 11/22/63 as a masterpiece), and how he masters dialogue in the most realistic, but still captivating way.

If you want to write horror, read King, Sci-Fi--Asiimov, High Fantasy--Tolkein, etc.

Reading these books will help you het over bad habits, and let you learn from masters of the craft, without ever having to meet them.

Hopefully this helps at least one person out!


** I completely agree... having recently read a lot of fanfic, I purchased and read a book that's on the nyt bestseller list and was blown away by its quality. And to be clear, it's a book very typical for the genre - crime/thriller, well done, but simply put a standard book that won't be remarkable in a couple years.

By consuming a lot of fanfic, I've become blunted to a lot of things that are carefully crafted and honed in traditionally published fic, just because most fanfic writers don't have editors, rounds of drafts and other aspects of literary and writing support. I encourage returning to published books from time to time. It also freshens my connection to the hp universe because it's never far from my mind and I make connections between the book and the hp world. Like a wee palate cleanser.

Reading books helps me return to writing fanfic with brighter, clearer and more inspired eyes. 10/10, would recommend.

*** On the flip side, I've read published books which would have been torn apart here. Each scene a separate chapter, consequently no transitions and no chapters longer than 1k words. Or another one where each character reacted basically like a trope-y caricatures of themselves, always having the same predicable reaction which consisted of one emotion.

Even good novels have their weaknesses. For example Clancy can write astoundingly good story arcs, many of which actually came to be (wg Annexation of the Crimea, 9/11's Flight 93, ISIS, Ebola pandemics), but his characters are rather one-dimensional and his romance arcs are very basic.

** I feel like this is really important for people who write fic based on visual media like anime and tv shows. There's just such a huge difference between how a story plays out on screen and how it plays out in written form, and I think there's a difference between trying to transcribe what you see visually in your head, and knowing how to write something that creates a strong visual for your readers. Pacing is a huge one here. Quick action, long pauses, slow, gentle interactions... these are conveyed so differently in visual media vs written media.

There are some amazing fics out there, and it's not a bad thing to admire other fic writers and take inspiration from their writing! But I think it's also important to mix polished, professional work into your reading to learn from people who really know what they're doing and have a team of editors who've helped them refine their work. It'll also help to read professional advice on writing to get a better idea of what you should be looking for while reading.

** And read old books as well (romance writer who doesn't know her Pride and Prejudice or Jane Eyere should not publish). And learn from them how to be brief ... over ninety percent of all fanfiction stories (in my experience) could and should be cut in half without loosing any content and with significant improvements in quality. E.g., [[https://journal.neilgaiman.com/2007/07/twelve-thousand-words-to-go.html]] “Stardust was 50,000 words. Coraline was 30,000 words.” Do you write better than him? Do you want to waste your readers' time by making them read useless words?

*** Such good points. Editing is a whole new skill that is certainly not done with a lot of fanfics. It's a skill in its own, and often doesn't feel good as a writer to do, and if writers are uploading as they write - as I have for all my fics so far - you get a sort of unedited, looser result at the end. Reading something that has been comprehensively edited is a whole new experience. When you open up Deathly Hallows, that book is tiiiight. So much is happening so quickly, the details are rich and serve multiple purposes. On the other hand, some fanfics I can fly through and skim because not a lot is actually occurring - no conflict, no action, no changes or dialogue with purpose.

To develop my editing skills I'm writing my WIP in its entirety, but wow. It is far more solitary and not as immediately rewarding, especially with no beta. Part of the journey of becoming a good writer I think. But it's made me realise that fanfic writing does reward word count and frequent uploads with reader affirmation, and also made me realise I rely on that for motivation more than I had realised or would like.

**** That's the question: do you want to write well, or do you want to chat with your readers? For the first you just cannot write serialized novels, even the best writers who did (e.g., Alexander Dumas, Arthur Conan Doyle) made horrible mistakes. Not only in continuity ([[https://simanaitissays.com/2017/01/24/watsons-war-wound/][where was John Watson wounded in the Afghan war?]]), but also in filling up with hot air when they cannot manage to write good stuff (and yes, Grimaud should be either cut out or significantly rewritten).

For the first one, well, “Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.” (Michael Crichton, alluding to Steele MacKaye (1889) article where he said this about theatre plays).

***** I'm super new to this game and I didn't realise how motivating I found reader engagement until the end of my first fic when it was important for me and I was looking forward to it. It's been a bit of a swivel trying to ground my motivation as something more internal like seeking to become a better fiction writer, especially because I found that the quality of my writing wasn't stronger when I was looking forward to feedback - but my overall motivation was far higher. Still something I'm learning, and it's a skill on its own. Motivation is fickle and I think if I don't find it as fun, I might find a happy between point between editing a full work and uploading chapter by chapter.

*** Mmm can't say I'm a fan of the second half. As a reader who loves long fics, I can't say authors who write long fics are wasting readers' time or think they're better than professional authors who write less. Story length isn't an indicator of quality... different stories require different word counts to be told, and I think implying authors should be so concerned with their overall word count will just cause unnecessary worry. There are definitely people who meander in their writing, but they can just as easily do so in a 20k fic as they can in an 80k fic.

There's different levels of unnecessary writing. On a more macro scale, are you including arcs and plot points that don't contribute to the story as a whole? On a smaller scale, are there scenes that add nothing to the story? On a smaller scale, are you over-describing things? And on an even smaller scale, are you sentences themselves fluffed up with unnecessary words that make them more difficult to read?

Making sure your story is readable, on topic, and conveys the information your readers need to know without getting lost in the things they don't is far more important to focus on than some arbitrary word count.

***** I'm actually firmly in the camp now of honing my ability to edit, personally, but I kind of wonder if there's room for people that write super long fics, even tho they could be cut down. Some readers just wanna spend some time in the hp universe, like spending time in a garden. They like long meandering fics, and you see it all the time - requests for large fics on specific topics. I've never been a fan of those works, but it's super common for a request, and a lot of people writing fic aren't trying to be good authors. They're just chillin with their faves haha. We're all here for different reasons I suppose, I kind of like that though.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

*** I'm sorry I just can't get over someone saying to learn from Jane Eyre to be brief. That book is nearly 600 pages long, with 38 chapters, and literally nothing happens until what the last...100-150 pages? The first 75% of that book is just “oh no I'm an orphan my friends have all DIED”.

While I agree some fics drag on, Jane Eyre is around 185,000 words. It's certainly not brief at all.

**** Well, yes, it is not Stardust-level brief, but I have mentioned Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre intentionally, because I don't require the action-films style action, but that for the romance-style novel you need different style of action. And perhaps Jane Eyre can be cut a bit, but I do believe that generally its pacing is not that wrong. You need some space to develop how horrible her growing up was and how truly abused she was (BTW, a way worse than Harry, I would say ... but that's perhaps just a different style of abuse). You need a bit of space (just a bit, that's all Bronte gives you) to make her into at least reasonably functional adult, and then you need a lot of time to develop some romantic feelings. She really doesn't fall in love with him the first second she enters Thornfield Hall (which BTW all adaptions screwed up), but their relationship develops in time. Actually, I believe her escape from the wedding has been too rushed, so the Yorkshire meadows took feeling of the Northern Siberia (the author should take a bit more time to destroy her from the well-functioning governess into a real social case). Then again, you need some time to get her rise up from the downtrodden social case into more or less self-respecting teacher and you need some time for even a possibility of some feelings between her and St. John to develop.

Now, I really don't think that Jane Eyre is crazily long. Yes, there are some classical romance novels which are too long (save the ball scene and whole second part of Emma by Jane Austen can go without changing anything, that's like one-third of the novel), but I don't think Jane Eyre is that long.

My main point for including Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice was just to stop objections that “romance novels just have less action”. That is not action I care about, but the plot development, and how every sentence has to be necessary to carry that plot. See how much more complicated structure of Jane Eyre is comparing with “Grow Young with Me” (using specifically that, because it is considered by many as one of the best fanfiction stories of all).

In Grown Young with Me the structure is really simple: boy meets girl, they take some time to know each other, and they fall in love. End of story. All hardships (Abby's relationship with her father, Harry's getting over loss of Ginny) are just talked about, not lived through (compare Jane's childhood and growing up), and in Jane Eyre the heroine must get up from zero to one hundred twice (once childhood, once with Rivers), plus there is really no social distance to overcome between Abby and Harry, comparing to huge chasm which needs Jane to overcome to fall for the lord.

*** I'd like to point out that of the three books in the Lord of The Rings Trilogy, the SMALLEST has more than 130,000 words.

The number of words you have is ENTIRELY irrelevant. It is what you are DOING with the words that matter.

Edit: What's more, harry potter itself has 76,000 (not exact numbers) as its minimum word count, that belonging to The Philosophers Stone.

If every book in the series had been written with the same number of words, but kept the same total, each book would have more than 150,000 words

** I'm gonna add a counterpoint: nah, you don't need to.

Sure, if you dream of becoming a NYT bestselling author, read NYT bestsellers and classics to understand how to write one of them.

But if you just want to write fanfic, feel free to just read fanfic. Yes, you probably won't produce the greatest literature ever. But if your readers wanted the greatest literature ever, they would read one of the many polished + edited books. Libraries exist, you can get the greatest books for free!

Instead, it is perhaps even more important to learn what the strengths of fanfiction are - faniliar characters, a familiar world, and iteration on canon. There is a reason that a lot of the most popular fanfiction is "canon, but with a cooler harry." Be it peggy sue, or a simple branch in canon.

In the end a lot of advice for books is that you (essentially) need to make it stressful: every chapter needs to advance the book, there need to be clearly communicated stakes, the reader needs to be kept on their toes the whole time! Kill the mentor!

But that just isn't the case for a lot of fanfic, because readers (and writers) don't want it. And that's totally cool.

I have enough stress in my job, I don't need to feel sad about a murder victim in a thriller. I just want to see Albus and Harry hang out, have fun, and destroy Horcruxes.

If you want to read or write "Harry Potter is raised by competent adults" that's neat! You could never ever sell that to a publisher, but that doesn't make it worthless. In fanfiction, not some arbitrary publishers decide what's good and what's bad, your readers do. And you write for them, and they write for you. You can learn from that.

** Whilst this is a good point, please don't think that published authors are perfect or without their sins. Especially the supposed "masters" of a genre.

90% of people I've met who've read Lord of the Rings and enjoyed it also felt that large stretches of it were incredibly boring and the books could have been about half the length without losing any actual plot.

Most people who read Asimov for the first time today find his work boring. It might have been the height of sci fi at its time, but these days it largely doesn't stand up to modern tastes.

Its important for aspiring authors to read a wide range of styles and voices, because you need to find your own voice. Its very rare for a book to be successfully published if it copies the style and voice of another author. Find your own. Use fanfic to practice different voices, different styles. Try imitating lots of different famous authors if you want, and see what you like about various approaches. Then compile your own approach from there.
