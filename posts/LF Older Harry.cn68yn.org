Any fics with a Harry that is older, where he has a different friend group. I enjoy longer stories. If a lot of suggestions are given I'll be sure to gild my favorite so far after a few chapters! Cheers!


** Harry Potter and the Veela by Z-bond is good but unfortunately it is abandoned

** There's this one, it's been great so far and the author regularly updates. He's two years older.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

**** This is a good one the wait for the HP DG pairing gets a little out of hand near the end of what's currently posted(chapt 18) but it has a lot of promise.

** Newcomb's what you leave behind is the standard slightly older Harry, fic. Great but incomplete. Best friends are Cho and Cedric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind]])

Thunderstorm is a fic where Harry is in Percy's year. It's a fic where he starts a relationship with Fem!Diary Riddle. Complete. Has a cordial, but distant friendship with Hermione due to the age difference.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm]])

Harry Potter and Hogwarts U. Hogwarts begins at age 18. Incomplete. I really liked how the author wrote the relationship dynamics between Hermione and her parents as well as some of the implications suggested of being muggleborn. Though Harry and Hermione are friends, they've only just met and it's a group of muggleborns who hang out with Harry rather than the trio.

edit: included some friendship groups

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  What if Hogwarts had to wait to start till student's were 18 when their magical cores matured? With magicals going to the Saint Schools for primary/secondary, they have a big lead on the Muggleborn in everything but magic. Follow Harry as he leaves Stonewall behind to enter into Magic where the rules seems stacked against the Muggleborn/raised. AU with alternative sortings. Harry/?
