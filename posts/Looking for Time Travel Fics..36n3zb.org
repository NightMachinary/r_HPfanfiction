I've read and liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Future Past]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]]. I was hoping for something with Harry being the one to go back, when he was still relatively young. Doesn't have to be going back to when he's 11 either. But really anything, I've just gotten in the mood for going back in time.

** If you're not averse to slash, Minisinoo's Aorist Subjunctive series starts as a time travel fic and the sequels are Cedric lives fics. Incomplete series of novellas but still worth a read. Min's an excellent writer in general: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/106720/Minisinoo]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]] by Newcomb/Lane Anasazi. Basically, a Harry sent back in time to the Graveyard in GoF, but done by malevolent beings who soul-spliced him with some of the evilest wizards of all time. So we have a super!Harry running around with malevolent voices influencing him. Just starting up, but looks to be awesome (and was updated yesterday at DLP).

I've read Stages of Hope, alt dimension not time. I don't think I completed it and not sure if I just got distracted or if I didn't like it enough to bother.

I'll give Unforgiving Minute a shot since I've seen it rec'd a few times now.

Read To Shape and Change. It was a good change from the usual stuff. No weird old as balls Harry in love with pre-teens/early teens.

******** You could also give 'A slytherin at war' a try. The peggy sue is Draco, who only knows that his side lost the war last time, not really the details of why Harry won. He tries to join the winning team this go round, but it takes some doing and a lot of facepalming and gritting his teeth around Ron.

******** I really second Messing with Time, I hope to God the author doesn't abandon it, or at least that they write a lot more of it until they abandon it. It's really great, funny enough (to me anyway) that it's almost a crack fic, but with enough plot to be going on with.

** Couple days old post but I'd like to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est La Vie]].

It is incredibly well written, but it is incomplete. Abandoned I think, it hasn't updated in a very long time. Harry won the war, but is miserable and spends all his time drinking. 'Fate' allows him a second chance at life for being fucked around so much, and as a reward for snapping the Elder Wand and getting rid of that master-of-death thing. He goes to an alternate world were Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Lily and James are still alive, and Harry Potter is a massive asshole.

** I'm not good enough of a writer to actually write the story. I was thinking something along the lines of when he dies goes back from the clean Kings Cross when he's 17 he ends up waking up as his 14 year old self. Something were the age difference wouldn't make it weird, and doesn't make him out of place. I remember reading a story where something similar happened but I think he went back to an 11 year old.

I just don't want Cedric to die.

*** There are a bunch where he goes back to 11... the only one that I can recall where he goes back to the middle of his Hogwarts years is Temporal Beacon. which has him and Hermione resetting to [the end of 3rd year? so 13 /almost/ 14] upon Death, but it drifts from canon quite a bit even on the 'first' pass.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4165301/1/Time_Mr_Potter][Time, Mr Potter?]] has him wake up 12 instead of 10-11 but I honestly cant remember which peggy sue fic it is to say anything more... I've read a bunch lately and they all bled together.
