Haven't read them myself, but a lot of people seem to recommend the ones at the top, or they wouldn't have left kudos.

You can also hit "Edit your search" and sort by bookmark count.

Btw, you posted this 3 times.

*** Searching by kudos/favorites has never worked for me in finding anything decent. I looked at the list you linked and granted I did not look too closely at most of these stories but the ones I have looked at have all been not interesting and not what I would call good writing. I really don't understand why most of those stories are so popular. There are also way too many crossovers and strange one shots.

Looking through recommended fic lists on this subreddit and even browsing favorite stories of the authors that I like has given me way better stories than stuff I found by searching through stories ranked by kudos/favorites.

As for good short fics, I enjoyed linkffn(I Know Not, And Cannot Know, Yet I Live and I Love) and linkffn(Cauterize)

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  They were happy. They were whole. They should have known it was too good to be true. It began with a murder of one, and it culminated in the rise of one of the most notorious serial killers to walk the streets of England since Jack the Ripper was at large. To think, though, that it all began with a bitter heart, a bottle of bourbon, and a very, very sharp knife. [Murder Mystery]
