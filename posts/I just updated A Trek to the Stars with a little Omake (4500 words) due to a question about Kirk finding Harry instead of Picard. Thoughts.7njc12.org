  Confused:Must be a AU Trek universe, as the Galaxy class (Enterprise-D)was supposed to be the first ship class with saucer section separation.
#+end_quote

In Star Trek Beyond separating the saucer is a plot point due to saucer trying to draw on power from the no longer connected engineering section.

  /someone asked how it would be different if Harry had been discovered in the jj/kelvinverse by Kirk and friends. He was discovered in the AU just eighty years later./

From Memory Alpha

#+begin_quote
  During the 23rd century, hull segment separations were dangerous, last-resort maneuvers, used in the event of a catastrophic emergency. (TOS: "The Apple")

  By the 24th century, separations were designed to be more routine, with some classes being designed with reconnection abilities.
