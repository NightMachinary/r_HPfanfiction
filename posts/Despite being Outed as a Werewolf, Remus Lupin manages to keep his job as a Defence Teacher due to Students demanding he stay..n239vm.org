Lupin was such a good Teacher, even after Snape leaked his secret over three quarters of the school population wrote to the board of governors not asking him to be sacked but for them to prevent him from leaving.


** Except Remus literally attacked three students while forgetting his super important potion like an idiot.

I'm not sure you can afford to make mistakes like that and still be trusted around kids. I'm sure a ton of his fans would have wanted Lockhart back too but popularity isn't a good gauge for professorhood.

***** He forgot about his potion, but then Snape also left the potion after seeing on the map that Lupin was following students. It's definitely largely Lupin's fault, but in no way, shape or form is Snape entirely innocent in this.

******* Hard disagree. If Snapw has a means to stop it that he can carry with him and he does not do it then he is just as culpable. This isn't effecting just Lupin or I would agree that it isn't necessarily his fault. It would still make him a dick.

Considering that, if he doesn't, he's leaving students at risk of being *attacked by a werewolf*, then, as a teacher and a head of house, he's responsible for the welfare of the students. Considering that, as the Potions Master, he was responsible for making and delivering the potion, he's responsible for making sure it gets to *the werewolf*. It's not like it's just some basic medication, it's required to keep Lupin's sanity and *not turn into a rabid, man-eating monster*. In fact, we know he does this!

The excerpt below is from Prisoner of Azkaban, from the original UK edition (I doubt this is particularly changed in later edits, though).

Pg 262 - Snape goes to Lupin's office with the potion he hadn't drank, *and fucking leaves it there*:

#+begin_quote
  "You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?" he [Snape] said, his eyes glitter. "I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your Potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. [...]"

** I wish! Imagine, everyone in the Great Hall sticks up for Remus, using the cliche where they all say they're werewolves too.

As Remus turns toward the Great Hall exit in disgrace, a single voice speaks out.

"I'm going have to leave too, because I'm a werewolf."

Ron and Hermione rise up and follow Harry in suit.

"So are we!"

/(So am I! And me! Yeah, me too!")/

Remus beams as everyone in the Great Hall erupts in applause, before quickly brushing a tear off his face.
