:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I came across someone looking for a fic and thought maybe someone here could help:

I remember reading a story about Goblins helping Harry. I also remember that Harry saw Hermione sitting alone and went to talk to her.  She was told to wait for someone to come help her.  They find out Dumbledore would take books out of the library and accuses muggleborns of taking them.  It seems he didn't want some of them at Hogwarts.

Harry and Hermione become friends and help each other.


** Was it this one? [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow]]

I hope you find it.

*** I don't think so, I remember Harry Crow and she was being laughed at trying to get her trunk onto the train when they met. Thanks though
