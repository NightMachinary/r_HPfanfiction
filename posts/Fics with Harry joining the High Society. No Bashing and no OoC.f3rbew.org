I wonder if thats possible, but i can imagine it. So, im interested in Fics that have Harry "acknowledging" his Money and use it to have a better life. Well, he lets his money do the Work, so he just acts as some sort of Admnistrator that ensures that his Money gets into the right hands.

â€‹

All this, without him or other characters driting into OoC and without Bashing. Potential smut though. So Harry might enjoy also the carnal pleasures.

Its ok if he has a Partner or is married, but i would like him to be single.

I already know a couple of Fics, but these have Bashing in it.

Harry is actively working on empowering his own name and his status as the Boy-Who-Lived. Not only by showing strength and skill, that he is a promising youngster and a leader of his generation - but by also making alliances with strong families with marriage contracts.\\
He realizes that he needs more than just magical power to realistically beat Voldy, so he starts learning about traditions, customs, how to behave in front of important people. How to use his name... etc.

PS: The first task in this story is truly epic!

** I can't imagine Harry joining 'High society' and it not being OOC. I mean all his friends are very specifically /not/ higher class, ergo for him to actually become High society would be OOC by definition. Like asking for a light Harry who also murders and tortures everyone, it's just mutually exclusive.

** The only ones I remember for this are Novacaine, which has him basically using his money to become a Rockefeller type and rebuild the Wizarding World post-War; that one with the secret society in the Sun Chamber I can't remember the name of; Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, which has him time-travelling and becoming an enigmatic Lord and investing money and home-ownership and such (still have no idea if I actually like this fic or not); Charon/Passageways which both have him adopting himself into an older House with estates and serfs and a village to look after; and that's about it.

I don't know if we can link to Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, what with the grooming paedophilia and all, but it's easy to find and the rest are below. They're interesting enough, but there's nothing utterly spectacular I'd rave about to recommend to you. Hopefully others know more examples than I do.
