Details: Harry is a fraud - he sucks at magic but is extremely adept at pretending to be good, and at manipulation. Written like an expos√© when Harry decides to bare all. He has a rivalry with Lockhart who is also a fraud. Hogwarts starts when students are 16.

Does anybody remember this fic? I remember it was hilarious, and pretty popular. A quick google search didn't turn it up so here I am asking you guys.

Not the one you're looking for, but definitely worth a read.

*** Yeah I just thought of it.. it was pretty good wasn't it. One of the most irreverent takes on hp, addressing the plot holes of jkr pretty well.

Here's hoping someone else remembers it!
