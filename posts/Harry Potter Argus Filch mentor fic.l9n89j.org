:END:
This is driving me bonkers. There is a fic where Harry gets into art. Eventually he decides he wants to be an artist. By chance he finds that Filch is actually a highly skilled art restorer. Harry asks him for help/knowledge.

Going on separately, McGonagall is headmistress, and she finds out that there is a lot of money available to the school, but it is tied up in obscure grants for classes like blood magic and (/gasp/) art classes! She finds out that Filch is a master artist and at the end of the years she announces that he will will teach a small art class. People have to submit portfolios to him over the summer, and Harry plans to...and then I lost track of the story.

Anyone have any ideas?


** Found it, nvm. Another plot point popped into my head and that's what I needed to find it.
