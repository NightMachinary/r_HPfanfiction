It seems they were a couple at the end of DH (and yes, I do know Luna married a different man later). I'd really like to see a good fic exploring their relationship.

I've already read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6445674/4/Nothing-Wrong-with-Different]]


** AO3 has a bunch of one shots with them at Shell Cottage and here's two of them:

​

This is the only long form Dean/Luna fic I know of. It's a one of those marriage bond fluff-type fics. It says it's a series, but as it's fluff, you don't actually need to read the first in the series to understand what's happening:

  {second in the Magically Arranged Marriage series, formerly titled 'Sunlight & Moonshine: Dean and Luna's Story'} Dean Thomas and Luna Lovegood have been found to be a perfect match by the Ministry of Magic's method to find soulmates after the War. Sudden and unexpected, now the two friends must try to look at each other through rose-coloured glasses...
