Basically what it sounds like I read the Promises unbroken series but I was wondering if there are others?

Sirius centric, Id like emphasis on the friendship of the Marauders plot driven is also preferable.

For shipping im good with het slash and fem slash

But no ships with anyone from Harrys generation with anyone from the Marauders generation even if it involves time travel. No genderbending No Marauder x OC ships If it has no ships thats fine too.


** There was Faithful only He, But I'm pretty sure that was either deleted or discontinued. There's also the fic where Remus is the Headmaster of Hogwarts, and James is in a wheelchair, but I cannot for the life of me remember the name of it.
