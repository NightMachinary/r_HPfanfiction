PSA: The following is an assortment of some of the worst fic title/user name combos I have come across. It does not reflect on the actual quality of the fictions listed. Intended as good harmless fun. Comment you own worst combos if you have some (must be existing and uploaded HP fics obviously).

/\/ Sapphires Meet Emeralds* by *Dark Lord Potter Black*

/-> Commentary: I spy with my little eye.../

/\/ Gems of Black and of Green* by *SweetAngels123*

/-> Commentary: Because “Gems of Black and Green” was not bad enough./

/\/ The Great Manipulator* by *Harmonious Cannons*

/-> Commentary: “Dey see me manipulatin', dey hatin'” -Rowling when shipping H/G-/

/\/ Is it Vengeance or Justice that you seek?* by *SlytherinNinjaKnight*

/-> Commentary: When in doubt, make it a question./

/\/ Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power* by *DisobedienceWriter*

/-> Commentary: A Good Title is Useful, But Fanfic is Fanfic./

/\/ Not so innocent now, Greengrass* by *NotAWeakHarryPotter*

/-> Commentary: Why do I feel like I need a shower?/

/\/ Harry Potter, the Forgotten Son* by *The Darkest Soul*

/-> Commentary: The edge lord shall rise again!/

/\/ Best Served Cold* by *sakurademonalchemist*

/-> Commentary: A beer?/

/\/ Harry Potter and the Ministry Machinations* by *rightous malestrom*

/-> Commentary: Assuming the author meant to call themselves maelstrom. On an unrelated note, did you know that according to urban dictionary, a malestrom is an orgy of men?/

/ps: Honourable mention: Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw/ by *LeadVonE*, for one of the worst titles ever used. User name is ok though.


** I get the feeling they meant ‘Malestrom'. Would be perfectly normal, considering this is fanfiction.

**** Nope. Malestrom, according to urban dictionary is, a ‘Wild, fierce orgy consisting of males only.' Given we're firmly in the fanfiction sector, I would not put it past someone to actually want Malestrom as their username. Especially in fanfiction.

***** The exact nature and execution of a "Rightous Malestrom" (assuming the author meant "righteous") is then left to the imagination of the reader...

​

Still, joking aside, we are possibly in the presence of a person who managed to make two spelling mistakes in their own username. I mean there are people who do not use Betas or re-read themselves and then they are people who REALLY don't use Betas or re-read themselves... that's real commitment right here.

** Since The Great Manipulator was mentioned, and erroneously so, a clarification seems to be in order. We are a family account comprising of cousins and we do prefer Harmony. The mentioned story has Harry as an apprentice to Dumbledore unofficially, wrt manipulation. No pairing as yet intended. The "Cannons" comes from the fact that the other 3 are Arsenal (Barclays' Premier League/Football team) fans.
