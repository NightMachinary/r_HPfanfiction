Basically, write a fix where one of four characters, (Harry, Ginny, Ron, or Hermione), attempts to establish an ideal Wizarding World. They leave for some time, only to return and find out that their dream has become a perversion of what they really desired, just as what happened to Roboute Guilliman.


** For those that are unfamiliar with the opinion in question:

  "/Why do I still live? What more do you want from me? I gave everything I had to you, to them. Look what they've made of our dream. This bloated, rotting carcass of an empire is driven not by reason and hope but by fear, hate and ignorance. Better that we had all burned in the fires of Horus' ambition than live to see this./"

In lore, Bobby G was given a multi-millennia dirt nap after a fight with one of his evil brothers went against him. One of his allies spent the intervening time slowly building his new life support system/combat armor. After the biggest loss for his people in thousands of years (The planet broke before the people did!), said ally was rescued by a death cleric of an Eldar (Think space elves, if Galadriel was what the Rohirrim thought she was) death cult. They make it to where Roboute Guilliman is being kept in stasis to find the place under attack but eventually get him in his new life support armor, kill him and bring him back.

Here's the thing; in the 10000 years Robert Guildedface was out, he empire his dad built has moved from a liberating empire based on charisma and humanity to a massive force that is kept moving mostly by their own momentum, and dogma. The greatest resource humanity has is its own people, and they will be sacrificed by the millions without second thoughts. Where the Empire Robot Goldfitch left was atheistic, in the time he's been out, a massive religion has come about deifying his father, which was something that thousands of years prior was a criminal act.

All in all, Rowboat Girlyman is disgusted with what humanity has become, but even with all of that, they're still the best hope for humanity as a whole, so he takes over the military and begins a crusade to drive off those trying to break the Imperium.
