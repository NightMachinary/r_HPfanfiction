Basically looking for fanfics where Fawkes chooses Harry as his new companion after Dumbledore dies in book 6.


** I've read one where Dumbledore stole fawkes when he was a egg and was meant to be Harrys companion

#+begin_quote
  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.

*** That was a fun read, Harry just mostly living life on his own beach with a grill and drinks and playing mad magical scientist.
