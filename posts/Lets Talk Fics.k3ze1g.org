A lot of people dislike Prompt posts (I will admit, I am among them), and a lot of what's left is 'unpopular opinion, but I don't like Umbrage', or request threads. While I still watch the reddit, it's very rare now that I feel a need to engage with any of the discussion going on.

But what is there new to discuss, you might ask? After-all, the books are long complete, and the more recent additions have been disappointing. Well, fanfiction of course.

Now, reading clubs are a thing, but they're also effort, and for longer fics there's a real barrier to entry (usually several tens or hundreds of thousands of words).

We see the occasional big review post (usually of the big name popular stories), but they are far too few. They also don't really spread the net wide enough. In a fandom of hundreds of thousands of stories, barely more than 100 or so actually see much discussion.

What I propose, is that every now and then, we try and post a one-shot (or longer story if the mood takes you), and don't /review/ it, but instead choose one aspect from the story which you enjoyed/hated/found intriguing. Then, replies can do much the same. Try the story, even if it's the kind of thing you'd ordinarily avoid, and see if there's something there that takes your fancy.

It doesn't need to be good. It doesn't need to be deep. Just give us your thoughts.

So, as my knowledge of one-shots is sadly limited, I'll start with a popular one:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/][*Doubting Thomas*]] /by/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/654059/][/Lady Azar de Tameran/]]

So, I will admit, that I found this story remarkably bleak, and I was torn on what to think.

On the one hand, I feel that putting Voldemort forward as merely a symptom of a greater problem is smart. The fairy-tale idea that someone can be /born/ bad is, I think, something which is damaging to normalise (funnily enough, I guess this works in a story and meta context). We tend to define ourselves through our free-will, through self-awareness, and the ability to recognise a 'self' in others. This idea of personhood is fairly fundamentally opposed to the idea of a human being born evil.

Hell, even Tolkien battled with the problem of evil in his Orcs. How could beings capable of free action be unsalvageable /as an entire race/? It was a problem he was never able to resolve to his satisfaction.

So surely, we must suppose that Tom Riddle, with a different history, perhaps if he had been adopted by a kind and loving family, could have turned out different (that is not to say that circumstances cannot lead a seemingly happily-raised person from committing atrocious acts).

I appreciate that view in this story, even if the greater context is intensely depressing.

That's the other side of my feelings after finishing this story. While Tom becomes a kinder person as a result of his changed upbringing, the society itself is just so bleak, that it seems to undercut its own nuance.

Instead of a cartoonishly evil villain, we are presented with a cartoonishly evil /society/ instead, and I am not sure I like it. It feels wasted, but then this story is less than 5000 words long.

Finally, I dislike it when stories create convoluted situations where the /only/ solution is violence. Perhaps I am hopelessly naïve, but I like to think that such a status quo is very nearly impossible in our messy, complex world filled with messy, complex people. It promotes the idea that you can either do nothing, or you can get violent, and that, too, is an idea which I do not think I would like to see normalised.

​

What about you? What were your thoughts when you read this story? Or, if you have not read this story, what are your thoughts regarding /my/ thoughts? Do you disagree with some of them? Do you agree, but with addendums?

Again, the idea behind this is not to offer 'concrit' or 'review' of the story in question, but instead to simply talk about some of the ideas presented by the story, or which are brought to mind by the story.

If I see someone else make a post like this on another story, even if it's something I would ordinarily avoid, I will do my utmost to add something to the discussion. Lets see if we can't get some real discussion rolling, on a topic that isn't just our pet peeves.


** I love this idea and I hope to see more one-shot (or longfic) discussions on this sub in the future.

The main thing that strikes me about /Doubting Thomas/ isn't the themes or the characterization. It's plain old wordcraft. I think the author's prose has a way of being both lyrical and spare. For example, this passage early on:

/The world crashes down around them piece by piece. Hundreds dying here. A thousand dying in a fire there. Dozens more in little skirmishes all over the globe. Until magic has overrun Muggle, and blood runs through the streets. They always thought themselves so superior. So much better than the magicless animals that dare to call themselves human. Yet, the purebloods are among the first to fall, slaughtered by Muggle mothers and fathers still weeping over the deaths of their own children. Hermione's parents kill dozens of blood purists before they're finally taken down by Arthur Weasley. Who subsequently ends his own life rather than live with the shame./

There are so many short, terse sentences (many of them technically fragments), but there is a flow that keeps the prose from feeling repetitive. It narrows nicely from the broad (a thousand dying in a fire) to the personal (Arthur killing Hermione's parents). It sets up the premise of the fic in a way that simultaneously leaves you wanting more and leaves you appreciative of the author's ability to know when to stop.

*** Hopefully it catches on. I'd love to see more takes like yours on stories. As a writer, simply having people discuss your story for /what/ it is saying as opposed to /how/ it is being said, is a great feeling. A lot of the time, we just see discussion on the nuts-and-bolts, not on the shape and form of the end product.

To that end, I'll give my thoughts on yours:

For me, I felt the brevity /almost/ (but not quite) went too far. It was an almost by-the-numbers kind of bleakness.

You know how some Pixar movies can pluck at your heart-strings, but when you look back on them you can see how... almost cynically manipulative it was in hindsight?

So yes, it does a great job of communicating just the kind of bleak and depressing backdrop that the author wanted, and it's really a great example of expressive brevity where fanfiction often tends towards the verbose. I just can't shake the feeling as I'm reading it, that it's... manufactured for my benefit. It doesn't feel as if it's coming from a human who lived through those events, but from a writer who wants to dunk my head down the school loo of grimdark.

Though, I think in the context of a short one-shot, this is exactly what is needed. Often, subtlety has to be sacrificed if you want to achieve a specific mood in a short time.

** What a great post, a nice change from the "Voldemort chokes on a drillbit made by Vernon" prompts.

It's an interesting one-shot and premise, but I felt the story suffered from the constraints of the style of writing. These stories rely on short scenes and dramatic descriptions to evoke an effect in their readers. While this works for stories like Cauterize, with a primarily melancholic story to tell, I'm not so sure that it works for a story like this. It reads like a very dramatic outline of a story, in my opinion, and would have been better served as a short novella. The plot itself, past the style, is engaging, however, and something that I could see happening. Like you point out, however, how the sides are broken down is rather crude.

*** Sadly, it doesn't seem to have captured the subreddit's imagination.

I agree that it reads a little like a summary. I think it's a testament to the prose that despite the artificial distance introduced by the summarised format, that it can still evoke the emotional response that it does.

It could have been a really intriguing and nuanced 800k word long epic, but instead it's less than 5k words long, and it still works. That's how you know an idea worth writing, I guess.

** I would have replied earlier if I'd seen it, I think discussing one-shots is a great idea for the sub.

I think I largely agree with you on the broad strokes of the story, or at least its premise---that it replaces a cartoon villain with a cartoon society---but I think I'm probably more willing to accept stories about protagonists who turn to violence than you describe. That being said, I think the decision has to be justified by the author, and it wasn't really in this story. We're told that the society is irredeemable, and I can even accept that as a premise, but there's no attempt at any action until little Riddle decides to start his revolution. Even that could be done well, possibly by making it clear that Luna didn't do as well as she'd hoped in changing Tom's life and he still had some of his anger and arrogance from canon or possibly by showing the possible consequences of someone who grew up in wartime raising a child in their image.

Ultimately this feels like a nice premise which hasn't been fleshed out. Is it supposed to be about Luna and her parenting, or her experiences with trauma? Those aren't really explored. Is it about wizarding society, which we only see through letters from school and shopping trips? Or is it about Tom's growth, which is again left out? I think that more deliberate planning of the perspective---and, if it remains Luna, how to present her window into the world---could have led to a major improvement in this area. Even something as simple as leaning into the “letters from the child at boarding school” angle and showing Tom's writing rather than simply describing its contents would have provided many opportunities for more characterization of every party involved.

The writing is still well above-average for fanfiction, though, and it always feels a bit unfair to me to rag on these stories which authors put out into the world, so I'll say that I still enjoyed reading it and would have no qualms mentioning it to someone else looking for something in this style or with this topic. I first read it a few years ago and remembered it well enough to recognize in just a few sentences, so it's doing something right.
