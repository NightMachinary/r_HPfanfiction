I just realized that if Sirius and Harry were talking on the mirror, and someone saw them, but Harry managed to hide Sirius' face in time, then that person might think that Harry was talking to his own reflection and was very vain.


** I guess it would depend of how common these mirrors are. It could either be a banal item, only impressive because teens enchanted them, or something unique like the Marauder map.

Also dependig of the timing (5th year ) it could be another "proof " for people that Harry is crazy.

*** I think of it as something unique, like the marauder's map. What do you think of it as?

**** Well unlike the map that feel really unique, with the heros not even knowing how it works, the mirrors seem. . . simpler. It looks like it's just 2 hand mirrors chared to show what the other see. There are several places using a similar spell in the books like the roof of the Great Hall or the windows in the Ministry. It is a pretty impressive magic, especially if done by students, but its the kind of enchanting that every wizard with a NEWT in Charms should be able to do. And the only reason it's not sold in Shop is because the item is too limited (a mirror can only connect with its twin after all ).

** Is this why James was seen as vain and arrogant? Because he was talking to his mirror all the time in detention? Haha
