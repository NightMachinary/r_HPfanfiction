I'd rather have everything before Harry's fourth year be 95% canon.

I've never been into Harry/Ginny but I'm starting to slightly.


** If I may, [[http://blvnk-art.tumblr.com/tagged/potterbyblvnk][this]] changed my mind on Hinny.

I had always pictured their relationship being mostly fighting against one another rather than for one another. Many of the drawings in the link provide context and story and drabble that I dearly wish Rowling would have come up with, as I was smitten with the two after going through blvnk's anthology.

*** I love these, way too much. Someone get me Harry's coat.

For some actual thoughts, I really like that Harry's scar goes into his hairline in some of the drawings, makes it look... more mature I guess? Something just feels older about it than when it's just on his forehead.

**** I know exactly how you feel about the scar. It feels more distinguished, even if it might mar his face in a way that is unattractive. If you've not read Blindness by Silently Watches, they describe Harry rather similarly to the way Blvnk draws him. Though the story itself isn't as widely appealing as many others on here, I very much enjoy their writing.

***** Hmm I remember a fic called Blindness, but searching for it says AngelaStarCat wrote it, not Silently Watches. Do you have a link?

****** Oh, oops. I somehow managed to mix up Blindness and Black Princess Ascendant... Yes, the Blindness I am taking about was written by AngelaStarCat. My apologies for the confusion, haha.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is Year 6 from Ginny's POV and very good.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** You can check the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/69334e/harryginny_fanfic_broken_down_by_category/][fic thread]] at [[/r/HarryandGinny]], especially the "Re-Do Fics" section.

Personally, I really liked [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=128130&textsize=0&chapter=1][One Blink by Sanidad]]. Gryffindor loses to Ravenclaw in the final match in /HBP/, and the first H/G kiss does not happen. With a few differences, the fic is definitely of the "stations-of-the-canon" type.

** I personally started liking Harry/Ginny after reading the Starting Over series on AO3. It's postwar so I think it fits your canon requirements.

linkao3(1023212) This is the first one, though I liked the sequel Inner Demons more you need this one for context.

*** Oh man I loved that fic even though it had a lot of contrived plot devices and there are things that go against my preferred head canon.
