Looking for fics where Sirius is actually a Death Eater, and not falsely accused of being one.

**** I especially find it funny that after Harrymort's shenanigans, [[/spoiler][Hagrid]] also joined Voldemort, at least on the surface.

***** Agreed, that's hilarious. Even more so with Voldemort's reasoning about ... pretty much any- and everything about that stuff.

The other hilarious thing of the same kind is [[/spoiler][Draco Malfoy]] joining Hermione's dark army. You just have to wonder what kind of dysfunction Harry (and, you know, the other person) has to have for that stuff to keep happening.

** [[/spoiler][HPMOR]] has this but it's not a focus of the story and is only revealed near the end. Also, this sub doesn't really like the story much, so YMMV. It's probably not going to be the sort of thing you wanted anyway, based on your request.

*** I'm pretty sure the only reason that is the case is so that the author could just it as the punchline to a pun.

Perhaps Yudkowsky should have left that effort to Heller and Pyncheon.

**** I assume you're referring to the part in Azkaban? I thought the epilogue part that mentioned him was well done, to be honest, although I can see why you'd disagree.
