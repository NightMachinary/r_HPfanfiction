I have been seeing this happening a lot lately, and I have only one question for the people doing it, WHY? I know I can't control other people's behavior, but this seems like the cruellest type of post to downvote.

I'm trying my hardest to make this post not look like me venting, (I have seen it happen to lots of people), but the next little bit does sound that way sorry.

Most of the time when I post a "What's That Fic" post, this is my last resort. I spend hours googling and searching for the fic before I even consider posting here. So what does it feel like when you ask for help and you get the most impersonal rebuff possible? Not only does it communicate "I think you are foolish to ask that here" it also is a "I don't want other people to help you" (because it pushes the thing down the rankings). So you go to your last resort and get basically told "Because I don't like the plot of the fic you are looking for, I don't want you to enjoy it again either." Downvoting one of these posts could remove it from the view of someone who DOES know what it is.

I'd prefer a "you are stupid and the fic you are looking for is stupid" to a downvote, because at least that starts conversation. I could be looking for a fic we both hate, just because it is in the back of my mind and I can't let it go. I could be looking because a friend asked me. I could be looking so I can laugh at how bad my taste was in the past. You don't know why I want to find it again.

If someone asks for a fic you hated, post it and tell them you hated it and why. That lets others know why they might want to stay away, gives the person who's asking what they were looking for, and starts discussion on this subreddit for fanfiction discussion.

For example, someone asked for a fic that I read out of morbid curiosity, just a very weird fic.

So I broke it down.

#+begin_quote
  I'm kinda sad that I know this one, its (removed for everyone's sanity.)
#+end_quote

I let them know that I personally don't like the fic, but then I give it to them anyway. Then I let people know why I disliked it.

#+begin_quote
  This one is super weird, after the slaves and nudity dimension (fic reads like they wanted to write a smut fic, but there are no sex scenes, (and the sub plot here is freeing the slaves), so does it really have to be a nudity dimension too?) they go through a dimension where cannibalism is legal and happens all the time, and after that it randomly turns into a crossover with buffy the vampire slayer. The Hermione in every universe has a different name for some reason.
#+end_quote

I let people know that it has /very/ distasteful content so no one goes in uninformed, and that's it.

**** Do you go around and tell people eating a cheeseburger/hot dog/taco that you think they have shit taste and should eat a salad/sub/your favourite lunch instead?

When you see someone reading a newspaper, do you go up to them and tell them that they should read another newspaper instead?

Do you tell people playing Pokemon Go that they have shit taste and should play another game?

No? So why do you want to tell others that their taste in fanfiction is bad?

I'll usually remove my vote though if I do that. Unless it's an attempt at trolling. I'm too lazy to downvote.

** I totally agree! Downvotes are supposed to be used when something is off topic, not just because you don't like something, although I know that's not generally what actually happens. But seriously, if you don't know the fic and it sounds boring/bad to you, just keep scrolling! It's not that hard

** As I've stated on several previous threads about likes/dislikes: Reddit does nothing to train its users to use the feature so it usually devolves into like/dislike. And a lot of subs use it like that. The ones who don't usually go to great lengths to frame the conversation differently. If you accept votes as 'like/dislike', you'll stop worrying about it :).

​

Now even those of us who try to follow proper Reddiquite (myself included) will downvote these types of threads quite a bit. If the post isn't well formed, I downvote. For "What's That Fic" posts, that means either a shitty title, or a post missing critical information. For that last part it usually is "Does the post answer the same generic questions you would ask of all looking for fic posts". If i have a question that is particular to your post fine, but if it is missing basic information....

**** Like [[/u/jakky567][u/jakky567]] said, it's the grammar. I have an /extremely/ minor, but still present, case of OCD. Which means the spelling and grammar make me wish I was capable of Avada Kedavraing (I say it annoys me, but proceed to use a word that isn't a word) the whole population.

** I downvote "What's That Fic" posts if the post title is simply something like "What's That Fic?" or "Looking for a fic". If they provide at least some information about the fic they're looking for in the post title, I don't downvote no matter what they're looking for.
