** I'm embarrassed to say I read almost everything robst ever wrote when I first got into fanfic. It took me more than halfway through linkffn(Harry Crow) to realize that he's not that good a writer, either down at the mechanics level or up at the plot level.

I think this was a combination being new to the genre so I didn't have much to compare it to at the time, and something [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer][u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] wrote a while back, which was (paraphrasing) that robst is /really/ good at writing the first 20% of a story, but after that, it's just a slog with no credible conflict and over-the-top shipping.

Edit: I still skim linkffn(A Different Halloween) once in a while.

Yep, that's robst. His mechanical skill is passable, and the beginnings and basic plot ideas always intrigue me.

Harry raised by goblins, and already has some fighting skill? Yes, let him defy a few expectations, that's what fanfiction is for! Count me in! Damn, give him a few more powers, no problem. It's always fun to see two gods fighting...

Wait, why is no one even close to Harry's skill? He's eleven? Okay, what happend the last 100'000 words? Why did I read them? Why should I read on? Is there any conflict left?

That was basically my thought process when reading Harry Crow, and his other works. After a while I always began to wonder why I should read on. Every story needs an incentive to read on. Each Harry Potter book has it - well, actually any good book has it.\\
First it's the magic, then it's the whole philosophers stone, afterwards it's "who petrified people", next up "how and why will sirius black attack?", afterwards "Who put Harry's name in the goblet, and why did he do it?" - and so on.

But I always miss those with the stories of robst.

**** Not sure I agree on the mechanical skill part. It's subtle, but the odd turns of phrase like using "It was X who said..." as a crutch, failing at "show, don't tell", and just general purple prose become grating after you've seen how much better other fics can be.

***** Passable meaning that it isn't outright annoying. You could write a great fanfiction with his technical skill, but there had to be exceptional storyline for the story to be considered that.

For me a passable is like an "Accaptable" in Hogwarts grades, whereas most good fanfiction is at least EE, and most books are O.

** Definitely linkffn(1337064) and sequel(1525917). I read this back in 2003 and my mind was blown that Harry Potter could be made into something like this.

From the author's profile:

#+begin_quote
  Writing strange stories full of predictions, swords, magical creatures, old buildings...
#+end_quote

Looking back, the story seems like a wankfest over Snape - he's a kind of vampire that can shapeshift and basically almost as strong as Voldemort (and surprise! he's the Dark Prince, yes it's capitalized). And of course Harry also becomes a vampire.

But it's still a fun story. Although characterization is thrown out the window, the worldbuilding, pacing and general plot were done well enough to make the story stand out in my memory after fourteen years.

The original characters existed solely to give a shit about Harry and to make his life easier, which felt like such a refreshing change after the Order of the Phoenix. There were some really good moments too, some where the circumstances worked out for Harry's benefit and some where he just really was a sad kid who had enough of people's shit.

*** Ha yes, I'm guilty of enjoying a bit of bashing too. I think it's mostly because I don't really care about the characters. I read almost exclusively Hermione pared with older guys (Snape, Lucius Malfoy, Voldemort, etc.). I'm aware that it seems weird, especially Voldemort, but when I read fics I search for things far away from canon. I love fics where they are older too, student-teacher relationships mostly creep me out. My favorite fics have Hermione being 25 at least, working a job, and then stuff happens. She's more comfortable with her bossiness, which I love since she's dealing with characters with strong personalities. I hate doormat Hermione. So, anyway, in most of those fics, the author tends to keep a canon beginning and Hermione is, or has been until recently, in a relationship with Ron. Some of these fics then bash him/the Weasleys, and I kinda don't care. But yeah, never too extreme !

And I'd have loved secretly pureblood topmodel Hermione. Oh my, the possibilities... My 14 y.o self would be so jealous of the stuff I sometimes stumble upon ! Especially when searching for HG/older guys stories, IDK why but there are either very good stories, or very, very bad ones. And I would have loved the bad ones.

Recently I found one where Hermione is actually Snape's little sister, adopted at birth and under a glamour, so she's in fact taller, black straight hair, etc. Snape immediately calls her by a nickname/calls her "little sis", she lives with him and Lord Voldemort falls in love with her and they go on picnics together. I'm not kidding. WTF !

Based on the idea of "Make a Wish" but less Harry falling assbackwards into helping/saving people, it's more Harry Falls Assbackwards into a new adventure/learning experience.

Bad parts, the Author puts to much "Aww wouldn't thus be cool or funny" into the plot. Then later on shoves to much plot into the last few chapters. Also plays the "Super Harry has to have Super Friends" Card which sucks

  Secrets are discovered. Alliances are forged. Battle lines are drawn. Some friendships strengthen while others break. The war has started. A friend and a Godfather have already been taken away from him. No longer will he stand for the manipulations!
