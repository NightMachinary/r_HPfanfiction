** Wish there was a completed, >50k word-length Honks fic that does not feature Dumbles bashing, manipulative!Dumbles, Indy!Harry wank, Lords and Ladies, time travel, Gringotts wank, or Light-side bashing in general.

Like, just a normal-timeline Harry (even if in another house) not hating Dumbles and friends, and getting with Tonks will do.

** I like the pairing, but I tend to prefer fics set in the books timeline, and there really isn't all that much of a window for this to happen in that timeline, without time travel or deaging or something.

My favorite remains Grains of Sand, with follow ups by some of those "Teddy goes back in time and gets his 'parents' together".

I do think the whole "Tonks goes undercover to protect Harry in school" and gets stuck there for 3+ years in a younger body could be a very good story, I've seen a few attempts, but nothing made to my 'this is a good fic' list

** Linkffn(Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor) Though I feel the fic is more gen than romance. It focuses on the plot and the pairing is not the main focus (or the side focus really). That being said, nuanced plot. Amazing OCs. Definitely worth a read.

Other one shots by the author have the pairing as well. Tonks is written pretty well in the other one shots.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

***** I did not need to look that up, I did so long ago as research for writing (since the series is set in the UK). By my local law, 14 would be legal as long as you aren't paying for it or abusing a position of power.

  16 and pregnant
#+end_quote

That's a thing?

16 is the average age people lose their virginity here, which means that half the population has sex younger.

#+begin_quote
  shouldn't happen IRL
#+end_quote

I bet most teenagers had fantasies about a 20ish women (or even older) and wouldn't hesitate if given the chance (well, beyond the usual teenage obliviousness).

Ffs, it would have been entirely legal in Scotland for 16 yo Harry to marry Tonks, and were talking about something much less consequential.

*** This whole argument's really simple.

Is it an adult with a minor? If yes, then its wrong.

Is it two adults who happen to be of different ages (ie an adult Harry and Tonks)? Then its fine.

Its not the number of years that matters, its whether both parties are old enough to consent, and whether there is a power disparity. So can we please stop conflating the two? A twenty five year old and a thirty three year old have an eight year age gap, but no one in their right mind would treat that the same as a 24 year old and a sixteen year old, or a sixteen year old and an eight year old.
