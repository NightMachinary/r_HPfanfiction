Synopsis: /Thirteen-year-old Harry is forced into the body of another Harry in a parallel world, where Snape adopted him years ago. And Snape is enraged to discover that his son has been replaced by a stranger. In our world, Snape discovers a new Harry--one who sees him as a father he never wanted to be. Each Harry must learn to survive in a strange new world, and search for a way home./

Rec: I want to start by saying, even if you are not at all into the Severitus/GuardianSnape genre, this fic is still for you.

I recently re-read this fic for the third time, and was blown away by the fact that I am still discovering layers and nuances in this story. Malora does an unbelievable job at creating a rich, interesting, and believable alternate world while still keeping the canon world intriguing. The brilliance of the fic really shines in the characters of Snape and Harry. The alternate versions are /so/ in character, and yet they are different because of their altered experiences. One of the awesome things about this story is how you see the canon characters in a completely different light by the end of the story, even though the damaged elements of their personalities were there all along.

The other brilliance in this fic is how the author weaves the main theme of "otherness" together with the idea of memory and all it symbolizes. It is subtle but incredibly moving. This story really makes me think about what the author has to say.


** What a great story, thanks for the rec. I've just read it in one fell swoop and loved it!

** You know, normally I hate any kind of Harry/Snape shit, even in a purely familial way. I can seriously think of only one other fic that I actually liked the way Harry and Snape were written, and I consider that the best fanfiction I've ever read.

With that said, this was a real tearjerker. A really great fic, something I wasn't expecting at all.

I've been in the fandom for about 13 years on and off, it's always nice to discover a gem like this that I've missed. Sometimes it feels like I've read all the good stuff.
