So the things I can remember about the story are

- The reason snape left the memories in a Pensieve in Harry's Occlumency lessons was to make Harry think worse of james.
- Harry figures this out and beats up snape using something transfigured into something like brass knuckles.
- Harry obliviates snape with his own wand.
- I think the Department of Magical Law Enforcement thinks that snape obliviated himself because memories of his past finally got to him.

Thanks for your help.
