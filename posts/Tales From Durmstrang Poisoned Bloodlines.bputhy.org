" In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy to kill it once and for all. "

A fic I'm writing about Durmstrang that describes the school in the detail. Please check it out!

**** Right away, i can tell you know more than a tiny bit about mechanics : grammar, comma before names, etc. It's amazing how few do, really. Interesting how you made Grindelwald Swiss, it's not something you'd usually think but it's a nice twist

***** That he is a Swiss could explain why he is so damn good at English. What did you think about the story, characters etc?
