Looking for fanfictions where Harry is Voldemorts Equal and are on his side or where he willingly Join voldemort and becomes a Death Eater (He must also hate muggles but if he believes in Pureblood Supremacy/Superiority and Blood Purity it is a plus) I prefer fanfictions where they atleast have some length than lets say 15 chapers or less, Preferably 20+ Chapters and have sequels if it isn't like some fanfictions where it's a whole book that got 40+ Chapters.


** Oh I've got a really good fic for you if you have nothing against slash. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/]]) Soo good. Dark Harry, great worldbuilding, the only real drawback is that Harry is called Izar in this but it all makes sense and you get quickly used to it. Highly rec if you like Death Eater Harry

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
