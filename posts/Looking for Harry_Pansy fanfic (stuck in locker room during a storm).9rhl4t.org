Hey guys!! I've been looking for a fanfic that I read a while back and the main plot was that Harry and Pansy get stuck in the locker room during a storm ! would greatly appreciate it if someone knows about it/helps!! Thanks! :)


** *Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)*

Harry always knew the monthly budget meetings were boring, but he didn't realize just how boring until Pansy Parkinson offered to show him something a little more interesting.

*The More Your Ignore Me (The Closer I Get)*

It's been a month since Harry broke up with Pansy Parkinson, and he can't get her out of his head. Literally.

*Sunday Morning*

Harry loves these lazy Sunday mornings. Written for the fifth round of kink bingo, with the featured kink: somnophilia/sleepy sex. PWP. Adult content inside.

*Overnight Train*

Harry's travelling the continent with his personal assistant, Pansy Parkinson, on a goodwill tour for the Ministry. Things can change so easily when you're on an overnight train to Istanbul.

Edit: sorry, misread the request. I thought /you/ were stuck in a locker room and wanted Harry/Pansy fics to keep you occupied lol.
