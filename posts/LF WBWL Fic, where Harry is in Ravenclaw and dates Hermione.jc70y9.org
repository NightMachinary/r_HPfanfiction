:END:
Harry is in Ravenclaw, and they're in their upper years. Harry is hunting horcruxes, and is mostly ignored by his family. He has no friends and is bullied in school, and then he befriends Hermione. She wears a horcrux, and Harry's brother gets her to leave him.

This is about all I remember


** Unsung Hero

*** One messed up but addictive story. Wasn't it suppose to have a sequel?

**** The sequel only got 4~5 chapters and then was abandonned.

And though Daniel getting the best of Harry left a very bad taste in my mouth, the ending was just fine on its own and left the readers free to imagine what would happen next.

  This was so bloody confusing. And if he thought it was confusing... Harry stifled a laugh, imagining Voldemort's face at the random knowledge from Harry's version of the future suddenly coming to him. Snake face's reaction would certainly have been hilarious to witness.

  If only her advice came with instructions. If only he could remember who she was. Harry rubbed his temples and heaved a beleaguered sigh. Why did he always choose to be an idiot? He was a bloody Ravenclaw after all, he should be smarter than that--or at least learn from his mistakes.

  §Flat face apes,§ hissed a disgruntled voice beside him, §always trampling on the little guys.§

  Harry blinked and tilted his head. There half hidden in the grass was a tiny garden snake staring beadily at him.

  §Serion?§ Harry breathed in disbelief.

  The snake tipped its head, and said, §I do not recall meeting a speaker of the snake language before. How is it you know my name?§

  Harry pushed up on his elbow and grinned at the sight of his suspicious familiar and long time friend. §That is because I am your King.§

  The End

See? Perfect. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.

***** Fair enough. I'm glad serion came back to life. His death hurt. But the story left a bad taste for many reasons. The guy lost every single person remotely close to him for each horcrux which kinda sucked. Very bad luck brian like. Also generally hate when women are used/taken advantage of, that just doesn't sit with me. But yeah, cool story otherwise.

****** It started out well but lost its way about 3/4 of the story, and had a really disappointing ending.

*** This story has one of the worst endings in fiction. Its worse than the GoT ending.
