I'll give you what I can remember any help is appreciated

Basically someone does something to Harry so he apparates to Malfoy Manor where he speaks with the dark lord. He can break through anyone's wards even hogwarts and he go shopping (I think). Malfoy then goes on about respecting those above you but then Harry shows his heir/lord rings (potter,black,perrevel). Voldemort becomes DADA teacher and tells draco that Harry i his. He also has 1:1 lessons approved by dumbledore

Thanks
