For me it's something like a three way tie between long journey home, against the moon, and seventh horcrux.


** I would have to say they would be (in no particular order): linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure; What You Leave Behind by Newcomb; Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome; Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone; Lesser Evils by Scott Press; Shadow of Angmar by SteelBadger).

I'm sensing a theme.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

Which is weird because it actually isn't particularly great. What with its inconsistent characterization for the sake of forced drama and a middle part that is paradoxically both much too long and much too short.

But I still like it. It just scratches that itch you sometimes get where you want some kind of action-comedy that doesn't /completely/ devolve in bashing.

And Fedora!Voldemort listening to Gustav Holst during a raid doesn't stop being funny no matter how mindboggingly dumb it might be.

** Have never re-read a fanfic. The furthest I went as rereading, was about halfway through "The Legacy" for a second time, but eventually got bored and wanted to read something new. Which is funny because I must've re-read the canon books (before i knew fanfic was a thing) about 10-15 times (starting from the third book, never liked the first 2)
