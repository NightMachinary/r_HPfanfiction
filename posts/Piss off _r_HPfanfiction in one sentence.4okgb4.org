*** I met someone online on a dating site, and we went on a date, and it turned out he was extremely into HPMoR. To the point where his house was the official LessWrong house (or meeting point or something) of his city. He was a perfectly nice guy, and we had a good conversation, but when we finally got around to talking about HPMoR, we were in complete disagreement. It really rankled me about how quickly he was willing to overlook extreme scientific inaccuracies when the whole point of the fic is to promote science, and he was annoyed about how quick I was to judge it when I hadn't even read the whole thing. Then it turned out that that was the only hp fan fic he'd read, which made me really sad, because there's so many really amazing ones out there and to only have read HPMoR really misses the heart of the community.

Anyway. We never went on a second date, for many reasons. But HPMoR was definitely one of them.

**** I think most people don't even know about the Draco trilogy, since she took it down when she became a published author. She did receive a backlash for basically being the the head of the "Draco in Leather Pants" trope, as well as the [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Cassandra_Claire_Plagiarism_Debacle][accusations of plagiarism]].

********** Hrm, good question. I used and operated a MUD (it's still around, was taken over and greatly expanded by Jim Baumgardner - [[http://www.cheesymud.com][www.cheesymud.com]]), data was available on FTP sites and on Gopher sites. Gopher was capable of doing some rudimentary searching, but most of the information you needed to find MORE information was found in text files that could be found - usually on a FTP site.

You'd get a UNIX shell account somewhere, with gopher, ftp and email tools like 'mail,' and 'pine.' Maybe you had USENET tools like 'tin.' You'd go out and download things, use the tools to communicate and save the data on the disk space associated with the UNIX account. You'd get that account from someone like Hookup.

If you wanted the data to be downloaded to your home computer, you would use xmodem, ymodem or zmodem tools to download from the UNIX shell if you were just dialing in bbs-style to their systems or with tcp/ip if you had an actual Internet connection (which was pretty rare but not unheard of).

It was fairly tedious to find data, fairly tedious to get the data, and fairly tedious to make use of the data, but it's what we all had at the time and it was a lot better than nothing.

Multi-player dungeons (MUDs) and Internet Relay Chat back then were /big/. You'd log in and find hundreds of people playing MUDs together - collaborating, communicating and stalking each other. Good fun.

**** I'm not so used to reddit-style forums yet, but I'm coming to like it more and more, I must admit. Still, vbulletin forums aren't built to handle this style and it's not particularly difficult to find stuff on there so I'm not pushing for change.
