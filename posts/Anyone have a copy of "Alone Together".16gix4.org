"Alone Together" was a fic on FF.net earlier this year that appeared to be abandoned, but is no longer hosted on the site. I found it to be an enjoyable read, and would love to have a copy of it to re-read now and then if anyone has a personal record of it.

The story itself was/is a crossover with Temeraire and started during the First Task and ended up telling the tale of how Harry and the Hungarian Horntail ended up in an alternate dimension with Harry controlling both bodies. It was a pretty long fic and had just gotten to the point where Harry was back in his original dimension (but without the Horntail).

I can't even remember the author, so I'm not sure if they posted anything regarding their take down of the story.


** That fic was by esama, who was a fairly prolific author. At the start of this year esama announced on tumblr that all the fics were being deleted to make room to focus on original works under a different name. I'm afraid I don't have a copy, but that's why they're gone.

*** Man, I really fucking hate it when authors do that. I mean, I completely get leaving to go to better things; they don't owe us anything and should do what makes them happy. But every time an author just takes everything down it feels like a 'fuck you' to all the people that enjoyed what they'd written and might want to go back and read it again.

**** I couldn't agree more - The only instance I could disagree is where digital space was limited, but I don't believe that to be the case with FF.net.

Edit: So I finally went and looked at the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1137344/esama][author's fanfic page]], and it appears that they actually intended to tell everyone "fuck you" based on the fact they cleared their profile and left "Love, the selfish bastard". Shrug, some people are just assholes.

*** Ah, I see. Thank you. I wish I had seen that announcement and I would have downloaded my own copy. Thanks again for the heads up.

**** I've done some googling, and i'm pleased to report I've found an archive to esamas work on the DLP forums. I'm not sure if it's a complete archive, but Alone Together is definitely there.

The dropbox link is [[https://dl.dropbox.com/u/92776639/Esama.ZIP]]

And if you want to verify for yourself, the DLP page is here, the link is two thirds of the way down, posted by user esperjones. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=608767&styleid=6]]

***** Oh, thank you so much. I've been rather busy this weekend, but now that I had the author's name I was planning on looking it up as well. Thanks again for all your help!

*** Yeah, I was rather shocked as well. It was one of my favorite incompletes and I check back in every once in the while just to see if it's been updated. If it did get updated in the last couple of weeks I missed it. But in any case, it seems to have disappeared overnight.

***** How odd that they updated it and then removed it not much more than a fortnight later.
