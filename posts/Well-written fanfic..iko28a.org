What are some of the best written fanfics you have read and what are they about? I only just started getting into it and have only read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness so far, a story which I enjoyed a lot.

Edit - If it sticks to canon it would be better.

** Sticking to canon can be a bit meh, as there are not enough changes to truly explore the fantastic depth of fanfiction. I have so many good fics I would recommend so I'll give three here, not necessarily my three favourite but a range of themes.

Linkffn(Living With Danger)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  What are some of the best written fanfics you have read and what are they about?
#+end_quote

If you mean HP-related I'm going to risk saying HPMOR. It is very well written by fanfic standards, especially after about a quarter of the way through. Parts are hysterically funny, and parts are brilliant. However, it's not really a Potterfic; it's more of a science fiction novel (full of SF tropes and references) rather than a fantasy novel; it indirectly bashes "canon"; its version of Harry is extremely annoying, etc. So it's unpopular here. It got me into this stuff though, since I didn't like the Rowling novels that much.

If you mean counting non-HP fanfic, I liked The Last Ringbearer best. It's a spy novel in the LOTR universe, set after the War of the Ring and written from the Orcs' point of view. Find here: [[https://archive.org/details/TheLastRingbearerSecondEdition]]

**** I didn't find it to be terribly plotted. The main arc built up through the book as planned, with the ending scene foreshadowed at the very beginning. It was "well written" rather than merely "grammatically competent" in that lots of the scenes were vivid, gripping, funny, etc.

It has the usual disease of fics published in installments while being written, of having some internal subplots that might have seemed promising at the time but that eventually fizzled (the SPHEW arc made me cringe). I haven't seen a fic published that way yet that didn't need a deep editing pass. The Rowling novels themselves suffered from this, especially volume 4 (and maybe later). My personal theory is that JKR like Voldemort simply grew too powerful to be contained by mere editors, so they had to shovel out what she sent them. The earlier volumes imho were much cleaner.

Anyway, because of the above, I mostly read fanfic to appreciate its good parts, while trying to overlook weaknesses that could be fixed with enough editing. By that approach HPMOR did pretty well. I didn't care about its fit with the rest of the HP fanfic universe (which I'd had no contact with at the time) or with the JKR novels (which were trying to do something entirely different).

***** I never found it particularly gripping because it flatly read more like it wanted to be an Ender's Game fic rather than anything to do with Harry Potter, and I don't find Yudkowsky's logic particularly compelling when it comes to some of his worldbuilding.

As far as Rowling goes, it's a pretty normal result of a new author on their first series. She was under pressure to continue a cash cow series and making each book larger in scope than the last, and her whimsical magical setting was never really thought through well enough to support the complexity of the later books.

***** Ideally a story should make you laugh, cry, and think. HPMoR does a great job of making you think, and although everyone's sense of humour is different, it certainly made me laugh. As for crying, well, feeling connected to the characters is probably more of a weakness of the story. Harry in particular rubs a lot of people the wrong way, and Hermione is admirable in many ways but connects with people more intellectually than emotionally. So it's difficult to feel invested in them to the point of tears over anything. (On the other hand, the Azkaban arc was certainly emotionally gripping, just not tearful.)

Two out of three ain't bad. And spelling+grammar is really top notch, not /quite/ error-free but they are extremely few.
