I love the plot of linkao3(The Well Groomed Mind) by Lady_Khali and was hoping for recommendations for /complete/ stories that are either Similar in style OR feature Barty in a large role OR have a sane (adult) Tom Riddle.


** Definitely keeping an eye on this. That is probably my favourite HP fiction.

ALSO I am writing one. Well. Two. I had an idea for another after beginning the first. They're not on the same timeline, though. Barty is central and Lady_Khali and I have very similar Bartys, which is one of the reasons I love her work so much.

**** It's not posted yet, I literally just started it last week. I'm hoping to write at least a few chapters in advance so people aren't waiting for ages in between, but I'll post a link as soon as it's up. :)

** I was just about to write a post looking for more sane Voldemort stories. I had just finished reading linkffn(11358664), which like A Well Groomed Mind, is sadly unfinished. :-(

*** Linkffn(Honey) has a sane Voldemort and is complete but the sequel was abandoned after just a couple of chapters.

I'm not sure I liked the story but it's definitely had me thinking about it after reading -I'm shocked that the descriptions of a certain character haven't made their way into my nightmares yet!

  Mika assumed she was destined for a quiet, normal life in Bucharest. She had her friends, her job, and occasional hobbies. But when her new neighbor with a metal arm saves her from a would-be assailant, she starts down a path that she didn't quite anticipate...and she doesn't do well with things she can't anticipate.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.
