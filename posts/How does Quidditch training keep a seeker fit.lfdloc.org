How does one get a Sixpack from flying? The only physically taxing part for a seeker seems to be constant body tension.


** Try to hold onto a wooden stick travelling at 200mph while doing 90 degree turns on a dime and come back and tell me whether you think this is physically demanding.

** Rowling never really explained what happened in Quidditch training but considering that Wood is an Quidditch fanatic and that Harry returned from training tired and dirty there is some physical training involved.

Training probably consist out of bludger dodging, golf ball catching and flying without hands on the broom. And while it will not give a six pack it certainly will keep your body fit.

** I believe this discussion has come up before. If you search for quidditch muscles in this subreddit you should find some answers.

*** Yes. Highest level competitive horse riding of all types, especially at speed, requires significant core strength, and possibly the jockey position, or at least a cross country galloping position, might be similar to a broomstick position. Constant balance adjustments and keeping your center of gravity in the right place through turns, swerves, etc.

Plus the core strength necessary for tricks like the Wronski Feint; have to stay with the broom, even banking sideways etc.

** A sixpack is probably the most likely muscle you would get from quidditch, beaters aside. I head canon it as quidditch involves manoeuvring constantly so your opponents can't predict where you are going. I would imagine that this would require you to constantly be shifting your centre of mass, and probably leaning away from the broom a lot, which would require mostly core muscles. I agree seekers seem to spend most of the match cruising, but he may do the same exercises as everyone else because he is a part of the team.

** Well, you'd have to shift your body-weight pretty drastically to keep holding on to it through tight cornering and rapid acceleration/deceleration. At the very least, they'd need upper-body fitness to catch those forces.

The closest equivalent might be motocross - which fits with how brooms are treated as well.

** Any good sports captain will have the team performing exercises, not just running drills. Thus, the team members probably run laps around the pitch and do calesthenics as a warmup, in addition to flying drills.

And I don't know about a six-pack, but they'd definitely get strong thigh muscles from holding onto the broom with their legs during all the fancy manoeuvres.
