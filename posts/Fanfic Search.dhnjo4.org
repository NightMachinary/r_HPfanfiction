:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Need help finding a fanfic where Harry has a ability to phase out of reality and cloak himself, using this ability to take care of the Death Eaters by phasing his hand into their chests and give them a heart attack. Pairing is either Harry/Hermione or Harry/Susan, don't remember which.


** Not the pairing you remember but he does have some of those powers in this. linkffn(Passageways by jerrway69)

*** Not that one. It's definitely not a Harry/Bella fic. I remember that Harry uses his new powers to save Amelia and Susan Bones. At the end of the fanfic, it mentions his daughter, Lily inheriting his powers and Hermione has found a way to track Harry and Lily when they use their powers. Thank you for help anyways!
