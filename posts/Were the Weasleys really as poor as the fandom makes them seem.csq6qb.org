They are the equivalent of wizarding hill-billies in many FanFiction I've read.


** I think that a lot of people conflate wizarding poverty far too much with muggle poverty.

As far as mundane needs and wants go - food, water, shelter, clothing, et cetera - the Wizarding World is practically a post-scarcity society. There is never any risk of the Weasleys struggling to feed their small army of children, hell they feast semi-regularly. They have a massive home, and a fair slice of land to their name. They live very comfortably, it would seem, save for the one time of year they need to get the kids stuff for Hogwarts.

Their relative poverty only really comes into play when they need to purchase the only goods that have any value at all in wizarding society - intellectual property like textbooks and magical items like wands.

Even then, at their absolute tightest years (the two years where they have five of their seven children at Hogwarts), they manage to scrape through.

Basically, it's an entirely different conversation. Poverty of luxuries, not poverty of needs.

*** What I think is weird in general about Wizards/Witches and wealth is that it doesn't seem like anyone has taken advantage of opportunities in the muggle world when you have magical abilities. There are probably tons of ways to make money with magic and that's if you don't want to resort to straight up theft.

Of course, this could have happened and just not have come up in the books/movies.

**** Ironically, isn't that sort of related to Arthur's job? Keeping wizards from breaking the Muggle economy with enchanted objects.

Can't all be exploding tea cosies, surely.

***** Well charmed/jinxed/hexed/enchanted stuff yeah. I was think making mundane stuff with magic, or repairing broken stuff with magic. You buy a trashed house really cheap and you renovate it with magic in a day and sell it for top dollar.

** I'd call them lower middle class rather than poor, personally. Seven kids on one income while accepting no aid or charity (even taking in an unpaid extra boarder for the summer), all of their kids are healthy and well fed. They don't indulge much in luxuries and stretch things as much as they can (hand me down robes and secondhand books), but they don't seem to be struggling too much, either.

** I wouldn't say that they are that poor, but canonically, they need to make every Galleon count.

** With magic covering your basic needs, I think the Weasley's were made fun of for being poor in comparison to other purebloods, for the most part.

The top struggles I remember the book covering are school supplies, wand replacements, new clothes, and any extra luxury items like candy or outings. It was mostly Slytherins making fun of Ron for this, if I recall. I imagine most high society purebloods want any reason to look down their nose at the Weasleys, and using the fact that they don't live in mansions, have the finest robes, and are very middle class is a way for high society purebloods to prove to themselves that their way of life is better than 'blood traitors'. The Weasleys were /that/ family that had a /dozen/ rambunctious, red-headed kids and aren't you glad we didn't end up like them?

Growing up, some of my richer friends thought that my family was struggling because we didn't have cable, wifi, never had brand name clothing, and never went on vacations. We never went out to eat, either, other than fast food twice a month when my dad's paycheck came in. But in actuality, we were absolutely blessed. My parents were just being frugal in order to pay off a mortgage and put two kids through college. We lived in a two story house on two acres of land, never wanted for food or clothes, but because I wasn't getting $300 haircuts, buying expensive makeup, or getting brand-name clothing, I thought we were struggling. Meanwhile, my mother grew up in the 70s without running water or access to dental care (she's had false teeth since age 13), and my grandfather stole his neighbor's pig to cook up for Thanksgiving. You judge your own situation based on your surroundings.

Compared to the Malfoys, the Weasleys are struggling, and as it's something Ron is teased about, it's something he's very sensitive about. But in reality, the Weasley's are at worse middle class, and have a happier and more loving home life than Harry ever had.

*** Middle class in the American sense lol - in England it can mean upper-middle/lower-upper class and middle. I've noticed American's like to pretend working class people don't exist, often, in the media at least.

** Well sorta? You dont really see poor people in the wizarding world often. But its hard to also say what poor means to wizard. Mainly because you dont know how much you can do with magic. Can you magically cook? Have shelter? Get water? What about heathcare? If you get cancer and go to St. Mungos is it free to get rid of it? Can you get rid of diseases muggles cant get rid of with magic? What about birth control is it like if you want a baby you will get one otherwise you wont? Can you reverse a pregnancy with a tap of a wand like having free plan b? Well if you can do all that you already have a huge difference from muggle poverty alot of issues you never have to worry about as long as you have a wand. So being poor doesnt mean what it means to muggles . But its also possible that making money is harder too. The minimum amount you need to survive is much less as far as money goes. Unless you are a squib.

Coincidentally the two squibs you meet one has a home at hogwarts taking care of food water and shelter. The other while being put in place by Dumbledore was still earning money from muggles and even then likely got extra funds for her trouble.

** I remember a scene in the second book when Harry and the Weasleys are in Gringotts and Molly scrapes everything from their vault together to be able to purchase the expensive books. (Lockhart demanded a whole lot of them)
