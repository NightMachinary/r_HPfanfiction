** Thinking about it, the Adventure genre is pretty bare bones.

For a light hearted romp. Albus and Harry's World Trip, is doing good things.

** These are all unfinished, but quite fun. The "adventures" take place in canon locations (mostly Gringotts and Hogwarts), so not quite like Bungle in the Jungle, but give them a try anyway. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

** There's a good one I vaguely recall in which Harry goes on a summer trip with Bill and some curse breakers.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
