:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read it a long while ago and I can only remember certain details

- I think Tom Riddle from another dimension/universe is good and he teaches at Hogwarts

- somehow he ends up in Harry's 5th year and begins to teach there, too

- he helps Harry figure out how to defeat Voldemort (I think so, anyway)

- he acts as a parental figure to Harry and comes to think of him as his son

- eventually at the end there's a battle between Voldemort and Riddle in front of the whole school and Riddle tells Voldemort that he won't hurt his son (Harry)

Anyway if anyone knows what the name of that is I'd really appreciate it!


** I haven't read this one, but sounds like it might be Professor Riddle and the Quest for Tenure.

*** Not at all. /Professor Riddle and the Quest for Tenure/ features Riddle building his power-base as Voldemort, very involved in politics, and is clearly out murdering people. The setting is also in the 1970s, well before Harry is born, and does not have time travel or alternate dimensions.

Sorry, OP, the fic you're looking for doesn't sound familiar to me at all. Good luck!
