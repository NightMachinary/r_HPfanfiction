** The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]] (link is to the first one; there are currently four books, and the author is working on the fifth). Entirely AU, about the American wizarding world with completely different characters; it is heavily inspired by the magic and world of Harry Potter, but there are no canon characters at all. For me, FF is mostly about continuing the story, so I normally would never have read anything this AU, but they're all quite good!

Also, I thought this version of rehashing "nineteen years later" from Harry's POV was interesting and good, if you're looking for other stories that break your boundaries: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3675690/1/Ouroboros]]

*** I wouldn't really call Alexandra Quick AU. It conforms to canon (although going a bit more in depth), and takes place pretty much in the same world, albeit a different continent. Pretty much same world, just different characters (who I personally like a lot better because they have more depth than many HP characters).

Side note, AQ also introduces more grey area morality than the basic black and white morality of HP.

**** That's a good point. Wrong terminology on my part. It's just...a totally different facet of the canon world with basically none of the same characters, which still qualifies as something I'd typically auto-reject. I guess instead of AU, just tons of OCs? Is there a better term?

***** There isn't really a term for it. AC for alternate characters? Can we make that a thing?

** A few that come to mind:

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1312532/1/The-Human-Condition][Awakening Power]] by C. K. Talons - a complete, novel length story about Harry incarcerated for crimes committed while fighting against an enemy that may or may not be all in his head. A psychological thriller and one of the first fanfiction stories I read revealing the potential of the medium.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Brown Coat, Green Eyes]] by nonjon - complete, novel length crossover between the Harry Potter and Firefly universes. A brilliant piece of writing.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4966520/1/The-Inner-Eye-of-Harry-Potter][The Inner Eye of Harry Potter]] by jbern - Harry is raised by Sibyll Trelawney.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/1/The-Best-Seven-Years][The Best Seven Years]] by blutaiger - complete, novel length, a Harry Potter/Calvin and Hobbes (told from Calvin's POV) crossover. Surprisingly entertaining and thoughtful in a crossover I had no idea would work as well as it does.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]] by BajaB - complete, long one-shot, a Marauder's era tale where James survives the attack and the Marauders show a far darker side than we're presented in canon. I normally dislike Marauder-era stories with their insipid prank wars, but not this one.

** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-843/MarcusRowland+Bring+Me+The+Head+of+Harry+Potter.htm][Bring Me the Head of Harry Potter]] -- mega-crossover that throws the first law of fanfiction completely out the window, mostly takes itself seriously, and gets away with it.
