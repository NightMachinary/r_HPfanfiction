Speaking from experience, someone yelling is stressful, even if they're not yelling at you, especially if they yell at you a great deal.


** Yeah I know how this feels, sometimes my parents would get into arguments and they would yell really loudly and I was in my room and they were downstairs and I was freaking shaking like I was the one getting yelled at. This also didn't help my self-esteem issue where I just feel like I can't do anything right and I'm just a bother to people. I don't like getting yelled at it helps nothing and I just get more stressed and scared at what your yelling at me for. I once had a sort of panic attack because I was being yelled at I was trying to catch my breath but I couldn't calm down and I was crying non stop, it was a scary experience because I couldn't stop myself and I didn't really know why this was happening because I've been yelled at before and that's never happened.

*** I'm not really prone to panic attacks, but it does make me go into "fight-or-flight" mode, and my first instinct is "Fight," apparently, since the last time I snapped, I actually punched the person in the face.
