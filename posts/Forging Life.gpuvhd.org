The creation of a Horcrux was never meant to be done alone, truly should not be done alone for alone there is but one way to split a soul. Together, a soul can be split with naught but a word.

The Four split eachothers soul twice each, a Quarter to Hogwarts, a Quarter to a moldy Hat and a Half for themselves.

The Castle came Alive, and its soul was Whole.

The Hat came Alive, and its soul, too, was Whole.

The Four died a little bit. But that, they knew, was to be expected for they had made Life where before there was none.

But they also lost touch, just a tiny bit. One became reckless, one buried themselves in their work, one grew to hate all that was different and one grew blind to change.

And so went the founding. So went the time of Legends. And so started the time of Hogwarts. The time of History Recorded. And so came the times of The Raven, The Foul, The Grinding Stone and The Snake. And after each came the times of those who fought them.

This is their Story. Their Time. Their Legend.


** Niiiiice.

So:

Ravenclaw = The Raven = The Lost Touch\\
Gryffindor = The Foul = The Reckless

Hufflepuff = The Grinding Stone = The Work-Buried

Slytherin = The Snake = The Change-Blind

I guess Gryffindor did terrible things in his recklessness?

Slytherin started the "disagreement" by hating anything different, but Gryffindor was the one that escalated it into a fight and forced Slytherin outside of Hogwarts.

Or something like that I guess

*** Should mention that I tried writing this so it can be written for different time periods, but it is a VERY open prompt
