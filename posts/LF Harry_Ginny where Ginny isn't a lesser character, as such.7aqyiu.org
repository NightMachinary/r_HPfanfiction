A good few stories just kinda feature her as... there, you know? Like, only really there for the ship and nothing else. +just like canon :^(+ I want to see more stories where she's actually fleshed out instead of a ginger doormat.

None of the main stuff, y'know, like Floreat or Northumbrian. Or The Changling.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1208839/hermyd][hermyd]] always writes Ginny as the powerful sidekick in her H/G fics.

Ginny had all of Tom's memories in “The Thorny Rose Series”, linkffn(9631998;9969456;10288020). She singlehandedly busted the Graveyard Resurrection Scheme, captured Wormtail, and forced Fudge to exonerate Sirius.

Then there is the [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm#pt][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]], in which Ginny gained the Slayer power during the Astronomy Tower Battle. Voldemort found out and countered by raising an additional army of demons and vampires. Ginny and the Trio had to fight those on top of the Horcrux hunt.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
