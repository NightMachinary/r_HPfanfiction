Hi! Just looking for some new fanfics to read after my exams to release stress. I found out that I quite enjoyed Slytherin!Harry with HP/DM where Snape and Harry get along, but haven't been able to find much. Even HP/DM where Harry is a Gryffindor is welcomed as long as it's HP/DM and Snape and Harry get along. Severitus is also greatly welcomed!

Thank you in advance!


** My favorite story closest to what you're looking for is Chaos Theory linkao3(1521479) but Harry is in Gryffindor and Draco is in Ravenclaw.
