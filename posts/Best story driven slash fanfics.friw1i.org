**** Right, here's some slash ones (M/M) that I've enjoyed because the writing is good and the story is not just smut or something like that.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/1110843][ô saisons, ô châteaux]] (series) - Regulus is a Ravenclaw, and takes place during the Marauders era. The story has slash pairings along with canon pairings, though main pairing is Regulus/OMC.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/1174661][TAB]] (series) - Harry finds out from Petunia that Snape is "that awful boy" and the story goes from there. Main pairing is Snape/Lupin.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1105713][October]] (series) - Series uses both MOD Harry and time travel mechanics, but it does a really good job of not falling into the worst tendencies of both tropes. Pairing for a time is Tom Riddle/HP, but then moves to other pairings (all non canon).
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/21709729/chapters/51783664][The Last Something That Meant Anything]] - Percy focused and a really good three shot . It's a mix of canon and non-canon events from Percy's perspective from pre-sorting to post-DH. Multi-pairings, but Oliver/Percy is a big one.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/16186133/chapters/37823456][Black Pride]] - Walburga Black saves Sirius from Azkaban, and the story goes from there. Pairing is Sirus/OMC.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][Face Death in the Hope]] - time travel shenanigans. Harry saves Regulus from the inferi, and both decide to kill Voldie. Takes place during 1st Wiz. War, with pairing being Reg/HP.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/18799003][Older Magic]] - a one-shot, but a great one. Takes place during Fantastic Beasts era, pairing is Percival Graves/Theseus Scamander.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/16586783][dear forgiveness, i saved a plate for you]] - Almost 30 years after Ariana's death, Dumbledore goes to therapy. Past Gellert/Dumble and Elphias Doge/Dumble.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413][Blackpool]] - A Sirus and Regulus centered story, I won't speak too much about it since it's one of the best stories to go in blind. background pairing is Sirius/Remus.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9571568/chapters/21642761][A Journey Home]] - a Percy/Oliver centered fic, takes place post-DH. They work together on a broom project, and shenanigans ensues.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/481516][Seeing]] - a Draco/Ron one-shot, and really well done. Takes place 10 year after DH.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/200820][Hand in Glove]] - Post DH (I think it's decent amount of time after) one shot, pairing is Goyle/Dudley.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/681][Ben Folds's Series]], Percy/Oliver is the main pairing, but story is a very different take on DH, and the story continues from there.

Also recommend Second String, which another user linked. The pairing is Gideon Prewett/HP.

I probably have more, but this is a good place to start at least!

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** I'd recomnend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man Who Lived]]. It's incredibly written and has a story line outside of the slow burn romance with OCs that the author writes so well. Draco lives and works in New York as both a tatoo artist and a mentor to youth.

** Thirty-Five Owls by Letterblade

Albus/Gellert epistolary fic; bittersweet, but moving.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7101118]]

Beastspeaker by prosodiical

Percival Graves/Newt Scamander[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11750064]]

The Unexpected and the Transcendent by Someone_aka_Me

Charlie/Draco isn't a pairing I recall reading before, yet I find that I like them very much in this story. And they are both asexual in this.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14312001]]

Potential Gravity by zeitgeistic (faire_weather)

A post-war Harry/Draco that I can believe. (I'm not a Harry/Draco fan) I like the intense feels. yet it's not sentimental. I like this Draco, who finally gets fed up with Harry's ways and starts a new life in Lebanon. Nice magical detail for a story this length (35,000 words or so).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1952640]]

The Secret Language of Plants by Endrina

Many pairings, but they don't really matter much because the slash is mostly low-key, and the action is exciting once the war kicks off. It's very AU throughout, so prepare for surprises, and there is a fourth, diverse side to the war besides the Ministry, the Order, and Voldemort. I like that it's Gennish, whimsical and magical, and while nearly everyone is gay, it's somehow believable. I adore the epilogue.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13984608?view_full_work=true][Mount Unto the Stars]] is Snape/Lupin set amongst a mystery story. The relationship develops slowly and with character development. Some sex at the end but not very graphic. The mystery is entertaining too.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11002008][Breathings of the Heart]] - Snape/Lupin, one of my favorite Snupin fics and I have read a lot of them. Snape and Lupin are forced to live together to receive an inheritance from Dumbledore. Told entirely through letters and news articles.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8138437][It Was Just a Kiss]] is Sirius/Lupin while at school and is basically about each of them coming to terms with being attracted to boys. They are very confused and in denial at first but horniness wins out 😛. Perhaps more porny than you'd like but the development of their feelings and their struggles with adapting to their sexualities feels very accurate.

** I have no idea if the authors are lgbt but I'll link you a few good fics I have bookmarked. I especially recommend you the Harry/Voldemort fics I've linked. I know this isn't everyones fav. Pairing but i chose those fics for their goodd characterizations.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

This is a Marvel crossover. Loki/Harry. Very focused on plot and a great relationship. Highly rec. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]])

Not really as much plot. The focus is the relationships between the people but it's a great Wolfstar series as the individual persons are very well written. Linkao3(Howl by Shiftylinguini)

All of these are Novel length fics with either Draco ir Snape as a Mc/focus point

Time travel (Snarry) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) This fic is called the boy who died a lot. I wasn't immediately hooked but after some time I got really into it. I laughed. I cried. Really good fic. Also this is Snape pov.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).

** Yule by budchick - HP/TMR

A Yuletide time travel TMR/HP with a credible emotional feel and plot. I like this Tom, and I believe in this Harry's reactions. Not at all melodramatic or slashy in the ficcish way; this has a more organic growth of empathy with a potential for a relationship rather than just sex. This is non-explicit and would be OK for non-shippers.

Harry Potter and the Sympathy of Souls by - MorticiaYouSpokeFrench - HP/TMR

An amusing take on how Harry overcame Voldemort and dealt with his horcruxes, with the aid of the Flamels. I love the sneaky Flamel trope so much, and the idea of Nicolas mentoring Harry really works for me.

credence barebone and the king of the faeries series by saltpans - Credence/Percival Graves

Lovely fairy-tale-ish fantastical magical detail; in part 2 Dumbledore is very in-character as well as uniquely powerful--well handled.

Part 1 king of the oak is complete, but author lost inspiration due to dislike of the second FB film (for very good reasons, IMO; I haven't watched that myself). Blessedly, the author gave a synopsis and a final snippet to round off the storyvline.

Thirteen Gifts by Lomonaaeren - Harry Potter/THeodore Nott

Oh, this is a lovely post-war courting story, and it was touching to read in the holidays.

** A Bit of a Rest by gonergone - Harry Potter/Charlie Weasley

Last updated in April 2014, so while I would love more of this melancholy but comforting post-war story, I doubt I'll get it. Potentially Harry/Charlie but mostly gen till the end, so if you don't like the ship, you can still enjoy it. Unresolved past Harry/Ginny mentioned, but again, that's not the focus--Harry's healing is.

House Proud by astolat (who happens to be a bestselling fantasy author IRL, so this is well written)

I'm not a Harry/Draco fan (never have been), but I loved this one. Great details on the importance of tending to a wizard house.

Spellist by Esama - Harry Potter/Phil Coulson

Very interesting magical detail in this one-shot, 2400-word crossover with Marvel Movieverse

Reading In by wynnebat - Kingsley Shacklebolt/Percy Weasley

Short, but a sweet romantic story of two friends who become more.

A Snake Named Voldemort by estalita11 HP/LV

Love this one--the Dark Lord in this story is cranky and evil(ish). But it's also the sweetest Harrymort I've ever read that is still credible. And Dumbledore isn't evil--bonus!
