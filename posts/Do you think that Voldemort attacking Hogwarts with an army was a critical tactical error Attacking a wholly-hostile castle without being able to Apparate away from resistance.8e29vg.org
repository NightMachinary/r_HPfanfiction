This is just a personal headcanon that I have, and I've mentioned before; I think the reason that Voldemort and his Death Eaters were so capable of fighting against the Ministry, and ultimately taking it over, was because as attackers with the ability to easily teleport (Apparation), they could pick and choose any target in Britain at any time, assassinate enemies with surprise attacks, then Disapparate again before reinforcements could arrive.

Furthermore, via the Imperius Curse, they could quickly and effectively create sleeper agents within the Ministry (or any other group opposing them), so that when they did attack a well-protected target the imperiused agents could turn and sabotage their enemy's defences.

Now, compare that to the Battle of Hogwarts:

- With the Carrows indisposed, Snape fled and the students sympathetic to the Death Eaters removed from the castle, Voldemort has no inside agents, Imperiused or otherwise, inside Hogwarts at the time of his attack.

- Hogwarts isn't vulnerable, it has numerous defenders; of-age students, the professors, the animated knights, and later on the centaurs and house-elves; not necessarily as dangerous as fully trained Aurors, but still a threat, especially en masse.

- Hogwarts is a no-Apparation zone, meaning that the Death Eaters couldn't retreat when reinforcements (lots of them) joined the fight.

- And for good measure, Voldemort announced his presence first and gave everyone in the castle time to prepare themselves and psych up for the fight.

Basically, instead of using all the tactical advantages that his Death Eaters had exploited up until then, Voldemort instead decided to just pool as many of his forces as possible into one all-out assault.

I'm pretty sure that was a massive error; his Death Eaters were practised in surprise attacks on vulnerable targets, not fighting against fortified enemies, for the large part the imperiused portion of his army had little to no combat experience, the giants, dementors and other creatures he had had fairly low versatility (and the dementors, while normally effective, were attacking a castle full of students who knew Patronus charms), he sacrificed the opportunity for a surprise attack in a failed attempt to intimidate his enemies...basically the worst possible army, against the worst possible target, with the worst possible tactics.

What does everyone else think?


** Well, from a writing perspective, I certainly think that writing pitched battles in the HP world is a mistake.

From an in-universe tactical perspective, I think you are underestimating Voldemort's personal power. In a conventional fight, I'm not sure that the combined defenders of Hogwarts would have been able to overcome him.

Consider his duel against McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley:

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside.
#+end_quote

[...]

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him ---
#+end_quote

[...]

#+begin_quote
  “You won't be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. “You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people ---”

  “But you did not!”

  “--- I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. *Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding?* You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?”
#+end_quote

From this we can deduce that Voldemort was laying waste to everyone around him, and that even when confronted with the most powerful opponents available to the defenders, he landed multiple spells on them in a very short space of time, each of which would have probably killed their targets but for Harry's sacrificial magic. Without that sacrificial magic in place, Voldemort probably could have killed Slughorn, McGonagall and Kingsley in the space of seconds.

Voldemort's true mistake was granting everyone in Hogwarts' an impenetrable protective Charm against his magic by accepting Harry's sacrifice in exchange for the lives of those in the castle, just as Lily had done for Harry.

*** In addition to this, Voldemort has shown that he isn't opposed to dealing with powerful (politically and magically) opponents personally. The key examples that come to mind are the Potters and Amelia Bones (were there any specific others I've forgotten?).

Allowing a pitched battle to occur at all was a fool's errand in the first place. Surgical strikes across the UK against his foes would've been far more successful. It's what I imagine the first war was very much like, until Riddle was unceremoniously duped by love magic.

Ah, i must Thank you, because you delivered an explanation to one of the most annyoing things mentioned in the Books. So i can cut this from my list about the "annoying 'Deus Ex Machina' things, that happened or mentioned in the Series, but werent explained". Now this explains that, BUT i still am annoyed and angered. It seems like Rowling did Harry make into a God-like Person.

1. Voldemort (and i think Dumbledore too) mentioned that Lily used "ancient Magic". So i would without a doubt believe that Lily, as a smart Witch (the Hermione counterpart, i would tell, but with Beauty and self-confidence) has read or studied about old Magic and was even capable about performing them (or atleast she thought so. as we can see, it worked). She knew, what must be done to perform this. I doubt (or rather, i refuse to believe) that simply sacrifice yourself to protect a person you love is the trigger, because THIS is one of the Main Logic holes in the series: Its like Lily Potter was the only Person brave enough to sacrifice herself, to protect a loved Person and all the other did nothing to do something like this. SO, she must have performed some sort of Wandless magic (or performed a Ritual, just in Case and her death would only seal the deal). That Harry was "through a 'trade'" capable of doing this sort of magic.....im sorry, but i have the biggest doubts. His School grades were average (i think his mother, would have been better grades), PLUS: Harry didnt studied ancient magic. The fact that his mothers Protection was now also enhanced to protect all his beloved, because HE thought it was because of his sacrifice or "trade", is just purely ridiculous. And i think this was something not mentioned or explained enough by Harry himself (even if so, he claimed it was HIS doing, not his mothers). The Magical World of HP seems to be a lot about Bonding by some Persons actions: as Harry spared Wormtail, it did Practically Nothing (Dumbles only mentioned, that a special Bond is forged if such thing happens). The result was that Wormtail was killed by Voldemorts "spawn", because the Silver Hand acted like Voldy would. but this "special" bond had actually nothing to do with it. Harry could have said anything that would serve his purpose. But i guess it was Wormtails hesitation that openend the Spawns eyes. And now this, Harry sacrificed himself to protect the others...another Bond was forged. Jesus, so if you want to kill someone, you have to make sure that this Person didnt make an arrangement in His/her past. AH, but hey, Sirius saved Snape from the Willow, BUT nothing happened (atleast nothing we know about).
2. Besides of the lack of explanation, Harry is on that passage (in my eyes) arrogant and a poser. Usually any explanation and conclusion that Harry made, we see in his thoughts. But this Protection was only barely explained. If i remember right, he only thought, that NOW he was ready to fight and then came his "solution" as he faced Voldy. He acted, like it was his doing to protect the others (we dont see, that Voldemort used the Unforgivables against the others (sure, you would say, he would, what a purpose he would have in using the other Spells)), but he just mentioned, that he protect the others, like his mother did to him. So Harry assumes, that just the sacrifice is the Trigger and no Ritual (it might have slipped his mind (like so many other things), that Voldy and Dumbles said it was "ancient" magic. So it was difficult to perform or would take a long preparation time....or its simply "ancient" because the age of this spell is really old and not because its powerful.

And isnt it ridiculous, that ancient magic is stronger than the Elder Wand? The most powerful Wand, ever made? Its not clearly dated, when the Wand was made, but i like to presume, that it was nearly as old as Merlin.

I dont know, what my thoughts were, when i first read that passage, but i was definetely confused, after listening to it after a whole century.

**** "Ancient magic" is used in HP to mean the deepest, most profound rules of magic. For example, the protection against spells in a dragon's hide is referred to as ancient magic. It's not a body of wizardry that can be studied and learnt, it's just a set of fundamental rules about how magic operates (the phrasing is a nod to Narnia).

Lily didn't "cast" any magic and nor did Harry. It's simply that her choice to die when she had the option to live had innate magical significance.

> It's not a body of wizardry that can be studied and learnt

you mention Narnia, so different Universe. But if this also counts for HP, then the whole learning and studying in the Magical School is worthless, because all Students already have the Power to perform this magic, they just need to be "aware" of. Example for what i mean: Neville can perform the Alohomora and envies all his Pals for doing it with perfection

Neville: "That so unfair, i want to perform this useful spell to"

Pal: "Oh, but of course, you can do it. You just have to be aware, that anybody can do all spells, so even you"

Neville concentrates "i am able to do it, so i want to do it" and suddenly, he perfoms the spells as perfect as any other of his Friends....without practicing....just because he made himself aware, that Anyone can do any sort of Magic, no matter how much s/he trains.

dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!”"

As we can read on here, Trelawney DID NOT joined them yet! She is still standing beside the Table, a couple of steps away and i think its stupid of her not to tell Dumbles as a Warning, that he will die. "**Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will die**" Dumbles was rising before she joined (sit down). To be Fair: Its not described if Ron did take Scabbers with him to Lunch (could be possible, that he locked him away in their Bedroom or Trunk). Please Remember: >"Full to bursting with Christmas

dinner and still wearing their party hats, Harry and Ron got

up first from the table and she shrieked loudly.

“My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?”

“Dunno,” said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry."

So, she saw Ron and Harry stand up on the same time. Why else would she be bothered on them instead of bothering Dumbles? As i said, its not described if Ron took Scabbers with himself, if so, Trelawneys Message was pointless from the beginning, without her knowing it, but if not, the 13 only counted the moment, she sit with them.

*********** oh, I understand, what you are saying, but your Logic is wrong (in my eyes). You see, IF Trelawney considered Dumbles to die, she would have told him. And of course, the FULL Phrase is Important. "IF i join", YET she hasnt, SO nothing happens...unless of course Rowling made a mistake and wanted to claim that Trelawney indeed joined "already", but why would she show concern about this unlucky thing when its to late? As Dumbles stands up (he leaves, so its 11) to welcome her and conjure a Chair, she joins reluctantly. NOW they are 13 and she indeed was the 13th. Trelawney was shocked, when Ron and Harry were standing.

But Trelawney clearly said "IF i Join", means, she hasnt Joined them YET, so nothing happens to poor Dumbles. It is true, that of these 13 Dumbles was the unlucky one, but i Doubt that Rowling has forseen this (its my Opinion). She just wanted Dumbles to die, so that the most important Protection for the light side and Harry and a Mentor for said Person would vanish and Harry would be on his own.

There is no Threat about Dumbles, because Sybill didnt/hasnt joined them yet...she pointed it out herself. Its actually obvious, but if you want to believe it the way you stated untill now, i wont interfere.

Oh wait. You want to say, that Trelawneys Prophecy did occur, BECAUSE it were 13 People from the Beginning? You have been counted Wormtail from the Beginning! Ah....now if this is right, things are clear. So that Ron and Harry both standing was a red Hering....hmm, ok. But i still have my doubts about that Rowling has forseen/planned this, but as long as she wont admit it, we can only speculate.

**** If it helps any, 'as old as Merlin' only takes you back around the year 500 or so. Hogwarts actually predates Arthurian time periods by a disgustingly large amount of time considering the kind of castle it is usually presented as.

Also in Arthurian myth Merlin aged backwards and was a baptised and thus de-evilled attempt at creating the anti-christ in some versions.

This has no bearing on anything, but it is amusing to me to think the potterverse wizards venerate a (failed) antichrist and irl religious anti-Potter activists never raised that point.

For starters, it's pretty obvious that Harry is supposed to be a Jesus type figure. I don't think JK was intending to convert us or anything, but she was very deliberately using Christian lore and symbology throughout all the book. In one interview, she mentions she never bothered to make a point to the public that she was Christian when Harry Potter was being accused of being the devils work, because she was worried it would give away Harry's temporary demise and sacrifice. Whether you like writing decision or not, it was almost certainly a deliberate intentional choice to frame harry as Jesus, sacrificing himself so others could live.

And as for Dumbledore talking about 'ancient magic,' I'm pretty sure he was talking about love (the driving force behind the sacrifice, and why it works in the first place), not some deliberate studied magical art that Lily researches and put into place to protect her son. Dumbledore meant ancient magic in the sense that love is ancient, is as old as life or whatever, and that this ancient magic of love is what protected Harry against voldemort. Feel free to make your own headcanon as to how Lily actually accomplished protecting Harry, but in JKs canon world it was just pure love that did it, nothing else.

****** All I'm saying is that we are shown throughout the books that harry never in any way attempts to research any rituals for love magic, but in book 7, he manages to pull off the same magic that lily did the night she died, despite not being shown any evidence of him even being aware that there was a specific ritual that Lily did to save him. There is a direct comparison between what Lily did and what Harry did, intending to show the audience that they were the same magic. So if Harry and Lily both did the exact same magic to protect the people they love, and Harry could not possibly have done it through any form of ritual, therefore Lily did not use any form of ritual either.

“You won't be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. “You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people ---”

As you can see here, it is stated in canonical text, that what Harry did in book 7 is the same as what his mother did. Harry did not use a ritual, ergo, his mother did not use a ritual. So the ancient magic Dumbledore speaks of can not possibly be a ritual that must be studied.

If that means that all those other mothers just didn't love there children enough, then that's what it means.

But something you should also take into account - James died, and no protection was cast upon Harry. James was willing to die for Harry, just like Lily. But the reason it didn't work is because James wasn't given a choice. It is the fact that Voldemort stopped, and gave lily a choice, to stand aside and let him kill Harry, and she would be spared, and lily said no, please kill her instead of harry, that made the sacrifice work. It was also a magical sacrifice, and by all accounts the magical population is rather small, so if the cause of death was, say, a gun, it wouldn't have worked. And lastly, the reason Harry was so famous, was primarily because it was voldemort that 'died.' the only reason so many people knew that he survived the killing curse was because voldemort was a terrorist whose news and circumstances death would have spread faster than a blink of an eye. If it had just been some random magical crack addict trying to steal a broomstick instead of lord voldemort, and somebody did the sacrificial magic, and the crack addicts spell on the recipient of the magical protection rebounded and they died, I don't think anyone would believe that story had they heard it. The killing curse was entirely unprotectable, is what everyone believed. Somebody telling a story about how it rebounded off of them would make them a laughing stock. So there very well could have been isolated incidents involving magical crack addict thieves and magical domestic abusers where the sacrifical magic was done, but nobody believed the survivors tale, with the story getting lost to history.

So given that the sacrificer has to be given the choice to live but refuse to step aside, both the attacker, sacrificer, and presumably sacrificee have to be magical, and the attacker would have to be enough of a known threat that their death would be big enough news that people would be more willing to believe the seemingly impossible, it's no wonder that there's no historical known precedent of someone surviving the killing curse via sacrifical magic.

He had to try to save it for his own sake, and barring that, he had to put down the one that could defeat him, who kept getting away and would after he destroyed part of Voldemorts soul would go back into hiding.

But bringing along his familiar was beyond dumb.

One of Hitlers grandparent sets was Jewish...

It's not really his goal, though. His goal is to rule the world (or at least, the /wizarding/ world), forever. Pretending to be a blood-purist was only a ruse, exploiting the ideology of all the easily-manipulated, morally-questionable young purebloods.

** I think in Voldemort's mind, he was at the height of his power. He had no reason to think he was not capable of capturing Hogwarts and taking out anyone who stood in his way.

Hogwarts is fortified to an extent, however Voldemort himself took down the shield easily. And its defenders where you mentioned the students. There are only a handful of-age students. How many 6th or 7th years do you think there are considering the book implies that Slytherins were not included? Especially, since the Carrow siblings would not properly teach them how to defend themselves and cursed most of them all year long. The DA could only teach people with what they learned from Harry only from a single year, knowledge of several years of inconsistent defense teachers, and from books. They could only learn so much self taught without experienced witches or wizards teaching them. Also, realistically, not all of them could produce a Patronous charm under pressure. They are not all Harry Potter. Not to mention, people would be dying right next to them and very few would find the strength to recall a happy enough memory to produce that charm in those conditions. You also mentioned inexperienced imperius witches and wizards in Voldemort's army, the students are inexperienced in full out combat as well. Plus, many of them could barely fight against *adult* witches and wizards when they are barely adults themselves. Even with the help from the Order and professors, they are not yet full fledged fighters.

Also you mentioned Apparation. If we are basing off the movie, the Death Eaters obviously could Apparatus on the school's ground after what Voldemort did. [[https://youtu.be/OJH2VSfQvYM]]

Finally, I don't really think anyone was psych up after Voldemort announced his presence. I could practically feel the fear in the air. All of them knew not everyone is going to make it. It was just adrenaline and tension building up as well as the determination to defend Hogwarts. However, I will agree that there was a sense of rebellion and anticipation to fight too.

** If it weren't for Harry repeating Lily's sacrificial protection, Voldemort would have won. Hell, at the time when Voldemort gave Harry the message to come to him, the first "half" of the Battle was essentially won by the Death Eaters.
