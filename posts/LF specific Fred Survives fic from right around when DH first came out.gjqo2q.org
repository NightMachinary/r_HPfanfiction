:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Actually probably the first fanfic I ever read, now that I think about it.

I feel like I found it from the amazon product discussion forums, but those are defunct now. It was WAY before I started actually reading fanfic, probably a oneshot or something short. But it was specifically based around the twins having some trick item (hats of illusion or similar?) that allowed them to appear in a different place than they actually were.

I adopted it as headcanon until I was able to come to terms with canon, but didn't download or bookmark it (plus that was several computers ago) and now that I'm actually a part of the fandom I'd like to find it again.
