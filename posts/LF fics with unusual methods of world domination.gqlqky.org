We've all seen the guns vs spells debate. But there are other ways to power.

For example, what if some crafty Ravenclaw enchanted a piece of paper to instantly solve math problems written on it? By itself not a big deal, but what if it could do instant magic prime factorization on really large numbers?

Make a bunch of them, put them into printers/scanners and you have a system capable of breaking most digital cryptography systems in use. Bitcoins? All yours. Encrypted emails? Easily cracked. Passwords transmitted over the internet? You got them. Hire a few tech savvy guys and within a short timeframe you could have access to computer systems deciding elections and managing billions in money. Without anyone realizing that anything is wrong. And if anyone does bother you you can listen in on everything they say and do. Voldemort could only dream of that kind of power.


** esama has some really unique takes on powerful Harry. I'd recommend linkao3(1113588) and linkao3(1149623).
