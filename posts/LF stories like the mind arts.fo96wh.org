I read all the fics the author linked and was wondering what other fics are like it. All recs are appreciated, thanks!


** It depends on what way you want the fic to be similar. linkffn(13507192) will feature a moraly ambigious Harry who goes onto become a magical prodigy and occlumency and legilimency will play a major role in it. He is also best friends with Daphne, but I don't know if I'd call the eventual direction of this story similar to “The Mind Arts”

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
