Some people like the actors and actresses who play the Harry Potter characters, some don't. Some are indifferent. But if they were remade today, what actors and actresses would you want, and as which characters?


** Ian McKellen as Dumbledore.

Thought it should have been this at the time, still think it.

**** He was, but that wasn't the only reason.

I believe he was approached when Richard Harris died, but he felt it would be inappropriate (Harris did not think much of McKellen as an actor, apparently).

***** According to McKellen, he had to turn down the role of Dumbledore because of a semi-feud between himself and Richard Harris.

The Dumbledore actor who died in 2002 called him, Derek Jacobi and Kenneth Branagh: ‚ÄúTechnically brilliant, but passionless.‚Äù

Slate reported the full quote as: ‚Äú'I've seen these so-called ‚Äònice' actors. Very able fellows like Ian McKellen and Kenneth Branagh.

‚ÄúBut they're like bank managers. So sweet and careful. Who needs them?'‚Äù

** This is SO hard! Snape is the one I'd find difficult to replace. I know Adam Driver is the fan favorite- but I'd put my vote with Benedict Cumberbatch- he's got the voice and the swag.

Is this for a total re-do of HP or like Marauders era? I'm still hoping to see an awesome HBO/Netflix series where they can go into more detail. But the casting is going to have to be amazing. Cool question- I'm looking forward to reading what other people think!

I agree with the other person that said they'd like to keep the rule of just hiring British actors.

And as for the question, I dunno because I feel like except for a couple exceptions (like Emma for Hermione), everyone else was perfect for their characters
