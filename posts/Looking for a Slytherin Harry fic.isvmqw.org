Honestly I dont remember much of it. And what I do remember, im not even sure fits in the same fic but pleaaaaase.

So the bit I rrmember most is when Sirius is freed, Dumbledore tries to get him a Mind Healer that had inappropriate relations with a client, because this healer is a Gryffindor. He spies on Harry, im sure. And tries to get Ron to be close to Harry to spy on him or something. Idk. I know that Harry is a Slytherin and Dumbledore doesn't like it. Dumbledore is pretty manipulative in it as well. Someone must knowwww.
