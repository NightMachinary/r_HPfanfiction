I'm bored of finding Dark Harry who's really just a misunderstood kid trying to make Daddy Voldemort happy, or a Dark Harry who has ‘'morals” that keep him from doing what he needs to do, or Dark Harry where one minute as prisoner of the light has him suddenly betraying the dark. I want a fic where he's Voldemort-level evil. Tear through anyone in his way evil. Bonus points if he's a vocal believer in pureblood supremacy.

Bashing and slash are fine. Please no mpreg, pottercest, romance/smut-centric plots or genderbending. Thank you!

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Check out The Nightmare Man by Tiro. Linkffn(10182397) It has quite the evil Harry. Also The Downward Spiral saga is awesome. Harry is seriously fucked up, especially in the later books. The first couple in the series are kinda hard to get through, but push through and after that it gets really good. Here's a link to the first one: linkffn(12867536)

  This story chronicles the rise of Harry Potter, the right hand of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Features a dark Harry in Slytherin, from pre-hogwarts to the end of the war. Harry knew nothing of the wizarding world until a teacher from a mysterious school visited him and told him the tale of his father, catapulting him into a world of intrigue, politics and Power.

**** It's just one of the ways authors at ao3 name their works, another pretty popular way is title like this: "something something (something something something)". Nothing to be done about it.

Not a fan of this, but I enjoyed too many works with quirks like that to write them off without checking first. Same with A/Ns at the beginning of work, sometimes they are so atrocious, in poor style and tone, but the work itself is a piece of quality writing.
