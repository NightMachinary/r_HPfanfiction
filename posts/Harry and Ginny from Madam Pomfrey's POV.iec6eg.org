I recall reading a fanfiction a few years ago written from Madam Pomfrey's point of view, which was basically an "I told you so" to the rest of the staff, outlining a series of visits she remembers between Harry and Ginny over the years leading up to the two of them getting together. Does anyone know where that is/what it is called?


** Try asking on [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]].
