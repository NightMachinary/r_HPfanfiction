Hello there

I request some help finding a fic I read some time ago on fanfiction.net that I liked but for some reason I forgot the name xD

It's a Dramione fic, what I remember is that Draco stabs Nagini in the head with a dagger with Manticore blade, after that he tries to escape Voldemort with a broom


** Don't need help, already found it.

It's The Malfoy Redemption
