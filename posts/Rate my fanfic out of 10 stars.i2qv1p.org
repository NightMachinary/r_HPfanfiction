Let me know what I could improve on, please- it's my first one! I posted this a few days ago but I was unsure about adding a link. Basically the premise is 8 teenagers are stand-ins for Harry\\
(Harry died in Voldemort's 1981 attack) and they're from our world.


** Well the first chapter is nothing and has no reason to exist. That's not a good start.

The second chapter has some massive formatting issues to begin with the dialogue. Those formatting issues don't continue past the first few paragraphs, which makes it seem like laziness. And it has the issue of making the actual plot portion of the second chapter almost unreadable.

There's an incredibly amount of anachronism and far too much pop culture. Wooo baseball and minecraft! They're in 1991. Minecraft doesn't exist. Sure, they may have shared memories of it but if that's how they pass their time when thrown into a completely alien society and time...well then.

As for Baseball in the UK. Well, BBC's sports section has one mention of it. And it's a video of Plesac making a play in the field. It does not list it as any of the top eight sports that have their own tabs. The Times, The Evening Standard, and the Telegraph don't mention it at all. And this is in the era of instant communication and information. That comes off as incredibly anachronistic. And no one reading your story gives a shit that the Twins win the 1991 World Series. And they're never going to actually play baseball.

There's problems with math as well. In chapter 9 you have a Qudditch match where one team is up 190-70 and then the losing team catches the snitch as a goal is scored and there's all sorts of argument about what order it happens in. Why? It's 220-190/200. They still lose. They get a penalty shot for...a reason....and score.....and win....Which still doesn't add up. It's at best 220-210.

You also introduce the MC as a 13 year old and then have him acting like an 11 year old. This is pointless and needlessly confusing.

As for structure. I mean there's no glaring spelling issues, so..that's a plus. The grammar is mostly fine if a bit choppy in places. It shows some inexperience from the writer but that's just life with fanfiction.

A lot of it; however, feels short and plotless. Like you post just whatever was finished on any given day. I've written sentences longer than a few of the chapters. As a whole it just seems to be a collection of 'Self Insert and things I'd do at Hogwarts!' Which, I guess fine, but is uninteresting to me.

And there's fannon terminology. Oh yes, must call Draco a ferret. Must use moldy shorts! Drop that its cringe inducing.

It then follows Stations of Cannon which is weird given that everything is acting exactly like Harry exists. Which...seems like it wouldn't be the case. Or should at least be explored. And it's not.

If I had to do what the title of this thread asks I'd probably go three out of ten. It's technically readable. But there's very little that's actually interesting and the plot is pretty much...not relevant. Again, it reads more like a loose collection of 'shit I'd try to do if it was at Hogwarts' than a story.

*** I appreciate the brutal honesty. I'm taking this week to give the dialogue/formatting a massive overhaul. I think the problem was too often I felt too rushed to clobber together a chapter with a decent word count, so some of them aren't really good.

I wasn't very creative starting out, so, I wasn't doing a lot of stuff away from canon outside of Sirius being released, I have a few plot twists planned down the road, which I promise are good. I just need to structure the story so I can do them justice, and I've gotten my friend to help (he's a perfectionist)

The baseball stuff is simply out of my own self interest, so that falls down to personal preference. I was aware not everyone was going to get it, and I was okay with that.

If you want to check back in a few weeks, the dialogue will be less cringe inducing.

Again, thanks for the review. It's nice to get constructive criticism once in a while so you see the actual problems with the story.

*** I can't screw with the plot already now, but I'm going to divert from canon a little bit more down the road
