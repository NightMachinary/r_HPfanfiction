Preferable if Hermione and Draco (or Harry) are in no Relationship with others, so no affairs. Just a one night stand, no love, no romance.

Also since Draco and Hermione had unfriendly schoolyears, she would be reluctant/rejectable. Malfoy however proves that he can be a tender lover.


** Since when did actual racism, repetitive harassment, and joining the guys who want to murder your friend get classified as

"unfriendly school years"

**** jesus. People, i know, that i downplayed dracos deeds, but it was exaggerated and was suppossed to be. Im fully aware of his deeds. But that doesnt matter, as i was asking for fics where they have a ONS with their hard schoolyears as a background....AND i was asking for a Harry/Hermione ONS too. There are a lot of Dramione fics out there and i cant imagine them being romantically involved. Neithertheless people can change over the years, so maybe they are both drunk and have a session

** There is not much point asking for a dramione rec on this sub, as you can probably see. You might do better with dramioneasks on tumblr.

**** Just to echo Colubrina's post: dramioneasks tumblr is a fantastic resource. You will find pretty much any category of D/H stories, all easily accessible through their tags features. Try it out, you don't need to have a tumblr to use it.
