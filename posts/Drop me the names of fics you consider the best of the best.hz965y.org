These are all completed and are of decent quality. There's enough variation that I'm sure there's a fic in there for your tastes. Of all of them, Realignment is my favorite. If you would like some incomplete recommendations as well or some more completed fics of dubious quality, feel free to ask.

** All I have are slashfics but this first one is one of my favs. I highly recommend it even if u are not into slash. There is a lot of focus on the plot and I just beg you to give it a shot since it's so well planned out and the relationships between the ppl are so well written. (Of wizards and heroes) Marvel crossover

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]])

One of the best Harry/Voldemort fics out there. Harry and Voldemort share their dreamscape. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9372596]])

A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magic and Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting. Tom Riddle pov. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

Linkao3(Howl by Shiftylinguini) This series. I linked the first work. I love the characterization.

Also this time travel fic. Bit sad at one point but Happy ending! (Ships Sirius/Harry Hermione/Remus) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers. Harry jumps dimensions as the MoD and starts to work as a Medium in the Sherlock universe

#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  Dora allows it, because she thinks it's sex. That's what Remus tells her, tells himself, tries to tell Sirius. It's physical, and only that, something the wolf needs and needs to take but not something Remus needs, oh no. Remus suspects that deep down ― or possibly not even that deep ― Dora knows that it's more, knows that Sirius is under Remus's skin and inside his bones in a way that one fuck a month can't even begin to sate. But if she has more to say on the matter, she has yet to say it. Remus knows enough about repression to guess that silence doesn't really mean there isn't something to say, and the weight of that feels heavy enough to bury him.
