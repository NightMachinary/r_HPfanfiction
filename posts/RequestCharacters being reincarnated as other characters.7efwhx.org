I'm looking for stories where character are reincarnated as other characters; kind of like a self insert I suppose, but not quite what I'm looking for. More like say canon character is reincarnated as another canon character and we see how differently things end up.

For instance: Harry Potter is Albus Dumbledore, or Salazar Slytherin, or Severus Snape, or Sirius Black ect extra.

Albus Dumbledore is Harry Potter, or whoever. Ect extra.

Any characters are welcomed. Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash. Can be set in any Era and anyone can be the main character.

Are there any stories like that? That just sounds very interesting. (I had the idea and it just sounds interesting, if not a bit confusing I suppose).


** This is on my follow list so I can't recommend it /yet/ but you might be interested.

** I can't find it, but I know I've read one where Harry is reincarnated as Voldemort. Or maybe he time travels and becomes Voldemort? It's been a while, I'm not quite sure. Either way, his mantra becomes "bad things happen to wizards who meddle with time" so he intentionally does everything that Voldemort did because the sanctity of the timeline has to be preserved or something. I remember it being quite haunting. Anyone know it?

** linkao3(25241499) is not *exactly* a reincarnation fic, but I think it's close enough, honestly. This fic has (eventually) some things I usually do *not* like at all in it--can't really be too specific without spoilers--but it's super inventive and very entertaining. It can be rather slow at times when it gets really deep into the historical bits, and truthfully I don't know enough about medieval UK/Europe to know if it's actually well-researched or not, but the level of detail seems to indicate that it is. It's a WIP, but it's on part four now and (I think) over 400k words.

linkao3(18163144) This is also a WIP and involves a bit of time travel as well as putting Hermione into a new body, but it's quite interesting so far--I personally love when fics go into more detail about Slytherin House and pureblood culture.

** So you get an insane nutbug who had to go through all of early childhood development with their memories of their previous life intact, what amounts to a mindwipe as childhood brain development destroys whatever memories were left over or (and that is a point stressed by centuries of expertise in reincarnation) unless someone in the Celestial Bureaucracy really fucked up all you get is an AU character with a slightly different personality.

Or you get a dumbass fanfic that ignores all the actually interesting bits regarding reincarnnation in favour of destroying two characters for the price of one.
