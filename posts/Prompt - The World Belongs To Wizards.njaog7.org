Wizards have taken over the world and forced Muggles to live below them. Muggles are treated as inferior and the world belongs to wizards. But one day, a witch made a prophecy:

/"It will be born of 2 Muggles, a child with a power greater than that of all wizards. That child will be" The Chosen One "and will save the Muggles and establish equality"/

Upon finding out about it, the wizarding government begins a hunt for the child. The child's family and friends hide and must train and protect the child until it is time to fulfill their destiny and start the rebellion to save the Muggles


** Not a prompt response but linkao3(The Philosopher King by RedHorse) is pretty close to your situation.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

** The muggles /literally/ live beneath the wizards. They've used some sort of ritual to seal off the earth's surface from the crust below, after driving the muggles, centaurs, goblins, dwarves, dementors, spirits, ghosts, etc underground. Out of sight, out of mind, they thought - but it was not to be. The muggles adapted with the help of the goblins, building a great underground empire that spans much of the known world, and while beings like the Centaurs also survive, they can't truly thrive while kilometers of rock separate them from the stars.

And so, in the under-empire, resentment stirs, and plans are drawn, plans for revenge and retribution should the crust crack and all that lays beneath be freed once more. Because you see, a similar prophecy exists beneath:

/Born to two of the powerless,/

/A child of two worlds, separated only by stone and soil/

/It shall have a power greater than any exists above/

/And when its time comes, it will free us all/

For beneath the earth, closer to its core, exists another kind of power, another kind of magic - a deeper, older kind, one inherent to mother earth, one that has existed before the fleeting life above and will continue to exist long after the sun has died and the surface has frozen over.
