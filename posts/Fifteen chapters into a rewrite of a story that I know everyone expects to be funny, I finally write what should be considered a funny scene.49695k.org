(Harry hurts himself during training and ends up in hospital wing for half a day or so, mostly sleeping it off)

When he appeared at dinner that night, nearly the entirety of the school stood and applauded him. He stopped and stared, wondering what was going on.

Deciding to ignore it until he had food in him, he walked to Gryffindor table.

"What the hell are they doing?" he asked when he sat down in between Hermione and Sophie.

"We heard you defeated a dragon, saved a princess, married her, had two kids in a time compression chamber, and they're starting at Hogwarts next year," one of the Weasley twins said.

"Well, that's what we've been telling everyone, actually."

"A Hufflepuff said you drank Hagrid under the table and it killed him and all it did was make you a little sick. Then he fell on you," Sterling said breathlessly.

Harry looked up at the staff table. Hagrid and Professor Green were laughing at something. Harry looked back at Sterling and asked, "Are you insaneâ€½ Hagrid's right there!"

"That's just a golem so the other students aren't frightened," Figgis stated matter-of-factly.

Harry's head hit the table hard enough there was blood.

...

When I first started writing the Darkness!Harry story idea, comedic moments just happened. It took at least fifty pages to finally have one happen.

** It's a little too over the top for me, personally. Humour is exaggerated, sure, but it still needs to feel like something that could feasibly happen.

** It feels too much like it breaks suspension of disbelief. It would only really work in a crack fic, and if you're fifty pages in without any funny scenes so far it's not going to go across that well, I think.

There's nothing wrong with it inherently, if you've written a story with intentionally over-the-top humour so far, but if you just drop it into a canon-ish type of story it won't work well.

** it's out of context so it's hard to judge accurately but I think it's fine. I'd read the story for sure.

** It's fairly cartoonish. if that's the vibe you're going for, watch some slapstick comedy to get you in the mood.
