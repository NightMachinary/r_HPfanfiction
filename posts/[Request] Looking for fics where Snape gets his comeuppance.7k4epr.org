** I wouldn't go so far to say "Like A Red-Headed Stepchild" bashes Snape, but he does get considerably more migraines than he did in canon, since Harry's taken in by the Weasleys and Percy shares his younger brothers' sense of humor.

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** "The Grass is Always Greener" by kb0 bashes both Snape and Ron pretty heavily, and Dumbledore somewhat mildly.

  During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG

** Not /too/ drastic, but I have what I consider to be a pretty funny revenge taken against Snape in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12682621/12/The-Parselmouth-of-Gryffindor][the latest chapter]] of my story. If you don't want to bother reading the rest, all you need to know is that Hermione is a Parselmouth, has befriended the Basilisk, and that there's currently a Boggart in Snape's class pretending to be a student.

**** Ok, it was an attempt at humor. I saw that the post had been empty for a while, couldn't think of any stories off the top of my head.

Also, Snape suffers /hard/ in canon. The woman he loved marries a guy he hates. He then gives information that leads to the death of said woman. He's a spy for years. He's forced to kill his own mentor. He finds out the boy he swore to protect has to walk to his own death.

Also, yes, there are things worse than death. But, death sucks pretty hard too.

***** That said, a lot of his suffering is either a result of his own actions or a result of him just not being able to let go of things or people. As such, some people feel that the suffering he gets in canon, the suffering that is caused pretty much by his own person, does not really cut it.
