A week ago, I got a wand from Etsy made from birch. As the description for birch isn't on Pottermore (though does exist as a wand wood), me and a friend decided to come up with one:

#+begin_quote
  Birch wands are loyal to their owners, and demand it in return, usually backfiring to those who use the wand forcibly against the owner or the owner's friends.

  The ideal owner of such a wand is loyal, hardworking, and confident in themselves and therefore wands made from birch are likely to underperform if the owner practices laziness.

  Moreover, if the owner of a birch wand endorses lying or falsities of any sort while using the wand, the wand's power will lessen until the endorsement has passed.

What characteristics would you give other woods that aren't described Pottermore?

I don't believe bamboo was on the list. Strictly speaking, it's a grass.

*** More importantly, what would it's name be? All Ikea items have names after all. For instance I have a chair called Markus

*** Pointless. A wand made yourself is unlikely to work.
