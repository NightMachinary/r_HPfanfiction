** Harry/Fleur - I wish they would have less angst and more romance, and that the dynamic would include Fleur teaching Harry stuff and taking him to nice places around the world.

Also, Harry maturing a bit faster emotionally due to her.

I also really want one where Harry is tired of England and their yo-yo moods with him and just ditches them with Fleur for greener pastures.

*** I would love to see one where Fleur is teaching Harry the finer things in life and how to enjoy his status while Harry teachers Fleur the wonders of being a nobody in the Muggle world while he quietly checks off his prehogwarts bucket list. Post War, you can have action scenes if you want to but it's a cute romantic story about Two people who are showing each other the attention and care they usually never receive

***** Nympho!Luna is one of the weirder fanon concepts definitely. I remember a fic where she was dating Draco and then suddenly, she started sucking Lucius's dick. In front of Draco and some other characters. And Draco explains it away by saying something like "Luna believes sex should be shared," and all the others (Pansy, Harry, Hermione, Neville) are just like "ok then" and carry on with their conversation. Utterly weird and sort of creepy because as you say she's so wholesome. I'd even go as far as childlike.

I find the Seer!Luna trope really strange as well. She'll suddenly speak in riddles that are blindingly obvious in their meaning but all the other characters except Harry don't understand. "Soon the bumblebee will leave the hive" was my personal lowlight of this trope. Yes, we get it, Dumbledore will have to leave Hogwarts. A five year old could have interpreted that one, and the author had Hermione (of all people) not getting the meaning.

Luna isn't some sort of idiot savant that can't carry on a normal conversation. Nor is she any kind of pervert.

If Luna was a Muggle, she'd be a typical art student. Probably wears mismatched shoes and homemade jewelry. Arty. Is into low level conspiracy theories but not the dangerous or racist ones. Reads magazines about astrology and aliens. Gets excellent grades on everything and is a really good friend. Would never cheat on a boyfriend. Knowledgeable AF if you get her on the right topic. Generally wholesome but odd. Is the only person under 21 to still have a landline phone.

** My favourite pairing is Harry/Hermione. However, I detest pretty much all Harry/Hermione fanfiction (and, for that matter, almost all fanfic depictions of Hermione).

There are many problems that beset the Harry/Hermione pairing.

*Fics skip the good part*

The vast majority of Harry/Hermione fanfics have them get together extremely quickly after the fic begins. The way they do this is by starting the fic in an AU where Harry and Hermione's canonical relationship is replaced with a dynamic where they /each already have feelings for each other, they just haven't expressed them yet/.

All it takes, therefore, for them to get together is for them to communicate these pre-existing feelings. And once they're together, they are immediately head-over-heels for each other, because they've each been harbouring these intense, hidden feelings of deep love and devotion for so long.

Basically, the authors completely skip the actually interesting part of Harry/Hermione fics: how to build them up from their canonical dynamic to a romantic dynamic.

That is the part I am most interested in, as a reader. As someone who once crushed pretty hard on a very close female friend, I am a sucker for "best friends to lovers" storylines done well. But "oh, we both actually are really into each other, let's completely displace our previous dynamic with an entirely different one overnight" is not that storyline. It's a dismal state of affairs that Harry/Hermione smut fics can actually do this a lot better than serious romance fics - perhaps because suddenly seeing a friend in a sexual light is a fairly realistic way to shift perception out of an established dynamic.

Ultimately, I think this problem is driven by the way that so many people view the pairing as so much more than just a pairing ("shippers", "Harmonians", etc.). These people are obsessed with the idea that Harry/Hermione should have been canon; as such, they use fanfic as a way to right this wrong by attributing to the characters, from the very start of the fic, the feelings which they consider Harry and Hermione should have felt in canon.

No good ever comes from writing fanfic as an argument to justify something, however. You just end up with a bad fic and a bad argument.

*Super!Hermione*

Another major problem with the genre is the way authors go overboard with Hermione's character. It's not enough for them for Hermione to be a very intelligent, hard working, well-read girl with an excellent memory. They have to make her as gifted as Voldemort; as knowledgeable as Dumbledore; as powerful as Harry - and often with a side serving of an additional prophecy to redistribute some of Harry's role as the hero to her.

The end result is a Mary Sue who feels like she is subverting Harry's place as the rightful hero of the story.

In general, authors are so confused about what it means to write a strong female character. It doesn't mean they have to be uber powerful. It doesn't mean they have to have some great fate or influence important events. /It means they have to have an identifiable personality, a distinct voice, and individual agency/.

There are so many fics where Hermione is the second coming of Merlin, but ultimately she and Harry operate as basically a single entity. This is not a strong female character. She's powerful, but she still has no agency.

A Hermione who retains her canonical magical ability (that is, maybe around the same level as Remus Lupin) but who has her own interests, goals, opinions etc. and who disagrees with Harry about things where their opinions differ, and they have to learn, as a couple, /how to disagree and remain together/, is an infinitely stronger character than Hermione the goddess of magic who is perfectly in tune with Harry.

*Bashing*

Not much needs to be said here, really. So many Harry/Hermione stories engage in all the tiresome tropes we're all well aware of.

*Mugglewank*

Among the tiresome tropes, king among them has to be Mugglewank, which is particularly egregious in Harry/Hermione fics. Just no.

*Fluff*

This kinda ties into point #1, but far too many Harry/Hermione fics are just sickly sweet to the point of repulsiveness. This is a universal problem across all romance except perhaps the "enemies to lovers" genre (though even in that, it often devolves to fluff eventually). It's a particularly bad problem in Harry/Hermione fics though, because neither Harry nor Hermione strike me as the type to engage in this type of sickly sweet behaviour. They're both pretty down-to-earth, reserved people.

Basically: no emotions please, I'm English.

So yeah. If anyone can think of a Harry/Hermione fic which meets the above criteria I would welcome your recommendations. I'm not going to hold my breath, however.

**** I think Mugglewank is particularly egregious in Harry/Hermione fics:

1. Because when they write Mugglewank, Harmonians tend to go harder, with more ridiculous ideas (SAS!Mr Granger, for example).

2. Because in the books, Hermione is a prime example of a character who looks down on Muggle technology (referring to it as a "replacement for magic") and generally adopts a paternalistic attitude towards Muggles (altering her parents' memories without their knowledge or consent).

****** I disagree that "space race" is something superior about Muggle society. I mean, it's not like the contemporary muggle world is some interstellar utopia. They just sent a dozen men to the moon in the 60s and have some cool satellites. We don't even know that there's never been a wizard in space. And the books don't go into detail about Astronomy. I've read a fic where wizard telescopes are capable of zooming in in the surface of Mars. That would be infinitely better "tech" than what Muggles have, and for all we know it could be true of canon.

Ron... well, making Ron work in Harmony requires giving him something of his own to be good at, not just wizard chess and playing second fiddle to Harry in Quidditch. Bonus if he's increasingly exasperated over the two of them not getting together despite obviously wanting to and just snaps, rants for a bit, then storms off to get a drink.

** Dramione is not my favorite but its the one that needs the most help. I wish more authors actually kept their characters in line with the books or at least gave them a reason for the deviation. Particular is 8th hogwarts fics. Suddenly Draco is sorry and Hermione forgives hom instantly 6 months after the war? Nah uh. Fred's body isn't even cold yet. Try again. Its a shame because they are very similar characters and in a world without the war I could totally see them dating by 7th year because they do compliment each other quiet well when you removed the death eater, blood purist, responsible for her friends deaths bit. Not that that can't be handled in the proper fic but it takes more time than people want to give.

Favorite: I love the Weasley twins and anyone. Their biggest sin is that there aren't more of them. (Also people tend to spend too much time on the sex side of things and not enough on plot.)

**** I actually think he's a very deep character if you look at it from a human perspective. He was born into privilege and racism enjoying it fully until age 15-16. After that point he realizes how fucked up the whole thing is because his parents, the ones who were supposed to keep him safe, followed the wrong views. Views he had been told since he was a child and had repeated to him daily since. Then at 16 he is suddenly responsible for an impossible task which he cannot fail or risk losing his family. He may be wrong and pretentious but he is still just a child and thinks like one. What would you do?

Like don't get me wrong. He's a shit. But I recall being 15 and most boys were shits until 17+. As a 15 year old I also did some insanely dangerous and stupid things that I should not have emerged unscathed from. (Luckily I did). Like sure maybe some parts of muggle psychology don't apply but he's still human. Let's remove magic and put him in a familar setting. Raised by old money white supremacist. Maybe he pulls that shit off in boarding school surrounded by people of the same mindset. But then he goes to some ivy league college like he's expected to only to find the top of the classes and clubs filled with people from everywhere. People who will not tolerate that kind of behavior. Over time that opinion changes based on experiences he gains away from home. Now i am not saying this would 100 percent happen, some kids are raised racist and never let it go. But I know a hell of a lot more who were ashamed of their parents behavior and distanced themselves from them.

And that was my dissertation proposal on Draco Malfoy: an introspective.

Some possible bias: overdrawn empathy, Tom Felton, dudes with white hair, British accents, and too much free time.

*** I think the closest high-school stereotype Snape would fulfill is the nerd.

I personally don't care much for the high-school genre, but it'd be an interesting novelty when most authors keep writing Snape-centric Peggy Sue fics with the ship.

**** (I accidentally deleted my prev comment pls don't mind I'm a dumbass 😅)

Yeah I just want some variety, I want to see how their relationship would work out in different settings, different time eras maybe? I just want more different types of AUs and not just the Peggy sue

In Another life is an AU fic which showcases a cute muggle AU and I really really really enjoyed that. linkffn(In Another Life by MyPhoenixLament)

** Harry with Female Tom Riddle, like in the fic Thunderstorm or Departure from de Diary.

Basically because of the same reason why people like Haphne.\\
I love the contrast beetween the passionate, brave and noble Harry and the ruthless, cold and agressive Riddle, Thunderstorm and departure had such awesome chemical between them that was awesome.
