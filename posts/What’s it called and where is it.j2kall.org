:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey so please don't hate on me but I love Drarry and I'd appreciate some help on locating a fanfic.

A friend of mine mentioned a fanfic where Hermione left with Ron when they were hunting for the Horcruxes in the Deathly Hallows. Anyway, Harry feels betrayed/abandoned so he finds Voldy. Harry tells Voldy that he is a Horcrux and so Voldy protects him. Harry and Draco end up dating. I don't know what fanfiction website it's on but I can narrow it down to three possible sites: Wattpad, Archive of Our Own, [[https://fanfiction.net/][fanfiction.net]]

** Ah-we found a brave one! Bringing up drarry in [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]]? How daring.

Lmao-Im just joking. KindaðŸ¤£ . I went looking for the same fic not to long long ago. It's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594/chapters/9926705][Temptation on the Warfront by alizarincrimson]] . Happy reading!

Edit: whoops! No it's not. I only read the first part of the description and thought I new it- sorry!! Idk that story but it sounds interesting.

You should also try [[/r/hpslash][r/hpslash]] and [[/r/harrymort][r/harrymort]]. I just found a bunch of platonic mentoring fics on there the other day-I'm sure someone could help you out.

Hope you find it!!

** It's not really what you're looking for, but these two also go away (this was written by Google translator, so it may be wrong)
