This has been driving me insane - it's one of my all time favorites. Set post-hogwarts, it begins with Draco finding Harry drunk in a bar, and decides to intervene. Harry ends up staying at Malfoy manor while he recovers, and Andromeda and Teddy move in to help. He eventually meets Daphne through Astoria, and they eventually try a date. It had some Ginn bashing and more minor Hermione bashing, but overall was just a lot of fun.

I don't remember the author's name, but it was on ff.net when I last saw it. Cheers

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

*** Thanks so much. I couldn't find it in my favorites, my bookmark went missing and I must have deleted the copy I had on my kindle.
