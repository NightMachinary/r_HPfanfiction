** Wouldn't that just make him come back to life since it would kill the horcrux instead of Harry? This is assuming it can destroy a Horcrux. It'd change the prophecy completely too. It would be interesting if at one point, the story focused on Sirius somehow bringing Harry back from the dead, maybe even with an upgrade or something.
