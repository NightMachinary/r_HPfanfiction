  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  ...and finally it was done! But what the public saw as the glorious day of Britain's liberation from the yoke of the Dark Lord turned out to be nothing more than one more funeral for Harry -- a few more friends he had to lay to rest. This time, however, there weren't any left to accompany him. Just where had he gone wrong...? Tragedy, Hurt, Romance...Time-Travel? OneShot

Something along the lines of what you are looking for? I've recommended this fanfic a couple of times over the last few days, I can really recommend it, but trust me, it gets real dark near the end. I can guarantee you'll suffer a light depression yourself after reading this one, at least I had.

Still, really good and extremely well written. I hope it fits your search parameters.

*** I don't know about that one.

The idea and atmosphere might be good, but it's a bit of a stretch to call it a well-written story. I mean, there are at least a dozen or more errors per page, not to mention the puzzling thing the author does with the brackets.

Editing is a mess, the language isn't great and full of mistakes, and the execution of the idea is pretty trite and basically requires all major characters to be name-sake OCs.

** Linkffn(4113087) doesn't necessarily have mental illness but more brain damage but might be similar to something you are looking for. I vaguely remembered this fic and thought it was mental illness, but when I found it, it wasn't. I linked it anyway just in case you would want to read it.

Basically when Voldemort tries to AK him he causes brain damage and Petunia steps up and takes care of him.

*** I'm actually rereading this right now, after recently learning more about MPD. One of the things I learned is that MPD is an outdated term, and dissociative identity disorder (DID) is the current term. When I first read this fic, I thought a lot of the MPD descriptions were exaggerations or just interesting plot devices, but it was really cool to learn a lot of it is accurate!

If anyone is interested, I've been watching dissociaDID YouTube videos to learn about the disorder. Really interesting and I'm glad that this fic and dissociaDID videos are removing harmful misconceptions.

  Harry Potter watched his mother die when he was fifteen months old, a piece of Voldemort's soul invaded his own, Vernon abused him, Petunia tore him to shreds with her hateful words, and Lockhart molested him throughout Second-year. After all that trauma, is it any wonder Harry created multiple personalities to deal with it all? In Harry's third year, Severus Snape decides to do something about it. He gives Harry therapy in secret, and this opens Harry up to a friendship with Neville Longbottom, another victim of Lockhart's perversions, and Draco Malfoy who can understand Harry's Slytherin alter better than anyone else.
