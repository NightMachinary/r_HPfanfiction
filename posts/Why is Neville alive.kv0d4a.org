I mean the bloke was just sitting there while the Lestranges tortured his parents and yet they didn't kill him off as well?


** There's nothing concrete in canon, but I think it's been said that Frank and/or Alice were captured.

  ‘We have heard the evidence against you. The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror -- Frank Longbottom -- and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, He Who Must Not Be Named --'

  ‘Father, I didn't!' shrieked the boy in chains below. ‘I didn't, I swear it, Father, don't send me back to the Dementors --'

  ‘You are further accused,' bellowed Mr Crouch, ‘of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom's wife, when he would not give you information ...

-HPGoF, ch 30.

Perhaps Neville's parents were taken from their home when Neville wasn't around (by his grandmother, maybe?), or they were kidnapped when on Auror duty, at work, on an outing, etc.?

I'm not sure if Neville personally witnessed the torture session. It's more the fourth film that makes it seem like Neville had actually been there as a baby. But in terms of the books I don't think anything's been said on that. Neville's reaction could just be due to actually seeing the curse that he knew messed up his parents.

So perhaps Neville survived due to not having been present at the torture scene? Or perhaps the torturers were captured before they could do Neville next? JKR left it vague.

** Why would they? They supposedly wanted to get the information of where Voldemort was from them, right? So, killing the kid or the two Longbottoms means they definitely won't be able to get that information from them. That'd be a last step, and they got caught before they finished.

*** Seems ineffective considering Bellatrix's rep as Voldemort's best death eater, I would've used Neville as leverage if I was her and killed him if they didn't say anything

**** Exactly my point. "Do this or I'll kill your son!" loses literally all effect once you've actually killed him. At that point, they've no longer got any reason to cooperate at all.

****** Precisely. Can't torture the dead. Unless Frankenstein is somehow real in HP, I suppose. I don't think Inferi-ing them really counts.

** OH My God [[/u/RoyalAct4][u/RoyalAct4]] you can't just ask someone why they are alive!!!!!!!!

I think it's said the parentes were captured, so Neville wasn't with them. But I don't know if there is confirmation of where he was staying at the time, maybe with grandma?

** Given that all of them were captured immediately afterwards and viewed as obviously guilty I always assumed the Lestranges were caught in the act, so never finished what they were planning to do.

** I really love: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSbXEFmc9Qk][Neville Longbottom and the Black Witch]]

Its a YouTube Video that goes into the idea of what happened with the Longbottoms. Obviously it is fanon, but still great none the less :)

** PLOT

and everything is pretty vague. so maybe he wasn't even there? or maybe the longbottoms were somewhere else?

jkr was really pretty vague about everything, and the movies blend facts.

** Maybe just have it that prophecy always finds a way to get finished? Maybe Harry wasn't accepted by the prophecy as the boy who lived yet. So magic didn't set Harry as the child in the prophecy. With I think the prophecy said dark lord in OotP you could have it that magic has not chose the dark lord Harry has to fight.

It could could change the outlook on a manipulative Dumbledore by not focusing on Harry's development anything could be the power he knows not if Harry ends up having to fight him to survive. It could fill in the plot holes of Dumbledore not knowing the secret keeper for the Potter's and Sirius being Harry's godfather. He could view himself as the possible dark lord of the prophecy.

** I don't think the death eaters knew why they were sent to the Longbottoms, because I don't think voldy would tell his followers that he fears two toddlers to kill him. As no-one except Dumbledore knew the full prophecy, voldy and Snape knew half of it. I believe they did as they were told, 'get rid of the Longbottoms' they might even enjoyed leaving Neville alone to his misery, always thinking why he was left alone, voldy never rectified their mistakes as he "died".
