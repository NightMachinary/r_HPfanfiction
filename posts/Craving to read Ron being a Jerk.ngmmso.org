Send me you best fic that involves Ron just being a horrible person.

That could be calling Hermione names or hating Harry cause he STOLE Hermione.

Honestly I just want some dickish Ron....

Thanks in advance!

Any ship welcome!

Though I am in a Harry/Hermione mood rn...

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

**** Here you go, sorry I was in the middle of something before. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17452775/chapters/41095088]]) I like the Ron in this one because it's manipulative Dumbledore and they're like â€˜is Ron being spelled to be an arsehole?' but Ron is just an arsehole naturally, ha ha. And he'd not stupid either, so I feel like it's quality Ron bashing

  What if Dobby bound himself to Harry without Harry knowing about it? How would that influence the story?

** Give me a bit I'm sorting through my fanfics and categorizing them on paper. I have a ton of bashing fics so it will take a bit of time.
