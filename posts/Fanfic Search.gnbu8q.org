I was reading some stuff and thought about some stuff. What if harry's parents were alive and neville's parents were conscious? Pls help find one that's complete and over 100,000 words. Best if harry was a metamorph and even better if harry was a metamorph that can transform into a girl.


** Not exactly what you asked for but “Let's Try Again” by DayDreamer315

“After the war Harry Potter's world falls apart. Then he is offered a chance to try and make a better future for himself and his friends. Of course things are never simple.”

Harry's parents are alive - all sets of them - and the Longbottoms are sane and well.

(Time-travel, fix-it, redo, Potter!Luck, Dumbledore!Bashing, Selective Weasley!Bashing, Hermione Granger!Bashing, Lily Evans!Bashing, Manipulative!Dumbledore)

(Warning: this is Harry/Fred/George, James/Severus, and Sirius/Remus so if you don't like slash or these ships then best not read.)
