** I never understood why James' sacrifice didn't count to save Lily or Harry. He knew he'd die when he sent Lily to the nursery, yet he willingly stood behind to buy them time and save their lives. His sacrifice didn't count just because he wasn't given the choice to stand aside?

*** The official word or consensus (I forget which) is that it is because Lily had the /choice/ not to die because of Snape's request, which Voldemort was honoring. He asked her to step aside several times, and she chose to die rather than give up her baby and live. James was incredibly brave, but he never had a choice, thus it didn't count as a sacrifice in the same way.

***** In the sense that every action we take is a choice, yes. But, at least magically, Lily's sacrifice was a much different kind of choice. Clearly this occurrence of magical protection is so extraordinarily rare as to be unknown to the wizarding world, so it would have to take something much more than just putting yourself in danger to help another.

(Also James happened to be wandless, so he had even less choice, but that doesn't seem to be a deciding factor.)

*** In order to invoke the magic you have to willingly die, when having the choice to live, with the belief your death won't actually directly save anyone. James was not given the chance to live. Lily and Harry were.

Edit: I should note the third requirement is just a conclusion I came to, apparently. I can't find a quote for it. But it works for both Harry's and Lily's sacrifices, and without it the sacrificial magic would be far more common, so it's the only thing that makes sense.

****** Wait, people here think the blood wards don't exist? What. They are absolutely a thing. It isn't even debatable, it's literally referenced numerous times in the books.

It's not called blood wards, but Dumbledore explicitly says Lily's sacrifice allowed him to place a protective charm over Privet Drive to keep Voldemort (and his followers) away.

When Voldemort bypasses Lily's sacrificial magic through taking Harry's blood, the protection over Privet Drive continues to work.

Edit: I am aware the words "blood ward" aren't mentioned. Obviously I'm still referring to the protection set over Privet Drive when I say blood wards. Can we not be pedantic for once.

** I have read, but would /not/ recommend, a couple of Lily-lives fics, as a result of them being basically the 2nd most common setup (after Peggy Sue) for the pairing I like the most (LESS). There's far too many issues with the premise that those fics simply just ignore (the Prophecy tell being the obvious one, but also the complete lack of redemption at this point, among other things), and the only fic of the kind I'd be willing to recommend would be Puzzle, but that one doesn't fulfill your request anyway because Harry dies in it and Voldemort is still at large.

So if you see a fic with the ship with this premise, unless you really like the ship and are willing to brush over the obvious issues, I suggest skipping them.

** Hm. This would cause some large changes to the overall narrative:

- First off, James will die first in the vast majority of scenarios. Lily guards the nursery, James the door. Don't really see them switching places.

- Seeing as how Lily survives and is an adult, I very much doubt that any legend such as the Boy-Who-Lived would be created, a legend that was fueled by the absolute silence on the part of anyone in the know about Harry's whereabouts. There won't be any books, paraphanelia or any other such nonsense published, because Lily is alive and well and not the kind of person to bask in fame.

- The phenomenon is much better researched, for the most part because Dumbledore doesn't get his hands on Lily in any capacity, seeing as how she's an adult, as well as a Head of House (Who knows what that actually means, though). So however the Horcrux was diagnosed the first time, it will happen again, only this time, Lily finds out and is most likely not pleased. It'll most likely be named the "(James/Lily) Potter Effect", and dissected by researchers until its cause is found. What happens then is anyone's guess. Non-Dark magic that requires a willing sacrifice and blocks the Killing Curse?

- The Prophecy is shot to all Hell. In the beginning, Dumbledore might think that Neville is the new participant, and his family moves to a secure location, preventing Frank and Alice's fates. Most likely, Dumbledore tries and fails to bend the prophecy into a shape that makes sense, fails, gets drunk and prepares to take care of the problem himself once it rears its head again.

- This kick in the bum, and having no prophecised hero available, will drive him to begin his research into Horcruxes much sooner, and he finds most of them before Harry even gets to Hogwarts. He doesn't die to the ring, though, as he takes Snape with him on the trip (with the dark lord inactive, Snape can move freely against him without fear of detection through the Mark)

- All the Horcruxes, save for Nagini, are destroyed by the time Harry comes to Hogwarts, and the trap for the Philosopher's stone happens as normal, Quirrel still becomes possessed and tries to gain entry to the chamber. Being raised by a relatively sensible (and smart, and loving) Lily and his uncles Sirius & Remus, I doubt that Harry would find the Mirror or investigate the corridor on the third floor deeper than "that's private property", especially after consulting with said adults, who contact Dumbledore and then tell him not to do it, and Quirrellmort stays in the Mirror room for a while. Eventually, Voldemort looks into it himself and becomes enthralled, until Dumbledore exorcises him and Quirrell may or may not survive.

- With the diary gone, second year is normal, and third year as well, because Sirius is never imprisoned. Peter is most likely never found, because a Rat can hide pretty well, even if he doesn't stay with the Weasleys (Lily and them were good friends, and would visit)

- In fourth, the whole thing still happens, but Voldemort may have Harry entered into the gobled purely because he's the son of his most hated enemy. Harry recieves help from his family and breezes through the tasks. He always has some sort of tracker on his person on principle.

- Voldemort may or may not attempt and fail to get Lily's blood, and may or may not accept it by proxy and snatch Harry instead. In any case, he will eventually be resurrected (blood of the enemy, not the greatest enemy, anyone who he hates and wants to kill is fair game) and work from the shadows as normal.

- Eventually, it comes to a confrontation in the Department of Mysteries and he's decisively beat when he tries to nab the Prophecy to see what it says.

- He rejoins the spirit world as an irate wraith, and re-possesses Nagini, inadvertently destroying the Horcrux that is there. The snake is eventually found as all his followers run away like the cowards they are, and summarily destroyed. He is now dead.

My other thought is that Dumbledore probably would still seek the ring without Snape, because he wants to try the resurrection stone to speak to his sister. Perhaps this would not happen if Lily got the cloak back as Dumbledore would have only the want from the triad.
