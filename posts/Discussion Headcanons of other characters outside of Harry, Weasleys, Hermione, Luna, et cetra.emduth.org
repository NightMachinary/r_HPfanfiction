Your headcanon of minor characters? Under used or not talked about characters? Or in between?

Who ends up with who? What job do the characters get? What kind of a family life do they have? Et cetra.

Some of mine:

The ones who were sorted in Harry's year, end of having a reuinion every 5 years, no matter what is going on with their life. Other years got wind of it, and decided to do reunions of their own.

Susan got interested to become a Healer, after helping the students out when the Carrows were teachers.

Blaise Zabini had tried to help while the Carrows were in control, doing it in the shadows. He had helped freed students, who were chained, helped students who were passed out from torture, et cetra. he became interested in healing the Mind, and became a Mind Healer. Even going to the Muggle World, and getting a degree as a psychologist.

Percy never got over how stupid he had been, going to the Ministry side, no matter how nice his relatives, or Harry, or Hermione was to him; that self hatred never went away. The only one that made it better was Audrey.

I've read stories where Seamus is straight, where he is gay. Now my headcanon is: He doesn't care what gender you are, as long as he likes you/find you interesting enough.

Lee Jordan became a journalist at the Quibbler, after the war; many people subscribed to the Quibbler, more then to the Daily Prophect, Luna's father continued to bring the truth to the people, needing more people to help him.

George and Angelina's son Freddie ended up getting interested in building Muggle Houses, while their daughter Roxanne (Roxie) ended up doing her own thing, Dean eventually helped George and Ron out with the joke shop.

Padma Patil and Anthony Goldestein ended up together, some of the students met up regularly, even without the reunion to worry about. Ernie had been friends with Anthony while at school, and Padma and Anthony hit it off, never really hanging out at school, despite being in the same house.

Audrey is a Muggle in my headcanon. A group of people at the Ministry had to practically force Percy to go to a club, it happened to be a Muggle club; whereas Audrey's friends had also had to force Audrey to the club, they eventually met there, and left their friends behind, talking about a lot of stuff.


** I found a certain website a while back, it's sadly gone now, that delved into the historical distribution of surnames in the UK, going a bit more in depth than just the linguistical meaning. Each name had whole paragraphs explaining exactly what the name meant, what this or that occupation was in medeival times, the linguistical influences the Vikings left, all kinds of cool stuff. According to this website, the Parkinson name was historically common in Lancashire. So I like to imagine a Pansy who finds pureblood ideals attractive because she grew up on stories of great aunt Agnes Nutter, and when Lancashire was industrializing her great-grandfather had to contend with muggles taking more and more land to turn towards heavy industry that wizards neither needed nor wanted, so Pansy feels like she has familial grudges against muggles.

** I've always like the idea that Peter's Betrayal was a far more tragic story.

- The first time James and Lily 'defy' Voldemort, he kicks the shit out of them without much effort.
- Peter, who is cowering in a nearby building, sees said Ass-whooping.
- Realizing they could never hope to beat such a monster, Peter approaches him and makes a deal instead: Turn spy, and Voldemort doesn't kill his friends.
- Voldemort agrees, and the next two times he tries to recruit the Potters, they come out of the encounters in significantly better (though still obviously injured) shape.
- When the Fidelius plan is discussed, it's Peter's idea to switch secret keepers. Not to betray James an Lily, but to actually stop Sirius from being targeted as well. Peter's in too deep at this point, and he figures since he's already bargained for their lives once, he can do it again.
- Voldemort agrees to Peters request, like he does to Snape's.
- Finally, Voldemort breaks his promises.

** I have a headcanon that James' parents died during his 6th year (or in the summer after 5th year). This gave him a reality check, giving him the reality of war at his doorstep. This led him to get his act together, and focus on studies and protecting those close to him rather than harassing Slytherins. This allows me to plausibly combine his pre-6th year bullying (no matter what you think of Snape, bullying is never an excuse. Especially not after he was nearly killed as-is), with him becoming Head Boy and maturing, becoming the Auror he was after graduation until he was killed, and dying for his wife and child.

** Draco eventually reconciles with Andromeda & Harry and becomes an uncle of sorts to Teddy. Scorpius grows up having a connection to him and thinks of him as a much older brother because they're both only children.

Lavender with werewolf tendencies (if not a straight up werewolf) and heavy scarring. She becomes the author of a mega-popular romance/adventure series with a strong focus on the discrimination & mistreatment faced by creatures, based on her own adventures & discussions with others. It becomes the "Uncle Tom's Cabin" of the creature rights movement, bringing the formerly taboo topic to every magical household in the UK. She marries Parvati and their life is never boring.

Charlie & Hagrid both remain single for the rest of their lives and are best friends/business partners.

I know Ron is a main character, but I always liked the idea of him retiring from the aurors because of the kids? I can see him as a stay at home dad, especially considering Hermione's role as MoM. The prime minister of NZ & her fiance have the same dynamic pretty much.

** Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan are cool bros. They host parties all the time and put serious effort into getting Hogwarts alumni to come so they can all stay in touch. They like to go clubbing and wingman each other except one day they go home together and hook up and realize they like that way better and get married but continue going out and occasionally have threesomes with women.

Draco had to use the very last of his political capital and enough money on bribes to get him down to normal levels of wealth in order to avoid Azkaban for the events of book 6. No one in the wizarding world trusts him enough to give him a job so he tried to become a muggle doctor but couldn't cut it in med school and ended up as a grocery store cashier making just enough to get by, while selling the remaining Malfoy heirlooms occasionally to make ends meet. He says something stupid to a customer and gets fired from even that, so he steps up selling off dark artifacts in order to eat. Eventually one of these heirlooms kills someone and he spends the rest of his life in Azkaban.

Scorpius, who is Ron's biologically after a drunken night with Astoria, is adopted by Ron at this point, and grows up working in WWW and everyone forgets he was ever connected to the disgraced Malfoy line, which is now extinct.
