Okay, so I remember that it started at Privet Dr. over the summer, where he comes into his inheritance, and an ancient dragon shows up to check on him, and ends up telling him that Harry is his many-greats grandfather (I think) and he was checking in on this generation, as they are an ancient species of dragon that retired to another dimension (? possibly. I know they lived somewhere else, but I can't remember why). Harry is accepted into the clan and taken to the dragon realm where they fix all his health issues and he ends up with dragon ancestors in his head as teachers. I think it was slash, but I can't remember what the pairing was, as I tend to read Harry slashed with like half the HP universe. I seem to remember Snape was good in this one, and maybe good Malfoys? I think I remember a scene where he's introducing them to the dragons. I don't even remember which archive I read this in, since I bounce around between a few, although it is most likely in fanfic or AO3, if I had to guess.

Finding this is driving me crazy. If anyone can help, it will be much appreciated!!!

** Good Snape, good Malfoys and dragons in people's heads (although not in Harry's):

linkffn(3 Slytherin Marauders)

Harry, Dudley and Petunia live with Snape on a dragon reserve to escape from Vernon and Marge, as well as Dumbledore and the Ministry (the dragon reserve belongs to the international confederation of wizards so the British Ministry and the Muggles don't have access).

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.

** It was Harry/Draco Veela-mate trash by chapter 6. I remember otherwise liking it, but it was years ago. I think my brain just did on-the-fly text replacement and eliminated Draco from the story.
