** Without having read anything, a short summary or something would have been nice. In general, it's easier to attract readers (and constructive criticism), if you provide a reason for reading.

  The story of Tom Marvolo Riddle's Hogwarts' years, from the perspectives of those who admired him; those who called him friend; those who feared him, hated him, and lastly, those who loved him and were thought to be loved by him. Canon-compliant.

** Looking just at the opening paragraph I would caution you against overreliance on adverbs. For example, in the first sentence you tell us the character struts proudly. It's almost always better to just show a character behaving proudly rather than tell us he is proud, and you DO that. He compares himself favorably to his peers, then thinks of himself as clever. Have enough confidence in your ability to show the reader things that you don't add in redundant telling!

Your interiority is great, and I immediately get a good feel for the character.

** From a quick read-through, I think you have a good handle on all the general stuff like grammar, but what I would pay more attention to is your narrative voice -- especially if you have a lot of POV shifts. It was very noticeable that the narrative voice didn't change at all between the chapters and - worse - it is very clear that the narrative voice is yours and not the characters'. The way you write some paragraphs would fit more for an omniscient narrator. I could maybe buy this style for a POV of a grown-up person, who is very cerebral and observant, but here you have a 13 year old and then an 11 year old observing their world like this:

#+begin_quote
  Taking out her wand and muttering some quick incantations, a lattice of thin, translucent blue lines materialised at the threshold where the door would have occupied if closed. Some of the lines seemed to align with Greengrass's facial features. A moment later, the lines emitted a series pleasant chiminng sounds, and dematerialised. Greengrass crossed the threshold, with a weary expression and a furrowed brow. She aggressively gestured with her wand. Edgar heard one of the boys gulp.
#+end_quote

It just doesn't fit.

But this is a relatively high-level critique, I have really not much to complain about here.

** Hi! I'm guessing English isn't your first language? I only had time to scim through it and have a couple of questions: your narration comes off as quite bombastic. Not just the characters. Makes it kinda hard to get into the flow. At least for me. And what kind of name is Jurgen Drachenzamer?! Sorry, that's just my personal thingðŸ˜‚

**** I think bombastic is a poor word. The writing is simply more formal, and there's nothing wrong with that. There were no real redundancies; on the contrary, I found it quite invigorating, although fics that stray far from canon aren't really my thing.

There's good sentence-length variation and the narrative flows smoothly. I think you've done a very good job!

**** I just saw the second part of your reply. Sorry, my app is doing weird shit today. JÃ¼rgen would be a German name, Jurgen is just wrong. And I laught, because Drachenzamer looked like you tried to write DrachenzÃ¤hmer, which is someone taming a dragon. I'll look at your story again, if you like.

**** That's not meant to be negativ! Your kommas are just very "non-English" and your narration has the feel of someone a little unsure about his own writing, that's all.

******* That name is ridiculous, even as a German. (Hans/Samuel/Frank) (Fischer/Becker/Schneider) or similar would work just as well, especially considering that canon has a Megan Jones or Lily Evans, which are entirely normal names. Hell, the protagonist is named Harry Potter and his father is James Potter, both of which are perfectly normal names you can find in the phonebook.

********* JÃ¼rgen is an early 20th-century trend name. It is not known before that (as it comes from George/Georg) and was popular between the 30s and the 50s, with a steep decline around the 70s. It was not even in the top-100 by the 80s.

(That's what the German Wikipedia page says, personally, the few JÃ¼rgens I met were all around 50 or older).

Also, it sucks for fanfics since no one outside of Germany knows how to pronounce an Umlaut (Ã„,Ã–,Ãœ).

For those pseudo names you have something like Beckenbauer (literally: builder of basins) or Langgrund (Longbottom). You can go with "von (insert place name)" to indicate some past ties to minor nobility (eg von Schwarzgrund). You can slap a -bach to pretty much any common last name and it still makes sense (Schwarzbach, Fischerbach, Schmittbach) but sounds a lot more elaborate (and is rather uncommon, but not implausible).

*********** Well, nobility was still pretty present in the 40s and 50s and while reduced to titular nobility, they persisted until today (there is still a Price of Hohenzollern, even though that dynasty was dethroned a century ago). German nobility is not like the average "Lord Potter" story or even the English peerage, more a collectable like a nice car.

Might actually be a little early for JÃ¼rgen (38th in the 20s). Werner/Walter and Kurt are a good choice there because they don't have that "old people" vibe like, let's say "Helmut", "JÃ¼rgen", "Rolf" "Horst" or "Herbert".

**** Hey, German native here. Drachenzahmer ist not quite correct, it would be "DrachenzÃ¤hmer" as surnames are generally in plural. If Ã¤ doesn't exist on your keyboard just use ae. Good luck in writing, this looks promising.
