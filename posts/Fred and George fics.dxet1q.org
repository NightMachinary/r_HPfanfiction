Looking primarily for well written George/ofc. Extra thanks if ofc is a muggle.

Fred/Hermione post war where fred lives.


** Have you read George & Annie: an Unofficial Biography? [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4998084/1/George-Annie-an-Unofficial-Biography]] It's awesome!

Edit --- “where Fred lives”---I felt that, ughhh

** Not exactly what you're looking for, but Ares Granger has several Hermione/ George fics. You can look them up more easily by using search with Ctrl+F and typing George.

** Ahhhh shit I can't find the name of it but there was a really fun F&G time travel fic I read that I really loved. Fred was sorted into slytherin. If anyone remembers the name please add it.

In one of my faves Hermione ends up with george and in the sequels has a nice depiction of him so imma leave that here since I can't remember the other one. /linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer]])
