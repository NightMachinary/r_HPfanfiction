I think it's drarry anyways I read it ages ago Well at the start of quarantine in March

The ONLY bit I remember is in theyre hospital wing and I think Ron and Hermione were here? I think something happened up the astronomy tower before hand, maybe draco ran down from there to the hospital wing to find Harry?? I really can not remember I think that happened somewhere near the end I really don't know And I have no idea at all what the name was or what site it was ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ if anybody has even a slight idea pleas tell me ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… if not though it's completely understandable ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ that's not much to work with


** Was it astronomy tower or did Harry get injured in Quidditch and Draco freak out?

*** I can't remember but I don't remember much quidditch happening in the story But then again I can't remember anything other than that tiny part in the hospital wing ðŸ¤¦ I don't think Harry was really injured tho not sure
