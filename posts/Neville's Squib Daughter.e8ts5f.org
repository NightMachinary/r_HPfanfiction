There was a nice little long one shot I read a long time ago where Neville's daughter turned out to be a Squib, but he and her basically found ways for her to still attend Hogwarts and participate in classes. I distinctly remember quite a bit of back and forth with the Hogwarts Board about the legitimacy of their plan, but it ended up working out. Anyone know which story that was?


** Yes, it was awesome, and I cannot remember what it was either. Sob :'(

Ahh, got it! Chapter 17 of linkffn(8985993). Which is awesome collection even in other stories (George & Angelina relationship! Roxie Weasley!!!)
