  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** linkffn(5904185) Emperor by Marquis Black

This story might match your request, *But* it depends on what you mean by /dark/. Does dark mean /Harry practices dark magic/ or does it mean /Harry is amoral, bad, ruthless and powerhungry/. /Emporer/ is the latter. Yes he probably uses some dark magic in the story (fiendfyre?) but "dark" magic is not a central plot point. Harry is not racist, not that it makes him more of a nice person.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Depends on your definition of Dark!Harry, but this comes to mind: linkffn(Lesser Evils)

In linkffn(Rise of the Wizards), Harry does hate Muggles, but he has no problem with Muggle-borns. It's sort-of a slippery slope argument, yes... but just in case.
