Why is it that every time I try to find Harry\Hermione\OC (I'm not picky about the main character) who aren't rehashes of canon characters, I find overpowered insecure show-offs! Seriously, authors spend pages having other characters be stunned by Harry and admiring Harry's intellect and his power and everything.

Even if the rest of the fic is interesting, I'm way past the stage when I'd be able to identify with such a character and feel that elating sense of self-grandeur :D Because I just don't feel it, I feel embarrassed for the main character when reading a fic like that.

I really liked Prince of the Dark Kingdom, a rare exception from the rule. Whether it's an indie Harry or not is up to debate, though, but he's diverged from canon quite a bit. Too bad that it's never going to be finished. But for this reason alone, it's my favorite HP fic (that and because Vold is awesome).

Is there anything else like that? Btw, indie /= dark, imho. Which is why I consider PotDK indie. Maybe I should search for something other than 'indie', if all indies are Mary Sues, but what is it?

Novel-length, please.
