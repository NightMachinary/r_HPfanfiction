Thousand years have been passed since Voldemort's death. The earth has collapsed. As a Master of Death Harry Potter can't die. In a last dying approach, Harry performed magic and dimension traveled to a universe which is similar to HP universe's 1920s but with one difference - magic is not hidden from muggles. (For this prompt - just to make it more global than a few thousands of magical peoples of the UK.)

Harry now sees himself as a savior of the universe. He feels that if 50% of the universe is killed, the universe will thrive.

On one side Grindelwald is fascinated by this Massiah and became his general - "Hear me and rejoice. You are about to be corrected at the hand of the children of Master of Death."


** Wait, what has magic being public to do with Harry becoming Thanos?

** Yay. I love a good Thanos is Harry fanfic even though I have never read one.

Now I have this prompt in my head where philosophical 2018 Thanos after getting his head chopped of in front of Nebula wakes up in baby Harry's body.

Thanks a lot OP, I can't get it out of my head now.
