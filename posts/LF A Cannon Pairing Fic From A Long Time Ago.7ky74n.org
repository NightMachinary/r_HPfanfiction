In which Fred and George lead Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione to a hot spring underneath(?) Hogwarts. One of the twins makes a joke about "follow that moist crevice" ostensibly referring to the cave their crawling through (I don't remember what the joke/pun was). Something happens and Everyone ends up stuck in a cabin during a blizzard, in which everyone pairs up. This is a short fluff piece with a very contrived setup but I remember the characterization being pretty good.

I have vague memories of this from back in sugar quill's heyday. I would like to see how it holds up today.

Thanks!


** Sound's intresting
