Harry never goes to Hogwarts. He's in the Military. Hermione is his girlfriend. He uses a time turner because he has to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

Dudley happens to be doing the boot camp too. During family day at the boot camp, the Dursley's visit Dudley. The Granger's visit Harry. Dursley's get mad that Dudley didn't get a special job. The Tri-Wizard-Tournament doesn't happen during 'fourth year' . I think they start later. so Hermione's fourth year is when she is 17.


** Ohhhh I remember this I can't remember if it was complete or not but it was pretty good. Was this the one where he lived in Potter mansion in the middle of the woods with the flamels? Or is that a different one. I can't help finding it though because I also have no idea.
