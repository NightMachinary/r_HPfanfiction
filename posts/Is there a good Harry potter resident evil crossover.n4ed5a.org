I was tooling around the internet searching for new fanfics to read I had come across harry potter and resident evil crossovers.

I read a few but none of them where complete. Some had good ideas and seemed interesting so I wanna know if there is any good complete fanfic of this crossover


** No, but if you want a story about Hagrid saving the world from really not resident evil zombies let me know

  A real prophecy involves Rubeus Hagrid. In Harry's second year, the giant spends his days planting a hedge around Hogwarts. Story takes dark turn every once in a while with "wait... what?" Lots of bashing of Dumbledore, McGonagall, Fudge, and Umbridge. There'll be seven parts.

** I don't know whether I'd consider it good, but this is the only RE-Crossover I know and it's complete.

  Long ago, Harry Potter was sold by his uncle to the Umbrella Corporation. But when the Goblet of Fire picks the champions for the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry, now Henry Ashford, is summoned to Hogwarts, out of the stasis tank he had been in. And so too has his mother. Alexia Ashford decides to use the Tri-Wizard Tournament to test the power of T-Veronica...and her own magic...

**** I wouldn't really call that fic complete since it's only part 1 to a series and the sequel is very incomplete.
