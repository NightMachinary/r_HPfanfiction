** Can't help you there, i've seen this done so many times and it /always/ sucks. I'm from Northern Ireland and i've never seen a fic written by someone actually from here that tackles it and it really, really shows.

The IRA are either portrayed really positively in half of them or the entire country is shown to be this barren wasteland of horror. Both are just horrific, none of it ever makes sense and it's honestly just a bit offensive.

*** Tell me about it. I'm Irish as well and it seems like most versions of Seamus come from a bullshit Irish Mafia movie . I'd like to see him as a male version of one of the Derry Girls (probably Michelle)

**** Have you ever read Slaugh? It's famous around here for being really fucked up but you'll not get angry at it unless you're Irish. Seamus becomes some sort of IRA one man army crossed with an Irish pagan evil bollocks thing. It's entertaining if only to see what some Americans think Ireland is.

I'd kill for magical Derry Girls. Anything halfway realistic would actually be really interesting but I don't see a way of doing it well considering the chances of a good Irish HP fanfic writer taking on the challenge are slim.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Seamus has connections with the IRA and becomes the explosives expert of the muggleborn guerilla resistance.

Because the question isn't "can we blast through these defenses?", it's "how much Semtex do we need?".

The fic image is Hermione walking away from an explosion, which was probably detonated by Seamus.

*** Aside from the timeline not really working, IRL Seamus would have been tortured to death for asking questions like but sure why not.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
