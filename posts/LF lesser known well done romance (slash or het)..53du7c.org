Hi all! I have a long flight tomorrow and I'm looking for some page turning, fluffy, grin inducing romance. Over 20k please, no cross gen unless there's time travel or something, and complete fics only if possible.

Also, I've read a lot of the most rec'd fics for the big pairings (H/G, H/Hr, Drarry and Wolfstar), so ideally in looking for not as famous of fics so I can find something new. Thanks in advance!

** Come once again and love me by laventadorn linkffn(7670834) It's not rare among people who read this pairing (Severus/Lily) however you didn't specify you read this paring so I thought maybe you hadn't heard of it. It's the fic that introduced me to this pairing, really high quality writing, it's primarily plot driven, so you won't find a dull moment.

Finding Himself by minisnoo linkffn(4594634) Really well written. Hermione/Cedric

Stars fall by Lady Altair linkffn(3771297) It's short, sweet and brilliantly put together. (It is 18k words though so a bit below your limit, sorry)

Also try looking for more rare pairs here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/53cwi0/rare_pairs_fic_rec_request/?st=IT93GSXX&sh=59451c46]]

*** Thank you! I'll look at all of these. I'll read almost anything (with the exception of LV stuff) so all these look great. But I'm not just looking for rare pairings. I am more looking for fics I haven't read yet regardless of pairing. I've never read a Sev/Lily so I'm excited to read that one first.
