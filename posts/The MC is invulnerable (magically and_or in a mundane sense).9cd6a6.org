Any fics where the MC (or any significant character) is invulnerable to magic and/or mundane harm, particularly the unforgivable curses. Imagine this: every Death Eater firing killing curses at the MC, only to have them bounce off harmlessly. Or a downplayed example: an AK does little more than knock them unconscious for a short time.

  It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.
