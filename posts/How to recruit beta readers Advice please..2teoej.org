Greetings.

I am currently writing a fanfiction with the working title "Helios, Luna, Yggdrasill". As I approached the third chapter of the draft I remembered that it would be pretty nice to have a beta reader check on my grammar and style before I post it on ff.net.

But I have no idea how to find someone like this. Please help.


** I'd like to echo the advice that you should be specific what you're looking for. Know your weaknesses. If you're already a solid writer, but don't have a very firm grasp on HP canon or the fanfiction landscape, an old hand who's been around for a long time can help you steer clear of cliches. If you know HP backwards and forwards but your technical writing isn't quite there, you want someone who's willing to go line-by-line and help you improve.

I post my story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/][What You Leave Behind]], in Dark Lord Potter's "Work by Author" section (often long before a chapter shows up on FF.net), and the quality of feedback I get there is night and day compared to my other main source of information about how my work is being received, FF.net reviews.

For one thing, posting your work in a forum allows for a discussion to take place. You can follow the thread of the entire conversation; the whole thing is transparent. With a single beta, it's easy for it to become an echo chamber where your ideas aren't really progressing and you're kind of spinning your wheels.

From what I've read, historically DLP has a bit of a reputation for being unnecessarily harsh. I can't speak for what it was in the past, but I can tell you that as a relatively new member of the community, I haven't found that to be the case at all. People won't hesitate to speak their mind, often bluntly, about what worked for them and what didn't, but as a writer, you should consider this kind of honesty to be more valuable than gold.

*** A forum seems great because there's multiple people looking at your stuff and they can contribute as much or as little as they like. But would you still recommend DLP for a very amateurish writer, or for someone trying to write a borderline crack fic? I'm not familiar with DLP (besides the excellent C2 on FFN) but I heard they have very high standards.

**** Depends on what your aim is. I would definitely recommend it for an amateur writer trying to get better. There are plenty of folks over there who will readily help out with basic stuff: punctuating dialogue, show vs. tell, characters driving the plot, adverb abuse, etc.

It's not a writing seminar, but you will get a sense, very quickly, of the areas where you need to improve.

It's a mistake to think of DLP as one cohesive group - tastes evolve with a changing userbase, opinions mellow or solidify over time, and well-respected authors come and go. But, yes, they do have high standards in terms of writing quality. In general, for a story to be held in high regard on DLP, it's not enough that it has good ideas or cool twists on canon - those ideas have to be executed well.

** I've seen some authors posting here some kind of review, explaining the background of the story without revealing the main plot, and then asking if anyone is interested in being a beta for the story. I think it would be a nice start.

** You can post here or go to the beta section of fanfiction.net. There's a complete community of people who say they can beta categorized by their expertise (grammar, continuity, etc.) and category (General, Harry potter, Naruto, etc.) That would be two places to start. Also, make sure you put your expectations for your beta up front, some people may not work as quickly as you need.

** If you are on Livejournal, try subscribing to beta communities such as [[http://hp-betas.livejournal.com/][HP Betas]] and [[http://hp-betas-wanted.livejournal.com/][HP Betas Wanted]]. For that matter, the LJ Harry Potter fanfic community is worth getting to know. It's possible to make friends with people who will beta for you in exchange for alpha work or cheerleading on your part.
