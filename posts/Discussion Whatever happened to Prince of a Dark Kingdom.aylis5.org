It's one of my all time favourites, and It's really a shame that it's unfinished. Do we know what happened to the author, did they just get bored of it or did they finish it somewhere else? Did the author ever give a summary of how the story would end? I need closure!!! It's one of those stories that I go back to re-read fairly often.

** Nope. The author dropped off the face of the earth.

I think they might have died... I can't imagine someone spending a decade and a million words would disappear so close to the end.

*** Yeah, Mizuni-sama had no other online presence under that name, just up and disappeared. Fanfic authors dying is a bit of a morbid trend, although we usually have confirmation from someone else updating the profile. Might just be that they lost interest entirely, or a 1000 other reasons, but even knowing the reason would be some consolation.

** I have speculated previously on what the ending probably would have come to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9evnw3/how_would_prince_of_the_dark_kingdom_have_ended/][here]]. These are just personal conclusions, but in my defense PotDK had a narrative style of consistently setting up the ending for each "year" rather obviously at the beginning, and we already saw most of the hints of how the story would have concluded.

An alternative possibility is that the author, in fact, never had a serious ending planned out - rather they may have just been adding more and more until the AU got to large for them to try and tie together (somewhat like how I suspect ASoIaF will go in the end).

*** As much as I love it, I suspect the Kingkiller Chronicles is one of those stories that got away from the author - it seems impossible that Rothfuss will be able to resolve all the plotlines and hints he's dropped in one remaining book and this seems born out by how long it's taking him
