I'm asking, because I never see this style of writing in published works that I read.

Maybe this is a projection on my part, but I assume that the vast majority of authors replicate the style of narration they've read in the past. That's certainly the approach I've taken for my own fanfic, since experimenting in this area strikes me as something I don't have enough experience to do successfully.

Part of my aversion to it might be that the books were written in past-tense, which is unfair, since narration, just like everything else, is also up for grabs in a fanfic. But I don't think I've ever come across it in the stuff I usually read, which is why I find it so jarring. I found stories written in present tense to be weirdly speculative and almost indecisive at times. It feels like characters lack some commitement and deliberation in their actions.

When I read: "Harry opened the door", I know exactly how to contextualise it within what's going on in a particular scene.

When I read: "Harry opens the door", my experience of the story becomes so open-ended that it I fail to find any finality in these actions. Does he actually open the door, or is there a chance that he completely changes his mind and closes it halfway through?

What are the benefits of writing this way, and can people suggest good examples so I can "get" this style, as a reader?


** The Hunger Games, probably. I know there have been other books written in present tense, but that's the biggest one I'm aware of in the past 20 years. And its target demographic is the same demographic that is most known for writing fanfics.

I generally don't like present tense, and I usually see it as a strong indicator that a story isn't going to be very good anyway. Especially since 90% of the time that present tense shows up, it's actually a terrible mash of present and past tense that speaks very poorly of the author's writing skill.

** You're not alone in having an aversion to present tense. There are tons of criticisms and defenses of it if you want to google for a more in-depth analysis. It's grown in popularity in YA novels recently, with the most popular example being the Hunger Games. Like most things relating to YA literature and fanfiction, a lot of people shit on it. I don't think that's fair. I think every writer has different reasons for using it, and sometimes it works really well. After writing both and eventually settling on past because I cave to those sorts of pressures, I can enjoy both interchangeably.

In terms of why it's so much more common in ff, I would wager that a significant number of people who write fanfiction are not reading as much original fiction as they are other fanfictions, which are likely to be present tense, and watching TV, which creates a present tense mindset in terms of narration. Writing in present tense, to me, feels a bit like writing a script.

There is something to be said for the vividness of present tense. My personal experience is that I began writing in past tense because all the books I read were past tense and then switched for a short period of time to present tense because I saw other writers in my fandom using it (at the time, I was in the fandom for a TV show too, so that makes even more sense). When I switched to Harry Potter, because the books are past tense, I got back in the habit of past tense writing.

In some ways, it actually feels more awkward to me. It's uniquely literary and feels very definitive. I like imagining things like a movie when planning scenes, but what works in a movie doesn't work in a book. Sometimes I'll think, "Oh, and then I'll cut to--!" and realize, "no, you can't cut away to draw a comparison between two scenes. That doesn't work in this medium."

You're right that "Harry opens a door" feels very open-ended, but the scene would go on from there. It would be more like, "Harry opens a door and steps through it. In the next room, he sees X, Y, and Z." At that point, you don't need to wonder if Harry actualized his goal of opening the door. They've told you.

You know what's a really odd outcome of my switch from present back to past that you might not think about outside of a ff world? I now find writing smut to feel incredibly awkward and never end up including it in final drafts. Without the vividness of present tense, it just doesn't work for me. I didn't like writing it when I first wrote ff in past tense, got very into it when I switched to present tense, and I don't like it again now that I'm back in past tense. Not sure why that is.

If you do want to experiment with different tenses as a writer, ff is a very safe place to do it.

*** Thanks for sharing this!

I think that your point about vividness, along with the ones on immediacy made by [[/u/twinfiresigns14][u/twinfiresigns14]] and [[/u/keto_crossword][u/keto_crossword]] really helped me understand the strengths of this approach. I imagine that particularly in a time-sensitive scene, it would help to feel "in the moment" and help to empathise with tension the characters are under. Looking at this from that angle, I guess the reason my reading preferences don't gel with that style is because I prefer a slower style of story telling, particularly in longer fanfics. Being engaged with the novel in present-tense is actually more exhaustive for me, if it demands that I stay in the moment with characters for long chapters.

I can also see how using present tense is a better choice for first person narration, since it fully takes the advantage of allowing you to embody the character. I guess this doesn't work for me purely because some fanfic authors are not good enough to do it justice. I really should read Hunger Games, I think.

A good way to remember is that with present-tense narration, you're watching it in action. It's like a movie. You can't pause it in a theater, but you can at home.

And it's also a great way to determine if you want to read the story, cause for some, it's easy to get drawn into present-tense style stories, while others, like me, prefer to pause it at certain times

** English isn't my native language, so maybe my observation is nonsense, but I have the feeling that present tense fits sad stories best. It gives the story a melancholy air that I enjoy, provided it fits the story content.

** I think it's just become a general trend.

I agree that the present tense is, for lack of a better word, â€˜fanficcy' or amateur. For most of my (book) fandoms, I don't mind it at all, since I'm so used to seeing it in fanfic. I've come to accept it as a stylistic choice confined (mostly) to fanfiction.

It doesn't substantially change anything for me, when reading. A good drabble has the same immediacy for me whether it's written in present or past tense.

But I can see how some would find it jarring. I still can't get used to third-person Babysitters Club fanfiction, for instance. I'll always prefer first-person fanfic for that fandom because of the sheer amount of BSC books I read as a child.

** I thought it stemmed from school teaching, a lot of writing for school is technical or research papers which are supposed to be in present tense, and if you don't think about it present tense might seem like the correct one (but my story isn't in the pastðŸ˜«!!)

Plus there are well written books like the hunger games in present tense, but good present tense writing is incredibly difficult, and frankly most ff writers just don't have the skill and should stick with past tense. But I think worst than writing present tense is authors who constantly switch tenses.

** I write exclusively in present tense because, for some reason, I can't write past tense. Present tense I hit thousands of words typed out in a day, but in past tense I can barely get out a full page. In all honestly, I don't think there's any inherent issue with it - I'm not trying to write the same quality as a published book, and my work is inherently based off everything I've ever read in the same fandom to begin with. Present tense is easy to write, captures most readers, and gives a sense of urgency to the story, like the reader is experiencing the plot alongside the characters rather than reading a summary of it after the fact. But you are welcome to your own opinion on the matter! I haven't posted any fics for HP yet, but for the main fandom I write in, Critical Role, nearly all the fics are in present tense.

** I think present tense works well for first person narratives. It gives a greater sense of the story unfolding from a limited point of view. First-person past-tense feels more like it's in the form of reminiscence than an active story. That said, yeah, reading third-person present-tense is jarring and should be avoided imo.

** Normal People and the Wolf Hall trilogy are both in present tense and highly acclaimed, though other posters are probably right in suggesting other books to inspire fanfic writers.

Personally, when I read (e.g. the above) in present tense it often makes me want to write in present tense. It's so much more immediate and subjective for me, that it esp makes it easier to write for imperfect characters - you don't fall into the trap of trying to objectively justify their actions, you can just have an easier unreliable narrator. There's other reasons too, but that's a big one.

That's not to say I always love it, but I think it has its uses!

Possibly also some good fanfics (I love The Changeling) inspire people?

** When I'm writing, I find that present tense lets me get right into the mind of the character, while past tense keeps them at a remove. That's just my experience, though, YMMV.
