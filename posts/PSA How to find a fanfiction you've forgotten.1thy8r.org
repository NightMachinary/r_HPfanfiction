There's a ton of people here looking for fanfictions they read a long time ago, but can't remember the name of. A good way to find this is using the " " function in a Google search.

Put any words you know were used in a specific fiction on a single page(even the tiniest thing), along with the name of the archive, and if you keep trying different combinations, it'll eventually show up.

For example: I'm trying to find HPMOR, but I can't remember the actual title. However, I remember that it's on fanfiction.net, it's popular, and it has a ton of science. Enter this into Google like this: "Harry Potter" "fanfiction" "science" and it comes right up.

Another, less common example: One of my favorites, Harry Potter and the Guardian Wand. I remember that it includes lots of discussion of EMP's, magically changed seeds, and a few other unusual things. It was also on Fanfiction.net. I entered in "Harry Potter" "fanfiction" "Emp", and it came up as the 2nd result. Had it not come up, I would have tried several different things that I remembered from various parts of the story


** You can also limit your search to a particular a site on google by using "site:[url]", e.g. enter the following: site:fanfiction.net "harry potter" emp and you will only get results from ffn.

Could be helpful if you remember what archive you read the story on.

** For fanfiction.net, someone at the DarkLordPotter forums made a custom search engine. It can be found here: [[http://fffn.darklordpotter.net/]] You can search by keywords, characters, genres, length, etc. at the same time. Very useful not only for finding forgotten fanfiction, but also for new inspiration. For example, by using: Minimum reviews, you sort out what people talk(ed) about.

*** Eh, you can do it without, but I find that it's best to get the simple words out of the way first, so you don't get some weird stuff that's not totally unrelated, and use quotes just to be as exact as possible

**** Quotes in Google searches around a single word forces a match for that word in the results. This is useful for common words, like "I" and "The," but also because Google sometimes seems to likes to give partial matches excluding some search terms, variations on spelling, or even synonyms. Using quotes stops that from happening and forces exact matches.

** Well, I have most stories I read organised in a calibre library (>2000 ebooks) and wrote my own full-text search engine with contextual awareness and all for that. I also regularly re-read stories after searching via Google. But sometimes I still can't find what I'm looking for, so I ask if anyone else has a stroke of inspiration for me because humans and computers do very different things when they try to find some particular bit of information ;)

On the other hand Google is a great tool and its always a good idea to first exhaust the resources you have at your fingertips...

*** I know, I knew the titles to both fanfictions. I was just trying to give an example, and that was the first fic that popped into my head.
