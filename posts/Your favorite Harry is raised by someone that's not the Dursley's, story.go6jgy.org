Can be Severus Snape, the Weasley's, Sirius Black, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, or someone else entirely.

Would rather not have Weasley bashing, am fine with Dumbledore bashing (up until a point, but even then would rather not have Dumbledore bashing either). Him making a mistake and learning from it is fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, et cetra (Doesn't have to be a pairing).

Horcruxes can or don't have to be a thing, can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings.

Harry more powerful or smarter then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable if at all possible, like he worked for it.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.Can be an older story or a newer story or somewhere in between.


** linkao3(Fruit of the Golden Tree by Lomonaeeren)

Part one of the Potter Rage series, this AU has a Fleamont Potter that was placed into a coma and only awoken after Harry had been placed with the Dursleys for a few years. It almost makes me want to believe that Fleamont and Euphemia are James' parents, and not Charles and Dorea.

*** oh! this reminds me of another one that sort of started of similarly. Dorea Potter had been in a coma (or otherwise not doing well) due to Dragon Pox, but someone figured out an experimental treatment, tried it on her, and was successful. She manages to get Sirius his trial, gets Harry from the Dursleys, and re-establishes the Black Coven.\\

Now he finds himself awake again in a world where all the members of his family are supposedly dead---except that the Potter family tree tells him that his grandson lives yet.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

** The Accidental Animagus: linkao3(14078862)

Harry is raised by the Grangers after he turns into a cat at age 6 and runs away from the Dursleys.

Harry is more powerful than canon, but it's all fairly believable as a result of growing up with people who encourage him to study and train from as early an age as possible.

The sequel-fic is updated regularly.

My favorite raised-by-OC story is The Paths Diverge by Vaneria Potter linkffn(7247199).

An in-progress one I'm enjoying is The Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe, written as an SI of a middle-aged male lawyer who's read the books and seen the movies. linkao3(21500365). While H stays at Privet Drive (so far), the spiritual visitor takes over his carefirst by possessing Vernon with Petunia's permission after the fact, then in a body they grow.

A fun series that includes Sirius, Minerva and Severus (told mostly from Severus's POV) collaborating to raise Harry in Hogwarts is the [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewseries.php?seriesid=71][Encounter Series]] by Hestia.

  Winner Oct. 2006 HPAA Best AU: Harry rescues himself as a baby and chooses Snape as his protector, why no one knows because the toddler isn't telling and no one can see him but Snape. No Slash, No Mary Sues, R&R please. PDF, ebook, mobipocket available.

  Very AU, set in the same universe as my other 2 "Encounter with..." stories. This is the promised prequel, explaining how Nana & the Uncles came to care for Harry. Be warned: more sad, less funny, since it deals with the aftermath of the Potters' deaths.

  Very AU! Harry as a 6 year old, Snape with a gooey center! Harry is caught foolishly trying to explore Hogwarts' lake, and Snape must bring himself to discipline the boy. Contains very mild corporal punishment. 1 prequel, 1 sequel now posted.

  Very AU! For those who asked for more stories in the same universe as "Encounter with a Squid", this one is set a year earlier. How do Severus et al deal with Harry's emerging powers? Very mild CP; lots of manipulation of poor Severus by naughty Harry
