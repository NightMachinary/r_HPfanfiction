Like say with the day dream charms they were selling in there shop. Mabye load the charm with the information that you want to learn and the an you use the charm you absorb it So it's personalised learning. Like say there is a daydream charm to learn a language someone might daydream being tutored by an attractive member of the opposite gender , but someone else might day dream about going on an adventure were they have a French person in there group, but another person would daydream about an adventure were they are traveling with a French person with them pick up French threw the adventure. It would not be a replacement for learning the practical but it would make learning Theory fun which I think the twins would find funny.

Or entertainment instead of a tv series were you watch as someone goes on an adventure instead you dream the adventure.
