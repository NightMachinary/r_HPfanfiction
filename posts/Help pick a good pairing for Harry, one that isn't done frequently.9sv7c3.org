I'm not a shipper, and I don't generally read ship-focused stories, but one idea I'm thinking about writing is a TrueLove(tm)-centric plotline. It's mostly focused on magic and ritual and desperate choices, but the fact is it would all fall apart without a love story at its center.

I don't want to just throw another Harmony or canonship on the pile, though. If I'm going to go out of my comfort zone and write a love-having story, I'd like it to be a contribution to a less already-done-to-death couple.

--------------

In case it impacts who he'd end up with, I should mention that this version of Harry will be more driven, intelligent, and pragmatic than canon.

It's going to be moderately-to-heavily AU (or divergent or whatever the term is) so I don't mind playing with the timeline as needed to put them in the correct age range. It will probably be post-Hogwarts, or at least alternate sixth/seventh year (but more like DH where they're not actually at school if so) because I have so many school year fics in progress or planning already and do not want another.

It will definitely be a darker tone, as Voldemort and company will also be stronger and the war will not be going well for his opposition - if, indeed, it isn't already over.

--------------

If you could provide a little reasoning as to how/why the relationship you choose would work, I'd appreciate it. :)


** I haven't really seen any Harry/Katie Bell stories. I think it could be really interesting to write if you explore the relationship they must have built up through quidditch. The relationships between that team weren't explored that much in the books, so that gives you a decent amount of freedom to work with.

*** Especially if you include them being 'hazed' since they are both new to the team (at least starting members). Plus they could bond over enduring the grueling workouts and training sessions from Oliver Wood's obsession. Bonding through shared experiences is how Harry became friends with Hermione after all.

Katie would make a good tutor for Harry if you wanted to shift the focus away from Ron and Hermione, since she went through the material the year previously.

Katie's friendship with Leanne could be something fun to work with, since both have a lot of room for characterization by the fic author.

**** That's a good point. It's easy to think of the whole rest of the team as experienced players because Harry is the youngest Seeker in a century (plus all of them probably had been on a broom before Hogwarts), but Katie is just as green as Harry when it comes to the team itself. I thought of that angle before.

***** Just because you've flown before doesn't mean you've flown with That team. Hazing isn't don't to introduce you to a activity, but to introduce you to a group of people who have the shared experience of playing together many if not all of whom went through the same hazing you did. They would treat Katie just as bad if not worst than Harry cause Harry is better on a broom that the girl who's had a broom since she was 6.

I'm partial to Harry/Luna myself personally. Maybe a somewhat more jaded and wiser Luna?

If you want something more unusual. Maybe Professor Sinistra or Vector? Make them on the younger side for a professor and set it a few years after DH?

Maybe Tonks? She's only six years older than Harry and since you're going AU you can keep her alive.

** Susan Bones:

- She's mostly a blank slate, meaning you can do whatever you like with her character wise.

- The few canon facts about her provide more reasons than other blank slates for her to be interacting with Harry: her membership of the DA, her Aunt being senior in the Ministry, her uncle Edgar and his family being killed by Voldemort.

- While she's frequently featured in harem fics, there are very few Harry/Susan fics so you would still be breaking largely new ground.

- Most readers of fanfic will already have a strong image of her in their minds as she has been fairly uniformly depicted in the fandom (red hair, stacked).

She still gives out stupid nicknames but their more for private time kinda like Mollywobbles than the Won-Won/Lav-Lav Incidents. Harry still being Harry desires love and Lavender is willing to grant that unconditionally it seems, Both characters in Canon love Hard even if Lav's is kinda childish.

Su Li - We Know little of her but rather than giving her some grand over arching backstory, she could just be the daughter of some low level diplomat. Where she fits she is much like Harry she is assumed to be intelligent due to being in Ravenclaw and being the child of someone with little power in a dark time would push her to desire more power thus her helping Harry along, a relationship springing up out of close quarters is almost expected.
