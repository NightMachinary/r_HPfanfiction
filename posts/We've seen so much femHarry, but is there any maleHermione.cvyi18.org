** I think if I were going to write one, I would name him Polixenes, because that's the name of the character in Shakespeare's A Winter's Tale that most mirrors Hermione's role. I would probably give him a nickname, or three, though, because Polixenes is a bit ridiculous to be writing all the time. Although I guess Hermione only doesn't seem like a mouthful because I see it all the time, so maybe not.

But no, I don't actually know of any male!Hermione besides the ones already rec'd. I'd read it though! Especially if Harry and Ron were also gender swapped, so there wasn't a complete lack of significant female characters.

** Leander Granger. My headcanon is that she's named after the warship, not the Shakespeare or Homer characters (largely because the one Hermione I ever knew IRL was) so the options are all of the male-named /Leander/ class frigates. Which include, amusingly, HMS Sirius (and HMS Minerva), but Apollo, Ajax and Achilles are also options.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

** Only one I remember is 'Harry Potter and the distaff side '. But, with the exception of a Harry who' s transported there, everybody's gender has switched. To be fair: all the gender roles have changed as well. So in the end it's really only a cosmetic change.

** Male!Hermione doesn't exist because of the gender double standard. If Hermione was a guy and did all the shit s(he) did in canon, s(he)'d be hated more than canon Ron, and the Hermione stans won't stand for that.

Plus, there's not really a market for it. People often want more female characters, rather than more male charcters.

***** Nobody would hate anyone for being shy and a nerd. But Hermione isn't just that. First of all where in cannon was she shy? Even in the first book, she barged into Ron and Harry's cabin and immediately poked her nose into their conversation. That's not being shy. Poor people skills? Yes. But certainly not shy. If the majority of the fandom can hate Ron for being jealous and insecure , what about a guy that's bossy, self-righteous, condescending and jealous? How did you overlook all those negative qualities and only saw her as being a shy nerd?

****** Shy wasn't the correct word, you're right. Maybe insecure? I was thinking of things like her having no friends until Ron and Harry, crying in the bathroom for hours when Ron insulted her, never really getting along with the other girls in her dorm, and even getting flustered when she's in a tight spot, like the troll in the bathroom and Ron having to remind her she can make light or fire from her wand when they're caught by the Devil's Snare plant.

Parts of the fandom will always hate everyone. You're clearly not fond of Hermione. Some people despise Harry for being too bland/ not asking enough questions/not being studious enough, you name it.

But in other mediums the nerd guy is quite often condescending and bossy when it come to anything they're expert in. "Scientist" Harry in those types of fanfiction almost always is, because he's smarter than everyone else and just has to show it off. People still like that trope. And many, many characters have a jealous moment and learn from it. So I think a male Hermione would easily be forgiven by those that liked that type of character, and hated by those who don't, just like canon Hermione is.

I think in Ron's case people who dislike him are most displeased by the fact that he keeps repeating the same error. To me that's very realistic writing, in real life people usually don't have a very special Hallmark moment and then learn from it and never make the same mistake again, it takes a few times and more work to overcome a flaw.
