** Hufflepuff's are particularly good finders, but even they could accept the simple fact:

If Harry James Potter hid something from you... you were NOT finding it.

*** Roger Davis Nearly whimpered when he heard the news from Lavender Brown, Harry Potter had gotten wind that he had been making fun of Lovegood again and Hidden his broom somewhere in the Castle Two days before the match again Slytherin. Roger still had Nightmares about the last time Potter had Resorted to a game of “ Hide and Seek Revenge”. No Accio Could Summon an item hidden by Potter and Any tracking charm always went haywire. Everyone at Hogwarts knew if something precious to you went missing, And you couldn't find it via magic, You were on Potter's shit list. Not even the Hufflepuffs could help you. Davis sighed and started his search If he was lucky he might find his broom before the summer holidays next year, Cormac McLagan Hadn't seen his wizard's chess set since third year and Malfoy was still looking for his bag of sweet his mum send him first year, after the Rememberall incident in the first years flying lesson. Hogwarts had an unspoken code these days, if you were a prat be prepared to go searching for some important to you , Harry James Potter didn't tolerate Bullies or Professor Snape, They were still looking for the potions classroom , Seamus Finnegan claimed he Stumbled upon it looking for the bathroom in fourth year, but everyone knew that rumor was bullocks. Since they had been having Potions in one of the extra greenhouses for the last few years, Coincidently Longbottom hadn't Blown up a single cauldron, since The change in classroom with Professor sprout hovering in the background of ever Potions lesson.

Davis snorted before Going to retrieve his hiking gear, He might as well start with the roof, maybe Potter Was merciful this time and just stuck his broom In a drain pipe on the astronomer tower like last year.

** It's not due to living under it as a baby, but Harry in linkffn(A Black Comedy) /does/ have ridiculous skill with the Fidelius Charm and the fic is pretty cracky. A key mystery figure is nicknamed and referred to as "That Fucker," for instance.

(Obligatory warning that its humor has not aged gracefully at all and is liable to rub folks the wrong way. Despite that, the plot still holds up pretty well IMO.)

** The first chapter of linkffn(9901496) takes the Fidelius charm to an extreme - but like the rest of the fic, it's honestly funny.
