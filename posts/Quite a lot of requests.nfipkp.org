:END:
Instead of spamming the sub-reddit with many different posts, I'm writing my requests in a lists here. And I know there's probably quite a few fanfics out there that cover these plot lines but I either don't find them or I just don't seem to be finding the engaging ones.

They don't need to have any ships in them but if they do, please don't pair Harry with hermione or ginny is my only request.

1. Harry knows there's more to a person than what they show in public. This request is: harry tries to get to know the people he is essentially living under the same roof under at hogwarts, he reaches out to the other three houses whether they be a year older or in the same year as him and interacts with them.

I found this to be something I didn't like in a canon where they would keep to their own houses and I can see that happening for the more reserved students but if you're at boarding school, this isn't what happens irl.

1. Harry has enough of hermione and (in a non bashing way) calls her out on not being as good a friend as she pretends to be. Or at least, calls her out for acting like she know everything when she could just ask for help from other people as well.

2. Harry and Ron try their best to keep up academically but not to hermione level, and try to get help from people they know (preferably from other houses as well) to help them with certain subjects.

3. The DA welcoming slytherin because we all know slytherins weren't the only supporters of voldemort.

4. Someone from hogwarts (anyone) does an anonymous or public interview/article where they call out rita skeeter and the daily prophet but they come with the reciptes and witnesses.

5. Any recommendation that seems like something I'd or someone else would enjoy from the above requests.

Thank you in advance!

Now he's back in England, and Minister for Magic Shacklebolt has a job for him -- find out who is behind the pranks and poison pen letters besieging Hogwarts.
