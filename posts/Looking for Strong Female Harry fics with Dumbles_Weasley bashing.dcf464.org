  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

*** Hmm. The railroaded canon re-tread is not encouraging ('Nigel' lost a toad, really?), but I'mma keep trying since 500k words is 500k words. We'll see.
