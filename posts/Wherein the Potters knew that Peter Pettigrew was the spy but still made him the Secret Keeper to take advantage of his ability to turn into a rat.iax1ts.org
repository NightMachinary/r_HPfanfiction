They made him Secret Keeper, asked him to transform into a rat, trapped him inside an enchanted cage that he could not get out of and voila, the Fidelius charm was not broken.

...

Or maybe they didn't know he was a spy but still trapped him in an enchanted cage anyway.


** 3 year old Harry : Mummy,can I take Wormtail out of his cage and pet him ?

Lily(cheerfully) : Of course not,you moronic little shit

** Even better:

Potters and Dumbledore set up a massive trap at their home and destroyed Voldemort's body.

They further captured Wormtail right outside their home.

Next, they laid ambush at the Longbottoms, killed two of the Lestranges, and destroyed Barty Sr's career with the capture of Jr.

As the balance of power completely tipped in this world, Frank Longbottom was made to succeed Barty Crouch Sr as the Director of DMLE. Thorough interrogations of all captured Death Eater followed, with Veritaserum, Legilimency, and Pensieves. Ilk like Lucius Malfoy never got away with their Imperius lies. Confiscation of Malfoy and Lestrange assets further yielded the Diary and the Cup, and Dumbledore began the Horcrux hunt 13 years earlier.

** It would be simpler if James decided to be the Keeper, like Bill did.

** That... actually sounds like the type of prank the guy who planned to give his rival as lunch for his werewolf friend would find hilarious.
