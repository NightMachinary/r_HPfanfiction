I was playing stellaris (for those of you who don't know, this is a grand strategy game where you steer an empire to greatness among the stars)

One of the things you can do to your empire is to give your civilization psychic powers, and it starts off by a select few within your civilization having those powers (very similar to the current status quo in Harry Potter)

As you develop your empire, you will have the option to initiate The Great Awakening ... which is described within the game like so ...

  The Human species has experienced what can only be described as a Great Awakening. For a time now, we have been aware of the great psionic potential inherent in our species, but such powers have only manifested themselves in a small minority... until now.

  Almost overnight, Humans everywhere have unlocked their full psionic capacity. It is as if some sort of communal pool of Human psychic energy finally reached a critical tipping point, collectively awakening the latent abilities of our brains.

  Telepathy has already replaced most verbal communication between Humans, and this is only one small example of the innumerable changes our society is faced with. We are now tied together in a way few of us could have ever imagined.

What if this event is to happen during the Harry Potter story? Is there a fan-fiction like this? Would people be interested in reading one?


** That would be sooooo good and then they could go in the stars
