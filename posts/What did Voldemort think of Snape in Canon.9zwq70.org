I thought i recalled that Snape was rather confident, even challenging of Voldemort at times when he was a Deatheater???

But in all fics I read he's this scraping, and backbone-less follower that's continually getting tortured. I always thought Snape was fairly favored....

Am I remembering wrong?


** I don't recall ever really seeing Snape interact with Voldemort during the books other than his death scene. He was confident and challenging towards other Death Eaters when they questioned his position and faithfulness, though, as seen in HBP during the Unbreakable Vow scene.

** We see Snape and Voldemort interact twice, once when Snape is killed and once when Snape is in the meeting at the beginning of DH. In neither one do we see or hear anything that can be suggested as favouritism towards Snape.\\
The one thing we do have is that Voldemort had promised to spare Lily. Though Voldemort was obviously not above throwing that promise out of the way to full fill his own goal, though he could obviously have just stunned her so whether he promised it in good faith is another matter.

  “No, he's not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.” With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, bat like shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.

He has a place at his right hand for Snape. When Snape and Yaxley enter the hall where they're all sitting for the meeting, Voldemort motions Yaxley to a random place and asks Snape to sit at his right hand side.

If you're looking to go for symbolism, Voldemort basically announces to the rest of his Death Eaters that Snape is his right hand, at that moment.

**** It can also just be read as Snape being the only one there that has yet to fail him. Though at the end of GoF he also calls those who appered there as Renouncers and those who went to Azkaban as Faithful.

  “And here we have six missing Death Eaters... three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever... he will be killed, of course... and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.” The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. “He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight...

That seems either telling, or a case of plot rewriting. Seeing as the first one is Karkaroff, the second one is Snape and the third one is Crouch jr. At least that's what I read it as, meaning that at that point in time Voldemort didn't know where Snape's allegiance lies.

This could possibly be what elevates Snape's stature in his eyes, but that he entrusted Snape to do it, and not anyone else means that he valued Snape very, very highly.

  “I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.”

  Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore's cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further.

  Scowling, Snape said, “The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius's recent failures. Slow torture for Draco's parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.”

  “In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?”

  There was a short pause. “That, I think, is the Dark Lord's plan.” “Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?”

  “He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.” “And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at Hogwarts?”

  Snape gave a stiff nod. “Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you -- ”

  “ -- much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius's position.” “All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort's wrath.”

  Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, “Are you intending to let him kill you?” “Certainly not. You must kill me.” There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.

  “Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. “Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?” “Oh, not quite yet,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I daresay the moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight"

​

Nothing here suggests that Voldemort gave Snape the job of actually killing Dumbledore. Only that it was given to Draco with the knowledge that it'd most likely fail rather catastrophically. Snape merely thinks that's what Voldemort plans. He doesn't know for sure and that's the thing. Voldemort might've had a different plan in place.

This is because Snape lovers want to accentuate his /heroism/.

In order to achieve this Voldemort needs to be extra brutal towards his followers (and Snape in particular) while Snape in turn needs to be extra altruistic by staying in his position as a spy.

Also the idea that Snape could be hedging his bets has to be thoroughly dismantled and discredited in order to elevate Snape.

*** The way I see it, Severus stubbornly refusing to balk at the idea of being a spy despite mistreatment doesn't need to have anything to do with altruism (he /could/ have been altruistic, but it's not neccessarily true) but could also just refer to him no longer caring about his own life at all and only seeing it as a means of an end -- his willingness to live dying with the death of the one person he ever truly cared for. There was really no reason for him to die to Nagini if he really didn't want to -- he's a Potions prodigy and likely dealt with Nagini's venom as part of Arthur's attack -- nothing stopped him from carrying antivenin and other healing utilities.

Say what you will about him as a person, but I do genuinely believe him to firmly be on the side of the Light -- it would have been very easy to do just a tiny difference to "accidentally" fail to protect Harry at a crucial moment, letting him die and thus losing the Light its primary advantage. Even if him being on the side of the Light is only by proxy.

That's not what "hedging your bets" means. Failing to protect Harry would be counter productive for that purpose.

The rest of your comment is similarly incomprehensible to me:

How is that not another definition of altruism? "It doesn't have to be altruism, it could also be because of altruism!"

In any case it is just there to make Snape look good and IMHO not supported by canon at all.

** Voldemort definitely considered Snape one of his most trusted servants --- it's very telling that he was the only Death Eater he entrusted with the secret of Unsupported Flight, and the one he made Headmaster of Hogwarts.

"Friend" might entail deeper emotional involvement than the Dark Lord is capable of, but I think Snape is as close to a friend as Voldemort can have, someone whose company he enjoys and intelligence/skill he respects.

Snape was useful. He was treated with enough respect that he was seemingly allowed to learn spells from Voldemort. (the flight spell he displays when he flees, comes to mind)

-Voldemort offered to spare Lily as a favor to Snape. Whether this is because he was favored or because he got Voldemort prophecy we don't know.

-Voldemort appoints Snape Headmaster. Lots of trust there.

-I would say that he is favored that he respects.

** With the torture, that's just Voldemort being Voldemort, he does that to everyone.

Voldemort offered to spare Lily, something he clearly had at least some intention on following through with (or the love protection would fail). He might offer similar rewards to other Death Eaters that do something that particularily pleases him, but this is the only case we see. He also offered to teach him unaided flight that nobody else in the Death Eater camp got that we see, but that might just be another reward for services rendered (considering that the magic would be useful to aid with dealing with Hogwarts, just like Wormtail would be more useful with 2 hands).

It's also possible that Voldemort sees himself somewhat in Severus which might give him special treatment (both are halfbloods with abused childhoods with good early control on their magic -- it's possible to think that Severus would have ended up just like Voldemort if Voldemort and Lily never existed -- Lily to teach him friendship and compassion, Voldemort to avoid competing Dark Lords).
