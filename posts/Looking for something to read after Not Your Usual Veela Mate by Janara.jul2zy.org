As it says in the title, I'm looking for something to read. I read linkffn(Not Your Usual Veela Mate by Janara) in a couple days and it was so good I almost cried but now I'm looking for something new to read. Points I'm interested in are listed below.

A mix and match of: - Harry/Draco (or Harry and Other, preferably not OC) friendship turned romance - An adult figure in Harry's life being actually supportive of him, preferably Severus or Lucius or both but could be someone else. - If Severus or Lucius (or someone else?) are not actually on Voldemort's side, then a decent explanation on how they ended up there - Interesting, well thought out, there for a reason other than ‘it would be cool if', creature inheritance of either Harry or his partner... yes it can be another Draco is a Veela fic - Harry becoming an independent thinker/already an independent thinker - Cool and exciting world building - Not necessarily bashing anyone but if a ‘Light' character is going ‘Evil' then they have a reasonably explanation for it (I'm looking at Dumbledore, Hermione, Weasleys) - A third side of the war between the Light and Dark

Please no: - Harem - Super duper graphic sex scenes in half the chapters - Evil!Harry - Romance with Voldemort, even Mentor Voldemort - Cross-Generational Romance (ie Harry paired with someone of his parents generation)

Any suggestions are appreciated! Doesn't have to fit all criteria, though please mention if there is something that might seem like a flag?

Thanks in advance!

  Draco is a Veela and guess who his mate is? I've tried to write a Veela story where the two don't jump into bed immediately, hence the title. Will contain Dumbledore bashing. HPDM LMSS AU from book 5

  Whilst Voldemort's prisoner, Draco is made a vampire and forced to take Harry as his first meal. With Draco managing to resist the temptation to drain him, just barely, in a moment of blind rage at what he has been forced to become, he aids Harry in the destruction of Voldemort. But even with that threat vanquished, once back at Hogwarts, Draco finds himself disturbingly addicted to Harry's blood. And amongst all this, a dark shadow looms ominously on the outline of the forest, watching them closely. A vampire!Draco story and also an ‘Eighth year' story.

  Harry didn't ask for Malfoy to walk into his shop after so many years. But one event leads to another, and soon they're scrambling to help Hermione find the solution to one of the most insidious viruses the wizarding world has ever seen. To make matters worse, Malfoy's hiding something, and Harry really wants to kiss him---except Malfoy doesn't date. Ever.
