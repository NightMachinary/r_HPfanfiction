** linkffn(7733333) The Dark in Peace. Unfortunately this is unfinished and the author shows little interest in continuing. Perhaps if more people badger him he'll reconsider. I hope so, because this was shaping up to be another great story from a top author.

linkffn(8262940) Unatoned. The characters are over the top, but the mystery is crafted beautifully. Guessing whodunnit is fairly easy, but working out exactly what happened is much harder.
