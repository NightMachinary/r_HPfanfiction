Ok... here's one for all of you guys. How the hell did Riddle actually find the Chamber?

Before you go looking for an answer in cannon for me, thank you but don't bother, it's not there, there isn't even any hints in cannon as far as I'm aware.

This has always baffled me. TMR is WAY TOO PROUD to ever suspect Slytherin put the chamber entrance in a bathroom, and to be honest... I don't see what kind of unlucky coincidence could have led to this.

So... any ideas?


** He managed to get some Felix Felicis and took a teaspoon before he went looking for the chamber, it ended up only taking ten minutes. Recognizing the snake sign on the copper tap he immediately knew that he could open it by saying open in parseltongue, after he entered the chamber he proceeded to rightly guess that the beast has to be a Basilisk and after a couple of tries figured out what to say to the Statue so the Basilisk shows itself(he of course knew to avoid looking into its eyes) the entire process took him twenty minutes and proceeded to have his perfect day.

** He clearly knew the school well considering he found the room of requirement, and seemingly explored the rest of the school to great lengths while he was a student. Maybe one day he overheard one of the female students talking about a weird snake emblem in the bathroom on the third floor. He likely read all he could about Slytherin history, and believed that the Chamber of Secrets existed. In order for it to be hidden for 900+ years, it would have to be somewhere no one ever looked.

If he got the sink to open, it would only be natural for him to explore it, and find the Chamber proper. He was supposed to be this incredibly smart student, who knew the school better than anyone, he might of just searched the entire school looking for snakes to speak to. Just a theory.

Edit: Now that I think about it. Who put the snake emblem and spell on the sink in the first place? Surely the plumbing wasn't installed almost a millennia ago?

This is the perfect example of something that didn't need fixing. The Romans had plumbing, and it's easy enough to believe that wizards kept their knowledge of it even after it fell out of use in the Muggle world. So it's believable enough that a castle built c.1000 by wizards might have plumbing.

Unfortunately enough people seem to have said to JKR "Lol why does Hogwarts have plumbing?" that she seems to have felt a need to "correct" it; thus her explanation that the entrance to the chamber was added by one of Slytherin's heirs, and originally it was reached via a trapdoor.

** As McGonagall would say: "Pure, dumb luck!"

In my headcanon a Parselmouth can open the Slytherin common room entrance by simply saying "Open" in Parseltongue. So after finding that out, Tom would naturally try and see what else he could open that way. During his usual late night wanderings he went into the girls' bathroom, noticed the overly large and ornate sink, something wholly unique to that particular bathroom, examined it closely, found the hidden serpent etched onto it and commanded it to open.

That or he read about the Chamber in an obscure book in the Restricted Section, noticing that it mentioned that it was connected through the pipes and after logically deducing that bathrooms were connected to pipes as well explored every single bathroom until he found the right one.

I refuse to accept Jo's ridiculous statement that Wizards and Witches relieved themselves anywhere and vanished the remains. For one thing, a first year student wouldn't be able to cast the vanishing spell, so there would be piles of excrement and urine everywhere that some other poor sod had to vanish for them. No, it's far more logical that magicals at least had a basic privvys with the wooden board with holes, the waste would fall into the pipes until they converted to toilets. Pipes that were conveniently big enough for an adult Basilisk to slide through.

** Canonically, what actually happened is that a 19th-century Gaunt family member further concealed the entrance Chamber (thus far just an ordinary trapdoor) and added the bathroom setup. Riddle would not assume /Professor Slytherin/ would have done such a thing, but he may have guessed a previous Heir had interfered, and he would not think so highly of the Gaunts from his limited knowledge of them.

Barring this, and while I love the image of him simply spending a /lot/ of time walking about the Castle shouting ‚Äú/Open/‚Äù in Parseltongue to nothing in particular, a more likely theory would be that he guessed there would be a clue to the entrance such as a carving of a snake, had some unwilling cronies find all old-looking carvings of snakes in the Castle, and then investigated /those/ one by one; there can't have been /that/ many.

If one accepts /Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey/ as canonical to any degree, there is also the fact that there is a Portrait of Salazar Slytherin in the Castle. The Portrait-Slytherin /might/ have known the secret, though I'm not quite sure the original Slytherin would have trusted anyone (even a magical copy of himself) with his secrets. If he did know, it's entirely possible that finding the Chamber was as simple as locating the portrait, and asking it nicely (in Parseltongue, so as to prove descent).

*** I'll be honest, I doubt the portrait theory. One because I do not consider that cannon personally, and two because Slytherin had been vilified for centuries, so I find it unlikely they'd have a portrait of him kicking around.

As for the Gaunt's, yes, I know that in cannon they were going to fix the plumbing and he hid the entrance, but Riddle knew nothing of the Gaunt's at this point. He did not find out about the Gaunt's until later that year at the earliest (that's what's implied anyway) and at that point the chamber would have already been open.

As for cronies searching all the snake carvings. It would work but there's a problem... Riddle would NEVER trust anyone to help him with this. His paranoia and independence would never allow it.

Interesting, I wasn't aware. I know it doesn't answer the question, but rather than his connection to the Gaunts and theirs to Slytherin leading Tom to the toilets/Chamber, it could instead be the opposite. Tom might have read about renovations done to Hogwarts, and some detail or other led him to investigate. Discovering the Chamber then leads him to research the one who did the renovations. A Gaunt. He connects Gaunts to Slytherin. Then he searches for living members of the Gaunt family, discovers the unique name Marvolo in a Ministry report/Daily Prophet archive, and from this and his Parseltongue ability chooses to make a visit and discovers truth of his family.

Public sentiment goes against him, but the House /is/ still named after him, and the Slytherins (who /do/ after all comprise one quarter of Wizarding Britain's population) certainly like him. If you tried to hang the portrait in the Great Hall there might be trouble from angry Gryffindors and fainting Hufflepuffs, sure, but if the Portrait were put, say, inside the Slytherin Common Room, or otherwise somewhere in the dungeons, I don't think there would be any trouble.

Plus, since they can move frames, I think it's harder to get rid of a portrait than you're giving the painted buggers credit for. Even if someone tried to remove him from Hogwarts, Portrait-Slytherin could just have fled his frame, gone into hiding, and then commandeered some poor schlock's frame for himself.

**** Slytherin reputation is not really that bad. People must not forget that, in canon, Harry spends most of his time with convinced Gryffindor who have absolutely nothing in common with Slytherin and his ideals. This sentiment is further renforced by the fact that Voldemort use his blood relation to Slytherin to "justify" his actions.

I'm pretty sure Slytherin is really respected in most "Slytherin" household (even the non Death Eater ones) while Gryffindor is presented as a fool, uncultured and arrogant just like the members of his house are seen.

‚Äã

I also doubt that there is any portrait of Slytherin at Hogwarts, but I'm pretty sure that there is no portrait of any founder at Hogwarts, and it is my headcanon that any portrait of Slytherin left in the Chamber would have been plundered century ago by a Gaunt along with any item of value there.

** Tom Riddle, by Dumbledore's own mouth, was a brilliant student. One mark of brilliance is to be able to extract from disparate sources a detail or theory that would evade others.

So in Tom's case he reads everything he can (ex. learning oldest parts of Hogwarts, that Hogwarts didn't have bathrooms/get plumbing until later, an account of a trapdoor on that floor that never opened, a fable involving a cunning Slytherin who hid something in plain sight, and a host of other information.)

Tom also explores and makes discoveries with Hogwarts, and in general always has his eyes and ears open to learn/find something new/of interest. And of course he studies everything he can on magic (such the ability to detect magic and its traces (like Dumbledore did in HBP), and the possibility of picking something up that a non-Slytherin, non-Parseltongue may have missed). Through the years he accumulate a vast store of experience, knowledge, and magical understanding. At some point, through his endeavors, some pieces fall into place.

Basically to answer the question satisfactorily a whole mystery plot would have to be created from thin air. Think of Harry's mysteries (connecting a grubby package, a gringotts thief, a chocolate frog card, a headache, a cerberus, a jinxing, a name (flamel, on silver platter). Unless you know the story it sounds a load of nonsense. I also have to say Luck is a copout IMO, Harry and the gang put in a lot of work (in addition to having a lot of luck), and Tom never seemed to have much luck at all.

** Not really related to your question but I have one of my own. I always thought since only the heir of Slytherin could open the chamber it was cunning of Slytherin to place the entrance in the girl's bathroom (the last place anyone would look, after all what kind of legendary entrance is in a bathroom) but...JKR once said that wizards didn't always use bathrooms. They would just do the deed and vanish the evidence. So maybe when Slytherin placed it there it wasn't a bathroom and the bathroom was eventually built around it.?

Slytherin was probably rolling in his grave when he found that out.

** In my headcanon, by third year, Voldemort knew he was related to Slytherin. Maybe not directly persay, but he knew enough to know parseltongue was a Slytherin trait. As an orphan obsessed with learning more of his heritage and likely to figure out who his father was because his mom couldn't be magical as she died... He would have started looking. He likely found the Room of Requirement by accident at this point, much like Dumbledore did as well. It likely took him the two to three years of searching. That is possibly why he made the claim that he knew that castle better than anyone. He, the self proclaimed most powerful wizard alive, took 2 years to find slytherin's chamber.

He likely cast 100s of revealing spells. Said dozens of words in parseltongue, and it is likely in this time, he struck up a relationship with the grey lady and other ghosts.
