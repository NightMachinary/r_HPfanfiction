** Linkffn(Gray: Scorpius Malfoy and the Blood Runes). Book 6 starts with alchemy although it has little use before that. It's now a major plot point as Book 7 draws to an end.

*** While the Philospher's Stone is the pinnacle of alchemy (only because of greed, of course), that's not what it would be limited to. In reality, it was the pre-cursor to chemistry, a subject matter focused on the transformation of matter. Applied to the world of Harry Potter, this means that alchemy is most likely related to both Transfiguration and Potions in some manner.

So what does this mean? Hell if I know. But if I were to guess, it would involve transforming an item /cough cough/ a stone for example /cough cough/ in such a way that it takes on the properties of various ingredients. This would keep it separate from both Transfiguration and Potions while keeping it related. The transformation of the essence of the object from Transfiguration, but with the incorporation of properties in a manner similar to Potions.

I have always thought that the process of Voldemort gaining a body in /GoF/ was alchemical in nature. The object transformed? The weird Voldemort homunculus thing (heretofore referred to as a homunculus). The ingredients? We know of three. Bone of the Father: Gives a structure to the body. Flesh of the Servant: Gives animation to the body. Blood of the Enemy: Gives life/power to the body. If it was just a homunculus not possessed/inhabited/whatever by Voldemort, the process might just have created an artificial person, such as a flesh golem of sorts. But with it? Bam, reborn Voldemort. We know some other liquid was involved, because Harry was hoping Voldemort would drown, so there were probably other ingredients to give more and more properties to the body so it would truly be Voldemort reborn, and not a fancier homunculus.

EDIT: Holy fucking shit. Each of the ingredients do more than that, more than I had first imagined possible. Not only do they give certain properties, but they by their nature reinforce the Voldemort nature of the object. Bone of the Father says it is the child of Tom Riddle Senior. Flesh of the Servant establishes him as the Master of the Death Eaters. Blood of the Enemy defines him as the Enemy, capital N Nemesis of Harry Potter. That's another, even more important reason to use Harry Potter. Harry isn't just the prime enemy of Voldemort, but is essentially the embodiment of the principles that oppose those that guide Voldemort. Dumbledore would be the other logical choice, except that his Enemy, his opposing Force was /Grindlewald/. Less reinforcement of the Voldemort mantle.

Just as the Earth with turtles, magic is symbols all the way down.

**** for my headcanon, Transfiguration is imperfect, doesn't last forever. The same with potions. Alchemy is permanent. That's how I'd use it in my stories.

***** There's nothing I know of in the canon that says that Transfiguration is impermanent. But then again, we are discussing headcanons, so whatever. Potions, I would probably give that one to you, though the fact that some, say the Draught of Living Death, don't end until an antidote is given implies that some potions can be permanent. Saying that all Transfiguration is impermanent and the same with all potions just doesn't feel /right/ to me.

I always remember the Matroyshka dolls section from What You Leave Behind when I think of Transfiguration. The beetle that Harry is supposed to transfigure into a button remembers being a rock, so Harry is able to use an untransfiguration spell to return it to it's original rock-being. Even when transformed from a rock to a beetle, it retained an echo of a rock, a true part of it's existence. That, to me, is what Transfiguration does. It changes the nature of a thing, but the object to what it is transfigured 'remembers' or retains a bit of it's ur-self.

Compared to Transfiguration, Potions is a bit more straightforward. Potionmaking would take a variety of ingredients, chosen to amplify certain properties while decreasing/canceling other properties of the ingredients so the final product when ingested or poured, those properties are imparted to the user. Skele-Grow returns bones, and there they stay until something happens to them (permanence). Felix Felicis makes you lucky for a time (impermanence).

****** But skelegro is healing/reversing entropy [which is is still temporary because eventually the bone can break again or the person dies, it doesn't make the bone unbreakable for the rest of the recipient's life].

Does it say of the Draught of Living Death that the potion is permanent until the antidote is used? Because no other potion in the series seems to have that kind of permanence.

I thought it did, but sometimes I remember things that never happened, so I could always be wrong on that count.

Here I think we're using different definitions of permanence. What I meant was that the skele-gro created a new bone, that would then exist as bones do. That is, growing until whatever biological function tells it to stop, and existing whole until some force or action is applied to it, such as a break from a fall, or an incompetent professor accidentally vanishing the thing. I guess, if I were to distill my definition down, permanence would be an effect that doesn't undo itself, but would require additional actions to do so or to change unnaturally.

Would I be correct in saying that the definition you had in mind when reading my comment was more of a "bone was created, and never would it change or disappear?"
