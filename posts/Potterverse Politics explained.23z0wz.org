** This was written ten years ago, before Book 6 was published, and yet it is better-reasoned than most of the political!Potter fanfiction I've seen.

*** It's an interesting read, though obviously flawed in places because it was written before HBP. I especially felt it went off the rails when talking about Lucius' motivation in CoS and Voldemort's "demonic" psychic ability.

However, it made a number of interesting observations as well such as the Malfoys' position being far more precarious than it seems at first glance. I also liked the analysis of Percy. I feel like he gets a bad rap. I wish more fics made an effort to make him a more sympathetic character.

The observations about why the magical world remained 'backwards' compared to the muggle one were insightful as well.

** This is fantastic, as is the AJ Hall essay it mentions, which I had not previously known about.
