** linkffn(8804823) / Basically Harry is Death. He's been alone for about 15 million years after everyone and everything died in his reality. When he 'emerges' in the new reality, the Mutants are going through M'day(x-men), which is where at least 90% of mutants lose their abilities. It's an awesome crossover fic.

  M-Day. A day that would go down in history as the emergence of a new breed of humans. The Magicals. It all started with one individual who thought he was there to save the mutants. Sequel to Potter's Protector, rating for violence and swearing, no slash.

*** The story before that (Potter's Protector) is where it actually begins with Harry and the healing bit. It's a HP/Buffy Xover.
