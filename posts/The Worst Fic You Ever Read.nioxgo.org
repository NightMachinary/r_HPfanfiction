:FlairText: What's That Fic? 
:END:
When you talk about bad fanfics, you quickly realize HP has a lot. And I mean a /lot./ But there is nothing, absolutely nothing that can beat My Immortal for the crown of the worst fic ever written. Although I've faced the worst, I would like to hear your thoughts about the worst fics you read (so that I can add them to my 'Must Never Read This Even If The World Requires Me To Do So To Ensure Survival' list)

P.S. I lost a dare so my friend made me read 'My Immortal' ten times. /Ten/ fuckin' times. Two chapters in I literally cried. At the end of it I was contemplating murder and suicide.


** Actually My Immortal is pretty funny or I have a shitty sense of humor but the whole gibberish writing always makes me laugh. Just like I laugh at "who was phone?" or "when was u when John Lenin dies". However I think the worst fic, other than My Immortal, was one on wattpad where Voldemort discovers he can control Harry through the Horcrux. It seemed like an interesting idea so I kept on going. Turns out Voldemort is bored and writes to Harry and despite Harry being previously ok he is suddenly so abused by the Dursleys that he can't respond so Voldemort worries for him and goes to check out on him and then they get into this BDSM relationship which involves Voldemort prostituting Harry to the Death Eaters and a lot of mpreg (including Harry who is actually the son of Snape and Sirius). By far the worst written in a serious way fic I've read.

** *Unsung Heroes*

Wrong Boy Who Lived.\\
Harry is hated by most if not everyone, or simply ignored. He same some brother that is a dick to him, etc. The usual.\\
Hermione eventually approaches Harry and they become friends, and then lovers. (They are already older students in the story)\\
Anyways, the relationship between Hermione and Harry develops nicely. Harry becomes more confident through it and eventually more 'powerful' as a person.\\
However, Harry's brother wants Hermione for himself. he is a huge asshole becuase he thinks that Harry wants to steal his fame. So, over the summer holidays, the twin brother sends Hermione that cursed Slytherin necklace per mail. She gets affected by it and the Horcrux takes advantage of the situation by basically making/forcing Hermione to throw herself at Harry's brother - pretty much like a lust/love potion victim.\\
Harry sees all that after the summer holidays. When he reunites with Hermione, she sits on the lap of his brother. They snog and so on in public, and Hermione behaves hostile whenever Harry tries to talk with her. There was even oral sex involved (between Hermione and the twin).\\
Eventually, Harry manages to save Hermione before his twin brother could rape her to death - becuase the Horcrux was about to drain Hermione of her life force completely.\\
After that, the story is one huge mess.

I hate CucK/NTR and the Author kept it a secret for half of the story. There was no foreshadowing or whatever. But then suddenly Hermione was promised to Harry's brother in the first place - against her knowledge.\\
So people assumed that it is perfectly normal for her to suddenly break up with Harry, act hostile, and throw herself at his 'heroic' twin. It was damn painful to read.

It was one of the worst stories I have ever read. Mostly because the author fucked with his/her readers.

If I could rate the story, I would give it a... -1/10

*** NTR should only really be included in properly tagged fics and in comedy.

I remember there being this story where a super!evil!indy!harry replaces canon harry for some reason or another and then begins doing typical indy harry stuff, including getting a harem.

But a running joke of the story is that the whole of Harry's harem has been fucked by Ron before he did and I think even after that too.

But it also makes fun of the NTR trope by making it so that every single time Ron had sex with someone it was an extremely contrived, insanely specific plot + manipulation that literally makes no sense.

The story was hilarious and a good read if you don't take it seriously

** *Harry Crow*, without question.

I have read a few chapters of My Immortal, and while it is unbelievably bad, it is easy to remain totally detached from it because it's so surreal. Harry Crow, however, is written so that you are immersed in its overwhelming awfulness. Maybe you could say that its decent prose is a merit and thus makes it better, but I'd say it makes the story better in the same way as the sharpness of a knife makes the knife better as a torturing device. I read Harry Crow for about twenty chapters, because I was tempted to find out what incredibly cringeworthy happens next. Finally I had to forcibly stop myself from reading it anymore. My mind was tempted to continue reading for a week or so, but as the temptation finally stopped, I felt as if I had narrowly escaped the horrible fate of being irrevocably immersed in Harry Crow for the rest of my life (which would, I'm fifty per cent sure, have ended in suicide by now).

*** This happened to me with the fanfic as well!! It's terrifyingly addictive but so bad in storyline. Everyone worships the ground Harry walks on and anyone who's disagrees with him even a little bit ends up being ostracized and hated. It's probably one of the most Mary Sue-esque stories I've read and to top it all of, it often shows up in “top ten hp fan fictions to read”.

Ffnlink([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5770882/1/Harry-s-Ridiculous-Adventure]])

It's a crackfic where instead of horcruxes, they're whorecruxes. Voldy basically had sex with 7 women and split his soul into them. Harry then had to give them more pleasure to destroy V's soul. He ends up being transfigured into a giant dick in order to succeed at one point and the whole thing is horrible but strangely funny at the sametime

Basically, Lily became a genie during her pregnancy to save Harry, and now because magic Harry is a genie or the potter family is secretly genies. Then, Voldemort gets his hands on Harry's genie bottle/wand and forces him to be his slave. I kid you not, THIS HAPPENS IN BOTH. Continuing on, Harry 'falls in love' read, Stockholm syndrome, with Voldemort while some ocs support their relationship and say that it's inevitable and to just obey. Literally, I dunno how tf, but I read them both and went 'this is the same story...just written in different ways...' oh yeah, also there's mpreg, which I don't mind, but with the context it's a bit of an ick.
