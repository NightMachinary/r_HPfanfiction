What in your opinion are the essentials of this fandom? Essential authors, essential fanfics. Sort of the fanfics/authors that new readers should see as the first introduction to our community. For example, a new reader wants to read a good Harry/Hermione fanfic, what story should they read. What author should they follow, that kind of stuff.


** Personally I'd have them start with a time travel fic, maybe the previously linked Oh God Not Again, then once they're hooked to the idea of fanfiction, start throwing slightly different fics at them till you've reached heavily AU fics like Wizard of the Kaleidoscope, over this time you can ask what they did/didn't enjoy and tailor your recs with that information.

also, obligatory “eww, harmony.”

*** Oh God was one of the first fanfics I read and Wizard of the Kaleidoscope is what got me expanding into other fandoms. Many years later and here I am, so seems like a good path to follow.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Here's what I'd put as my essentials list that would give you a fairly broad overview of many different popular well known fics that I assume most long time HP readers have read or at least encountered.

​

*Essential Time Travel Fics*

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past - The most well known and probably the first fic to do a lot of the currently common time travel tropes. No link because story is currently down from ff, since it was flagged for copyrighted song lyrics despite not having any. The author is trying to work it out, but will presumably just post on AO3 or something instead if the issue doesn't get resolved. Active.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]] - Actually complete, and widely acknowledged as excellent. In some ways similar to the above, but also has some unique ideas. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] - Very out there, but interesting, and pretty well known. Harry is stuck in a time loop adventure, but it doesn't resemble canon at all. Complete. There is a sequel which is also complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] - Harry Travels back in time to his parents time period and befriends Bellatrix, who isn't crazy yet. Complete. There is an incomplete sequel, but Delenda Est tells a full story on it's own.

*WBWL*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] - The best one, but sadly abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] - The best one that is still active.

*Slytherin Fics*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] - Slytherin Harry, sadly abandoned pretty far in, but what's there is great. Likely abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or]] - Slytherin Hermione, similar to the above, gets pretty far, then was abandoned, but what's there is great. Likely abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]] - Fem Harry sorted into Slytherin. Written by Taure, who is a very good writer, and posts here sometimes. Active.

*Harry Travels to Alternate Dimension*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]] - Voldemort sends Harry to another dimension, as he figures that will let him live forever since the prophecy wouldn't be fulfilled. Very infrequent updates, might be fully abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800-Rent-A-Hero]] - Harry is summoned to another dimension by a desperate Order of the Phoenix shortly after defeating Voldemort, where he becomes the Divination professor. Likely abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] - Harry goes through the veil after defeating Voldemort, and into a similar but fairly different universe, where Sirius also went, and they have adventures. Complete.

*Other Good Essential Fics*

Either of white squirrels series, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] - in one Hermione is super good at math, which makes her great at spelcrafting, in the other Harry becomes an animagus due to accidental magic, and gets adopted by the Grangers. The Arithmancer series is complete, the animagus one is still active, but close to finished I think.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] - The horcrux takes over Harry, but is much less evil. One of the few good humor fics. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] - Hard to describe, but awesome. Basically Harry is literally a personification of death, and thus is really OP, but also doesn't really understand people, and that creates a lot of conflict as she goes through life trying to make sense of all the nonsensical things that seem to surround her (it's a fem harry fic). Active and updates pretty regularly. Has several also excellent spin off fics that also update regularly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]] - Another fem harry fic. Set in a very AU world where Riddle went to politics route, and basically won. Harry really wants to go to Hogwarts, but can't because they only allow Purebloods, so she and her Pureblood cousin switch, since he wants to go to the American school. Active, updates somewhat regularly, usually about one to three months between updates, but has had long hiatuses in the past.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]] - Completely original plot set in America, very different from current canon America, but super good and elaborate world building. Books 1-4 are complete. Book 5 will be out this year, currently it is fully written and being edited. There was a many year gap between the release of book 4 and 5 though, so will probably be a while after that for book 6.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8509020/1/The-Handbook-of-Elf-Psychology][The Handbook of Elf Psychology]] - Harry runs away, decides he is a magical creature, gets a muggle book on magical creatures from a library, and decides he is a forest elf. Hijinks ensue. Complete, but sequel is incomplete and likely abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations]] - Dudley is a wizard too, and goes to Hogwarts with Harry. Likely abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] - Harry is blind, but that makes him OP like daredevil since he can see magic instead. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] - Harry gets some of James' memories during the Goblet of Fire and thus is powered up. Tasks are different too. Pretty well done. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] - Hard to describe without spoiling things, but has great mystery elements. Harry befriends Cedric and Cho, and Hogwarts has a mystery room for each founder. Likely abandoned.

*Crossovers*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] - Complete Firefly cross.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] - One of the earlier MCU crosses, is abandoned, but still probably most well known one. Likely abandoned.

*Newer Fics I Really Like (So don't have the history the other fics on this list mostly do)*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]] - Self Insert into a random Hufflepuff. Tries to effect things in the background without getting overly involved, but does befired Hermione which changes some things. As of present has had no meaningful interaction with Harry or Ron. Active.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council][Harry Potter, et al, and the Keystone Council]] - 5 different versions of Harry can communicate across dimensions, and as they are experiencing very similar things, help each other. Sounds like it would be confusing, but is really interesting, and easy to keep track. Hopefully still active, it had been updating like once a week, and it's been a couple months since the last update, which has me worried.

*** That's a pretty good list. Can you mark the completeness/activity status of more of them? I'm Still Here seems to be inactive, for example. Blindness is complete. The Handbook of Elf Psychology is complete and is the first in a series.

I'd find a way to message Pony, possibly through mod mail, possibly through the discord if you want more from that.

My top 3 must reads would be

They Shook Hands by Dethryl - all 7 books with a convincing Slytherin Harry

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin - best WBWL fic that isn't abandoned

The Lie I've Lived - Jbern's comedy is top tier and his magic scenes are great

Sarah 1281 was the lass that got me into fanfiction in the first place with linkffn(Oh God Not Again), which is a truly brilliant comedy.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** I think the best fic I've ever read is 'Tightly Knit' by Kmbell92. It's on Wattpad, not FFN or AO3, but is written SO well (I dont think I've read anything wrong in it). It's pretty long, 100+ chapters with high word count in each chapter, but is the type of book that you just don't want to put down!

It's focused on an OC, who is best friends with Cedric Diggory, and doesn't really go along with the storyline, but there's a huge character arc and the actions of the protagonist change the story slightly (personally, I think that to have a good book, if you have an OC they should have an effect on the storyline). It's not predictable at all and the plot twists are incredible but also really believable! And the canon characters are so in character and are developed really really well!

Honestly, all the stories by kmbell92 are amazing!! I'd honestly reccomend it so much!
