idk if there is a term that exists, or maybe i'm just looking for suggestions, but the only term i can think of is 'quidditch bitches' but thats like extra derogatory and seems unnecessarily mean. plz lmk if there is something and i just missed it.


** Seeker seekers and chaser chasers

** If I'm understanding the context of the question (assuming that cleat chaser is some form of sports groupie), it's all going to end up somewhere in the derogatory realm. Maybe try for something relating to brooms, or snitch witches (which is still kind of horrible, but hey it rhymes).
