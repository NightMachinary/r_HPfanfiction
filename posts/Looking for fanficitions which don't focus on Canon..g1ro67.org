So yesterday I reread *Unfogging the Future by Naidhe* which is basically a polar|murder story where Lavender Brown found herself back in 1947 working as Seer where some strange murders are happening. Her good side-kick in trying to understand what's happening is the famously handsome and devilish Tom Riddle Jr.

It kinda gave me a craving for story that doesn't really focus on Canon (even if in this particular story Lavender actions change completely the future) with their own original plot, with unorthodox pairing or with a main character using an uncommon branch of magic.

So if you can recommend me, during this confinement period anything like this please, I don't particularly mind anything, slash or non slash, however I do mind it when the author write his whole cast as slash characters not really my cup of tea and not really realistic.

Thxs in advance.

*Edit:* because I was not clear enough when I mean "fanfictions which don't focus on Canon" I mean fictions that don't focus on Voldemort defeat, no time-travel to find and destroy his hocruxes, no AU smart|indy Harry stories during his period at Hogwarts, no WBWL and etc. It can be prior Riddle birth or after his defeat or during the "Canon" period 1926-1998 (if I don't fuck up Tom birthdate) even in a future where the Dark Lord won


** This is a Harry-centric one-shot that has nothing to do with defeating Voldemort and everything to do with Hogwarts students being sorted based on how they fight a troll. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11106651/1/Trial-By-Troll]])

In the Bleak Midwinter is a story where a time traveling Hermione aspires to have Tom Riddle Senior take care of his son to make sure that he doesn't turn evil. Tom Riddle Senior tries to make wizarding society believe that he's a pureblood wizard. It's a fun story, but still a WIP. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13013582/1/In-the-Bleak-Midwinter]])

If you're okay with crossovers, this is a pretty awesome one. HP-Matrix crossover. Voldemort is not a focus of the work. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370121/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Illusions-of-Reality]])

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** What do you mean by "not focus on canon"? Do you mean isn't set when Harry is at school and/or is about the struggle against Voldemort? Or do you mean isn't canon compliant?

If we're talking about just the former:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]]... Harry is an Auror trying to solve a crime
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][The Conspiracy of Blood]]... Harry is an old Auror trying to solve a conspiracy
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1623053?view_full_work=true][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]... largely focusses on Harry's muggle neighbour and Ginny while Harry is an Auror and tries to solve a crime
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21848851/chapters/52142821][Wood for the Trees]].... WIP about James Sirius Potter's relationships/life as an auror (it's either romance or slice of life)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8402590/chapters/19251973][James and Me]]... abandoned (WIP??) fic about James dating the muggle neighbour's daughter (from her perspective)
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=213384][The Seer]]... James Sirius Potter is a seer and there's a conspiracy... can they stop it before it's too late? Voldemort isn't in this but I can't remember if they were trying to resurrect him or not. I don't think so, but given the nature of the request I thought I should mention this niggling doubt.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15033473/chapters/34851110][Lethargic]]... first person account about a really lazy and very talented girl dating James Sirius Potter (not brilliant but I liked reading it) There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1057793][the Complicated fic series]]... similar deal, can't remember which I liked reading more out of these.

Those are all basically canon compliant. And also, I guess, there's a bit of a theme to them (well, two themes). The plots sometimes relate to what happened in canon, but they're definitely not about Voldemort.

Fics which are more AU:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13191881/1/The-Peverell-Dilemma][The Peverell Dilemma]]... Harry is a journalist and tries to (a) do something with his life (like solving crime) and (b) date Ginny... to be clear, this is not a Muggle AU
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=306311][And Love Prevails]].... Dominique is an Auror but doesn't solve crimes since she accidentally travels through time and meets Ignotus Peverell (romance)... might not actually be AU depending how you look at it (100% no Voldemort, though) but a very unorthodox pairing
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1881966/1/Reality][Reality]].... Harry is The Bachelor and Ginny is a contestant... also not a muggle AU... look, it's not fantastic but it was fun to read

If you're looking for just more non compliant fics, e.g.:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/25/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]... the resurrected Voldemort versus Lucius versus Dumbledore and co. after years and years of a Lucius ruled Britain; the author has more of these very alternative takes on the War, e.g. Divided and Entwined
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418][In the Bleak Midwinter]]... still about stopping Voldemort (I think, may just be a romance), but Hermione's travelled back in time to raise Tom Riddle as his governess (WIP)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/Strange-Visitors-From-Another-Century][Strange Visitors from Another Century]]... Harry, Ron and Hermione meet the founders and are trying to get back to stop Voldemort... a WIP that, to date, is still set entirely in the Founders era
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]... an accident on a very different horcrux hunt sends Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna to a very different dimension where Neville was the Boy Who Lived (until he wasn't) among other things. Also, Harry is... unstable.

Nice Recs already thanks.

*Edit:* I don't mind a story where the main character stop Voldemort accidentally, if he/she does it without any idea of what they are doing. Like in Unfogging the Future, Lavender made a prediction that the sevens will be his downfall, his death, she doesn't know what are the "Sevens" , and because she predicted other things related to the plot of this fiction and made a true prophecy, he listens to her, and irrevocably change the future for good, maybe not in a good way, but she did and made canon irrevelant

  In 1981, Lord Voldemort was victorious in Godric's Hollow. Fourteen years later, he rules Britain with an ironclad fist. Each year, young witches and wizards compete in Requiem for a place in his inner circle.

Post Battle - The canon epilogue is full of crap. After the battle, society is running on fumes. The government is gutted, economy is in ruins, Hogwarts still looks like a warzone, and the people are still terrified.

Harry ends up with a shitton of gold, families sworn to him, and wizengamott votes out the arse. Harry ends up putting all of that to use rebuilding society.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
