*** I really love this fic. A lot of people say they don't like the way Harry acts but I think its brilliant characterization.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

*** Wow, this story was not what I expected. From your description I was expecting comedy/borderline crack, but what I got was a a pretty good drama. It definitely has some moments where Harry's thought processes feel forced and rather illogical, but the overwhelming majority of the story is a rather compelling read.

I like the amount of thought the author put into the circumstances surrounding Harry's arrival, but I was disappointed that Harry caved and accepted working for someone he should have seen as his chief kidnapper so easily.

Anyways, it's a good read, but its currently at a point where I want to read more of it because the sheer injustice of the world makes me mad and I want the conflict to get resolved.

**** I agree with you about his caving... mostly. I can't remember the exact sequence of events, but it becomes clear that a primary motivation of his is to help his female alternate. Her life is, if anything, worse than his was at that point in time. As much as he doesn't care about what happens to everyone else, he cares about what happens to her.

His other motivation is a lack of options - he's really, really screwed by what they've done to him and he has no rights whatsoever. Working with this abductors in some fashion seems like the only way out, no matter how horrible that option may feel.

As long as he's secretly planning to visit upon them all the same physical and psychological anguish they did to him, though, I think it's fine.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7746111/1/Harry-Potter-the-Halfblood-Auror][Harry Potter and the Halfblood Auror]] is average as far as the plot goes, but the slow-burn nature of the pairing is really good to read, and the characterisation of Tonks is really vibrant and wonderful to read.

*** The author abandoning the story is what finally made me commit to only reading completed stories. However, it is a good read, agree with your judgement, average plot, good relationship building.

** Here's a relatively old one that's only /technically/ Harry/Tonks, but it's hilarious and amazing and clever and one of my favourite fics in general. linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool)

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

**** I think it's to symbolize the train crash that is incoming. With as disaster/danger-prone Harry is, and as clumsy as Tonks is, its only a matter of time before she trips, crashes into him, and they both land on some sort of mystical magical artifact that either sends them into a x-over, or destroys the world.
