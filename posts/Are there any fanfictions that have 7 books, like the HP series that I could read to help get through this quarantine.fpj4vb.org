I found a recent love of HP fanfiction, so I'm just curious plus super bored. It doesn't have to be that long, just anything would do really.


** The sacrifices arc by lightning on the wave is a classic long read. Complete rewrite of all 7 books. It's a “wrong boy who lived” fic where Harry has a twin brother who everyone believes defeated voldy when they were babies. It does have a slash relationship in the later books but it's easy to skip if that's not your thing (author gives warnings chapter by chapter). It's LONG. Like 3mil worlds long over the 7 fics. Well worth a go, I really loved it. It starts with “saving Connor” [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/?s=1&a=s]]

** It doesn't have 7 books but it's long enough to keep you busy for days. The first part is called initiate and the author should be Marauderlover7 or something like that. It's on ffnet. Still haven't finished it but it is nice. I really like the bits about Tonk's auror training. But it's more about Sirius taking Harry from the Dursleys prior to the first book and then it goes on when Harry goes to Hogwarts but everything is quite different.

And Cunning and Ambitious by MinaAndChao on ao3. It's a really good Slytherin!Harry story. 1-5 are completed and a few chapters of book 6 I think.

And I can't help it but: Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb sauce. Best story ever.

** Are you new to fanfic? Or just new to HP fanfic?

You write "anything would do" - are you aware of the dark and disturbing corners? Like the internet, there are parts of the fanfic world that can be seriously disturbing if you are new to it. There was a recent thread that discussed "things you won't read" and on the things that came up was (I wish I was kidding) Hermione and the troll from first year porn. Yuck.

That said, many people have different things they won't read. I dislike creature fic, harem and gore, while others dislike so-called slash (homoerotic love pairings) and mpreg (male pregnancy fics), which are things that don't bother me too much.

I think it would be a good idea to specify what you do not wish to read and or what you find disturbing. There is amazing fanfiction out there and there is very disturbing fanfiction out there and - this is the scary part - sometimes they overlap. What I consider amazing might make you run screaming for the hills and vice versa.

Personally I think "Blood Magic" by Gateway Girl is a good introduction to HP fanfic. It covers approx. Harry's 6th year, but with a twist: Harry finds out he is the biological son of Severus Snape. I like it bc it is very well written, discusses some ideas on dark magic and wizarding society that have become accepted in the fandom as standard by now and explores some ideas that J.K. Rowling could not put into the books for various reasons even if she wanted to, like a love affair between Remus Lupin and Severus Snape.

Note that Blood Magic was written before HBP came out. After reading Blood Magic so many times, I actually disliked HBP bc I preferred the outcome of Blood Magic to the actual ending of HBP.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

________

Another good story that would be a good introduction is Harry Potter and the conspiracy of Blood by cambangst

An elderly Harry, his adult children and grandchildren need to uncover a conspiracy against the Weasley clan and fight a new dark lord.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019]]

It is canon-compliant, so this is good if you want to read about how things might be 40, 50 years after graduation.

_______

Finally, something completely different: Exile by bennybear

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]]

It is about Draco Malfoy and his life after Hogwarts. He is forced to live without magic for several years and finds himself struggling through the muggle world, fighting depression and PTSD at the same time.

**** Most fanfictions have short-hand descriptions in the summary. If for example you see HP/DM you know it is a love story between Harry and Draco. Or HG/RW is Hermione and Ron.

You can also make specific requests like "Please recommend long, complete fanfics to a newbie to HP fanfic. Please no slash, no smut, no gore." Modify as needed.

Alternatively search this sub, there were quite a few threads requesting long completed fics to read during quarantine.

BTW: If you find you don't like a concept in a recommended story, don't get upset and hate on the author or on the person who recommended a story, just roll your eyes and hit the back button.

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.
