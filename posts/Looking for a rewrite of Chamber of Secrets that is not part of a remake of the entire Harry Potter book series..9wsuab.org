That's that I want to read a remake of the second book that is still a sequel to Sorcerer's Stone, but absolutely nothing about the first book was changed and it doesn't even have to part of a total remake of the next five books either (that'd be nice actually), I was just want to read a much more improved version of the second book.

Thanks.

*** I like that one; I feel it handles the idea of a Basilisk being essentially a living WMD quite well.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Linkffn(Furious Angels) is such a good rewrite of the CoS, and it doesn't have the credit that it deserves. I haven't reread it in a while, so I'm not going to say anything else other than you /absolutely/ should read it!

** Linkffn(Sympathetic Properties) seriously explores the consequences of the first book, from the potential impact of the philosopher's stone on the wizard world economy, to the fact that Harry was left in the care of muggles who abused him. It's a very well written story and tackles a lot of things in a very competent manner but is INCREDIBLY slow moving. Deals a lot with Harry gaining independence from Dumbledore (who is the author's caricature of the usual Manipulative/Greater Good Dumbledore tropes that is actually hilarious) and coming into his own. Highly recommend it.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] series starts the summer after book 1. Harry prays for help and Loki answers. There is some bashing in the beginning, but only in the sense that characters need to get used to a more independent Harry. The slash rating is for minor characters, not Harry.
