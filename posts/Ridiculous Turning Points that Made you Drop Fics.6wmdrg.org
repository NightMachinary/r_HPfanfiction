I thought it might be amusing for everyone to mention out of context the crazy wtf turning points that made you drop fics. Its usually out of characterness for me, but sometimes its powers coming out of nowhere. The more ridiculous and specific the better. We don't have to name the titles (its funnier that way).

For instance a few of my recent ones:

Ginny asks Harry's evil alternative universe self who acts like Gilderoy Lockhart for help writing a press release so she can dump regular Harry without ruining her reputation.

and

Harry admits his love for Hermione and also confesses he was so scared of loving her he was doing the unthinkable; pushing her to love Ron. They both laugh at the ridiculousness of it (its not an alternate universe).


** I once saw a fic ages ago where in order to turn the public opinion against him, Voldemort had Harry branded with the Dark Mark, since he planned on having his body dumped in a public place where everyone could see it.

This was after he had Harry captive for several days, letting the Death Eaters engage in torture porn with him.

I can understand the torture in captivity part, wanting to break him before you kill him and all of that. The Dark Mark branding I could understand too. Marking him as a member of a group that he and most of society hate/fear for good reason.

That's not the part that made me nope out.

SOMEHOW, Bellatrix, during one of the torture sessions, managed to break free of the alleged curse on her that made her evil, became /A Member of the Light Side™/ and helped him escape because she fell in love with him, eventually joining his harem.

WTF.

The fic was going quite decently until that point too...

You know the most fucking painful part of that? The Sword of Gryffindor is pretty much /useless/ on its own! What they needed was /basilisk venom/ and they could have gotten that any freaking time.

** I was really enjoying Avengers: Battleground by Shroud09. Just a fun "Harry goes to the Avengers universe and gets caught up in their adventures, as one does" story. The whole point of the story is he's the only magic user in the timeline. He needed to get away from the Wizarding world. Then in chapter 14, Morgan la Fay appears out of NOWHERE. Fine. Whatever. I can adjust, and it's still fun to read. In chapter 21, Harry basically wishes the wizarding world into existence in the Avengers universe. Why the HELL did you have him leave his universe if you were going to have it come back later? Make up your mind!

This and the constantly changing verb tenses (present/past tense) made me unsubscribe from it.

What annoyed me even more was Harry's insistence that he absolutely could not trust anyone because the scared sheeple would burn him like they did all the other witches and wizards as if the witch burnings were the first and only times humans had ever killed each other over something stupid.

It's such a shame that there a so few good Avengers crossovers, and even some that are good turn into ridiculous Multicrossovers with twenty new characters in every chapter and 200 thousand words before anything actually interesting happens.(I'm looking at you Child of the Storm)

I mean *Every* year something wants to threaten/kill someone.

First year - Troll, Mad Teacher(I doubt they knew he was Voldemort)

Second Year - Basilisk(That somehow killed no one)

Third Year - Crazy mass murderer/Voldemort's right hand(Or so they thought), Dementors.

Fourth Year - Gryffindors are dicks/Dangerous tournament/Death of a student/Mad Teacher

Fifth Year - Mad Teacher who legally tortures children. Also, does not teach anything.

Sixth Year - Death Eaters/Death of Dumbledore.

Seventh Year - Forceful attendance by orders of Lord Voldemort. Mad Teachers who legally torture children.

Apparently, Mad Teachers are popular in Hogwarts.

******** My reply was a mix of my own opinion and what the student body might think.

Strictly the student body:

1. Troll was an Incident, nobody hurt, no problem.

2. No idea why nobody ditched, it was basically a serial killer in the halls. People blame Harry, but that's just more reason to either lynch or run.

3. The dementors around the school could be compared to an ex military security company. Soulless killers, but don't get in their way and you'll be fine (you hope)

4. Above/Above/Something happened but no one is sure what, so it's basically indecision paralysis. Dumbledore claims one thing, Ministry still has some credit and claims the other.

5. You said it yourself, LEGAL torture. The kids put up with it cause they thought they couldn't do shit. Schoolwide attitude (except for slytherins) starts turning against MoM but they're in the middle/end of the school year before any of this starts getting severe.

6. Most of Draco's incidents are isolated from other people. Everybody is just hearing tales from people who were there at the time. Nobody even knew about Ron's poisoning aside from close friends. Not a lot to go on aside from bad feelings. And people ARE wising up and pulling kids out, it's just not a lot. By the time there are more, it's too late and attendance is mandatory.

When I say unrelated plot, I mean unrelated to Harry. Basilisk, Triwizard, technically Umbridge, because if Harry wasn't there she still would be in order to discredit Dumbledore. The Stone, eh. Voldemort was there for the stone but Harry was a secondary goal. He would have gone after him eventually. For the rest of it, if Harry wasn't there, villains would have no reason to be there and school would be relatively boring. I think most of Hogwarts got their kicks from betting on how the Defense teacher would leave/die that year.

like i find the dark side of the hp world interesting to explore too and i've read some extremely au stuff but it was such an lazy asspull justification and i could sense all the lightside bashing and Dumbledore beard twirling from a mile away at that point so i clicked away with no regret.

also i sudder to remember this(mush, much worse) one ncis/hp crossover i attempted to read(because really, i will give /anything/ a try) which in the first chapter had some random death eater give harry a permanent womb. the story had no mpreg warning so this came out of totally no-where to me, and apparently the whole justification for harry leaving to the muggle world was that he could never get a women pregnant again even if he chose to get rid of the womb, adoption is never an option, and apparently wizards are also all homophobs. dear lord

***** I totally agree. I view it like pairings - if the first time the characters meet each other you know "oh ok, I guess they're gonna be friends for life" it knocks the fic down a few pegs in my book.

Rowling added some nice twists (Neville becoming close even though he was basically disregarded at first, Lavender becoming prominent, etc.) that made the characters feel like an actual school. My best friends from school now are not the ones I was friends with when I was 11, even though I'm still at the same school with them.

***** I usually use a story's treatment of Ron as a good indicator if I want to keep reading. He doesn't even have to be in it much (or at all) as long he's not a complete jerk or drooling moron. Writing him out into the background is usually a sign of restraint.

Ron has a lot of legitimate problems and could easily and believable be on the outs with Hermione and Harry. Heck, it happened several times in canon. Writers don't need to villianize him. I think he's got the most room to grow out of any of the characters. He should be one of the most interesting to write, imho, but he's usually the most mishandled.

***** That's why I mostly prefer AUs, post-canon stories, and stories that start after year 5/6. When you re-do canon you need to keep a good amount (because you and your readers want to be reading Harry Potter, not an original story wtih only the names). But, much of what's kept logically would not be kept if this was original fiction.

**** From the perspective of both an adult and a child I doubt Harry would be friends with both of them unless he was desperate for friends. They are children with all the flaws associated with that but so was Harry and I don't see him putting up with a nagging knowitall or a jealous friend all the time.

******* That was more directed at himself being poor, something that's always been a sore point for him - as it was for Ginny, according to Tom from the diary -, and Harry treating ten galleons (£50 in 1994 ~= £94 today) like it was nothing didn't help. He never seemed to begrudge Harry having money...

Also, that happened /after/ their falling-out.
