I read it many years ago, so I don't remember the exact details.

I think it was one of those "Summon a Hero" fics, where Dumbledore and the crew try to summon someone who can help them.

Not sure, though, but it did have the whole trio, and they were like more mature versions of their canon selves.

I dunno if Ron's in it. I think he's dead or some shit.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
