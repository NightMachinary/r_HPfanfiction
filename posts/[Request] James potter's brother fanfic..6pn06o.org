I read a fanfiction a while back about James potter brother who raises harry. I think his wife was killed by death eaters and he is not a light wizard more grey not afraid to kill.


** No idea what this is but if it's not abandoned I'd definitely like to read it.

  This is a what if story. Canon will be followed when it fits my story. Harry is powerful but not a superhero, Harry and Hermione the main pairing, rating may change down the road.
