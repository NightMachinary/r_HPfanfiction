linkffn(Return of Emerald) This is one of my favourite fics ever. I liked it a lot and whilst it does have its faults (the comparison between the colours jade and emerald were /annoying/. I googled the colours and they seemed to be pretty similar and indistinguishable) it was profound and unique. The Altair plot twist was pretty cool but also sad. And I definitely would have liked to see more of Harry's emotions - the author seemed to fluctuate between wanting Harry to be completely emotionless and only wanting him to be so when he was Hassan, and wanting him to feel as Hassan but not show it, imo. It was what threw me off when I tried to read it a couple months prior, the emotionless thing, and I think I tried to read it twice before settling down with it.

Also! After I finished it I listened to The Hobbit audiobook and I'm going to start LOTR soon! I've never watched the movies but this fic made me intrested in the franchise

  COMPLETE Slytherin!Harry. When the BWL is discovered missing, no one thinks twice when Hasan Castell appears at Hogwarts. Abandoned in a muggle orphanage, Harry grows up with a love of magic-in books that is-and thinks sorcery is all in his dreams. He calls himself Hasan to separate his dreams from reality, and is adopted and raised by a man who should be dead.HP/LL mentor!Snape
