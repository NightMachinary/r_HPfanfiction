*** Threw this together

​

​

The Dark Lord had only just apparated away from the revel. Cheers still filled the air.

Regulus Black could have been the poster child for the Dark Lord's movement. Slytherin to the bone, and proud of it. His family were purebloods, one of the Sacred 28. Smart as he was ambitious, and usually the picture of pride when it came to the Movement.

Not tonight.

It was with great reluctance Regulus approached his idol. Lucius Malfoy was everything he aspired to be. Lucius Malfoy would know what to do.

“We attack in two hours,” the man was saying happily. “Now we'll see how the magical world prospers when true wizards reclaim their rightful place in society.”

His swallow was audible. “Uh... Lucius...”

The older man noticed his hesitation for the upcoming battle. “Have courage, my friend.”

“Yeah. Lucius... I've just noticed something.”

But the blonde was carefully rearranging healing potions organized on the inside of his robes. “These Aurors are all cowards,” he muttered to himself.

“Have you looked at our marks recently?”

The question skimmed the outer surface of his mind as Lucius continued to prepare. “Our marks?”

“The Dark Marks - on our arms.”

Attempting to offer a fraction of attention, he mumbled, “What? No. A bit.”

Regulus struggled to continue, as if he were about to admit something deeply personal. Finally, he blurted, “They've got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our marks actually are just a snake coming out of... a skull.”

Lucius blinked a moment in confusion, finally looking up. “Uh -- I don't -- well --“

“Lucius...” He sounded as desperate as he looked for reassurance. “Are we the baddies?

​

​

​

It was just twenty minutes later their conversation resumed. “The DMLE is sending about fifty Aurors, so we'll be slightly outnumbered. But if we take half our Eaters and-”

“Why skulls, though?”

Lucius straightened. “What?”

“Why skulls?”

With no small amount of frustration, he answered, “Well... maybe they're the skulls of our enemies!”

“Maybe.” Regulus seemed to consider that. “But is that how it comes across? I mean, we didn't get a tattoo on our other arm saying, ya'know, yeah we killed him but trust us, this guy was horrid.”

“Well. No. But-”

“I mean, what do skulls make you think of? Death. Cannibals. Beheading. Erm... uh... pirates-”

“Pirates are fun!” he burst out.

An amused smile crossed his face. “I didn't say we weren't fun. But fun or not, pirates are still the baddies. I just can't think of anything good about a skull.”

“What about thestrals? Thestrals are cool.”

Regulus looked unconvinced. “Even thestrals are more usually depicted with the rest of the skeleton.” Whereas the Ministry-”

“Oh, you haven't been reading the Daily Prophet's interviews with the Minister, have you? Of course he's going to say we're the bad guys.”

“But they didn't get to design our marks! Their symbols are all quite nice. Phoenixes, lions, the letter M...”

“What's so good about the letter M?”

Regulus scoffed. “Well, nothing. And obviously, if there's one thing we've learned while infiltrating the Ministry it's that our government is in dire need of younger representatives who possess an ounce of inspiration to create serious and meaningful change.”

Lucius offered a shrug in agreement.

“But I've gotta say it's better than a skull. I mean... I really can't think of anything worse as a symbol, than a skull.”

His voice overcompensated confidence to hide any shred of hesitancy. “A... niffler's anus!”

“Yeah. And if we were overthrowing a government body that got matching tattoos of a niffler's anus, I'd probably be a lot less worried, Lucius.”

In frustration, Lucius grabbed his mask from the table to continue getting ready. The black eyes of the skull mask seemed to judge him. Avoiding its gaze, he noticed a fellow Death Eater lighting his cigarette with a skull-shaped lighter. The lighter produced a skull-shaped flame.

Shit.

“Okay. So...” Lucius started cautiously, but then met the challenging eyes of Regulus. Resignation slowly crossed his face. He took a short breath before understanding what they had to do.

A loud crack filled the air. Where the two men had stood, only some upturned dust remained.

** G: I just can't think of a name for a group that's worse than "Death Eater".

M: We could be the... Chuddley... Cannons.

G: Yeah, well, if we were trading curses with the "Chuddley Cannons", I'd feel a lot better.

-Excerpt from Crabbe's Journal

Due to these written "musings", and as part of his plea deals, after the first war, Crabbe became founding owner of one of the worst managed and worst funded Quidditch teams in British history.

** Malfoy: Very well. They're coming. Now we'll see how these Mudbloods deal with a crack Pureblood force.

Crabbe: Uh... Lucius...

Malfoy: Have courage, my friend!

Crabbe: Yeah, uh, Lucius... I've just noticed something.

Malfoy: These blood traitors are all cowards!

Crabbe: Have you looked at our dark marks recently?

Malfoy: Our dark marks?

Crabbe: The dark marks on our arms, have you looked at them?

Malfoy: What? No, a bit?

Crabbe: It's a skull. Have you notived that our dark marks are actually just mainly a skull and a serpent?

Malfoy: I don't...

Crabbe: Lucius... are we the baddies?

...

Malfoy: We should be able to hold them at this point here for at least a few hours.

Crabbe: But why skulls though?

Malfoy: What?

Crabbe: Why skulls?

Malfoy: Well, we're Death Eaters aren't we? We eat death! It's about our defeat of death itself!

Crabbe: Maybe, but is that how it comes across? I mean we tend to cast the Dark Mark right after we kill people, mainly. It doesn't say next to the skull, "You know, yeah we killed him, but trust us, this guy was horrid, and his murder will lead to the eventual defeat of Death itself down the road a bit."

Malfoy: Well, no. But...

Crabbe: I mean what do skulls make you think of? Death, Cannibals, beheading, um, pirates...?

Malfoy: Pirates are fun!

Crabbe: I didn't say we weren't fun, but fun or not, pirates are still the baddies. I just can not think of anything good about a skull.

Malfoy: What about pureblood skull shape?

Crabbe: Even that is more usually depicted with the skin still on. Whereas Dumbledore...

Malfoy: Oh, you haven't been listening to Dumbledore's propaganda? Of course he's going to say we're the bad guys!

Crabbe: But he didn't get to design the permanent magical brands on our bodies! And Dumbledore's symbols are all quite nice! Phoenix, Lion, Eagle, Badger...

Malfoy: What's so good about a badger?

Crabbe: Well, nothing and obviously if there's one thing we've learned in that 10 years of defeat was that Hufflepuffs seem to be the ones that do all the real work in our society. But you've gotta say, it's better than a skull! I mean, I really can't think of anything worse as a symbol than a skull!

Malfoy: ...A flobberworms's... anus?!

Crabbe: Yeah, and if we were fighting wizards marching under the banner of a flobberworm's anus I would be a lot less worried, Lucius!

Malfoy looks at his Dark Mark, and the one floating above the dead muggle's house.

Malfoy: Okay... so...

Malfoy and Crabbe lock eyes, then apparate away...
