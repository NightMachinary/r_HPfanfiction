Can be a little or a lot. No Muggle Wank, but people genuinely curious is fine.

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14078862]]) The Grangers adopt Harry and do things like attend Wizengamot sessions and magical plays.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** Linkffn(13308768) They're not the main focus, but they take an interest in what happens in the story

linkffn(5265558) is the sequel to linkffn(4967871) They pretty much help Harry and Hermione, along with Sirius to get out of Britain.

That's all that comes to mind without Weasley-bashing.

  What if Lily and Petunia had been able to reconcile while Lily was still early in school? If the two remained close until Lily was forced to go into hiding? What if Harry knew a lot about his mother, and wanted to be like her rather than his famous father? What impact would that have on a certain headmaster's plan to have a young Harry enter the magical world hoping for an escape?

  Many fanfics speculate about what would have happened if Harry had asked Hermione to the Yule Ball. Or what if he had taken Ginny to the Ball? Here's a twist. What if he had done both? And what else in the story might have changed as a result?

** LeadVonE's "Dodging Prison & Stealing Witches" linkffn(11574569). Very intense and complex, still in progress, extremely amoral Harry. But the Grangers really do get into it: reading all the books, wearing robes, becoming vassals to a great House, etc.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
