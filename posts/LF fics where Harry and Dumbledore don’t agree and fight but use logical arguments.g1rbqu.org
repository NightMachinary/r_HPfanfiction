So, I'm looking for fics where they fight (verbally) about how to handle the war, using logical arguments instead of ”harry mah boy I insist you stop this nonsense, they can be reformed!” And ”shut up u old man I don't need an adult”

- I Prefer longer fics
- They can fight with magic too but pls no

Thank you


** Shut up, harry Mah boy, you're interrupting the last season of stranger things!

**** Harry, mah boy, I will marry you off to Molly Weasley instead of your daughter if you don't stop interrupting the magnificent specimen that is the Sheriff. And this time I won't use love potions.
