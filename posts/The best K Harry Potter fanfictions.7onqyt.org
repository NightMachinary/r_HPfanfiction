I've read quite a bit of Harry Potter fanfictions and I was wondering if there were any worth reading that had a K+ rating instead of T or M. I read Oh God Not Again! and quite enjoyed it so I was just curious if there were any others out there with that rating that are good.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3661577/1/Summer-of-Independence][Summer of Independence]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3781358/1/Year-of-Changes][Year of Changes]] are good. It's goes on a little cliche of rich/business owning Harry, but I think the writing/plot/characterizations make it more innocent and fun rather than as a set up for a politically powerful!Harry. Both complete. 131k and 60k words respectively. No pairings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]] is another good one that starts on the basis that the basilisk presence is taken MUCH more seriously than in canon leading to a series of reactions and events. Basically, the idea of what "should have happened" had adults acted like responsible adults. Complete. 34k words. No pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7619993/1/Calculation][Calculation]] is a long (18k) one shot featuring a super smart and mature!Harry. Don't take it too seriously; it's just meant to be a fun fic, I think. To be honest, I think it could be considered a crack!fic, but it's very well written. Complete. 18k words. No pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7239464/1/Different-Not-Defective][Different, Not Defective]] is a story with ASD!Harry (autistic spectrum disorder). I'm not autistic myself, so I can't say how accurate it is. I had thought the author or someone the author knew had ASD, but when I went back to check for author notes, there weren't any. It's got a lot of mostly positive reviews, though, including people who are on the spectrum--so I can only assume it's fairly accurate in its portrayal. That being said, it's a heartwarming story showing Severus bonding with Harry. Unfortunately incomplete (and probably always will be). Incomplete. 32k words. No pairing. Last updated May 11, 2016.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] is one I partially read a long time ago and never finished. I can only speak for about half of the chapters (I went back and skimmed to make sure I remembered this was the story I'm thinking of). Essentially, Harry comes back from Hogwarts and finds the house empty. So he figures out some summer plans (while being in disguise). I think I remember it being pretty light hearted, although nearing the end of where I stopped reading, I think something happens. Features a bit of a more mature!Harry, if I recall. It's very slow paced, too, and it has hints of Harry/Hermione (but I don't know if it actually happens). Incomplete. 264k words. Last updated November 16, 2010.
