I have read Harry Potter becomes a Communist, so do any of you know about any other leftist fics?

** Its difficult matching economic theory to HP bc the magic obviously creates a lot of fuckery but for more generically leftist/antifascist ideas the closest I can think of right now is probably linkffn (Democracy by Starfox5) though that is a lot softer than what you're probably looking for, completely agree tho, would love to see a fic that recognises fully that politics are the product of mass movements not people sitting in tearooms seeing who can say "my Lord" the most

** Communism would be a legitimately interesting ideology to explore in Harry Potter, because Magic makes both a post-scarcity society and a stateless one (or at least the state being incredibly hands-off and only exist for the Secrecy Statute) quite possible.

The whole capitalist market and idea of wealth seems to be in many ways a spook in HP, unless we talk about some really specialized items that can't be mass produced, or produced in-house.

‚Äã

The People's Union of Britannia could possibly achieve real Communism, as Marx saw it.

*** How does Marx apply to what is essentially a pre-industrial society? What are the "means of production" in Harry Potter? I see no evidence that there is anything recognizable as capitalism in Wizarding Britain. I think we'd have to look to the Middle Ages in Europe, with their guilds of skilled, specialized craftsmen, to find a Muggle economic model similar to Wizarding Britain.

*** errr... No. Magic will just amplify inequality.

When you have people that can't even cast a shield charm and they have to rely on people that have all the power in society why should the people in power dedicate their existence to serve other people's needs instead of following their dreams? This is especially apparent in Harry Potter when a powerful wizard can do whatever he wants and society can't stop then.

This is more an Ancapistan than anything else.

first of: starts off with an insult "Oh shut up.". If that is how he starts a joke, he is just asking for his joke to be taken seriously.

second: Nothing that even remotely hints at a joke. No punchline, no visible sarcasm even in text form. It is literally just 'everything is political'

to put it bluntly: If it was a joke, which I have a hard time believing, it was a shit one.
