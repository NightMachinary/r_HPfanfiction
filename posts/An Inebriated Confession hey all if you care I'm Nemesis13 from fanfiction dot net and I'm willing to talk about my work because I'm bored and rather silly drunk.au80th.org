:FlairText: I'm Bored, Enlighten Me.
:END:
So while I was, hmm... /very/ apprehensive about this I had quite possibly the worst work week I've ever experienced in my three decades of life and kind of figured fuck it, I need a distraction. I am fully expecting either A.) No responses at all, or B.) Vitriolic condescending commentary, and least likely but certainly most preferable, C.) a genuine desire for communication.

So Reddit, talk to me, what do you think of my and Lily's stories? What would you like to see us writing in the near future when it isn't insomnia driven?

I'm leaning towards 'Balancing the Scales' but really I'm up for anything if someone gives me a good enough reason to pursue it.

Heh, Lily is gonna be pissed with me when she finds out I did this... Ah well, she's cute when she's angry.

So knock yourselves out Reddit, either no one gives a fuck or I'm gonna get fuck'in swamped, either or, I'm up for it.

*** Working for a narcissist who spends more effort to displace blame for his own mistakes then he actually puts into fixing said mistakes is tiring. I've been awake since 1 AM and have been sipping wine while watching gen:LOCK over again, then I got bored and felt compelled to write and then didn't know what to write.

It's a thing.

Regardless, I'll be ok soon since I'm looking for a new job. Thanks for asking ^_^

** Since your Reddit username contains Vault-Tec, I suppose you like Fallout too. There's never been a decent HP crossover with Fallout finished, although I see strong potentials here. Are you interested in writing one?

*** Truthfully I had never really considered it, I suppose writing Harry and whoever else being in stasis after the attacks wouldn't be out of the question, but getting them to America would be something I'm not quite sure they would be capable of. And they would /have/ to be in America since half the fun of Fallout is the 1950's flavor of the entire franchise, hmm...something to consider.

**** Goblet of Vegas has an interesting premise that I'd love to see expanded on by a talented writer. Blatant flattery I know. ;)

The short version is that messing with the Triwizard Cup results in it sending the champions to New Vegas were the challenge is to do more than just survive.

** I LOVE Baancing the Scales.

I'd love to see more of it.

[By the way, it is that fic that got me to play KOTOR for the first time]

(I would only be slightly less enthusiastic about Bellatrix)

*** You know 'Being Bellatrix Black and Loving It,' started off as just a method to make my muse shut the hell up and let me get some sleep, then it ended up doing the direct opposite because I kept thinking of scenarios that made me break out laughing?

Maddening, absolutely maddening.

Also I'm glad I got you to play KOTOR, it and its sequel didn't age all that well but they are still certainly fun if not for the gameplay then the storyline.

***** I was considering starting the next chapter off with Revan introducing Bastila to Remus and then having to explain to her girlfriend why they called her 'Blood Blossom' during the war.

"Err...yeah that was one of the titles they gave me before I was mind fucked to be a pacifist. Blood Blossom, Crimson Lily, Death's Bouquet, honestly I was very busy, and eventually a girl gains a reputation when she gets around."

****** As a follow on question.... I've been going through your various stories and reading them (more, please!!) and I was wondering if you had plans to eventually complete all of them? Or are they just plot bunnies and you'll see where they go.

Other than that, I haven't read much of your stories but from what I've seen, your writing is solid.

*** That one is honestly in my top five favorites to write; Dany's thought process is so fun to write through because she is incredibly intelligent, with a century old wizard's memories to call on, yet at the end of the day she's a teenage girl who has no real idea what the hell she is doing but is able to fake it like it was no one's business.

** I generally enjoy your works but most seem to be abandoned a few chapters in. And I really get that writing updates can be a bitch, and sometimes you want to skip the boring bits and get to the good part, but your pacing is all over the place. Looking at "Through the looking glass", it isn't impossible to build a relationship in that amount of words/chapters, but it is unbelievable how quickly it happens in the story. I think you go from "enemy" to "let's bone" in a week. A bit more time passing in the background would already do the trick (eg " a month passed and Harry...")

** I've really enjoyed "A Life Twice Lived" and "Through the Looking Glass" I rofled when I read the line about Harry feeling betrayed in Through the Looking Glass by Ted and Sirius. And the reaction of Ted and Lucius over the relationship of Dany and Harry was great also. When will we see more?

*** Through the Looking Glass was a surprise for me, I just kinda wrote what came to mind and it ended up being one of my most followed stories over night which, don't get me wrong, is awesome, but I had never written an outline for it so I kinda stymied myself on how to progress it.

Ted and Lucius in A Life Twice lived kinda serve as the 'straight men' to all the chaos around them rather well don't they? As for when it'll be updated, whenever the muse strikes, which is hopefully soon because I adore that story.

*** I'm going to be honest on this one, with /that/ story I kinda froze up and thought, "Holy shit, how is she /not/ going to burn the school down in the first week out of shear boredom?" When every day is an adventure and every hurtle is a boss battle what is a young Red Mage supposed to do when she has to go to a history class taught by ghost? Which, in said young mage's mind should have been fucking /awesome/ but ended up being suicide inducing boring.

I love Iris but her thought processes are honestly terrifying, and I /created/ her.
