** Still writing HBS. Still no end in sight.

At one point, I thought I had the ending and then I scrapped two chapters. 35k words just shift+deleted. At times, I have written myself out of writer's block by starting up another story, but I don't want to put myself in a situation where I write one fic in favor of another.

I can only hope the holidays give me some inspiration and motivation

*** Y'know, one of the advantages of writing a work in progress is that you can take back the last chapter if it ends up leading the story into a brick wall.

So, if you were somehow compelled (by magical editor fairy) to change the last chapter, what would you change?

*** Thank you so much for your dedication. The main thing is that you keep at it, and take as much time as you need. I would rather have a chapter a year and it be amazing, then finish it in a month and it not be as good at the beginning 47 chapters.

I think I can speak for all of the fans when I say if it never got finished it would ruin me. So thanks for your perseverance.

***** A canon rehash means that you keep most, if not all plot points same as canon. If your fic follows the old pattern of Cafe fight->Grimmauld Place->Ministry->Forest->Godric's Hollow and so on, then it is a canon rehash. You can probably mess around with group dynamics and all to keep things relatively interesting, but unless written by an exceptional author, a canon rehash will always be a bit on the dull side.

A fix-it fic is one in which all canon conflicts are resolved far too easily and lazily. Like, here you add Ginny to your story, and she solves everything. All of the horcruxes are obtained easily. Ron no longer leaves. Dobby and Fred no longer die. And so on. There is now little to no conflict or meaningful consequences. Generally done to avoid a canon rehash, but it just makes the story worse.

Writing this story, you've probably asked yourself what Ginny could add to the team. That is fine and good, but perhaps a more important question to ask is how Ginny could possibly /detract/ from the team, all the ways her presence could make the horcrux hunt worse rather than better. Having things go wrong is far more interesting than having things go right. Change a major plot point that can be shown to be a consequence of Ginny's presence: Voldemort finds about the horcrux hunt earlier? One of the original trio dies? Harry walks away instead of Ron when Ginny sides with her brother and he perceives betrayal?

Of course, Ginny still has to remain a strong character with agency even if you choose to have her presence make things worse. Doing otherwise makes very little sense story wise and does a disservice to the character.

EDIT: How do you intend to solve the problem of the trace on Ginny? You could have them stay at Grimmauld Place the whole time, but that's fix-itty and boring.

** Writing linkffn(Holly Polter) - wherein canon is interrupted pre-5th year when my alternate fem!Harry drops in and decides to turn everything upside down. It's a silly smut fic that I'm taking too seriously.

Also working on the continuation of Holly's main story, linkffn(the Spiral Path), if only to catch up with the version in Holly Polter.

Planning the Story of Magic, which is intended to go into the pre-historical origins of magic as described by late 21st century Professor of Languages and Arithmancy Constantine Carlisle, who learns most of this using the Resurrection Stone he'd found in the Forbidden Forest. He summons older and older spirits, learning to speak ancient languages to get ever closer to the source of magic.

** I'm still writing a Seven Samurai inspired HP fic with the founders as the hired wizards and Hogsmeade as the targeted town. I've managed to get a couple of chapters in a couple of times then get busy and lose the time to write it or lose inspiration. Once I've actually manage to finish it I'm going to write other Akira Kurosawa inspired fics with Harry Potter wandering into towns and sorting out their issues.

They're hopefully going to get me into writing and work the rust out my keyboard and brain so I can write the fic that I want to write, which will be a more of an ambitious project that I don't want to screw up.

Deconstruction isn't really genre in of itself, because they change ALOT depending of what they imitate. Most recent major deconstruction is Undertale.

** I have several things kicking around in my brain that I can never seem to find the time or the energy to write.

1. A Harry Potter/Skyrim crossover where Harry finds out that he's Dragonborn during the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

2. A post-war story where Harry went into hiding after the war and is not happy when the Ministry arrives to bring him back.

3. Harry Potter, Senior Unspeakable, accidentally gets sent back in time due to an accident in the Department of Mysteries. Although the idea is apparently cliched, I was going to try and subvert as many of the usual time travel cliches as I could.

4. When Harry catches Draco in the Room of Requirement trying to fix the vanishing cabinet, he's not quick enough to avoid getting hit by a spell and Draco leaves him for dead. The magic of the room keeps him alive by assimilating him into Hogwarts. He basically becomes the avatar of Hogwarts, but I probably won't write it because OP!Harry gets boring really quickly.

5. Another Harry Potter/Skyrim crossover where Harry and Hermione miss the story of the Three Brothers and instead find the story of Auriel's Bow. What follows is basically Harry and Hermione going through some of the storyline for the Dawnguard Skyrim expansion, including meeting up with Serana and one or both of them becoming Vampire Lords.

6. A fun piece of post-OotP fluff where Tonks gets suspended, Fleur gets cheated on by Bill, and Ginny runs away after being grounded and forbidden from speaking to Harry anymore after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. All three women end up at Grimmauld Place at the same time and decide they need to get away for a vacation, and they decide to take Harry along for the ride. Cue Harry and three beautiful women visiting night clubs, beaches, etc, while the Order goes nuts trying to find Harry.

7. An attempt at a cursebreaker!Harry story that explores actual cursebreaking instead of fan-invented "wards." I know the mechanics of the magic I want to use, but I have no plot to go with it.

*** Second request for number 7! Mayhaps Harry goes on vacation to Hawaii, and gets knocked off his surfboard by a kraken, dragged deep underwater, and by the time he escapes/kills the monster, he is leagues away from land or the surface. With his trusty bubble-head charm, and a friendly underwater-fire-crab (or something else cool and new), Harry swims towards a faint light in the distance, which turns out to be... /Atlantis!/ So he has to break in, fix the sunken city, and return it to it's rightful place as a floating magical utopia, fighting off undersea monsters, magical creatures, and whatever remaining magics are left on the long lost sunken city.

** There's one I promised to this subreddit a long time ago (like several months) that I'm still working on, because I hate to put things up if I'm not 100% sure they're done and I like them.

Basically the premise is your typical independent-Harry-suddenly-distrusts-and-outsmarts-evil-Dumbledore-at-every-turn, only that Dumbledore's evilness is actually entirely in Harry's head. And instead of being crack, like Seventh Horcrux, it's played perfectly straight with associated horrific consequences. Also Merlin is involved because reasons.

Edit: My other two WIP are actually crossovers, one with Bleach and one with Puella Magi Madoka Magica, but I'm not sure how much the audience for that overlaps with this subreddit.

** I got a couple couple thousand words written on a couple things. The one I've got the most written for is 'Ron Weasley: Undesirable No 1' about an older alcoholic Ron being framed for the murder of his brother and the kidnapping of a muggle child, roughly based on the films '12 Blocks' and 'The Gauntlet'. My other ideas are a fic about Dudley being in a magic hating gang as an adult but that ideas basically near enough the same as the Ron Weasley one just switched round so I doubt I'll ever write much for that one. Last two are still in the ideas stage, one is about Goyle adapting to life after Voldermort and the other is an AU set after book 4 where Voldermort realises Harry is a Horcrux and tries to corrupt him.

**** In my story he got leniancy due to his age and who his father was (meaning what chance did he have if he was brought up this way). I've not decided whether he's going to have a short stay at Azkaban or just his wand snapped/confiscated for a certain amount of time. The fact that he's free after torturing students though would play a large part of it, including some of those students looking for revenge.

** I have a very dark fic I just want to finish. 10 years in the making, lol. But I have roughly 6 chapters left which I am so happy about. linkffn(imprisoned realm by lovehp)

I have another idea that is in the works. It is also a dark fic. Instead of Harry 'dying' in Deathly Hallows, Voldemort discovers he is a Horcrux. Fast forward a year later, where the good side have lost and everyone believes Harry is dead. Neville is a rebdl against Voldemort's new order. He raids Hogwarts and Harry is rescued. I want there to be interaction between Neville and Harry... not sure where that leads too at this point jn time.

** My main project at the moment is Not From Others linkffn(11419408), a 'missing moments' type fic of Ginny's POV in DH. My main problem at the moment is unravelling the timeline, but it's one of those fics where once I start writing it feels effortless.

My other WIP, on the other hand, is being a right pain in the arse. It's quite dark, and is about the days surrounding the Potters death. I don't need to tell you that the timeline for that is completely confusing, so writing takes a lot of work. I probably won't be able to update til the New Year. linkffn(11610295)

After I've completed both, I'm planning on writing an action/adventure with Luna and Rolf travelling the world looking for magical creatures, or a murder mystery/crime with Harry working as an Auror. I just can't make up my mind.

** Currently re-writing / re-imagining one I started years ago. It's about a kid Bellatrix had with Voldemort during the first war (unbeknownst to Voldemort). She ends up helping resurrect her father and fights with the Death Eaters against Harry and co. Haven't worked out the ending yet but it's pretty fun writing about the bad guys. I'm trying to keep things canon as much as possible (the main character's existence notwithstanding), allowing for plot divergence of course but maintaining realistic scenarios based on personalities and histories and all that, but I have to make up a lot when fleshing out the Death Eaters which keeps it interesting. It's taking forever though because while I have some significant time jumps every now and then, the plot is spanning the entire length of the series (fall of Voldemort to fall of Voldemort).

** i'm writing my first fanfic that's an AU from Ootp onwards. It has an OC main character(sorry if that turns you off) who's a transfer student from durmstrang that plays a key part in the magical world.

Lots of new characters, setting, spells and plot. Although the story will follow through the golden trio's 5th-7th year and retain some of the basic core plot of said years, story will be very different as it progresses, especially in the 7th year story.

In my mind it's going to be a trilogy(1st story= 5th year, 2nd story=6th year etc...) but as of now, i'm entirely focused on writing on the first story.

** A little late to the party, but what the hell. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eaverant][Here]] is my FFN profile for the curious, as it lists most of my now and future ideas, free for anyone to use as their own. If you're starving for ideas, check it out! and read and review what little I've published, that's a good idea too...

For the lazy, I'm a big fan of badass, competent Harry, in his/her many forms. My plan is to write an Alternate Dimension story where Dumbledore draws in not one, but /three/ AU Harry Potters to fight for them. As it turns out, these Potters are proven Dark Lord killers. They didn't do anything so pathetic as rebound a curse, they each met their Voldemort on the field of battle as an equal.

I'm also writing a Master of Death fem!Harry that travels the multiverse, going wherever death sends her. It will include pretty much every crossover that I'm interested in. The longer she lives, the more she'll come into her powers as MoD, and the less she'll directly interfere in events, acting more as a guide to some and a mystery to others.

Finally I want to write about a Harry that is so hugely powerful that he can destroy a building with a wave of his hand, but he can't levitate a single pebble by its lonesome without levitating everything else in the vicinity. #PowerfulWizardProblems

** A time travel fic starring Lord Voldemort. He wins The Battle of Hogwarts, after getting disarmed by Harry Potter he summon some kids wand, conjure a metal spike and proceed to banish it through Harrys chest. By 2016 he control all Wirzarding nations with a centralised government, after a series of devastating wars, the world wizarding population is down 36%, and declining.

But then because muggle hunting is now a regular practised sport, muggle advancements in moment capturing and information spreading and lack of people and funding to the obliviators, the muggles figure out Wizards exist.

Then some american hate church radicals kill a pureblood teen wizard. And spread the video wide. Everything escalate after that. Halfbloods who are against The Dark Lord go to their muggle goverments, tell them about magic, what it can do, what it can't, and how to detect mindcontrol.

Western nations, appalled by the recent war (Quote:"Voldemort is the wizard Hitler, and the magicals are living in a future, not unsimilare to the one we would live in had Hitler won.") and threatend chose to declare war to free the magical world of their dictator.

Radicals, religious and intellectuals fearing loosing themself to mindcontrol magic escalate the war on the muggle war. Voldemort & co escalate it on the wizarding side.

By 2028 the wizarding kind is nothing more than a band of Death Eaters surrounding Voldemort, traveling around the world. Fleeing whenever they are discovered. This is not the world Voldemort envisioned, so he develops a way to travel through time.

tl:dr: Timetravel fic starring Lord Voldemort, he wins the wirzarding wars, but not the muggle war. He doesn't accept that.

Edit: I'm only a few chapters in, and refuse to put in up on DLP before I have 20k words, and refuse to put it on ffnet before the 50k mark.

** I'm currently messing around with the idea of a HP/Campione crossover, In the form of a GoF AU (original, I know). Basically, Harry kills St. George at some point before fourth year starts and becomes a campione (i haven't decided if other campione are around yet, but I'm leaning towards the older generation being there). It's still very much in the planning stage, with power balancing being my main problem since even the weakest Campione makes a wizard seem like a muggle. The current plan is for Harry to have trouble using his wand due to his changed magic, and for Voldemort to become a bastardised campione by using Harry's blood in the resurrection and collecting grimoires to use the Authorities sealed inside. Not sure how well it'll turn out, but I adore Campione too much to resist.
