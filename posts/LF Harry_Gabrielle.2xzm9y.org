**** Ditto. I'm a huge fan of the Harry doesn't know love theme, especially when it ends in tragedy.

** Rather surprised that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5403795/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Price-of-Being-Noble][Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble]] hasn't been mentioned. It's long, pretty well written, doesn't just retread canon and it even updated recently.

** [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=753]] It's Harry+Gabrielle towards harem, with possible H+H. It's very long, and yet to get finished, and I really really hope it does. One of the best FF of Harry Potter I've read.
