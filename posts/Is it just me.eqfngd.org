I see many Harem fics these days. Personally, I don't like them. Is it just me? Or anyone else does not like them too?


** Im good either way as long as the writing is good enough to read.

Harry (because its always harry in a harem fic) can fuck or marry or whatever any amount of chicks and or dudes as long as i enjoy the story.

Imo most harem stories are pretty meh but there are plenty worth reading at least once if you feel as i do. Personally i enjoy the politics in harems though most fics dont touch on that aspect too much.

Look at any pet peeves, "what makes you stop reading a fic," worst tropes, etc thread and harems will be among the top responses.

** Most of this subreddit doesn't particularly like harem stories. They're usually just badly written wish-fulfilment fics, without a hint of realism in any of the relationships. The wider community seems to love them for some reason though.

The only fanfic with a harem in it that I can say is good is the Firebird Trilogy. The harems are a dystopian element of the AU rather than a tool for wish-fulfilment.

** I'm not a fan, harem fics usually come along with super-duper god Harry who now goes by Hadrian and grows his raven-hair down his back, and is now super best buddies with misunderstood Draco "dragon" Malfoy.

** I'm ace, so the smuttier harem fics don't really have anything for me. I mostly don't like them because the harem becomes the plot and that's ridiculously dull. I don't want to read of a bunch of women fighting over a single man, if I wanted that I'd go watch one of the ridiculous 'naked attraction' type tv shows.

Poly fics sometimes have this, but there's also often plot besides the romances and that's more interesting to me.

If someone managed to write a harem fic that actually had plot and wasn't just "First Harry banged Girl A, then he banged Girl B, and after a spot of lunch, he banged Girls C through G" then I'd probably enjoy it.

** i actually like harem fics just not in this fandom for the most part there is odd good one but most seem to just be wish fulfillment and rather than using the trope for world building
