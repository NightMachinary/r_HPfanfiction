I've seen many variations of this and i've wanted to write it myself but I couldn't figure out how to write it


** "Sorry," was all Charlie said.

George was nowhere to be found.

His mom was busy in preparing a large supper for all who had chosen to attend the anniversary. Of course she was. Tears could be hidden well in the kitchen sweat.

His father stood, stoic as ever, greeting the well wishers who had come to say their farewell.

Not a single pair of eyes was dry in the Weasley backyard, except him.

The sun shone brightly, in a mockery, or perhaps celebration, of Fred's death.

The sun would miss the moon, too.

The Potter's were yet to come, which was understandable really. Harry and Ginny wanted the kids to be kept out of the public eye, as much as they could.

Bill couldn't come this year, some contract or another, but his letter did find it's way in the hands of a trembling Ron.

And yet, somehow, Percy's eyes remained dry.

He really wanted to shed them, if not for his brother, then for the crowd, to show them that he really did grieve him. But shedding false tears would be selfish, and it would be fake.

He couldn't do that on his brother's death anniversary.

He checked his pocket watch, handed down to him by Hermione's parents.

15 more minutes.

He put it away. Wary of false accusations.

He had to be. He was the fallen Weasley.

Everyone knew the tale. His fracture from his family had been too public to be buried under any amount of time.

He had accepted it. Just another repentance for his crime.

Which he had every intention of correcting.

The sands of time he had stolen flowed inside the pocket watch, the only fully non-magic item he possessed on his person.

He clenched and unclenched his fists.

He was ready.

He was going back in time.

He could save so many people.

So many lives could be saved.

Remus. Tonks. Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.

He shook his head. No, that wouldn't do.

Too much could go wrong.

He had to see his brothers alive, again. Alive and whole. Not the broken husk who wore the face of George.

Was he selfish? Yes. Did he care?

Flashes started flashing as the Potter's entered the backyard.

Perfect.

He looked once again, at the capstone of Fred, hoping to never see it again.

And he apparated.

** The key is that there has to be a body double past percy still has to think Fred died otherwise you would cause a paradox
