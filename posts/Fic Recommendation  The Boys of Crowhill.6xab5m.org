linkao3(The Boys of Crowhill)

I do not remember how I found this story - it might have been here or it could have just been me combing ao3 - but I am eleven chapters into the first installment and I am /impressed/.

I don't think I have read a story that managed to blend the realism of a child's thought processes and the gritty nature of the Harry Potter story in such a way.

It's in the small things, like Harry mishearing 'Phoenix' (in reference to the Order) as '-vie Nicks', a shortening of Stevie Nicks, and running with it without being corrected immediately by a plot-convenience. He is awful with a quill and not a great speller and it does not take three days of hard work montage to fix this... but he is also not without his talents.

The plot itself is not hugely different from canon, on the fringes; there is so much /more/ to it here, flavor that enhances canon enough that you're definitely not bored or skimming. I love it so far. Hope you all do, too!

*** I am not a fan of them myself. Enough is different that it doesn't feel like the author is adding obligatory canon because they're too lazy to branch off.

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.
