** Would you like a nice healthy relationship? Or some abuse?

To what extent would you like the abuse? Sexual is the most common but there are some emotional abuse fics out there. Unfortunately there isn't much variety and Severus is always the victim. If you wanted the opposite you're out of luck.

Is child abuse ok? Rape? Non con?

How do you feel about plot?

Edit: I dug something up from my fascination with this ship a few years ago.
