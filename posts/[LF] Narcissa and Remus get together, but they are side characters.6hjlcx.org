This is NOT a Narcissa/Remus pairing story, not in the description since Harry is a main character.

I don't remember much but in this story, Harry tries to correct stuff like the usual time travel to the past.

Something happens to Lucius, maybe jail, then Narcissa becomes a free woman and does things she wants to. Like getting back together with Remus since they couldn'tâ€‹get together the first time due to her parents.

There are also scenes where Draco sees Narcissa in Remus' clothes in the morning, something scarring like that.


** It's not a time travel fic but I think that happens in Larceny Lechery and Luna Lovegood. linkffn(3695087)
