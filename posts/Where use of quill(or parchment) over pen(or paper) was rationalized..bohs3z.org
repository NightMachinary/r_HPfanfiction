:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I recall a certain fan fic where the use of quill(or parchment) over pen(or paper) was "explained" as needed for when writing magical document/contract, as natural material is magically conductive or something whereas artificial manufactured products aren't. Whereas it's not necessary for homework etc, it's good practice for when it's needed.

I'm 95% sure it's an English fanfic on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] but can't quite remember which it was. Spent the last half hour on google trying to find it, but those rather generic keywords are not helping, even in conjecture with the titles of some that I know I've read.

I say quill or parchment etc because I can't quite remember if the explanation was on the writing utensil or the medium or both. But I think you get what I mean.

I also can't quite remember who is explaining it to whom... But the situation obviously arises when someone, muggleborn, was wondering why not use pen/paper which is easier (as so many fan fiction in fact do).

​

This was brought up when I was having a discussion with someone about how magic society is backwards. I recalled this (on a conceptual level) and mentioned that where possible it would be nice to have a rational reasoning other than simply bigotry or backwardness, which is kinda hand wavy. So I'd like to find the source if possible.


** If I want to write really nicely I use straight metal nibs, not like those things on fountain pens that split apart.

Since paper consists of fibres these can get stuck in the nib, and they can affect the contact between the nib and the paper.

Parchment is superior. As a person who does not want animals killed for my writing supplies I do not use it, but it is still superior. The wizards do not care. They want the best material for writing and probably use magic to make it last.

Presumably the wizards prefer the writing feel of quills over metal nibs. Magic is probably also suitable for avoiding its disadvantages, like the need to cut quills down.

** In linkffn(The Brightest Witch in the Darkest House by Belial666) and/or its sequel, it's justified as a way to drill children in making very precise motions with a very cumbersome object, which is transferable to wand work.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** I actually stumbled acrossed it on re-reading a story.

The reason it was hard to find/remember, I guess, is that the discussion did not focus on it, but it was merely an extension of a discussion on signature.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10766595/38/Harry-Potter-Three-to-Backstep]]

near the bottom.

​

I do appreciate the alternatives reasoning that were brought up.
