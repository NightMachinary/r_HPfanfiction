As mentioned above the fic has Harry moving to a village, might be a village under voldemorts control. and possibly has him not going back to hogwarts.

Thanks


** Did this have Regulus Black in it? I been trying to find a story that seems to fit your description. Harry inherited a house from ,a great uncle?, which is in a hidden village where Voldemort lives. Regulus sacrficed his voice to.... strengthen the wards around the villiage, I think.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
