I like Gamer fic but the one thing that I have come to dislike about them it's the way the the Leveling system works.

Are there any gamer fics were instead of just getting xp to level the character has to do something that goes above and beyond there limits to break threw the glass ceiling and level up?

And also stats were just running or lifting weights is not enough to up your stats so Harry just running around would get him a small boost in agility but Harry running away from Dudley and his gang during Harry hunting would give a much larger boost in agility because there is the danger for Harry in that if they catch him they are going to beat the shit out of him.

Harrys first level up would probably be after they save hermione from the troll there is just nothing in Harrys life up to then that would be enough for him to level up(survived the killing curse would not do it because Harrys Stats would not meet the minimum requirement for a level up)

What do you think Harrys stats would be by the time of the Troll fight if stats and Leveling worked like Danmachi?


** That makes me wonder if levelling up/stat boosts could be handled in an actual game by a sort of Limit Break system.

As in, the usual stuff that fills a limit-break/overdrive/whatever it's called bar, are also needed to accumulate any meaningful EXP from an encounter. Using up a lot of health/mana/stamina, basically. Final Fantasy II did that, sorta, if you lost enough HP in a battle then your HP would increase, and so forth.
