Imagine the context of relative secrecy and the first thing they do is write down spoilers of their previous time-line as if they are doing their shopping list. It doesn't make sense, considering that - someone else may stumble on it, - important stuff like "Save X from a killing" shouldn't need to be on a list to be remembered, - over time, memory retention is fucked anyway. Why???

... didn't you just answer your own question? Same reason you write grocery lists: to remember what you need to do.

Frankly, if you don't have a detailed, written plan for something as far-reaching and which involves so many moving parts as changing the past, you are not the kind of person who should be entrusted with that power in the first place. "Relative secrecy" is meaningless when the Wizard world has mind-reading, truth serums, and compulsion spells up the wazoo.

*** Yeah, I think a lot of the goes back really far into the past stories make such a big deal of the preparation and planning work required to go back that /not/ making a grocery list would be completely out of character.

I'm frankly not buying a character that spends 20 years working out how to do it and just wings it when they finally pull it off.

*** I might have expressed that badly, I meant that the character doesn't remember events accurately anyway, even for memories they consider extremely important. Witnesses to 9/11, for example, have experienced changes to their memory of the attack. So technically, that list of based on what they remember wouldn't be factual with regards to what actually occurred... (making the whole thing redundant)

**** So you think it would be a better idea to have the time traveler wing it off the back of half-assed memories of an incomplete plan which is itself based on unreliable memories? Really? Because that absolutely sounds like the best way to ensure our protagonist forgets about important things like "Save X from dying."

Keep in mind: normal people have notoriously finicky memories. They have problems remembering grocery lists with 10+ items, let alone a sprawling *7 year plan to save the world,* which realistically should have hundreds (thousands) of bullet points. Break out those dividers and highlighters, Hermione.

You don't see how writing down a plan, running it past reliable allies who are decent planners (Dumbledore, Hermione, etc.) to refine it based off their own memories of events, and then following this plan is a much, much better idea than randomly changing things and hoping things turn out better? Because, barring plot armor, that seems like a great way to ensure a Bad End, since Harry's original victory relied on a heck of a lot of luck and coincidence lining up just right.

Why? All you need is a list of everyone who has to die so that good people do not have to (Umbridge, Voldemort, the Lestranges and so on), the Horcrux locations and traps as well as a few notes (eg Lockhart = fraud). A good time traveller should be able to resolve the series within a few months, tops.

That is the part where time travel gets morally complicated. Killing child Hitler means killing a child for what he would become without your lethal actions.

Honestly, there isn't a good answer when it comes to morality because you must not put their lives above the ones of their victims on the slim chance you manage to change them as that puts every bit of suffering they cause on you.

That being said, the magical world has the death penalty. And Harry coming from after the war will be hardened by it and come with a decade of combat experience, so from his PoV killing the people he has been fighting for a decade will be the obvious solution.

It still hurt Bellatrix, it just didn't hurt as much as a properly cast curse would have. We can assume that the one cast in DH was also improperly cast (or that having a year to stew in helplessness and bitter rage put him in a better mindset than sudden shock, shame, justified rage, and self-recrimination.

Although that could be a funny fic. Get one of those "Bigger on the inside" trunks and turn it into a library filled with everything the time traveller thought was relevant. Not just the notes on what will happen, that's only a small portion of the library, but things like potion recipes, and the schedule for this one janitor in Sweden.

** Does that happen in a lot fics? The only case I've seen of a time-traveler writing notes for himself was in a fic where he needed to undergo a memory charm to hide the truth of his past from a master legilimens. But it wasn't like the information was unsecured on paper - he set up an elaborate system of wards to hide the words from anyone who didn't know the password.

So I can imagine cases where writing notes could make sense with the plot, but it would be pretty weird if they wrote down blatantly obvious things about their goals without some additional reason for why they wouldn't just remember it on their own.

The character making a list of what they need to ensure does/doesn't happen (whether it is written or otherwise) isn't inherently a bad thing, particularly when they go back with a lot to accomplish. Perhaps (like it was said above) you'd prefer it if it had more plot relevance or there were a more unique spin? Maybe your just burnt out from seeing it so many times?

** If I was a time traveler I'd definitely write everything down that I knew and that I needed to accomplish. But then I'd put a TON of spells on my notebook so no one but me could read it. And if someone did bypass my spells I'd just play it off that one of my elderly relatives was a Seer who gave me this information before they died so I could try and change things.

** I personally would not write a list. I would have an entire bloody wall, mind-maps, networks of contacts, about a calendar per significant person, a shelf for bound copies of old newspapers...

I mean, it seems realistic, you're never going to track that stuff, it's hard enough remembering when birthdays are, let alone that one significant day when a particular photo appears in a newspaper or whatever.

***** I get your point and that was one of my main concerns. Even memories which we consider super important to us aren't accurate recollections of fact and then we have a protagonist going around remember that random conversation on a random Friday afternoon with a random character... No.

Someone suggested the use of a Pensieve to increase accuracy when comparing changes and to keep track of things both with detailed notes, additional materials as well as the Pensieve to accommodate inadequate memory retention.

** As with most things, it's not a bad idea, but can be poorly executed.

A list helps you to organise your thoughts, sort tasks by importance, chronological order etc, mark things off as you go, keep an idea of your total progress and prevents you forgetting anything.

Provided you actually do more than write

1. Kill Voldemort
2. Free Sirius
3. ????
4. Profit!

And you don't write it in plain english with "Harry's time travel plans" at the top and leave it in the common room, I think it's fine.

** I don't care if they have a list, I just don't want tp read about them writing it or the specifics of what's on it, only referencing it when it's relevant to the story. There could be a whole bunch of things on the list that are irrelevant to the story like "See a Rolling Stones concert" or "Bang a young madame rosmerta" that might have nothing to do with the story and do nothing to inform us about the characters or their motivations that the author might have in their notes but shouldn't be mentioned because it's irrelevant. I nope the fuck out when a story spends a whole chapter going over every bullet point in a 10 page list, it's unnecessary and detracts from a story's pacing.

*** Counterpoint, I could see it being very reasonable. You come back after x years in the future - and what's something you'll want to do? Make sure you remember everything that happened that you can. And that you'll continue to remember it days, weeks, months later.

Notes are excellent for that. Its important enough that forgetting some minor event could mess everything up - so I could easily see many people taking their time with it
