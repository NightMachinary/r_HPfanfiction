I'm looking for stories where Harry and Hermione are friends with benefits.


** I have no interest in reading about Harry and Hermione in a serious relationship, unless they're much older, in their 40s.

In that respect, I do prefer the canon pairings of Harry/Ginny and Hermione/Ron.

But there's something about Harry/Hermione smut that I find deliciously naughty .

*** If you're looking for smut, maybe mark this as NSFW? I wasn't sure if you were looking for FWB romance/drama or just lemons until I saw this comment, so it would help get the right sort of attention.

** Harry Potter and the Emerald Coven by Hallows_Seeker on Ficwad has what you're looking for. Unfortunately it looks like the author deleted it recently.

Does anyone know where else the author may have posted that one?

*** Ficwad is having some sort of malfunction where it marks stories for deletion. All my stories have been set at the index as deleted by author, but I didn't delete them and they're still up there, including [[http://ficwad.com/story/227774][Holly Polter]] which has a Harry-Hermione thing as OP requested.

Here's the link for the other story: [[http://ficwad.com/story/168679][Harry Potter and the Emerald Coven]]
