I can appreciate Snape in his own way, but he grates on my nerves like no other. I'd love to see some fics where Harry or someone else gets revenge on (adult) Snape, a prank or even something more extreme. Thanks!

**** yeah Snape getting killed by Voldemorts snake in canon it means nothing to me, it isn't justice finally being served, it isn't for being a death eater or for getting Harry's parents killed and other crimes committed , it is just him being killed by his Master nothing more .

I want to see Snape killed by Harry, arrested and put in Azkaban or given Dementors kiss and for his crimes known to everyone like being responsible for the deaths of the potters.

It makes me wonder if Mcgonagall knew Snape was responsible for some of her favourite students deaths. I believe Dumbledore didn't tell her or anyone he was responsible because she would never allow Snape to teach students but you never know.

Snape got off to easy thanks to Dumbledore.

***** Yeah, and that's not all.

By the time that scene happens, Nagini's venom is known for a while (attack on A. Weasley), Snape knows the situation (at the very least, that the endgame is close) and no one checks the body after Harry leaves. The bleeding, in the book at least, doesn't appear to be enough to kill him quickly - there are puncture wounds, but no large rips that would kill him in moments.

Which makes the fanon "Snape totally faked his death" rather plausible. Imagine, Snape gets away, changes his name. He has some funds, he has a stash in his house at Spinner's End that most believe abandoned. He has skills that will alwys be valuable. And thus, Severus Snape, the ideal, dies a hero, but Severus Snape, the man, lives on. :p

Yeah, if we take canon version, he died because he was incautious, not because he sacrificed himself.

** Linkffn(10383313)

(Chapters 5-7) Snape is tricked into revealing exactly what kind of spiteful bastard he is when Harry takes him up on his threat of dosing him with Veritaserum. Very satisfying.
