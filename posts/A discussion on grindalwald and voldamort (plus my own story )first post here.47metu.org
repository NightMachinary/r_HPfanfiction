***** Nah but thanks for the offer but I do have a question who came up with mpreg and why? Seriously ? I don't have any problem with gays or slash if people enjoy reading slash that's totally fine. Though I don't read slash but honestly mpreg just seems super wrong and disturbing to me

  Now it was the begging of august and Harry was changed he was taller with some slight muscle on him but that wasn't the most notable change no that was his face gone was the smile and kind green eyes in their place was a hard stone like expression of a trained soldier and if someone were to look in his eyes they would find not the kind eyes of lily potter but eyes like hard emerald that clearly promised pain to anyone who angered him .
#+end_quote

Words fail me.

This kind of edgy Harry is a dime a dozen. It's not unique in the least.

** It's hard to take this story, and you as a writer, seriously when you know you have an issue with your grammar but don't want help improving it. Someone on this thread also offered to help your grammar and you turned it down to ask why people write mpreg. Honestly, if you want people to stop commenting on your grammar and focus on the story then maybe do something about the grammar. It's very distracting.

** One of the best ways to improve grammar is to proof read your story out aloud. Note where you pause naturally? That's a full stop. Say something as an aside? That should be in brackets. Notice you are getting confused? Need to restructure your sentence.

For example your post, you have written:

These are my opinions feel free to disagree Voldamort yes I know he was probably made this way for story but he is a moron plain and simple he has all this magical knowledge and power and can't beat a teenage wizard without a full Hogwarts education?

Firstly: You have an extra line break between disagree and Voldemort. You also spelt his name wrong. Both of these are easy to fix and should be obvious to you if you proof read.

Next; if your read it aloud, it becomes obviously too long. You run out of breath. The sentence also rambles. It isn't clear at all.

So what is the point you want to say? Break down each point.

- This is my own opinion
- You are free to disagree
- Voldemort was written in a certain way
- Voldemort was a 'moron plain and simple'
- Voldemort had lots of magical knowledge and power
- Despite this Voldemort could not beat a teenage wizard without a full Hogwarts education

Now put the points that logically follow together. Remember after each idea the sentence should end.

So the above becomes:

This is my own opinion and you are free to disagree. Voldemort was written to be a moron. Voldemort had all this magical knowledge and power, but he could not beat a teenage wizard (without a full Hogwarts education).

One of the quickest ways to lose a reader is to make it hard for them to read. If they have to pause every sentence to figure out what you meant, it is very hard work. In a lot of ways, poor grammar is worse than poor spelling.

** Grammar is a big thing for a lot of people, and you'll get a LOT more readers if you fix your grammar.

If it's not instinctive for you maybe just write how you normally do and ask someone to beta and correct it? I really think most people will skip right past a story with bad grammar since that literally makes it harder for them to read. You could have the best story in the world but 99% of people will not get past your first three paragraphs before giving up.

  Dumbledore is manipulative and the bad guy along with the weaslys as I hate those characters
#+end_quote

I think you need to reevaluate who's the "moron plain and simple" here.
