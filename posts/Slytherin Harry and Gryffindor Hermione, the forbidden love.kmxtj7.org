I've read so many Dramiones, just curious if anyone's done a good Dark Harry, Light Hermione.

Or if not, dark Harry, Light anyone?

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** All the fics with this premise that I've seen basically feature a suave, smooth, clever Harry-in-name-only 'shipped with a Hermione who has no personality. Needless to say, they didn't make much of an impression on me, and so I can't give you any names.

I think the opposite setup has more potential, because a Harry who's had to solve his own problems without a friend who knows stuff and a Hermione who has come to resemble Alastor Moody in her mindset could have an interesting interplay. Unfortunately, all the fics with this setup (that also 'ship them) that I know of are downright unreadable.

*** I vaugly remember a good Harry pairing with Narcissa Malfoy, can't remember how that started, just that Draco didn't care for Harry banging his mum.

That's the closest I've read to your inversion suggestion.

Harry isn't exactly dark in either, but he is rather ruthless with enemies.

*** This is one I'm reading where before Harry goes to hogwarts Snape takes over as headmaster. He then changes the school to be more combat focused to prepare for the return of voldemort. The author delivers unique twists to cannon story arcs while also crafting new story elements.
