[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil be thou my good]] is a crossover with Hellraiser but you don't have to know anything about it, I'd never heard of it but it still had me hooked. Excellent writing style and the characters feel very in character. 41k words all in one chapter so not too long, it's 100% worth it either way.


** Thank you for your suggestion! I start reading it right away.
