** Actually, we never learnt for sure whether he really wanted that DADA position, or whether it was just a sham.

*** Twas likely a sham, he probably wanted to be the head of Slytherin and eventually indoctrinate them through this role as teacher and head in a much more sinister version of Slughorn. Not to mention he could have kept on eye on his future enemies while teaching.

*** I feel like the first time he asked, it was for real, and if all goes well, maybe even turn into an 'out' from his plans of being a Dark Lord.

Second time it was a sham, no doubt about it.

**** It is probable, but we don't want have the canonical evidence one way or another. And I like for example how “‘Sorry, Aunt Petunia.' by Emily_Elizabeth_Fowl, sparklygems” linkao3(17476328) develops right now: Quirrel (reprocessed to be functional equivalent of Tom Riddle's body) is now trying to be a teacher (at least so far, we don't know, how far it will go).

** /Methods of Humanity/ by local_doom_void linkao3(22008067) is almost identical to the prompt. Quirrelmort succeeds in getting the Philosopher's Stone. The newly resurrected +Voldemort+ Thomas decides that being a dark lord is way more trouble than it's worth, teaching's where it's at.

  Tom Riddle was never taught to live -- he had to learn from scratch.

** Ooooo just got an idea off this. Quirrel breaks into gringotts to find the stone but doesnt, voldemort then gets the bright idea of using a horcrux to get a new body or fully posess quirell. They go deeper, break into bellatrix's vault and grab the cup and slip out.

They do some sort of ritual mumbo jumbo to restore him, voldemort betrays quirrel and they take full possession of his body, but theres a weird reaction between the soul shard of the cup and whats left of voldemort possessing quirrel. Maybe some BS like because his soul accidentally split again when attacking harry the shard in the cup overrides the smaller wraith and ends uo absorbing him while taking control of the body. Of course Tom(the soul shard of the cup) doesnt know this and only has the memories of quirrelmort up to that moment then decides to get a handle on wtf his future self has been doing.

Quirrel can be back seat alive or dead, that can be a sort of sub plot. I dont remember when exactly the cup was made but im gonna assume for the sake of plot it was the 2nd/3rd horcrux he made out of school or something. There was a whole plot with him working at borgin and burkes then tracking down the cup in the main story but idk the specifics atm. You can always say this was his second, so hes sane enough to be a decent human being and knowledgeable enough to be on the level of voldemort. Plus with him absorbing future hims memories thats solved anyway.

In terms of the villian plot, first year would be just setup, 2nd year could still be the diary which can be handled in any sort of way, 3rd year can be Pettigrew and sirius with maybe pettigrew overhearing info about tom in some sort of way. Maybe hes working with dumbles to change the country and do something useful who knows. Pettigrew can overhear him filling in sirius and remus or coming clean to dumbles, maybe dumblebore can catch him messing with the diadem and trying to figure out what happened to his soul when he encountered harry that caused his shard within the cup to absorb the other shard when theh did the ritual. Or maybe riddle was messing with the diary he took after he saved harry in the chamber last year, plenty of space for experimenting.

In between their discussion tom and bumbledore brainstorm a theory about harrys scar containing the larger piece that shouldve escaped and it needing a host to hide/exist so it attached to harry while the smaller accidental shard that was supposed to go into the horcrux fleed? Im sure someone can finagle something that makes sense since common sense would say the smaller piece should attached to harry since it was made to be sealed jnto something. Or maybe someone can bs an earlier plot point that tom aka the cup shard was always going to overtake quirrelmort because he split his soul so many times. Maybe a moment where this is where tom realizes 3 was the best number and not 7.

Getting through my rambling, peter over hears this and realizes harry potter is the key to resurrecting voldemort. He escapes, links up with barty, and they plan to capture harry and use him to resurrect voldy. This goes into 4 year with the tournament, harry gets put in, tom clowns fumbledore over the age line with plenty of i told you So(s) skip to the ritual, peter does the usual ish, kills harry to loosen the shard, then idk cuts off his scar to toss into the cauldron. Voldemort is rezzed, summons his followers. Shows off harry's dead body, talks a little ish, then in between monologuing harry gets up.

Plenty of opportunity for memes here like peter trying to gesture behind voldemort with his still severed arm and voldemort telling him he will fix it/reward him later, then whatever can happen here until harry escapes. Maybe they duel, maybe harry uses the distraction to grab peter then port out while they stare at him in shock. Rest of the story has plenty of room to go, maybe the shard that was rezzed knows that quirrel is reformed tom and needs fo hide his horcruxes, maybe tom realizes since voldy is rezzed he needs to get the others.

This can all culminate in tom not knowing if he will cease to exist if the other anchors are destroyed since maybe hes still possessing quirrels body. Maybe tom goes to find the rest and absorb them to be sure that they can be destroyed then voldemort killed and he can still be there. Or maybe tom isnt sure that if the voldemort can be killed and not turned into another wraith if he (tom) isnt killed aswell.

This can a once again culminate in the final battle down the line where harry defeats voldemort, they think its over, but you see a wraith form escape into the forest. Tom tracks it down and meets with it vision to ultron style. Or maybe the wraith pops out in front of harry and tom absorbs it in front of him then doesnt know if potentially voldemort out wills tom and absorbs him instead. Then tom pulls a kono dio jojoseph style and harry almost kills him. Once again, who knows.

Idk, I've been rambling all this on mobile so bear with any spelling. I might try to do this later but if anyone gets inspired feel free to do it. Ill clean it up later.
