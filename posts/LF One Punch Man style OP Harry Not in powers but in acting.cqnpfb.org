  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** There is One Punch Wizard, a One Punch Man / HP crossover where Harry was raised by Lily's cousin Saitama. It's fun. linkffn(12355543)

Itachi, is that a baby? also has a Harry who is a little on the strong side. Also has the best Dumbledore, ever. linkffn(11634921)

*** I loved one punch wizard and was sad that it hasn't been updated in a long time. Does the other fic that you mentioned have an OP Harry? Any slashes or bashing or anything to look out for?

  When the Dursleys die in a car crash, Dumbledore is left with a quandary as to where to place the Boy-Who-Lived. That is, until he remembers another relative of Lily's: a cousin in Japan. Rated M just be safe.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
