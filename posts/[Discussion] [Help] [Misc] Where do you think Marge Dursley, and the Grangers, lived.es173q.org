Trying to figure some locations out for a story I'm considering writing, and figured this would be the best place to ask for help. As I'm located in the southwest America region, I'm having some trouble with UK locations.

It's said in the books and [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Marjorie_Dursley][here]] that Marge Dursley lives "in the country" near a Colonel Fubster, has a big garden, and breeds bulldogs, but that's all we're really given on her and her location. It seems like she only visits the main Dursleys every few years, so I initially thought she may live fairly close to them, but it's suggested she has a good deal of money (can take vacations, spoils Dudley), so she could well live fairly far from Vernon and family, and can afford to travel very far but just doesn't do it often.

As for the Grangers, all I can find is "in a house, outskirts of London", though I've seen a fair couple of fics say she lived (or the dentist's office was) in Croydon.

So my question for UK writers (and really just anyone more familiar than me) is, where do you think is a reasonable place for Marge to live and still visit Privet Drive? Where would count as "the country"? And, does Croydon seem accurate for the Grangers?

As well, is there anything else I should know (location-based) for these places in order to make a decent story, that I couldn't easily find from just googling and researching them a good deal?

As a side note, I only recently looked up some of the places on Google Maps, and it sort of surprised me to see how close Harry, the Weasley's, and (possibly) the Granger's would have lived to one another; easy enough to visit even by Muggle methods, really.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Edit: when I go to Mr. Granger's page on the wiki and click link to their house, it claims to be in Hampstead; however, it doesn't say that on any of their pages, so I assume it's just stating the house used as theirs for the movies was in Hampstead?


** For Marge - she gets the train and stays for days at a a time, so you can have her living quite far away if you want. I had her living in Kent which really isn't that far from Surrey but just, to me, fit her Little England aspiring middle class lifestyle. I would suggest any of the home counties too, maybe East Anglia - almost certainly southern.

** Personally, I have her in the north of England- she's quite a robust character. Possibly somewhere around York, as there's a lot of context there for county shows and the like which she could show dogs at.

Also she refers to drowning dogs (horrendous) in the books, which is generally a practise associated with rural living and/or farming. She'd therefore be more likely to be from a rural area, and southern England is jam packed.

I like North Yorkshire around Thirsk (a northern aunt Marge and uncle Vernon sounds amazing, and fits as Petunia is from around Manchester), which is about 5 hours from Little Whinging.

*** There's still plenty of countryside in the south! Speaking as someone who grew up in rural Suffolk!

But agree Yorkshire could be a good shout too - I knew a very Marge like woman from Yarm.

** I think Hampstead fits nicely because it's a really nice, affluent area with a village-y feel despite being bang in the middle of London*. Hampstead is well known for being an extremely expensive area and its high street reflects that to the extent.

It's not, really, really not 'the outskirts of London'. Technically, Greater London is anywhere except the City of London but no-one really thinks of it that way. If you have a look at a London borough map, you can find the outskirt boroughs on the edges of the boundary, e.g., Croydon.

Personally, I think her family seem a bit wealthy for pre-gentrified Croydon. Croydon, like Newham, had a reputation. Although in fairness every borough has wealthy and disadvantaged areas.

If you live in London, anywhere outside of the M25 is the country and anywhere north of Watford the North. It's an ongoing joke.

If you look up UK by population density, then you can see where the fewest people live and can choose how remote you want the country to be. Generally, if you go to the South East or South West of England (basically, not London) it's fairly rural/towny for England barring the odd city. Bearing in mind that England has much higher population than places such as the USA.

Historically, the Shires have been rural.

In my mind, she is either in Devon or Cornwall but of areas I know somewhere in Oxfordshire I think Chipping Norton would fit well as it's a well to do little village in the arse end of nowhere. There's also lots of other tiny villages. But pretty much anywhere in Oxfordshire except Oxford would do.

That said, the UK is much smaller than you think and Marge could feasibly live anywhere, provided she can drive.

My personal theory is that it is much further away that Oxfordshire because she stays in the spare room. Anywhere in Britain would do if you can drive and you can get pretty far by train too. You can get to France and back within the day from Surrey. Edinburgh (Scotland) or Newcastle (almost as far North in England you can go) to London is a bit over 7 hours by car or train.

It can be a bit more tricky travelling from East to West, however.

Edit: In England, the wealthy generally do live in the country.

** "how close they live to one another" even though little whinging doesn't even exist, and the filming for little whinging took place (partially) in martins heron, berkshire which is northwest of the real surrey, and even for that place to ottery st mary (the real ottery st catchpole) is about 140 miles away

*** Well, I was just sort of going off of Surrey in general since Little Whinging isn't real, and 140 miles isn't much at all (to me). They're all within a few hours drive of one another.

**** That is a really long way to Brits though! A drive of more than a couple of hours is considered quite an ordeal.

** Something to bear in mind, wherever you place the characters, is that we in the UK don't think of distance the same way someone from a bigger landmass might. A 3-hour drive is enough to warrant an overnight stay for the most part, and we therefore don't travel to visit as much as you might think despite the island's size.

** So, following [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2005/10/24/in-search-of-little-whinging/][this essay]] I have decided for my story that:

1. Little Whinging is a limit approaching [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camberley][Camberley]]. What surprised me, after I decided about that location, that that is where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst][Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] is located (for you, Americans, that's British equivalent of your West Point). I am surprised nobody used this for anything (neither will I, just that Mr Granger, who is ex-Navy dentist from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hermes_(R12][HMS Hermes]]), uses Sandhurst as the pick-up place to collect Harry, when he runs from Privet Drive).

2. Grangers live (I picked that up from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3301733][Northumbrian]]) in the small village of Itchen Worthy which is a limit approaching [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itchen_Valley][Itchen Valley]], an suburb of Winchester.

3. I have no idea about the Aunt Marge, and I cannot care less. According to “[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12551744][Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee]]”, which I like very much, it is in some other London suburb, or certainly not that far from the Little Whinging.

** Well... Marge only comes on the occasional visit, and when she does she tends to stay for a few days. Her visits are like an event for both Harry and Dudley... Dudley because she dotes on him, Harry because she's the Worst Person Ever. So she has to live far enough away from Little Whinging that going on day trips or just popping by for an afternoon visit wouldn't be practical. So I think we can see with relative certainty that she doesn't live in Surrey, and probably not in London.

Hampstead seems like as good a place for the Grangers as any, but I think you're right that it's mostly used because the exterior shots of the Granger house for the movie were filmed in Hampstead.

You can really place the Grangers anywhere you like in England (except for Little Whinging or Ottery St Catchpole, because if they lived in those places the narrative WOULD have mentioned it) because Hermione's Muggle life is such a non-topic in canon. London is a popular place to put them in fanfic, but just WHERE in London varies wildly.
