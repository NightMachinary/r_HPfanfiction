It's so weird to me that HP Fan fiction is full of Dumbledore bashing lacking nuance when Dumbledore is easily one of the best written characters in not only the series but the genre. He's a great, flawed, interesting character who gets some of the best character development in the series. Such a rich character, wise only because of his own failures. I adore him.


** Fan fiction in general has a tendency to simplify complex characters. A lot of people want to “fix” canon by making the characters either simply good or simply evil, and then doling out rewards and punishments according to some simple idea of fairness.

***** The list is actually quite long if one cares to look, but Dumbledore is a convenient target because not only is he magically powerful, intelligent and capable, he is also old, respected and politically powerful (that, or given a bunch of important sounding but hollow titles so that he can be blamed, but not act- a fun avenue to explore).

He also had opportunities to change the world, being part of Main 7 plot, as well as Fantastic Beasts (correct me if I'm wrong).

Additional reason behind Dark Lord Dumbledore is that he easily could have been.Before you pull out your pitchforks... We have testimony of Bathilda Bagshot regarding his childhood - it was not some great epiphany that turned him away from that path, but his sister. He would have many other chances at redemption even if that was averted, but would he take them? A topic ripe for discussion.

Next we have his high degree of influence over Harry, and the way people often exaggerate his treatment at the Dursleys as well as degree of knowledge and influence Dumbledore had there.

Finally, we have the way he is portrayed in the Main 7, again. He is alternatively portrayed as a shining beacon of light, hope and forgiveness, and a man past his prime, stretched too thin across his many positions, across his many games. The first invokes in some fans "Love the heroes, but love to see them fall more". The other?

This is my main grudge against Dumbledore.He was filling too many positions, of which each would count as a full-time job if done properly. After he was lured out of the castle with the pretense of urgent summons to the Ministry in Book 1 he should have started looking into replacements. It proved, after all, that such could be used against him to the detriment of his charges, and while Dumbledore freely admits to his mistakes and even apologizes...

We do not see a lot in the way of making up for those. Unfortunately. We see him stop doing bad stuff, but never be proactive about good stuff. Even if we disregard the Gordian Knot of cold cases, rumours and whispers that included the Stone, Hallows, Chamber, Sirius Black and others...

My respect for Dumbledore died in Book 6. Because it was then that this old man, whose very presence acted like a shield for those who trusted him, who held many key positions that had no clear succession - decided he'd sacrifice himself for Draco Malfoy. (And yes, the ring... That is still a year for some political shuffling, and other arrangements.)

By placing almost all of the Light's hopes on his own shoulders and the remainder on Harry's... When he went down, so did their hopes. They lost not only their leader, but also their heart.

******* Yes, the plot was enjoyable. Good story.

But my problem was that Dumbledore first sheltered his people, then abruptly vanished. That meant they had to grow, mature and step up very quickly, not having had time to grow into their roles.

They were left with a pair of too-big boots to fill, and no giant to lend them a shoulder to stand on. Sink or swim. This is thing that happens, no doubt. But if something can be easily prevented, I usually feel compulsion to do so. Should I project my expectations on a fictional character? Probably not. But I had an opportunity to crawl before having to run, and for that I will forever be grateful.

** Bashing in general is just poor writing. An author /can/ make a fic work with bashing, if they're otherwise talented enough... But it's very hard to do so, because it's so excessive.

Dumbledore obviously suffers heavily from it - but to explain it, he /is/ the authority figure with the most control over Harry, his plan /is/ incredibly convoluted, and it involves Harry dying. Combine that with the reconciliation of his incompetence in the first half of the series (a narrative choice made to let Harry be the hero), and... well, he's an easy scapegoat.

It's a shame, because an actually manipulative Dumbledore would be an interesting villain to have in a fic. It's obviously not canon, but hey - that's what fanfiction is for! He's got all this power, operates behind the scenes, is an incredibly powerful wizard in his own right - he'd be a far more formidable foe than Voldemort, if Dumbledore were truly evil under everyone's nose. Or, at the least, if he was personally power hungry. That'd be an interesting premise.

Unfortunately, bashing makes it almost impossible to do that premise justice...

Its very close to canon. You don't even /need/ a convoluted-yet-painfully obvious plan involving paying the Weasley's to keep Harry on his side. He could be a bit more callous or a bit more well-meaning, like in his younger years where even at his darkest he genuinely thought it best for both muggles and wizards if wizards ruled the muggles.\\
He'd be plenty dark if he just thought Harry was a necessary sacrifice to be made, with or without his loyalty. Or with Snape. Why do those fics not explore their complex relationship a bit more? I mean, I'd imagine it being complex, Snape, like Dumbledore, (almost) going dark and stepping away at the last minute, BUT it could be argued this was for the 'wrong reason' sooo.... surely Dumbledore must've had thoughts about that? Or reflecting on his cold treatment of Snape earlier yet having to work alongside him. Or his ideas about how sometimes 'we sort too soon'? I don't remember any fics where that was touched on, so if anyone knows any, that'd be nice

*** For the convolutedness of the plan:

It was really the only way to destroy him. Canon doesn't have convenient goblin horcrux extractors, even basilisk venom directly inside his bloodstream did nothing.

A vessel has to he destroyed beyond repair, that necessitates death.

Was there really a choice? Like, critically thinking about it, was there? We never want to be in a dilemma like this, basically a modified version of the trolley problem, byt exponentially more difficult. Studies have shown that some people would make the choice, some would run away, and some would do nothing.

If there is even a snowball's chance in hell that Harry survives through some bullshit technicality, I can't fault Dumbledore for risking it. I mean, the worst that can happen is he dies anyway.

But he /must/ die. Without his death, Voldemort appears again and again and again. If he is imprisoned he simply kills himself. Dementors obey him. He's the strongest wizard on earth.

Hell, Dumbledore even remained in Limbo to level with Harry and inform him of the choice he might have, or to accompany him into the afterlife instead of rejoining his family there right after he died.

Magic is powerful and varied enough to make other options possible - but JKR just wanted that to be the way to go, which makes it difficult to say - because, well, author fiat can make it seem like that's the only way. But a human horcrux is unique enough that we just don't know all that much about it, after all.

Even if that's the case, it's still pretty callous to have a plan involving Harry's death, and not telling him about it - while seemingly not investigating other methods.

But Harry was never a Horcrux and by the canon logic from books 1-4, the soul shard should not have been able to survive contact with Harry. Just look at what happened to Quirrel and through which hoops Voldemort went to be able to harm Harry.

****** Harry's protection doesn't do anything to Voldemort's soul, though. It burns the body, and in the instant of its creation could turn the killing curse, but it never acted upon the soul, only Voldemort's corporeal form and his influence over mortal flesh was affected.

We see this by the fact that Horcruxes can be touched by him without any ill effects to the item or the soul within.

The scarcrux is such a weird case because a horcrux takes over any host body it can - as seen with the diary or Nagini. Nagini is a human that could turn into a snake that has lost the ability to return to being human, and her entire being was corrupted.

If anything, the blood shield managed to prevent Voldemort's horcrux from exerting its influence over Harry, but it was never strong enough to affect it directly.

***** I think we can be pretty sure that if there had been another way to do it, Dumbledore would have figured it out. He has Harry's best interest in mind.

This is what makes Dumbledore bashing so infuriating. The fanfic author makes up an alternate, non-canon way to get rid of the horcrux and then bashes Dumbledore for not doing it. It's moving the goalposts!!! Often combined with the narrative calling him stupid and bashing canon for not just going to Gringotts and doing the super duper powerful horcrux killing ritual that they've just made up!!

Maybe you can tell that I'm annoyed by this. Bashing is always lazy and stupid. And bad writing.

But I agree, to the best of Dumbledore's knowledge, and he seems to have spent more than a few years doing research, that was the only way, I completely disagree with the bashing, I see where people come from, because the way he went about was very traumatic to Harry, and often increased his suffering(the isolation and lack of information), I even agree when people write that some aspects of it blindside Dumbledore until someone throws it on his face, I, however, don't think he was doing it with malice, just ignorance.

I think Dumbledore is just hard to write because he is nuanced, so people want to reduce him to a one dimensional character because it's easier to write, imagine a story where we have a version of Canon!Dumbledore playing 3D chess with a Harry who is smart and assumes Dumbledore is trying to kill him, or even a Harry who is going Darker(as in Grey) and does his best to get out of his influence. Two people who are not evil but whose goals are contrary to each other.

It wasn't as strong as a mother's love, but it was still there. The books have many moments in the final battle where people survive impossible odds, for example.

In any case, when Harry was hit by the killing curse, both him and the Horcux went to Limbo, where Dumbledore had remained. The scene spells out clearly what happens - Harry was hit with one curse, and he still had the lingering protection on him, which was also entwined with Voldemort's body, which juxtaposed the two souls and allowed the one with more agency (=himself, as he is a human and the horcrux some weird baby thing) to choose life, while leaving the other behind.

So he returned to his body and the Horcux was destroyed.

For all that one should not decry and discard estabilished rules of the setting, one should not go to the other extremes and acclaim the method chosen in canon as the only possible one out of a wide variety of others that the very same material makes available.

Not to mention, how do you even get it into him?

If you can beat him in open combat, then you don't need the potion. And nobody can do that, not even Dumbledore.

If you can give him a potion, then you can do things that are a lot more destructive, like cursing his soul into insanity or something.

****** I disagree here.\\
Dumbledore was able to go spell for spell with Voldemort, the problem was not truly winning a battle. It was not allowing the conflict to become a war of attrition, because Dumbledore had to defend normal people who were not particularly determined to fight to begin with, while Voldemort would just recruit another bunch of wackjobs or a discriminated against group.

When given an opportunity, Voldemort ran. That part is well documented. problem was restricting his escape options.

Now Voldemort had two things going for him: horcruxes and prophesy that said X would defeat him. So, the objective here is to take Voldemort down long enough to administer the potion - possibly forcing a rebirth so that physical characteristics could be disregarded. Defeating Voldemort permanently was prevented because a, prophecy and b, horcruxes were hidden at that time. The goal here would be to stall until the Light champion was ready.

But after attack on Potters there was a ten year period of free action, and with Fawkes, Dumbledore could have theoretically appeared just as Voldie was emerging from the cauldron - or even as a babyform - stun it, feed it the potion (r just portkey it to a room with unpotted young mandrake) and work on researching a more permanent solution. Or even possibly with Quirrelmort.

****** It entirely possible he has made himself immune to it but until you know it for sure it's still an option, you might not be able to make yourself immune to it. It could easily be delivered with actual physical weapons(Sword, Bow+Arrow, Gun).

You could do it while he's distracted, read a fic do this while Volde was sleeping and take him to the place where the locket horcrux should've been.

And even if you could beat him in combat that wouldn't negate his horcruxes you'd still need to track them down, with the draught you could avoid that.

Your example falls into the same trap you mentioned why would I curse his soul into insanity, I'd argue he's already insane and/or this could make him a lot more dangerous, why wouldn't I just use Avada or another lethal spell to kill him instantly.

That's a stretch, I think. I think a close reading of the text shows that he would not have ever become a Dark Lord. He spent a couple weeks to a couple months planning questionable things, of course, and that is definitely bad, but it is also a far far cry from actually doing those things without remorse. Dumbledore barely dipped his toes into the Dark Lord pool --- and he knew all summer he was deluding himself about what Grindelwald really was, but he kept lying to himself that everything was fine. He hid from reality until reality slapped him in the face. Whether it was his family or other victims, Dumbledore always would have realized this violent cruel game was not for him. The point of Dumbledore's backstory with Grindelwald is not to realize he could have been a Dark Lord, but to realize he is and always has been a huge coward.

** We know, canonically, that Dumbledore was aware that Harry was being cruelly mistreated by the Dursleys and did exactly nothing about it. Heck, based on his comments towards the end of OotP, everything was going according to plan. That makes him complicit in over a decade of child abuse - someone that does that shouldn't be allowed any position of authority over children.

But wait, it gets worse! He employed a teacher that chronically bullied and belittled his students while administering blatantly unfair "discipline" and shielding student bullies in his House from accountability. He endangered the entire population of Hogwarts by hiding the Philosopher's Stone there, then compounded this by basically pointing scores of inquisitive teenagers at the third-floor corridor (because that warning would only motivate /more/ students to check it out), and further by going "Oh, a troll in the dungeon? I'd better send the students back to the common rooms with no adults guarding them en route. It's not like one House is /in/ the dungeons or anything." After /that/ idiocy, he placed a magical artifact that he himself openly admits is super-dangerous in a completely unsecured classroom accessible to anybody. Welcome to Hogwarts School of Bullying and Child Endangerment!

Overall, his actions make no consistent sense given his canonical capability and motivation. Supposedly he wants Harry safe, and yet sends one of the least stealthy or combat-capable Order members to retrieve baby Harry. He doesn't train Harry or arrange any training to give him even a semblance of a chance, seemingly to allow him a normal childhood, but leaves him with relatives that he /knows/ are hateful and abusive.

Looking at all of his actions and inactions, unless he was insane or senile, Dumbledore was actively grooming Harry into a child martyr: Durskaban taught Harry that he had no intrinsic value as a person, that he was only worth what he could do for others. Being allowed a small number of friends but no true family gave Harry just enough to die for without giving him enough to /live/ for.

**** Dumbledore knew that Petunia despised magic and that she despised magical people. Harry didn't tell him they were abusive, but he's a legilimens and should've been able to see that. Furthermore, Dumbledore refused to allow Harry to reside elsewhere, when really he should have absolutely no say in this, even as his magical guardian, supposedly, and Vernon and Petunia, as his non-magical, summer time guardians, should be the ones to have a say in it instead. They most likely would have readily agreed to have him out of their house, and Harry would have been glad to spend all summer with the Weasleys. Dumbledore knew this as well, and still, didn't allow Harry to do so. He may have seemed like he was doing things the best he knew how but he's been known (by Grindelwald) to do things "for the greater good" when they are, in fact, not always for the good of everyone. It's possible that Harry's death was the only way to kill Moldyshorts, but this isn't proven or expanded upon in cannon.

**** I think it's crazy to say he didn't know how the Dursley's treated him. A lot has already been mentioned but here are a few more things that anyone with reasonable intelligence like Dumbledore would draw conclusions from and investigate if he cared. -Multiple letters had to be sent...at some point a human being at the school would see it was addressed to the 'cupboard under the stairs' and share it -Hagrid would have reported back to Dumbledore after meeting the people who raised Harry...seeing they took him to an island to avoid Hogwarts...seeing the shoddy clothes Harry wore and how they spoke to him. -After second year Molly Weasely would have told Dumbledore what her children had shared. That his things were locked away...that there were bars on his windows...that they weren't giving him food.

Whatever his reasons for doing it the way he allowed Harry to be treated by others was cruel and he was aware of the cruelty. If Dumledore didn't know it's because he chose not to. The summer after fourth year and the fifth year term was essentially a series of decisions made by Dumbledore that were cruel and caused Harry to suffer. He knowingly did all those things...that is not supposition.

**** In OotP, Mrs. Figg tells Harry that she deliberately made his experiences at her house lousy because she suspected his relatives would find a different babysitter if he was enjoying himself. Considering she was Dumbledore's eyes and ears in the area, specifically placed there to watch over Harry, I find it profoundly unlikely that he didn't know about this.

Now, to directly quote the man from OotP, c37: "You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years." "...you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well."

So, he admits knowing that Harry would be mistreated, and even has the gall to say that his plan was working well.

**** Here's my trouble with the abuse line. We know Neville was hung out a window to make his magic show up. Is this perfectly acceptable in the wizarding world? Do wizards not care as much about physical violence because they can just magic up a cure? That somewhat seems to be case. So the Snape abusing people line always makes me question that. "Yeah but that's still no excuse," I agree to our standards it's a pretty shitty thing, I don't know if it's shitty to their own standards.

However that being said abusing Harry is different because Harry isn't living in a situation where his pain/abuse can just be magicked away by some cure, he's living with muggles. Harry is living in a situation where he should be judged by muggle means, and through our muggle means it's horrendous. And at least McGonagall and Dumbles knew about it. Reminder: Mr. H. Potter Cupboard under the stairs. That letter was addressed to Harry by McGonagall. Sure they could have just magicked the address on a couple thousand Harry letters and never took the time to see what address it was, but that seems rather far-fetched.

** He's a well written character with depth, strengths and weaknesses, and fanfiction authors tend to write shallow characters.

But the biggest problem to me is to explain his actions in the books. How is he not evil, manipulative, or massively incompetent? From the first book he makes questionable decisions. Leaving Harry on a doorstep in a November night without even trying to communicate with the Dursleys? Good story, terrible decision. How about leaving Harry with a cursed scar, saying "scars can be useful"? Good story foreshadowing, another terrible decision. Leaving Harry in a situation he /knows/ will be difficult? Good story, etc.

If it's deliberate, then he's evil or manipulative, if not, then he's incompetent. How is the "obstacle course" in "Philosopher's Stone" a good idea? One fanfic questioned why he didn't just throw the stone in a drawer and slap a fidelius on it. The real explanation is that he's written to make a good story.

I mean, most of the obstacle was outright silly, and clearly a series of tests rather actual protection. One fic even had the whole thing mocked by Nicolas simply making another Stone, another by him having multiple.

Second and Third years are much easier to justify as Dumbledore simply not being capable of solving the problems.

Fourth Year has making me believe Barty Crouch Jr. was a Mystique-level impersonator because he fooled close friends for a /year,/ there was no way he knew how to act or answer every question like Moody, did he use Legilimency, a Pensieve, how did Dumbledore never suspected? What about the Goblet? Was it tempered before? After?

Fifth Year forward is a downward spiral, with Harry being repeatedly screwed over and Dumbledore being unable and to Harry, unwilling to help him, even going as far as compounding his suffering with more isolation and lack of information.

Another thing is the dementor in book 3, I have read one where Lupin didnt take the train... "Well you could use this plot device to save Sirius but I clearly dont do anything myself"

No actions against the bullying, secret passages arent blocked after the resurrection...

Additions of plot devices like the fidelius or the unbreakable oath could have stopped dangerous teachers like Lockhart and Crouch as well...

I understand why you like him but I'm not sure how you find it weird how he is treated in some fan fics given how incompetent he was many times throughout the book. Harry and Co. in many ways succeeded in spite of Dumbledore...not because of him.

** Here's the problem of Dumbledore. As we get him in the books, his character is inherently flawed by the premise of the story. If he were doing his job, Harry would never get the chance to be the protagonist, especially in the first few books.

In the end, you can either treat him like a character, or as plot device, but not really both. In the first books he makes a lot of decisions that make no sense, outside of "the plot wills it" and "JKR hadn't invented that magic yet". In the last several books, JKR decided to make him an actual character, but what we were told about the Dumbledore of the last several books doesn't mesh with the Dumbledore we saw in the first few. On top of that, half of the needless conflict in books 5 and 6 could have been shortcut by actually communicating with Harry, and his grand plan for Harry in book 7 had Harry committing suicide by Voldemort, with a mere hunch that Harry /might/ survive it. It doesn't take a whole lot of work to twist things into the point where Dumbledore has to be evil, incompetent or both.

That last statement is the bane of nearly every Dumbledore bashing story I've read. It might not take a /lot/ of work to twist the story (and let me be clear: they are twisting the story, and taking things out of context), but you have to do more work than "Harry sat down a made the same list he's made in 5000 other fics"

** Pulling from my response to a similar thread

There are definitely strong feelings on both sides of the Dumbledore table. In my mind it comes down to writing and thinking of Dumbledore by his actions as written or his character as written.

JK Rowling wrote an inconsistent series that experiences serious growing pains as a result of adapting from children's fantasy to darker general audience fiction. Things that are whimsical in early books, like the trope of the chosen one being abandoned to live with bad relatives (a la Cinderella) become horrifying if seen through a more realistic lens, with Dumbledore admitting that he knew he was condemning Harry to a horrible childhood by leaving him with the Dursleys in the fifth book. Additionally, actions taken by Dumbledore for the sake of plot (cant have competent adults in a children's book or there wont be anything for the hero to do) when looked at through a non fantasy lens are unacceptable, such as allowing Quirrel to stay in the school, leaving the school by broom, protecting the stone with childish traps, etc.

On the other hand, Dumbledore the character, as written, is a generally good guy, well meaning, accomplishing much good, but making mistakes.

To a fanfiction writer this leaves three options: ignore it like Rowling, hold Dumbledore accountable for his actions, or provide justification and explanation for his actions.

For many fics, treating the whole situation like Rowling does can be best, just pretend that everything is fine with child heroes doing everything. This allows the author to focus on the main story they want to tell.

For others, if a fic is intended to have more strictly enforced logic, this can't be allowed. Which leaves the other options, vilify or justify. Dumbledore is out of touch and lacks empathy whether from a malicious or good hearted place. He still did bad things. OR Dumbledore is magnificent like in the books and has reasons for everything that must be explained, there were spells keeping Harry safe on the doorstep, the traps weren't intended as an actual defense for the stone, just the mirror, etc.

Where bashing takes over is the place where high emotions interrupt the writing process. I've known people that were abused who could never forgive the character of Dumbledore for his actions in placing Harry with abusive relatives, this coming from people who've never read fanfiction, just the canon abuse. For them, there is no room to justify Dumbledore's character. He makes them angry. If they were to write a fanfiction, it would almost certainly devolve into bashing. One doesn't need to be abused themselves for high emotion to enter the picture. Harry fills the role of the reader, the reader is supposed to empathize with him, and while Harry might forgive Dumbledore and love and respect him, most people wouldn't in his position, if it had been them.

A Dumbledore critical fic can be written without bashing or poor writing, but it falls into the same traps mentioned before. If Dumbledore is made aware of his failings, he must either fix them, in which case there is less room for a Harry centric plot. Or he must ignore them or justify them, in which he becomes less likeable and would be considered to be bashed by some readers.

** Canon Dumbledore is an asshole.

A 'well-meaning' asshole, but an asshole none the less.

Throughout the series, he never gave a straight answer to a direct question. Not once.

The basic lesson of the Harry Potter series is that Adults are Fucking Useless and cannot be depended upon.

I mean, look at the adults in the story.

Snape is an ass to Harry because Harry's father was mean to him in school.

McGonagall had too many jobs to do any of them well, and her advice to Harry when being targeted and tortured? "Keep your head down." What was she doing in the House of the Brave, again?

Hell, probably the least asshole adult in the story was made out to be a moron. Arthur Weasley, a good father, a good man, but couldn't grasp the point of a rubber duck? That's canon. (and before you realized he allowed his wife to publically humiliate his kids in school)

What was wrong with the staff of what was supposedly the world's best school of magic that it took a 12-year-old girl with a year and change of magical education to realize that Slytherin's beast was a basilisk?

But back to Dumbledore and his 'plan'. He gave the kids a trio of Deux ex Machina without the instructions.

What if Hermione had decided that a book of fairy tales wasn't worth hauling around in her beaded bag that evidently held everything in the universe other than food?

What if Ron had never run away in a snit and the Put-Outer was never needed?

What if Harry's dispair had never reached the point where the tried to put the snitch in his mouth?

And most importantly, what if something Dumbledore never planned for, that being Harry disarming Draco had never happened, and Harry never became the master of a wand he had, to that point and beyond, never touched?

All of Dumbledore's plans were unnecessary and served no purpose. Harry won because he disarmed Draco and for no other reason.

So, yeah, Canon Dumbledore is an asshole. Possibly well-meaning, but still an asshole.

On the contrary, he's the archetypal dumbed down plot device in a children's series. His actions border on criminal incompetence, negligence, and dereliction of duty.

Plenty of readers saw through the charade of the in-book propaganda such as "the wisest wizard" and "the greatest headmaster", and they write Dumbledore accordingly in their fanfics.

Unfortunately, dumbing down a dumbed down plot device character further is not conducive of making the story better. Here I disagree vehemently with these authors. *I'd like to see a Dumbledore who's up to this game, who faces great odds against both Voldemort and a malicious Ministry, and who makes mistakes but agonized over them.*

*** I disagree , to the notion of him being incompetent in the early books. In the first book there is plenty of evidence in text of him orchestrating the events of the novel, not in a sinister way, but to test Harry and get a gauge on LV. Whether this is wise, is another question.

In the second book, while he knows who is doing the attacks, he has no way of knowing how, and his hands are tied by other means. As Harry is the MC and quite heroic it makes sense that he answers the hero's call and solves the mystery and defeats the basilik.

As for the third and fourth books, its mostly the same deal. As he isn't omnipotent and omniscient he has no way of knowing Moody is being impersonated as BC Jr. does a rather good impersonation and Dumbledore is quite otherwise occupied.

I think a lot of the disconnect to Dumbledore being dumbed down is that he often seems to wear a silly facade.

I think a lot of the bashing stems from him placing Harry with the Dursley's. Ideal? Fuck no. However what other options does he really have? In canon there is no other option that keeps Harry safe from the Death Eaters and eventually LV. The "solutions" to this problem in fanfic almost always fall apart under further inspection and what we know of how canon magic/ world building works. Given the choice between emotional abuse (which he doesn't know the worst of bc Harry isn't forthcoming with any details) and a child dying a gruesome horrific death what is the ethical choice there?

As for him plotting Harry's death I think that's oversimplifies canon.Dumbledore does not want Harry to die. He suspects he might have to (which he does) and dreads it to such a degree that he arguably puts off far too long telling Harry about prophecies and horcruxes. It's a flaw but an endearing one.

I'm curious what this plentiful evidence is.

In fact, I would argue that the only evidence is Harry /believing/ that Dumbledore was helped them, and that is not evidence at all. I would even say that all the plot points that get Harry into that chamber are so incredibly coincidental that even if Dumbledore were behind them, Harry has no reason to realize this, so he has no reason to make that statement at all.

Again, I'm not arguing that Dumbledore did or did not do things. My personal belief is just that the background plot is not actually very well written. I think we are /probably/ meant to understand that Dumbledore was behind everything, but if you honestly look at the plot, it because really confusing how he possibly could have.

  I think a lot of the bashing stems from him placing Harry with the Dursley's.

Dumbledore, as a character, is in a sticky intersection that makes it hard for readers to relate to him. Most people, especially young readers, side with the underdog. Dumbledore is in a position of power, therefore, he is not the underdog. The series also brings his morality and trust-worthiness into question, and while those are arguably showed to be red herrings to the truth, many readers take this things at face value and use this information as permission to believe that anything Dumbledore says as a lie. Therefore, him showing emotions and being vulnerable are not interpreted as genuine or valid emotions, but "tactics" and "schemes". Maybe /a/ authority figure can be seen as being emotional and vulnerable, but Dumbledore is reserved and stoic, and those are not viewed as raw enough to be convincing to people who are already inclined to not believe him.

There are honestly a LOT of reasons, but those are just some of my thoughts.

****** As I said in my previous comment, I believe the reader is meant to consider Harry's statement true. My problem is that Harry himself has no reason to come to that conclusion. The things that made him go to the chamber are coincidences, most of it was him overhearing Quirrell talking by happening to pass him as Quirrell was talking to himself in empty rooms. For Harry to say that Dumbledore is behind it all is for him to think that Dumbledore has control over the words Quirrell says (not to mention the timing of when Harry walks by), which makes no sense for Harry to think, and it also brings into question the cohesiveness of the entire premise of the book and series, but that's a different problem.

To be absolutely clear, I /do think/ we're meant to believe Harry, because it's a children's book and JKR had no reason to think anyone would take a second look at her plot. That is why I think the real flaw is the plotting. If JKR or the editor wrote and edited that book now, I think there /would/ be plentiful evidence that supports Harry's statement. But the way the book is written, there is no /evidence/ that Dumbledore had anything to do with it /except/ for Harry's bizarre belief that he did (which I don't think counts as real evidence in the strictest legal sense). If Harry had not said that line of dialogue, then no reader would have thought Dumbledore was behind it because there is /nothing/ to make the reader think that. Except, of course, Harry's line of dialogue.

My point is, how does the reader know this was Dumbledore's intention to do this? This is an assumption the fandom makes to the point it has become fact, but where /in the books/ does it ever suggest this?

Dumbledore doing things does not prove that he did those things with the express purpose of getting Harry into that chamber. I'm not interested in assumptions that every fan has decided they believe. I'm interested in /specific textual support/ from the books for why Dumbledore's motivations are specifically to get Harry into that chamber during that school year.

**** I don't see Dumbledore as evil, sometimes incompetent but most assuredly he's an asshole, in my opinon. Reminder that when Snape first told Dumbledore Lily and James were going to be targeted, Dumbledore's first spoken response wasn't "Thanks Severus for the info, or I'll get them to safety..." It was "What will you give me in return?" Also, "Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy..."

Dumbledore bashing also stems from the fact that at no time did Dumbles believe Sirius was innocent or tried to help him prior to the events in POA. Even though in the first scene of the first book Hagrid mentions the fact that Sirius didn't fight at all about giving Harry up to him, he even gave him his motorbike. Does that make Dumbledore incompetent? In some sense yes it does to me, because where is the logical jump from Sirius killed Harry's parents so Voldemort could get Harry to Sirius put up no resistance whatsoever when Hagrid came to collect Harry.

Dumbledore says there was no better option without exploring them, I mean yes obviously this is children's story, but most fan fictions are not from the perspective of a "children's story" It adapts it to a more mature audience and exploring these, holes in logic, are interesting I think. It does result in a lot of bashing, we don't really see what happens if Dumbledore does explore other options. A lot of bashing is lowbrow, but there are perfectly valid criticisms against his character, in my opinion that people don't articulate too well.

** I'm a Dumbledore basher. I've never posted a fic, but I've vented about him a lot. If you want a viewpoint from my side of the fence I'm willing to share. My main issue with him is near and dear to my heart. He forces Harry to live in an abusive environment.

Petunia aiming a skillet at a kid's head is canon and abusive. Vernon throwing Harry into a cupboard is canon and abusive as is that cupboard being the kid's bedroom. Letting a child use another child for a punching bag is abusive to both children.

Perhaps Dumbledore didn't know prior to Harry going to Hogwarts, I can understand that. Having never been unloved by adult family members, why would he assume Harry would be unloved by family? However, a student pleading to not go home after not seeing said family since September needs to be looked into, I don't care how amazing magic is, a child should get homesick. I know the school corporation I work for is not the only one that trains staff to watch for abuse and Harry gave Dumbledore a huge red flag right there that needed to be looked into.

Some people argue about Harry needing the blood wards. No, the blood wards were the best protection, but not the only option. Thank goodness Harry could dodge so well. Had Petunia's skillet connected, Harry could have gotten brain damage or worse. Harry repeatedly called Hogwarts home over Privet Drive, I'm surprised the wards worked at all.

This is one of my complaints and only my opinion of course, I don't speak for all Dumbledore bashers.

** The saying "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" is applicable to Dumbledore. And it's easy to make that case going from his canon behavior, including failing to ensure Harry's care given his family's contributions and sacrifice, his failure to ensure good education at Hogwarts (Snape, Binns, Umbridge, the DADA curse/lack of good teachers, not preventing bullying), and his willful need to give too many chances even if it endangers innocents (Draco's actions in trying to kill Dumbledore endangered others criminally).

Those were all his *duties* as Chief Warlock, as Headmaster, as leader of the Order of the Phoenix, as Harry's magical guardian (even if only while at school), and as the receiver of the prophecy. Dumbledore is a fascinating character, and truly well worth writing well. But he also was a failure many times due to his past experiences making him hesitate to take charge.

** Okay here's my take.

/Added paragraph topic key/ 1 - Personal disagreement with OP assertions (irrelevant to Dumbledore bashing) 2 - Dumbledore's Characterization 3 - Trap of Canonicity 4 - On Voldemort 5 - Personal Opinion of Dumbledore 6 - What classifies as Bashing (this one could be read first)

First I want to address something. I agree Dumbledore is a well written character in Harry Potter, one of the best even. I find it extremely faulty to claim he's one of the best in the genre.

Now, I want to really get into why Dumbledore is routinely bashed in fanfics. The main reason I find is his characterization, and things we see him do. Now whenever I read the books I find that Dumbledore is very manipulative, and that causes an issue and conflict with any sort of self-aware Harry. Dumbledore is responsible (in some way or another) for nearly* everything that happens to Harry. The exception being Harry being made into a horcrux. If Harry is self aware or really thinks about most of the things that happen they quickly tie into Dumbledore. Now personally, I read Dumbledore as manipulative as it's the only way I find his character to make sense, it's either that or he's comically incompetent. Now you look at what Dumbledore has done. He's put Harry with an abusive family and kept him there knowing full well how bad it was (that or all of the guards throughout the series are stupidly terrible at their jobs), he's also straight up ignored most the problems.

This issue is fine until you try to change Harry's character and keep the main story the same. The line you have to skirt is you can't have Harry figure out about Dumbledore's actions, I previously mentioned self-aware Harry as an cause this is because in many of the stories that Harry is smarter/cleverer/more independent, it becomes increasingly more difficult to justify Harry not figuring it out. Again the issue is, if Harry figures it out he has a direct reason to oppose Dumbledore, and Dumbledore can quickly become the biggest villain. You can't change Dumbledore's character too much either, because then a lot of his actions don't make sense and the story completely changes. As said earlier, he's responsible for practically everything that happens to Harry. The only ways out are to make the story vastly different, or to completely overhaul another character.

This lucky character is Voldemort. Now if you know me at all, you'll know I take issue with Voldemort. He is hands down the worst written character in Harry Potter, there is one other character that comes close and that's it. However from a fanfic writing perspective, this is great. The biggest way to fix the issue is to have Voldemort be a big enough bad guy that Harry works with Dumbledore anyway. This does still come with the risk of bashing Dumbledore just not as much. There is a lot of issues I could talk on with Voldemort, but this comment is long enough as is.

I do however find it relevant to put my opinion on Dumbledore's character. I love Dumbledore. But no matter what I can't read Dumbledore in non-manipulative manner. This is what makes Dumbledore such a good character in my opinion. The story is him versus Voldemort, I find that Dumbledore doesn't truly care about Harry as a person but as a piece in his game against Voldemort. Dumbledore isn't a good guy. He's aligned with the Protagonist, yes. But he's not a good person. Dumbledore is also not a bad guy. Dumbledore does what he believes is for the Greater Good, and he's actively doing everything he can to defeat Voldemort.

On the topic of bashing itself. I find that most bashing for Dumbledore is revealing manipulations and Harry opposing him because of it. The only books I've read that were labeled bashing and actually bashed to the point I though the label justified was Ron/Weasley bashing. I don't actively read books made to bash characters mind you so I may be off, but this is my anecdotal experience with people labeling. I don't think just making a character not on our protagonists side or even making them an antagonist counts as bashing and that what I used as my definition throughout this +essay+ comment. So it is worth noting we might differ on opinion at this core of the argument.

5.) Left a dangerous artifact that can trap people, just lying around a school where any child could come upon it.

6.) Basically pointed the students to the forbidden corridor.

7.) Told the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs(who both go the same way to get to their dorms) to go in the direction of the Troll that could kill them.

8.) Allowed children to serve detention in the Forbidden Forest with only Hagrid as a protector. Hagrid, who isn't allowed to practice magic and certainly can't control what is in the forest if something is in there killing unicorns against his wishes.

9.) The 'protections' for the Stone were rather pointless. Three children passed them, meaning an adult possessed by Voldemort surely could. Either he is insane or he's setting Harry up in a test.

10.) Was lured away from the school that easily? Or did Harry need the right push?

11.) Despite Ron, Hermione, and Neville being perfectly okay days before Harry even awoke, he did not award them their points. Harry then woke up days before the leaving feast and also didn't get his points. Dumbledore waited until the winners(Slytherin) had already been decided and were CELEBRATING before pulling a switcheroo on everyone and ruining Slytherin's moment. I'm not saying those points weren't earned, I'm saying he had days to award them and would have avoided the horrible unfairness of the situation.

12.) Hired another teacher that he knew was suspicious because he was friends with 2 of the people in Lockhart's tales and knew the truth. He knew the whole year that Lockhart was a fake, and compromised the education of the entire castle once again, while also doing nothing about it.

13.) Somehow, despite being the 'Great Albus Dumbledore', never put 2 and 2 together on where the Chamber of Secrets was? With all the context clues?

14.) Allowed the entire castle to bully Harry for being a Parselmouth when, as the Headmaster, he could have imposed a punishment of some sort and lowered the number of haters greatly.

15.) Gave two minors access to Time-Travel.

16.) Allowed the entire castle to bully Harry for being in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. He might not have been able to stop the foreign students, but he could have done something about the Hogwarts students.

17.) Somehow didn't know that his 'friend' wasn't truly his friend the entire year? And let him demonstrate the (illegal)Unforgivable Curses in class?

18.) Sends Harry back to the Dursley house after the 4th Year ends, without any real help. Then proceeds to once again, control Harry's life to an extent he has no right to. He is Harry's Headmaster for 10 months each year and that is it. He should not be contacting Harry's friends to tell them to avoid writing to him. Why he even thought that was smart, to isolate a child who was just tortured and had to watch a friend be murdered because he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, is stupid and beyond me.

19.) Avoids Harry without proper explanation. Seriously, he could have just said Harry's potential connection with Voldy is dangerous and it was best to avoid each other to keep the Dark Lord in the dark where he should be. Then Harry could at least feel as if he was participating and doing some good instead of internalizing everything.

20.) Not even a blip of help with Umbridge when the Black Quill mess began and she barely had any power in the school. But 'he didn't know' right?

21.) Making Harry learn Occlumency from Voldemort's spy. I like Severus but even I know that wasn't smart. The lessons went better in the books than in the films(by a long shot) but those two should not be around each other at all if it isn't required.

22.) Admitting to knowing Harry wouldn't be treated well with Petunia. (Canonically has been choked by Vernon, struck with a pan by Petunia, degraded, forced to live in a cupboard for years, forced to do ridiculous amounts of chores before being allowed to eat 2 slices of bread as his meal, and actually locked in a room with a cat-flap and bars on his window where he's only fed a can of soup that he splits with his owl. And sometimes Petunia 'forgot' to feed him.)

23.) Believed a muggle drunkard's word about a magical child without hesitation. Then lit what that child considered to be his only possessions on fire(stolen or not). He lit the possessions of a orphan in the Great Depression, on fire. As a lesson. He admits in a later Memory to wanting to scare Tom onto the straight and narrow. A man with no legal right to a 10 year old he didn't know, decided it was his duty to punish this child for crimes he doesn't actually have proof that the boy committed. He tried to traumatize a child into being Good, but only succeeded in pushing him away with his example. Also, the reasoning he used to do it, at the time, was that theft isn't allowed at Hogwarts. Of all the crimes Tom was accused of, that was the one Dumbledore addressed with concern and not potentially murdering someone's pet?

24.) The entire time, Dumbledore gives no vibe that he wants the Houses to get along. He even once tells Severus that the good things he did to bring about the end of Voldemort mean he should have been Sorted into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin, implying Slytherins can't be good or do good things.

25.) As an educator, he is responsible for teaching Tom Riddle. As the Deputy Headmaster, he has more responsibility when Tom is away from his legal guardian. He was supposedly suspicious of Tom the entire time he was at Hogwarts but did nothing at all to try and help him? He could have tried at least, but he didn't. Tom being like Gellert was damning enough apparently?

26.) Dared mock Severus Snape for switching sides because someone he loved was in danger due to his own stupid actions, when Dumbledore only switched sides because he might have been the cause of/shares blame for his sister's death. The man wanted what Grindels wanted once upon a time and changed for the same reason as Snape. His lack of owning up to his own faults is annoying while shaming another for doing the same thing.

27.) Aberforth explains that Albus wasn't the best sibling and was more concerned over not being able to see the world and explore, than he was about raising his delicate sister who needed help and had killed their mom accidentally.

28.) The whole raising Harry to be a martyr thing is a big issue with so many details that I don't feel like listing right now.

29.) Now that I think about it, if he was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, why did he allow Sirius to be imprisoned without a trial? They have a law system. Even if the person claims they're guilty they still should go to trial. The Lestranges did much worse and got a trial. Sirius was accused based on assumptions and his own supposed confession, but did not get a trial?

This isn't even all of it tbh. There is much more, but based on these alone, it's hard not to see him as manipulative(in the worst possible sense) and cruel.

***** We never have any canon evidence Harry would be attacked until after Voldemort's return, most DEs were inactive or imprisoned, Voldemor implies some of them were okay with it remaining that way(they were rich and the system favored them).

This Blood Ward nonsense was a plot device invented because JKR realized keeping Harry with the Dursleys was criminal, and so needed a good reason for it, it's never explained how it worked, when it didn't it was left vague so it could cover any holes on the plot due to it.

The only reason he was attacked the moment the wards fell down was that Voldemort was back and waiting for it, other times Harry left the house, wandered around and nothing happened, or rather even under said shielding the Dementors reached him, so the protection was limited by the house, meaning if a DE was really raring to kill him all they would have to do was ambush him somewhere. It's not like this protection shielded him from all the crap thrown at him over the years, only against Voldemort directly touching him, something that happened /once/ before he found a way around it.

If you really wanted Harry safe, then Grimmauld Place under the Fidelius was the best one, or Hogwarts with its protections and Dumbledore himself, along with all the teachers there.

And also because he is the perfect illustration of the famous saying the road to hell is paved of good intentions. His plan is basically so much convoluted and encompasses all aspects from the moment the killing curse failed in its original target, it is simply the work of a redoubtable chess master. And of course the circumstances of the prophecy speaking in a job interview that was not conducted in his office when the war was being in the critical phase of threatening to be lost by the light side that is too much coincidental, there is simply too much to not consider a much more ambitious plan with a organised leaking of a self fulfilling not genuine prophecy. Too much coincidence, and as some people like to say those types of coincidences don't exists ( L.J Gibbs NCIS rules). And of course Dumbledore knows much about psychology and its influence, Harry placement with the Dursleys is in this light very much a part of the plan. His plan would have failed if Harry was raised differently by Longbottom, Tonks or some other family that were not with links to the Dark Lord in last resort. If Harry case was examined by a court, he would have never be sent to the Dursleys for a simply reason they are muggles, the mother of the godmother would have precedence over the muggle aunt, idem for a cousin of the Godfather ( Yes I received the memo of Rowling changing Harry Grandparents to some not much know characters, worse she does not tell us the family of the great mother (Euphemia) , they could have been considered for custody over Muggles by the Ministry that is clear as day. ). The Ministry would have never considered muggles for custody because their blood link is irrelevant.

Every character in HP has good and bad qualities and yes Dumbledore has made many mistakes, and done dark things for the greater good but so has everyone else. It makes no sense to me how a lot of people hate Dumbledore but they love Snape. Snape sort of redeemed himself a little in the end due to his sacrifice but that doesn't change the fact that he's still joined Voldemort by choice which means that he also believed in that whole nonsense too.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

What really put me off MoR were:

1. Harry's absolute meltdown in front of McGonagall in an early part of the fic like goddamn son get ahold of yourself.
2. Snape, seeking self-justification, deliberately withholds evidence to get Harry's opinion, and then when it doesn't come out to his liking, proceeds to emotionally bomb Harry with the missing piece, being that the scenario presented actually involved Snape himself.

Also, the author freely admitted he hadn't even read all of the series but proceeded to blithely write his idea of Snape's and Lily's relationship anyway.

****** I was referring to Harry's characterisation in MoR, yes (although actually, canon Harry, while not arrogant, is often rude).

1. In context this could actually have been pretty well in character. Harry was clearly pretty sensitive about the issue of investigating child abuse complaints, which he attributed to having read quite a bit about them, and it certainly isn't unusual for an eleven-year-old boy to lack self control. It's very unlike canon!Harry, yes, but then again, canon!Harry spent his entire childhood being told, through words and actions, to keep his head down and try to be ignored. This Harry didn't.

2. Not having read all of canon might be a hindrance, but it's not automatically a fatal one. I gather that the author had read enough fanfiction to grasp the key points; if his characterisation of Snape ended up a bit closer to fanon than canon as a result, that isn't an automatic write-off. (And honestly, Snape withholding information in a way that makes Harry much more likely to fail his secret test of character, then piling on criticism, is pretty accurate; just consider Harry's Occlumency lessons.)

***** This is an aside from the topic of the post, but I personally didn't love MoR because I found it often betrayed its premise, leaning too much on edginess and not enough on rationality. Like the bad guy was obviously the bad guy, all the evidence supported him being the bad guy and using the methods of rationality Harry should have anticipated him being the bad guy by chapter 2, yet Harry never actually seems to /use/ methods of rationality. He name-drops complex philosophical and scientific theories every paragraph but very rarely seems to apply them to actual magic, learning, or adversity in common sense ways. It would be fine if the fic itself and Harry weren't so preachy about using rationality all the time--the hypocrisy was a little much for me. That's just my two cents about why it was frustrating to me. Dumbledore was fine though.

Edit: I also feel like the story is subject to a higher level of scrutiny and criticism than other fanfiction works because the author has sold copies and profited from the story.

There is a reason, after all, that the author is part of a community titled /Less Wrong/. Because the premise is that everyone does a lot of stupid things, including the people who can recognise and label those stupidities in themselves, and the hope is simply to do a bit better than before.

These days I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. And the main reason for this is because it started off as a satire (what happens if a rational character meets an irrational world) and evolved into an earnest take down of canon's philosophy using concepts that do not exist in canon. That's a big change in what the story is.

I'm not sure I'd call it outright dreadful. Seriously misleading, certainly. Too long? Definitely. But the main thing I remember people taking issue with, i.e. Draco's suggesting that he'd rape (iirc) Hermione, is something the text quite specifically used Harry to criticise.

** Considering this is a series for kids and teens, there are plenty of plot holes present to allow for the young reader to relate to the characters, and the characterization of most adults in authority suffers for it.

I find that fics that make me like Dumbledore are ones that either don't go too deep into his character, and thus somewhat dodge some plot holes related to him, or the ones where he is shown to have significantly less political power the we are made to think, and thus bears less responsibility for Harry's pain.

The fic the put me on track to no longer straight up hate the character, and made me start to enjoy deeper characterizations of him was (Umbrus Shade, The Incredibly Annoyed Ravenclaw). It's a SI in a canon-compliant universe (initially) that eventually forges a nice mentor relationship with Dumbledore, to the point he starts learning his maneurisms. I love Dumbledore here, highly recommend this fic. Worth to mention that there is no pairing and it takes a while for Dumbledore to become truly relevant.

So not only does he have the dumbest name on the face of the planet, it's /also/ arranged in the worst possible way.

Like, I don't know about you, but if I'd introduced myself to my classmates as /Shade/, I'd have probably been drowned or something.

Christ.

Apart from the name and the arrogance, the magical theory is pretty good.

Like, first chapter, and our dear /Shade Umbrus/ (since Shade is his first name, not his surname) calls a random person on the street an NPC.

But apart from the blatant superiority complex, it has some of the best magical theory segments I've seen yet.

For now, he's definitely no gary stu, and actually has some problems with magic. I like the way transfiguration is explained, and how it subverts most of the usual magical theory tropes (the bad, definitely, but /also/ some the good).

** Bashing is bad writing and bad writing is integral to the very fabric of the medium of fanfiction. Fanfiction isn't really meant for good writing or compelling stories, even if it can sometimes produce those. It's mostly an outlet for fans to explore their own fantasies of versions of events that happened in the books. Fantasies don't generally make for good writing. I've learned to get over the stupid cliche fanfic tropes I don't enjoy, and focus on the trashy cliche fanfic tropes I do enjoy, like Harry travelling back in time and fixing all his mistakes! I think it's okay to indulge in bad writing that doesn't make sense sometimes. :D

** I remember discussing this recently. Anyway, I would really like to see a fic where Dumbledore actually tries to manipulate adult ministry workers and Wizengamot members and not just school children. I'd like to see a Dumbledore who just wants to keep the peace and tries to appease Voldemort. There is a precedent- some British were against war with Germany in the '30s. Particularly Neville Chamberlain who is still a controversial figure. It's boring that every manipulative/ evil Dumbledore fic has him steal Harry's wealth and plan to have him die in battle.

I don't know why in fanfiction Dumbledore often refuses to kill Death Eaters. Wasn't that a Batman thing? Anyway, one possible justification I've come up with is that he probably taught lots of the older Death Eaters and no matter how bad they are now he still sees them as students and can't bring himself to kill them.

** I'm not the biggest Dumbledore fan, but I think he is one of the most complex and well-written characters, in my opinion he's actually one of the best! I really do like his relationship with Harry and I genuinely believe he loved him and saw him as a son, but he did have to think of the greater good not only was he headmaster but the leader of the order. I feel like he felt his feelings for in the road of Grindlewald and he didn't want to see his feelings get in the way of stopping Voldemort. Not only that but he definitely blames himself for Ariana's death and probably feels similar towards Harry, idk that's just my take

** I think it ultimately stems from the place that people accept that Dumbledore is manipulative but do not accept the validity of his actions. I think this is mostly because he's seen as a utilitarian who acts for the Greater Good and everyone's seen Hot Fuzz by now. Mind you... I think Dumbledore is a paternalist and paternalism is really unpopular because, well, because it's a fantastic justification for meddling with well loved values like autonomy and liberty. So... maybe people just really dislike manipulation and aren't willing to listen to why. Which, you know, maybe that's fair enough.

That being said, I don't think Dumbledore bashing tends to come from a place of critique. I don't see fics which critical of utilitarianism or paternalism or whatever other ethical justification one wants to use... the books go with love, which I take as paternalism but maybe it literally just means "love is enough" (Harry certainly seems to think so).Rather, Dumbledore seems to be bashed because he sets Harry up to die based on a guess. And this just seems... ill informed. All the fics which I've seen work like this, invent their own (almost always just as risky) alternative means of de-Horcruxing Harry and they all use the existence of this alternative as a basis for bashing. I mean, is letting a Dementor, say, suck the Horcrux out really the safer option?

But, then, would I give a bashfic that is about the problems with Dumbledore's ethical motivations that has a safe or, possibly, the same solution to the Horcrux the credit it deserves? I think, probably not. Why? I like Dumbledore. As you say, he's interesting because he's flawed... because his policy in OOTP makes things worse /and/ because I see why he was like this. It's like how Sirius is more interesting as the guy who tried to turn his best friend into a murderer than... whatever else.

Mind you... Seventh Horcrux's Dumbledore appears to have no idea what's going on and I'll happily read that. I guess that's because Harrymort thinks Dumbledore's fifty steps ahead whereas he's really just rather harmless.
