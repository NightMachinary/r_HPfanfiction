*** I was reading this fic where Hedwig brings Harry mice to eat and thought huh, I wonder if there's any fics where he eats the bird instead.

** There is. I don't recall the name of the fic but it's by an [[http://www.amanuensis1.com/mainfanficpage.html][author named amanuensis]]. All of her fics are dark. Like BLACK dark. Depression-inducing, sadness-filled, horror-type, NC-17 dark. They're proper writing though - not the stuff of moody teenagers, so maybe have some pictures of kittens a box of chocolates and a script for Zoloft if you're going to read them.

*** I believe the fic you're looking for is [[http://www.amanuensis1.com/onepieceof.html][One Piece of Parchment]], although the owl-eating is only implied.

** Seeing as Hedwig is Best Girl, I /might/ have to kill you for this.

Don't go anywhere. I'll be over shortly.
