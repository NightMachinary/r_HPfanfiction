If it helps, I particularly liked "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9065880/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Butterfly-Effect][Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect"]].


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking-Control][Taking Control]]: t's the summer before Harry's 6th year, and Harry is wracked with grief. But what happens when Harry makes a vow to himself to take control of his life? Harry's life takes a sharp turn when he gets an unexpected visitor one night. HPGW Independent!Harry (Dumbledore's not evil, but he's quite manipulative)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746/1/Harry-Potter-and-Godric-s-Legacy][Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy]]: Post OotP. AU. Harry is fed up with Dumbledore's interference and sets out to do things his way, with help from some unexpected sources. When he learns the second half of the Prophecy, and finds his power, he won't allow anything to stand in his way.

Not helping with your question, or anything, but isn't there a /“Harry is a girl”/ story with pretty much the same name?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A-Butterfly-Effect][Found it]]. Hard to get much samer, as far as names go. The one I linked is awful, by the way, but it has Harry/Ginny. Lesbian Harry/Ginny, but Harry/Ginny nonetheless.
