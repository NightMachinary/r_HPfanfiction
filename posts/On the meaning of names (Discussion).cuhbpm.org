Percival - The exact origin of the name is uncertain; however, the most likely source is the Celtic "Peredur" from the Old Welsh meaning "warrior of the cauldron". This name was borne by a Welsh legendary hero of the Middle Ages and the cognate Old Welsh "Pair-cyfall" means "warrior of the Chalice".

That's what I found when I googled the etymology of Percival. I then spent a good minute laughing, on Albus as a master of Alchemy being a Warrion of the Cauldron, and Percy Weasley battling the Ministry over the thickness of Cauldron bottoms. Anybody else have some good laughs over names? I know I've read a few fics where names have power, anybody have a favorite where that angle is explored?


** Hermione means Princess of Hermes, and one of Hermes' symbols is a satchel or pouch. He's also "the god of boundaries and the transgression of boundaries"

  "But she follows a lot of rules, way more than us, and she's really upset when we break them," Ron said.

  I shook my head. "When Hermione does break rules, however, she has no distinction between stupid ones and basic human decency. Remember when she wanted to kidnap and interrogate those Slytherins? Or when she tortured that reporter?"

** Honestly, I don't really like speaking names, I find them rather immersion breaking when I notice them. I guess it's alright for comedy, or when your work puts more importance on the symbolism than the plot and the characters, but that's not most fics, and that's not the feel I've always gotten from HP.

** Nymphadora stems from Greek for ‘bride gift'. I can understand why she hates her name.

Dumbledore is old English for ‘bumblebee'.

Dolores is linked to the word ‘sorrows'

Severus is linked to Latin, for ‘stern' or ‘harsh', while Snape is linked to Old Norse, for ‘to outrage, dishonour, disgrace'
