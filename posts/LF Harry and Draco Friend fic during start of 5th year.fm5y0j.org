Read it a few years ago. Starts off with Harry being recently found and interrogated by Madam Bones. I think Harry was hiding and grew up on the streets of Diagon Alley and was recently found. He and Draco somehow met earlier and became friends.

Story starts of summer before 5th yr; harry is living in the castle and draco comes as well after his parents find out. I think there was also mention of a vampire? Those are all the details I can remember.
