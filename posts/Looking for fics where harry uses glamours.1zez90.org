** Out of the Night by BekkaJane

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/5/Out-of-the-Night]]

Adopted from Raining Ink. Between 5th and 6th years, Harry is ready to take his life into his own hands. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Independent!Harry. Dark!Harry. No pairings.

It isn't called a glamour but after Harry gets his Peverell inheritance he is able to shift his face at will between his true self and his Peverell features.

** Teeth by hathanhate

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9406877/1/Teeth]]

Harry screws up the animagus processes when he throws himself into becoming one in the summer after 5th year to not think about Sirius. He ends up using glamours for most of the fic after that, because his human appearance is affected by his inner animal. It strays into Avengers crossover territory after a while though, so it might not be your cup of tea.
