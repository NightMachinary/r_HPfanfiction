***** Very nitpicky. Tenses can shift halfway through a sentence, especially when it's the character's thoughts. Sure, it's not 100% correct, but it's fanfiction. If you're so intent on hating it, why post on this thread in the first place?

****** It's narration describing character's thoughts. It would be nitpicky to harp about one uncorrected mistake in the fic itself, but this is description. And that mistake is coupled with typo and generally poor wording. If that's the effort put into description, then I shudder to think about fic itself.

******* You could, yknow, at least check out the first chapter before stating why you hate it. Or you could just leave if you're not interested in the fic? Like, I get it, it's not your cup of tea, but since you haven't read it so you can't offer productive criticism, why are you still here? I can't force you to leave or anything, but it just confuses me.

Edit: also there's another person on this thread who said that they liked it, so its not just my opinion on it. At least if you're going to drag it through the mud, read a chapter first.

But the fic fails so hard, that I can offer criticism based on description alone. Why even bother reading the first chapter?

And? The number of people liking a thing doesn't say anything about quality, just see most favourited fics. Especially that neither you or the other fan of the fic wrote why the fic is good.

*** The only H/D I'm interested in are the Veela!Draco fics. I'm usually let down because I want Harry to reject Draco because Draco's an asshole. The author usually goes the angsty Harry route where he begrudgingly accepts Draco because he "doesn't want to be responsible for Draco going crazy and slowly dying because his mate rejected him" route.

Harry's all, "I don't want to be responsible for him dying," and I'm all, "Help him dig his grave, bitch!"

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezor with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and that wasn't what he wanted, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”

** It's kind of a shame someone decided to dislike this post just because it's m/m. Especially since if they read the fic it's not even shipping yet. At all. They're friends. I'm honestly kind of disappointed that this subreddit seems so instantly against any fic just because it's “slash”.

*** I think the "soulmate" part also has something to do with it. It's a trope that screams "insta friendship without any character development", it suggests the author did not want to really think about how a friendship could develop naturally and took the lazy way out. That's the reason why I am hesitant to read the story. Not because it is slash. Also, it wouldn't have hurt if you had given us a little more to go on... Neither the story summary nor your recommendation tells us what this fic is about. Does it follow the canon timeline (Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Voldemort), what about Ron and Hermione, is it a lighthearted or darker story, what is so "amazing" about this story? I don't mean you should spoil the story, but a little more information would have been nice.

**** Yeah, I understand. (Edit: I did get a little bit annoyed when I browsed through this subreddit and found a bunch of anti-slash stuff, so it did make me a bit testy. My bad)

It starts during chamber of secrets, and during the duel, Draco trying to quiet Harry reveals that they're both soulmates. They still hate each other, but it's awkward and they still try to make an effort to at least listen to each other. Each chapter follows a book. Both Draco and Harry's friends are kept in the dark at first, but when they find out about their soulmate status, Ron, Hermione, Blaise, and Pansy try to work together to keep Harry and Draco's soulmate status a secret from Draco's parents.

As of now, the fic is more about their slowly growing friendship and the hiccups along the way that tend to occur when you realize the person you hate is destined to be your greatest love/friend.

***** Thanks! Hm... I think often slash is excluded not because people are homophobic, but because stories that include slash often put a focus on it at the cost of the rest of the story and include long sex scenes. It often also comes with certain other tropes that people might not like.

******* Sadly that is the way of the world. A single example is often used as the excuse to exclude those that may even slightly be similar. Many people hate rational fics because Methods of Rationality exists. Many people hate the Harry Ginny Pairing because the movies ruined the Ginny character. many people hate Harmony because the pairing is so over worked. And as far as Slash is concerned, it is often because Slash stories are about the slash.

Heres the thing... Homosexuality does not change people's characters except for their dating preferences. While it may open a few doors, it also closes them plot wise. My issue with slash stories is that no one who writes them understands that slash should not matter at all in the story unless its a character basis. Most slash stories on this fandom deal with the fact that "OMG Harry is gay! Lets make that a major plot point. " Then they spend the next 30k words to communicate that Harry is gay and that he is attracted to Draco/snape/voldemort. Never mind the fact that in canon, while there was romance, it was a driving emotional force, not a central image. Thus, every single time that romance, slash or otherwise, becomes central in the story, the characterization of the characters is odd, uninspired and boring. This story also falls into the trope, and while it is an okay story, the fact that it is romance centered is the issue. nothing more, nothing less.

Also, the flair is wrong. you should have the Recommendation flair, not the request.
