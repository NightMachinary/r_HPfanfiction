1. My friend is looking for a fic. It's older - about ten years old - so be aware. She doesn't remember much about it, but here is what she does remember: it goes more in depth about the abuse Harry received from the Dursleys. He either starts running or starts helping a construction crew paving to get in shape (she thinks both). He meets Hermione first. That's all she remembers. A long shot, I know, but maybe someone remembers?

2. I am looking for fics kind of like Growing Up Black. Anything about Harry being saved from the Dursleys early on or not going to the Dursleys at all. I'd LOVE fics of Minerva raising him, or the Weasleys, or Sirius. I'm okay with complete book rewrites. I'd mostly enjoy Minerva or Sirius raising him, however.

Thanks in advance, guys!

**** I almost didn't post it because it gets recommended on here so often! I figured you'd have read it already. It's a really great story with awesome character development and the third part it the series is updated once a week!

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Not sure if this is quite what you're looking for, but linkffn(11360264) is about Harry being raised by Sirius and the Malfoys. Colubrina says it's on hiatus, but she last updated 16 hours ago, and she tends to finish her fics rather quickly (or at least updates frequently).
