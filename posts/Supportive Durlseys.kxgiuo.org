Basically looking for fics where the Vernon and or Petunia (preferably both) are supportive of Harry instead of the usual negligent or outright abusive.


** I was imagining a senario where harry slowly wins over Petunia with his manners and good behavior during the 10 years he stays with them. But Vernon and Dudley are the same intolerant people in my senario.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  In which a smart!Vernon figures out that he and Petunia are being manipulated to resent Harry, and decide to do all they can to teach him everything they can about the wizarding world. Petunia enlists Lily's old friend, Severus Snape, and when the Marauders come on board they love the biggest prank on Dumbledore ever.

  Vernon Dursley is an ambitious man. And when he finds a freak at his front door, he opts to see it not as a burden, but as an opportunity. An opportunity that shall provide him with rich rewards in due time.

** A Better Man on ff.net (hopefully someone can link? I'm blocked). It starts in canon (...more or less) during Vernon's funeral. Harry, bitter AF, just wishes he'd been a better man. The fates awaken and Vernon is given a second chance...starting at Lilly and James' wedding. Instead of being magic-hating jackasses in a corner, he determinedly introduces himself properly to James and his friends.\\
THings get better from there.

** Just reading “3 Slytherin Marauders by severusphoenix” linkffn(4923158), where the score is complicated: Petunia turns around, but is shot by Vernon, who dies eventually. Otherwise, the story is Severitus, and I haven't finished yet, so I don't how it finishes.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
