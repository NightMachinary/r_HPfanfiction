I really love the flash, and want to know if there are any stories where Harry has the speedforce? Or, at the very least, has super speed and uses it often?

Preferably over 50k words C:


** ... I might have to give this a go given my PHD is on the Flash and Barry Allen...

Well-written DC crossovers or adaptations are hard to find.

** This isn't exactly what you asked for, considering /Ron/ has the speedforce instead of Harry and it's under 50k words, but I figured that I might as well put it here.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** ...Why would we kill you?

Anyways, there was a two chapter thingy that was a "Harry has speedforce" thing. At least, it was two chapters when I read it, but last time I saw it, it seemed fairly abandoned. +I don't recall the name, but you should be able to find it with the FFN filter function. It was a Harry/Daphne fic, less than 10k words.+

Found it! linkffn(In a Flash by The Count Criminal)

*** Thanks ! And I said "Please don't kill me" because people tend to be... over-dramatic about things when it comes to fanfiction

  My name is Harry Potter and I'm the fastest man alive. When I was seven years old I was struck by a bolt of lightning that made me the impossible. At eleven I learned that I was a wizard. Using my Speed and Magic I defy Voldemort and his Death Eaters, A Corrupt Ministry, Tons of politicians and Manipulative Headmasters whilst while improving, improvising and expanding my skill set.

** I actually started writing this one, with PoA Harry meeting Flashpoint Barry Allen who wound up on this Earth after being replaced by New52 Flash.

Once again, I hit the adversary problem. Pretty much any DC superhero is OP for Potterverse. The only worse option in this regard is Ender.
