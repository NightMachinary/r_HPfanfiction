This may not be the right word but where Harry behaves like in the beginning of this fic

#+begin_quote
  Now all we need ta do is get ya a pet," Hagrid rumbled. He took the boy into the pet shop and spent several minutes examining the owls to find the best one.

  "I want that one," Harry said, his gaze locked on the creature in the shop's largest cage.

  "I am not a pet," the well endowed platinum headed girl growled. Fleur was not having a good day, she'd gone to this triple damned island of pigs with her father to conduct some business and as soon as she'd let the man out of her sight, an odious toad like individual had captured her and locked her in a cage. "My name is Fleur and . . ."

  "Well . . . yer only su'pos ta have an owl er a cat er a toad, but I don't see the harm in ignoring all that."

  "Yay," Harry cheered.

  "You're not even listening to me are you?" Fleur demanded.

  "I think I'll call you . . . Hedwig," Harry said thoughtfully.

  "I said my name is Fleur."

  "Hedwig."

  "Fleur."

  "Hedwig."

  "Fleur, or I will give you such a pinch."

  "Fleur then," Harry agreed. "And I'm Harry, pleased to meet you."

*** That was cliched, full of fluff, with meh-writing, a seemingly noncommittal author, and a mix of cringeworthy parody with random plot elements popping in everywhere.

But I /kinda/ liked it, some parts, at least, maybe because I've spent so long away from this fandom. Any other recs like this?

**** I'm currently reading Delenda Est and am about 75% done with it. Harry seems to become less and less intelligent with each chapter. In the first half of the book he cleverly uses his knowledge to change the fate of many characters. He maneuvers high pressure situations with wit and determination, while Bellatrix tries her hardest to benefit from him while he deflects her advances. In the second half, Bellatrix takes over almost completely. She is the one coming up with all the ideas, ordering Harry around while he often just states "i don't know / no idea" when confronted with a problem. She becomes the mastermind while Harry is her pawn and he is reprimanded for his decisions.The story just seems to get worse the further I read it :/.

It's arguable whether Harry is so stupid he breaks physics or so insane that physics works out for him.

  And then nothing. No light. No sound. And he was alone and time seemed to stop passing altogether. It seemed an eternity before his uncle came. The light from the living room was dim as the man looked down at the boy in the cupboard. "You know what to do, Harry."

  "Yes, Uncle Vernon," he acknowledged, as the door closed, leaving the two of them sealed in the dark. He stripped off his clothes and waited.

  "If I didn't want to help you I wouldn't be able to bring myself to touch you." The words were the same every time he received special discipline. Spoken in that sad tone of voice that made him wish he were dead rather than being a burden on his family.

  "I know, Uncle Vernon. I apologize for forcing this upon you again," he whispered, lying down, face down on his nest of blankets and rags. He spread his thighs as he heard his uncle spit several times. Then was the familiar pressure followed up by ripping pain that increased as his uncle grunted and began thrusting. Harry clenched his eyes and teeth and waited for his punishment to end. Which it did with a surge of fluid entering him, a few last thrusts, and his uncle standing up.

  "Harry?"

  "I'm sorry you had to touch me, Uncle Vernon. I will try to be better in the future."

  "See that you do."

**** Sorry for offending you with this recommendation. It's just that I find reading about the darker themes introduced by writers to be rather fascinating, and did not consider that other people may be more squeamish about such things.
