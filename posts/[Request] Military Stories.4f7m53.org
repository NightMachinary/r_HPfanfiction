I'm looking for stories that are based around Harry gaining military experience. Stories like linkffn(2784825) or linkffn(11494711) are what I'm looking for. Although with A Military Man I'm not fond of the age and timeline alteration.


** The best one would be *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]*, where Harry never went to Hogwarts, but to a muggle military academy instead. Most of the story took place after 2008, when all of our known characters were well into their adulthood.

*** Who is the focus on in the story? Despite having been reading Fanfiction since before OotP I still haven't branched into fics where the focus isn't on Harry.

How Harry built his empire and vanquished his enemies.

The first chapter is also the epilogue of this story.

****** Don't bother. It meanders around and does nothing for thousands of words. Having the ending at the beginning ruins any sort of sense of danger or suspense because you already know what will happen. If you think the action scenes will redeem it, it's possible. What usually just happens is essentially "Harry blows it up Colonel Mustang Style."

******* It's always possible to skip the prologue, but either way the author has changed it as the story has progressed.

** This isn't about Harry, it's about his daughter Lily, but I thought it was a nice one shot about her choosing to enter the British military after Hogwarts. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/666224]])

** Old Soldiers is a favourite of mine. Did you try linkffn(What We Are Fighting For)? There is also a dimensional transfer out there that has Harry pulling his army to the new dimension. Susan is his XO iirc. Also, linkffn(Code of the Gryffin by Knife Hand) is one I like a lot.

  Harry is sent to military school, is the basis of this particular fanfiction. This will take place from the time Harry is seven till the end of the series. Hopefully. Rewrite of 'Military Man'. M for violence, swearing, and probably some nudity.

** Chances are my next fanfic is going to revolve around a mercenary Harry. Can't say when it will come out, or if you'll like it but you can keep an eye out if you want. (Ave Imperium is my pen name on ffn.)
