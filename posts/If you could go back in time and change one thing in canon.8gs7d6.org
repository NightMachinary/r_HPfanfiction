** I probably would've kept at least one of Harry's relatives alive other than Petunia. Or had Remus contact him more.

And kept Fred alive so George wouldn't have to live without his twin. Although, I like Percy Ihe would kill him off or even Arthur in fifth year.

** I would not let Ariana get assaulted, which would lead to Dumbledore being a happy confident bloke, Grindelwald would fall in love with said happy confident bloke, which would lead to them feeling that gay rights activism being a more pressing matter than becoming the Masters of Death or world domination, Grindelwald would use his talents to form a political career and Dumbledore would do research, after quite a while they would win acceptance and would decide to start a family, they would put a spell on all orphanages to alert them in case a magical child is left without someone to care for it, and beep beep, there would be one, Tom Marvolo Riddle would be his name and they would raise and love him as their own, which would lead to him becoming a super cool nice bloke, who would become a teacher and mentor for young Severus who would therefore develop some nice self esteem and not be miserable and everyone would love and live happily ever after.

....

If everyone would be like me, there would be no stories, everyone would just be happy and loved.

** I would add in some positively overt LGBT characters sprinkled through the story. Maybe Harry notes random same-sex couples at the Yule Ball, maybe he gets to know a trans character in his House. Maybe one of the mentioned Order members is mentioned as being a man with a husband, or a woman with a wife!

These are ways to do this positively and naturally, and without having to change the main casts sexualities away from seeming straightness (like some people here comment about they don't like seeing happen in fanfictions).

** I'd make it so Hermione died against the troll in first year. (Just kidding lmao.)

In truth, something like, if Harry wasn't abused by the Dursley's and they were a loving family, I wonder what Harry would have been like. (Probably more emotionally stable, less anger, perhaps even a different house sorting, more confident perhaps) This doesn't mean he necessarily knows he's a wizard however, Petunia would love him in this scenario and wouldn't want him to be a "freak" or expose him to the dangers of the wizarding world (She knows her sister died from it)
