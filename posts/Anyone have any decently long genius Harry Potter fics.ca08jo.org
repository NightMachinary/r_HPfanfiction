  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

*** Hi there! Just so you are aware, "Blindness" is one of the stories that breaks Rule 8:

#+begin_quote
  No direct links to sexual or suggestive content involving minors.
#+end_quote

You are allowed to tell people about it and encourage them to read it, but you *cannot* provide a direct link to the story. Therefore, I've had to remove the bot's reply to you.

Just wanted to let you know!

** Well, obligatory /HPMoR/ rec is obligatory...

...although there's a fair argument that as opposed to being decently long, /HPMoR/ is /indecently/ long.

Not quite certain if this all the way counts as genius! Harry, but it's certainly clever! Harry, and 371k. I only read through the first book so far but the writing is good.
