** When the POV seems to change with every other paragraph, it drives me insane.

A story primarily about two people and the POV changes between them is totally fine. Something like Game of Thrones where there are different POV's per chapter is also fine.

Constantly changing POV's however is completely infuriating, now it's person A, next paragraph is person B, in the middle of that same paragraph it changes to person C.

I'll drop it immediately if there's no sense of order in that chaos.

When a fic uses third person limited, I'm always on the lookout for instances of narrator omniscience and the characters knowing more about a given situation than they should. It's surprisingly common.

**** Yes, that's totally fine. Just make sure it's a seamless transition as to not confuse the reader.

Another thing even the original series does is subtly change POV's. Sometimes you see the POV changing to the omniscient narrator, sometimes even for other characters. But, you need to very careful with this because if done wrong it's a certain way to confuse the reader.

When I only see a mess of POV's changing all the time where nothing makes sense, I stop reading.

Here's an example from the Half-Blood Prince, the change is highlighted in bold:

#+begin_quote
  And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort.

  "... but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!"

  "What?"

  "Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I'm afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore -- you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes -- Harry, dear?"

  *She looked back over her shoulder, having only just realised that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other.*

  "Harry?'" she repeated uncertainly.

  Perhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock-still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long ...

  It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their son ...

He also loves his friends to bits and he doesn't put up with what he sees as betrail (see year 4). He's also a bit quick to judge and easily angered and a little jealous.

*** I hate this so much since it pops up so frequently in one of the pairings I follow.

Usually the guy will be unfaithful and/or abusive, just bashing him mercilessly so the girl can be "rescued" by some other bloke. This template is usually very popular and has reviews applauding it and calling for the guy to be torn to shreds. I hate the bashing and the "savior" shit but I can at least agree with the girl not returning to such a toxic relationship.

But if the woman cheats on him, even if he's done no wrong, lots of people want her to leave him for the other guy, continue seeing this bastard in secret and even having his baby, or think she should be forgiven easily.

The worst I've seen(and skimmed to see the ending) was where the girl gets knocked up by her neighbor while she's already in a relationship. Instead of telling him to move on or making him feel better, all his friends and family gang up on him to take her back and partially blame him for the mess. This was after they meet the guy she cheated with and have a laugh with him at the boyfriends expense. Then the girl gets mad when he wants her to stop seeing him.

Just...aagh! Needless to say I disliked the author and now none of her work shows up in my results. I'm thinking things like this may be because most fanfic authors and readers are female and have a bias towards the female character and since the guy gets a bad rep. You can probably guess the characters I'm talking about easily. </rant>

******* No, no, I have no opinion about you not liking it, that's completely your prerogative. What I objected to was the idea of it /not being possible with magic./

I mean, it's literally magic. They put caves in trunks, kitchens in tents, and libraries in moleskin pouches. Who says the baby has to grow inside the wizard's body? It could grow in magically extended space. It could grow inside the wizard's magic. And I think a working set of female internal organs held continuously for nine months, or even for the wizard's entire life, alongside their male internal organs or instead of them or however, would be /pie/ for the force that let Pettigrew live as a frickin rat for 12 years.

Saying it's not tolerable, you don't like it, you don't want to read about it, that's whatever, that's normal.

Saying it's /not possible with magic/ just makes no sense whatsoever and is a little bit kind of maybe heteronormative and ethnocentric.

Also, your example of how it could be done, is much more thought out and logical than 90% of the fics that use mpreg as a plot device. And in regards to the heteronormative bit, I'm not even straight so we can throw that right out the window.

********* I don't know about you, but the majority of fics that use it as a plot device that I've read are pretty much thinking 'Pairings that bridge the gap between hate and love are the best =D (which I totally agree with 0.0) but these jerks are too prejudiced to consider letting it get beyond a one-night stand. What's the fastest way to make them get over it?' And they find the answer to be 'fulfil their deep-seated desire for a family'.

They're romance/family centred fluff fics full of cotton-candy dreams that possibly start out with some angsting guilt of 'oh merlin I've betrayed everyone' and 'love is a weakness!! I am not in love I'm just using him' and then devolve into 'so what colour do you want to paint the nursery?' I don't think the mechanics of male pregnancy are at the forefront of anyone's mind.

The fics where I've seen people go into how it's possible are usually the ones where mpreg is possible in that world but doesn't actually happen to the main characters. And I don't think I've ever seen anyone write about the baby growing inside the wizard's magic but I think it's definitely possible to write it in a way that makes a lot of sense.

#+begin_quote
  "rearrange it into the shape of a goblet"

This is causing some seriously bad images of a goblet-shaped raven that's still a raven in my head. I think maybe that should be reworked because that's pretty animal-cruelty.

Out of curiosity, do you also think animagi/werewolves retain a human internal structure?

I don't know about your personal situation of course "" but it just seemed like, saying that magic can do all these impossible things but it /can't/ allow men to have children is kind of like saying "children are the explicit privilege of a male/female union and anyone who doesn't like that can use a surrogate".

It's just, personally I don't think in the world of blood purity and family lines, surrogate parental DNA would be welcome, whether that's in the form of a 'donor' parent, or a 'third' parent due to the addition of magic.

(both from a physical and mental stand point) I do like your idea of incubating the child in the wizard's magic though. That is less of a horror show in my mind. And in regards to the surrogate parenting, I don't think the pure bloods would mind, if the surrogate was also a pure blood.

*********** When I was little I used to hate mpreg on the grounds that oh my gosh, it must be so humiliating for the person, everyone thinks they're a girl and then BAM it's a man! They can't walk out amongst people cos everyone will think they're an alien.... But eventually I realised that in a lot of Harry Potter fics, it's viewed as perfectly normal by everyone around them, and the people are just thinking 'oh, baby' not 'man with a baby!!!1!' Plus, it was just around so much that I got used to it and it no longer seemed shocking or far outside the boundaries of my once-narrow little mind. I guess it's just pretty hard for me to remember how it felt back when I still found it shocking or unpleasant ;0

Discussing situations JKR never dreamed of is the beauty of fanfic ;D and I think the purebloods would be against it because it would make inheritance law a mess.

*rant* (feel free to skip)

What if the main branch of the Slytherin family had three daughters, and one of them was the surrogate for, say.... A Dolohov and an Avery. The Dolohovs have a son, but the Slytherin daughters, who have married into other families, have only daughters. Given that the statute of secrecy took effect sometime in the 1700s I think, it's likely that up until then, wizard's and muggles at least superficially shared ideas/culture, meaning the male bias was present in both muggle and wizarding culture. The son of the Dolohovs has equal blood relation to the Slytherin line as the Slytherin daughters' daughters. The problem is, he has 0 blood relation to the Averys. In addition, he has a greater claim to being the Slytherin heir than his female cousins. This opens up the great, ancient, noble Slytherin line for some upstart from the Dolohovs, who haven't even been in /Britain/ that long, to claim the title of heir to their family, and get their filthy hands not only on their money, heirlooms, political influence, etc, but also, (and this is the most sacreligious) (I'm using hyperbole in case it's not clear) their precious parseltongue, which I can imagine they valued above all else and guarded jealously if the state of the Gaunts is any indication. On the other hand, it leaves the Averys with the problem that the son of their son has no blood relation to them. So can he really inherit their wealth, their heirlooms, their political influence? This is especially problematic if it's the main or only branch of the family.

Or what if the kid was related to all three, the Slytherins, Dolohovs, and Averys? And the three Slytherin daughters all died without any children. Now the only Slytherin left is some upstart Dolohov and the great and noble family is absorbed into a lesser house. Not something I can see the family that considered themselves practically wizarding royalty due to their blood would be ok with.

Of course, one might think it would be easy enough to say 'even if the kid has Slytherin DNA, legally it's an Avery', but I think the wizarding world has so much focus on blood and history and hereditary magical traits that they just wouldn't be able to get over the fact that the kid isn't actually related to them. It seems like this would introduce strong social pressure, if not legal pressure, that the heirs to ancient families /must/ be in heterosexual couples to produce an heir.

*/rant*

Anyways "" of course there are counterarguments and explanations around that and etc etc but that's just the way I see it :D sorry for the super-long tangent. The idea 'who knows what wouldl happen" is exactly what lets it be unique in every fic and let every author put a different history/culture and structure in place depending on where they want their fic to go =D

***** It's true that many of the people living in some regions of the UK share /minor/ Y-chromosome homology with members of the Basque region of Spain, but there is no widespread consensus that they originated from that point on the continent. Indeed, the very notion that ancient Britons came from Hispania emerged from Roman propagandists who had no interest in performing verifiable research. The most likely originator of this theory is Tacitus who wrote a very flawed history of the region called /Agricola/, which was a panegyric to his father-in-law.

Caeser knew the people living in Britain weren't Celts because the Greek historian Diodorus' work [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheca_historica][Bibliotheca historica]] described "a land beyond the Kelts." In this context, Kelt is a Greek word meaning 'stranger' and was originally used to describe the people living in northern Italy. Caeser called the people he met in Britain /Belgae/, from which we have the word Belgium.

I have no idea what to call the first people who settled Ireland or the UK. There simply isn't enough information available to give them a label.

  */Bibliotheca historica/* (Βιβλιοθήκη ἱστορική, "Historical Library"), is a work of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_history][universal history]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus][Diodorus Siculus]]. It consisted of forty books, which were divided into three sections. The first six books are geographical in theme, and describe the history and culture of Egypt (book I), of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia][Mesopotamia]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India][India]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythia][Scythia]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia][Arabia]] (II), of North Africa (III), and of Greece and Europe (IV - VI). In the next section (books VII - XVII), he recounts the history of the World starting with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War][Trojan War]], down to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Alexander_the_Great][death of Alexander the Great]]. The last section (books XVII to the end) concerns the historical events from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadochi][successors of Alexander]] down to either 60 BC or the beginning of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar][Caesar's]] Gallic War in 59 BC. (The end has been lost, so it is unclear whether Diodorus reached the beginning of the Gallic War, as he promised at the beginning of his work, or, as evidence suggests, old and tired from his labors he stopped short at 60 BC.) He selected the name "Bibliotheca" in acknowledgement that he was assembling a composite work from many sources. The authors he drew from, who have been identified, include: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecataeus_of_Abdera][Hecataeus of Abdera]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesias_of_Cnidus][Ctesias of Cnidus]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephorus][Ephorus]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theopompus][Theopompus]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_of_Cardia][Hieronymus of Cardia]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duris_of_Samos][Duris of Samos]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyllus][Diyllus]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistus][Philistus]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(historian)][Timaeus]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius][Polybius]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius][Posidonius]].

****** I swear I remember reading that the idea the tuatha de danaan originated from Spain is actually present in Irish mythology, or something like that. I know there is a huge lack of information about the early inhabitants of the Britannic isles, but I dont know how much faith I'd put in modern genetics.... After all, Ireland was basically England's first colony, and that was after the Britons had been jammed into Wales by both the Anglo-Saxon and Norman invasions. The Picts appear to have simply disappeared off the face of the earth, who says the genetically native Irish didn't do almost the same thing? You don't need to share dna to pick up the culture and origin-stories, and British lawmakers were going out their minds at British immigrants in Ireland "going native"

  Britons had been jammed into Wales
#+end_quote

A smart observation, but I'm not sure how much credence to give the idea. It's not that I disagree with the notion, but it all comes down to the extremely lively debate about the true size of the invasion of the Angles and Saxons. Historically, ethnologists and anthropologists from Germany like to state that there were ~100K immigrants. Most English archaeologists report finding only enough evidence to support a claim for 10-20K Angles and Saxons. I tend to give this second account much more credence solely owing to the fact that as of the fifth century there were already /four million/ inhabitants of the island of Britain. The idea that the immigrants (mostly) peaceably settle in the area is far more likely. Even 100K is a drop in the bucket against a native population 40 times its size.

This debate goes hand in hand with another closely related argument: how many children did the typical Anglo-Saxon family have?

Many of the Welsh would disagree with you, but it's immaterial. Almost all conversations between Scots, Welsh, and Irish devolve into an argument over who has more cause to despise the English.

******** Well to be honest I'm basing most of my information off of my "History of the Britannic Isles" and "Old English Language and Literature" classes last semester .-. it sounds like maybe you have more personal experience, and I'm by no means an expert, but Britannia really was my favourite class ever and the fact that I could apply it to my Harry Potter obsession just made both of those things even better :D

As for the Welsh, when I said 'first colony' I was contrasting it with China and India and such. I don't think, or at least I haven't seen, the Welsh referred to in such imperialistic, sub-human terms as the Irish were. Of course, the Welsh did have earlier exposure to the Brits than the Irish. I gathered that the native Britons were jammed into Wales by the time lapse maps of the isles we saw, showing which territory belonged to which group of people. Of course there might have been overlap or movement or fuzzy borders, but the maps implied that the areas under the Britons' control were rapidly eaten into until they controlled only the area now known as Wales. Of course the Anglo-Saxons were infighting and their own kingdoms were getting bigger or smaller or eaten amongst themselves, too.

With regards to the numbers of Anglo-Saxon invaders, we haven't covered it, but from what I could tell, the Anglo-Saxons were organised in warbands, while the Britons seemed to be kind of... domestic, after the Romans left. I mean, it was their home country, of course, so they were more settled, with actual houses and stuff. The Anglo-Saxons eating all their land may be less about numbers and more about viciousness.

But as I said, I have pretty much four months total of expertise on the subject.

It's the tiniest of minor nitpicks, but English and British are vastly different things. The word British comes from the Old Welsh word 'Prydain,' and probably means 'the people.' Most Welsh people would have no problem calling themselves British and a few more ornery types would also say that the word British should *not* apply to the English, given their murky origins in Germany as we've already discussed.

#+begin_quote
  imperialistic, sub-human terms
#+end_quote

It's true that the Irish have had a very tough go of it at the hands of Imperial England. The fact that they managed to win several concessions from Edward V in their peace treaty is remarkable and I'm glad they're able to celebrate independence. My own user name is a very tongue-in-cheek reference to the Welsh nationalists who - in comparison to the Irish - don't have the first idea for winning free of Westminster's control. I don't personally support the idea of complete independence, but increased devolved powers to the Senedd is extremely appealing.

The two most oft-quoted instances for England's recent bullying of Wales are the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Not][Welsh Not]] which was an active attempt to stamp out the Welsh language and the flooding of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capel_Celyn][Capel Celyn]] where Liverpool flooded a predominantly Welsh speaking town to make way for a reservoir.

Solely viewed in context of surviving languages, Wales is well in the lead of any of the other remaining First Nations. Welsh is the only non-endangered 'Celtic' language and has the highest proportion of speakers by far. Only 1.5% of Scots are fluent in Scotch Gaelic, so I'm at a loss as to why they wanted their independence when they're basically England+.

#+begin_quote
  the Britons seemed to be kind of... domestic, after the Romans left
#+end_quote

Understanding how Rome left fourth-fifth century Britain is another contentious point of debate with no clear answer. For me, I think it all comes down to a very strange historic figure: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus][Macsen Wledig]]. The Roman 'histories' claim that he was a general with a lengthy service record in Africa, Spain, and Germany before being stationed in Britain around 380 CE. The Welsh have an equally unlikely tale of the Emperor of Rome being so enamored of a Welsh woman that he freed the British people from subjugation at the hands of the Romans. My opinion - and perhaps also erroneous belief - is that he was simply a local Welsh chief and had contact with the Romans who grew to possess enormous military might and ability. The only thing we know for certain about him is that he waged a five year long campaign in Gaul starting in 383. Once he was finished with his war, the Romans had /no discernable presence/ in Gaul north of modern day Lyon. Most likely, he was a bloodthirsty warmonger who killed those at the upper echelon of Romano-Gaulic society. An incredible feat. The oldest Roman coins found near the Antonine and Hadrian walls date from 463, but it's extremely likely that Rome's presence in Britain was greatly diminished well before that time. Honestly, though, it's unlikely we'll ever have a clear understanding of the timetable or reasons for Rome's departure from the island.

You've raised some really excellent points and I'm grateful for your perspective.

Your username sounds like a name to me ;0 I'm unfortunately very ignorant of the Welsh language, though it would probably be fascinating to study. As for independence, I have absolutely no right to speak on that, but I hope things work out so all people in Britain are treated fairly :D

I was under the impression (from class) that the Romans hauled out of Britain because Rome was in deep trouble, and first of all the Roman army was needed back home, second of all they didn't have the economic power to keep their army supplied up there anymore. Of course it's possible that while the upper level Romans and recent immigrants headed back to Rome, others stayed and 'went native', I have no idea about that, but I think what we consider the 'Roman retreat' was when the connection to Rome was no longer able to be sustained.

  Britain may be famous for preserving its royal DNA
#+end_quote

Did you understand this reference? Because it flew right over my head.

It sounds like Diodorus was more right than he knew about 'a land beyond the Kelts.' Unfortunately, his /bibliotheca historica/ is also quite often used by Greek-centrist/supremacist historians to propagate the wild claim that Stonehenge was originally built as a temple to Athena. Sigh.

The inability to locate a sizable portion of 'Viking' DNA in most of the populace doesn't surprise me either. To my knowledge, the Vikings took thralls on a fairly regular basis. The native peoples of the island were considered to be particularly barbaric by the Romans because they did /not/ practice slavery, nor would they submit to be used in such a way (much like the Native populations of the New World). Indeed, the builders of the Hadrian and Antonine walls were likely Africans shipped from over eight thousand miles away. West African Y-chromosome subgroups pop up in Yorkshire in particular. [[https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6293333.stm][Article]]

If a populace won't work as slaves and you're a slavery-practicing culture, there's probably no reason to hang around. Maybe they had better luck in the Orkneys (or more likely the islands were almost constantly deserted and had no population to offer any resistance to Danish or Norwegian settlement).

#+begin_quote
  The answer, researchers said, was that Anglo-Saxons intermarried with, rather than replaced, the existing populations.
#+end_quote

This seems a very broad, sweeping statement to me. *All* of the existing populations? It seems to fly in the face of the already stated claim that the different groups showed remarkable heterogenetic diversity. If the typical Anglo-Saxon family had more children than was previously thought, then that could easily account for the higher frequency of their genetic markers, but I suspect it becomes splitting hairs at that point and ceases to matter.

The 'surprising' find of no Celtic genetic markers is - I think - only a problem of nomenclature. Of course there weren't any Celts in Britain! The notion that a people would call themselves the Greek word for 'The Strangers' is laughable. IMO this is just one branch of science finally clearing away the detritus of the far more biased research of earlier centuries.

I've a fair undergraduate background in both macro and micro genetics, but I can't testify as to any of their methods used. But frankly if they're publishing in /Nature/, then it's probably on the up and up. The only thing that gives me pause is the mention that they only sampled 500,000 positions out of a genome that is usually 3 billion base pairs long. Perhaps the 'positions' are something else entirely that the science reporter didn't quite relate, but I suspect that their methods and practices are quite thoroughly well executed.

These 'relatively recent' migrations are extremely interesting to me, but I've become particularly fascinated of late with Y Dyn Unig (formerly called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lady_of_Paviland][The Red Lady of Paviland]]). It makes for an interesting read and a rather damning account of early anthropology.

Thanks very much for sharing the article. I really enjoy learning something new about this field and I look forward to reading the article in full (if I can find a copy without a journal subscription).

************** Way out of my depth ;0 the last time I studied genetics was 6th grade. I think the opening sentence is simply mentioning that Britain is famous for its royal family, not any exceptional purity of the royal family. After all, almost all the European monarchies were interrelated. I haven't studied the bibliotheca historica at all, but I can say the idea of Stonehenge being a monument to Athena has /never/ crossed my mind.

The Vikings took thralls? Like..... Incubus thralls??? Going off context here (I had no idea that was another word for slave...), I think they stuck around for the land and the fat monasteries, not necessarily the slaves. Although I did hear they settled the Orkneys pretty homogenously, from what I learned in my classes. As for the native Americans, we learned they didn't resist, so much as die off en masse? After all, the Aztecs (Incas Mayas one of the three I have no idea but I'm guessing probably not incas) took slaves from the neighbouring civilisations they absorbed. It's just I'm pretty sure they didn't do quite the same capitalistic exploitation of their slaves as the plantation owners did.\\
I think they didn't mean all of the existing populations, but from what I can tell (and guess) there were areas where Anglo-Saxons were more prevalent, and areas where they'd never set foot. It probably has to do with geography and with how violent of a response they met and how successful the resistance was. I don't think it's surprising for them to have intermarried with the people they found already living there, as long as they didn't kill them off/were killed off by them first. Also, of course, a bunch of places sharing Anglo-Saxon markers doesn't necessarily mean there can be no other differences between them. About the rest of it.... I have no idea. Over my head, as I said "" but uh, am I the only one who thinks of le chevalier d'Eon when reading about the "Red Lady"? Maybe you'll find a copy of the magazine it was published in in print and be able to read it there?

As to this I'm not entirely certain. Columbus is extremely controversial today given his history as a fervent slavery practitioner. In contrast to the large scale efforts of the early explorers, there are very few references of Natives being used in slavery post 1714. I'm currently reading Mann's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1491:_New_Revelations_of_the_Americas_Before_Columbus][1491]] and hope to know more about their very interesting inter-cultural practices once I have a greater understanding of their - surprisingly immense - terraforming inititatives.

It can't. Throughout the books it's shown to be quite limited and there are several very real limitations.

There's not a single spell or potion in canon that is shown to be even remotely capable of withstanding as much pressure as a bullet generates. If those existed they would be pretty much invulnerable against any physical threat, which they clearly aren't.

Also, that's assuming you can see the shooter before he hits you. Guns can accurately kill people from a kilometer away which is way farther than any spells can reach.

*** It feels like this shouldn't be an automatic disqualification. Lectures as a stylistic choice can be (as can their cousin flashback to how an ability was acquired just before it is used for the first and only time). Wizards being scared of Muggles is not inconceivable.

In the books things happen the way they have to happen, people act the way they have to act, magic works they way it has to work, for one reason -- to tell Harry's story. Everything hints at the shape of a greater world. Details are vague enough that the pieces we know can be made to fit together in countless different ways.

That is especially true for everything that happens in the supposed non-magical world. That is something a lot of fan-fiction-authors miss. What JK Rowling came up with is not a fantastical world that exists next to ours. What she came up with was a completely new world, inspired by ours, that also included a hidden society full of magic. It's a made up world, and thus as pliable as it has to be.

We have no objective way to predict how any muggle/wizard interaction will play out. We do know that they can't see dementors, but what do we have after that? Memory charms and obliviation? There's second hand accounts at best. Hermione talks about eventually lifting an enchantment on her parents. It doesn't say that lifting that enchantment requires magic. We know that electronics don't work if there's too much magic around. Do we know for sure that the same thing doesn't happen the other way around?

We know that witches didn't fear pyres, because they knew how to survive fire. Do they know how to survive polonium-210? Sure, polonium-210 doesn't have to exist in the Harry Potter universe. It could, though, and wizards could have reason to be scared.

There is no way for Harry to be in a healthy relationship with Draco while he consistently uses what is in effect a racial slur against his best friend. Furthermore, there is no way for said best friend to be in a healthy, reasonable relationship with Draco while he harbors such feelings. Could Harry, Draco, or even Hermione change? Absolutely, but that would require such a significant shift in the character that they would hardly be recognizable outside of their name.

Ginny is described as being small and built more like her mother (i.e., curvy).

Lily's older sister is skinny/tall, and Harry is skinny as well. So it's more likely (though not certain) that Lily was built more like her sister than like Ginny/Molly.

And honestly, I disagree with regards to recreating a relationship. There aren't a ton of parallels between Lily and Ginny's backgrounds. The most you can say is that they were both in Gryffindor and were both strong women willing to stand up for people they cared about.

And despite their physical appearances, it's implied that Harry has more in common with Lily personality-wise than James. And if Harry does not equal James, then it follows that he wouldn't chose a partner identical in personality to James'.

If anything, Harry is more the Lily to Ginny's James.

1. Fanart is made by fans, so it's in no way a perfect representation of what JKR actually intended the characters to look like. A drawing of Lavender in which the artist chooses to represent her as short with a button nose and round blue eyes does not mean that canon Lavender has blue eyes and a button nose.

2. Each artist will imagine the characters differently. You can't identify Ginny or Harry based on the shape of their nose or their cheekbones, because the shape of their nose and cheekbones depend on the artist drawing them. People will imagine characters how they want to imagine them. [[http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/6900000/Harry-and-Ginny-harry-potter-6912753-564-682.jpg][This]] person sees Ginny as very slim, highly freckled, with long bright red hair. [[http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/8800000/Harry-Ginny-harry-and-ginny-8890963-604-440.jpg][This]] person sees Ginny as being of average build with lighter/shorter/neater hair.

Just because two people share a noticeable trait does not mean they look alike. Dean and Ron are both Gryffindors described as being tall/lean, but I doubt people confuse the two.

If you had two good friends with ginger hair, and one day someone said "hey, a girl with ginger hair came by to talk to you about something," you might have a genuinely difficult time figuring out which friend it was. But that doesn't mean that they actually look alike.

I'd much rather have an author who isn't comfortable writing explicit scenes write toned down T rated stories than lemony M rated ones if they don't think they can pull off the latter.

*** I think it's possible to hint without describing it in detail. Even in the books themselves, Harry/Ginny's physical relationship is basically left up to interpretation.

However, I think I know what you're talking about. I think it's partly writer inexperience and partly writers from more conservative sexual cultures (i.e., American). But at the end of the day, these are (largely) irreligious British teenagers at boarding school in a culture where marrying young is much more commonplace.

Sex (or lack thereof) should be a topic of discussion even if it's not being described in lurid detail.

***** I think statement B often leads to statement A, but that doesn't mean that A cannot exist without B.

Marrying young is often common in places where waiting until marriage is a cultural norm, because couples are either anxious to get started or they've already started and now they feel they must get married because they're pregnant/guilty.

The cultural pressure to wait doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's attached to a religious norms about sexual purity and the sanctity of marriage. And since religion appears largely nonexistent in the wizarding world, it would follow that they are not particularly puritanical about sex.

Wizards aren't modern, but that doesn't mean they're prudish.

We tend to think of historical attitudes toward sex as becoming gradually more lenient over time, but that's not really how it works. If you went back four hundred years (which is a much closer approximation of wizarding culture than say, Victorian England), you would be surprised by how openly sexual/bawdy people were.

I think there are several reasons why marrying young is so common in the wizarding world, but one of the most important is that further education after age 17 is relatively uncommon. In the muggle world circa 2015, there are plenty of people in their early or mid twenties who are still getting their footing with regards to whole "adult" thing, and that's thought of as a very normal and natural thing. Whereas in the wizarding world, it's more like it was 70 years ago, where the vast majority of people entered the adult world at 18 and began taking on adult responsibilities like a marriage and a child. In addition, the wizarding world is relatively small and insular, so meeting one's spouse at school is certainly more commonplace and those relationships are likely seen as less frivolous because there's no university/college to interfere and distance issues are far more minor.

***** The concept of 'waiting until marriage' hasn't really been a part of British youth culture apart from with people from religious backgrounds for a long time though. Sure, people wouldn't obsess over sex or even necessarily try and have sex as soon as possible, and perhaps girls would be encouraged directly not to, but the concept of actively choosing to wait because of purity or etc. is a very American concept.

I for one had absolutely no idea that "mom" was apparently a big taboo. To me, it seems like the most obvious way to casually say "mother". That's the way I've always heard it in movies and television shows, what else is it supposed to be then?

Also the hair combed to cover a forehead scar is 'fringe', not 'bangs'; 'pants' is short for 'underpants'; 'stuffed' is best not used when describing the feeling of having overeaten; 'bloody' is the polite speech equivalent of 'goddamned'- not to be used in front of elders or officials unless you /want/ to be treated like a feckless barbarian, though it may be excusable if something heavy just crushed your toe.

That's an Americanism? I've often heard it used in that context and can't see that it'd be an issue. (Unless it's a regional thing; I've spent my entire life in southern England and East Anglia, but I know those northerners sometimes do things different.)

** Rewriting canon in chapter one. Suddenly Ron decides to disown harry as a friend, after being loyal and friendly (if jealous) for years. Harry is purposely hiding his genius so he doesn't hurt Hermione's feelings. All along she cared more about being the smart one than pushing people to their full potential. Shit like that. If you want to start a fic in year 5 with a different history than canon, fine. But please don't pretend it happened and then go retconning it because you want to write about smart harry, dumb hermione and bastard ron.

** This will sound kind of bad, but if it's obvious that a fic was written by a guy. If it's obviously by a girl, fine, if I could never guess, even better, but if I'm feeling any bro vibes, I lose interest very quickly. I mean obvious within the narrative itself. If I only know from the author's notes or profile, that doesn't matter. Some really excellent stories have male authors, and that's actually great because fanfiction is so often perceived as female-dominated.

But when I'm seeing male power fantasies and harems pop up, I'm outta there.

**** I read one fic that definitely had a bro vibe. Harry was staging mud wrestling fights and tricking his female classmates into participating, then characterizing them as really "catty" and "bitchy," getting more vicious as more clothes came off. Naturally the 100% male audience (who were also placing bets) were enthralled and loved Harry for it. Afterwards the girls' outrage at being forced to participate was totally brushed off. Harry's like, "Aw shucks, women amirite?" The story was funny and enjoyable until I just couldn't take the casual misogyny anymore.

The teenage girl vibe is also often palpable, but it can be overriden by an otherwise good story. The bro vibe leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

** If it's written in first person other than in a memory or a letter. I see first person and I'll close out of it immediately. I'm just really picky about that in general though. I'm good with Catcher in the Rye and Rivers of London first person, but it took me a while to get into Hunger Games and Divergent because the first person narration was too limiting for the author. People often seem to think it's easier writing from first person, but it kills their character development if they need to tell instead of show. Some people can pull it off, but I've read too much on the wrong end of it to try it again.

Also, for some reason, I really, really hate Harry/Ron or Draco/Ron. I prefer slash tbh, but Ron just bothers me with guys. I don't know what it is, but I think it has something to do with Ron being such a blatantly straight character in canon, that there has to be a lot of OOC alterations to pull it off. Pretty much any other character can be read as straight/gay/bi/pan etc, but Ron just doesn't work from what I've seen.

Also, if there are no breaks between paragraphs. That's just painful on the eyes.
