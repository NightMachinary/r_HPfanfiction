Anyone else do something half-stalkery/half-moronic in re: to a story of theirs?


** "I can't believe you've done this."

Yes. Yes, I do.

As soon as I discovered the Story Stats stuff, I started watching it like a hawk. Even if a few months had gone by before I'd updated again.

I don't really mind how many people like/dislike what I write, but I'm always anxious to know that it's being read in the first place, lol.

  When Harry Potter is rescued from a planet he spent centuries on alone, he's happy to find his kind still exist on their new world but he exiles himself amongst the muggles of the Federation, hunting for something. Then when his one friend amongst them is murdered, Harry contacts the one group that knows of his abilities and offers his help. For a price.
