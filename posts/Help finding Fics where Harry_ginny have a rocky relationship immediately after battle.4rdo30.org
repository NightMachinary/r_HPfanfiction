So I posted before that I'm reading and reviewing literally as many post-Battle fics as possible, with a focus on Harry and Ginny (though certainly not exclusively).

I've found hundreds of fics that have them getting back together immediately and falling into a blissful, hopelessly in love relationship that often is not portrayed realistically.

What I'd love to read more of (the few I have read I really enjoyed) are fics where Harry and Ginny either break up or don't get back together at the end of the battle, and then the story is about how they do wind up together in the end. Here are some of the criteria I am looking for:

-The fic would need to stick to canon as closely as possible. So Harry doesn't go back to Hogwarts, Ginny does become a Harpy, Fred does die, etc. This might preclude many fics written before July, 2007. -I'd love to see a story where they start out together but Harry training as an Auror and Ginny at school causes enough long-distance issues that they break up or are on the rocks. -I'd prefer Ginny and Harry not wind up dating other characters we know (so no Ginny/Draco) but it's not a deal breaker. -It's ok if the story plays with the timeline a bit. We know Ginny plays three years for the Harpies, and has James in 2004, meaning a 5 year window between when she graduates and has a kid, further meaning she likely marries Harry in 2003 at the latest. Relationship conflict does not mean the timeline has to be altered, but I'm ok if it does, so long as we aren't talking about a 50 year old Harry and Ginny getting together. I'd prefer them to be in their twenties when they reconcile, ideally.

I've read Seeking Ginny, which was written well before the series ended, and while the lack of canon-compliance is difficult to overcome, I still liked the story itself and would be fine reading similar types.

Thanks everyone!


** *In Case of Emergency*, linkffn(4625848): mostly meet your requirements, but Fred seems to be alive in this fic.

  When Harry and Ginny broke up, they thought they were each doing what was right for the other But is it possible for them to be "just friends", especially when it seems like someone keeps trying to kill them? Mature sexual themes.

**** Yes, this one I read a while ago and really enjoyed it. They hit the nail on the head for what I look for in these types of fics. Realistic in how they broke up, a murder/mystery b plotline to keep it from getting repetitive, and the ultimate reconciliation. Bit explicit which I'm fine with if it doesn't control the whole story.

** One I can think of is: "Lovers and Liars" linkffn(11301003). Though, this fic features far more than just Harry and Ginny's lives (and the two have yet to reconcile, though, I suspect it's only a matter of time).

  The war ended, but life didn't end with it, even though it sometimes felt like it had. It isn't an easy road for the survivors as they seek to heal their world. Despite everything they persevere, trying to find closure and happiness, but it's a tightrope that they walk - one that spans the gap between being a lover, or a liar. Then again, the best of us are the people who are both.

We do? I don't think anything's been said about the number of years. Where did you get this from?

*** I thought it was mentioned specifically somewhere but can't find. However, James is born 2004, meaning Ginny is pregnant in 2003 or 2004 at the latest. Rowling has mentioned, or it was mentioned in the wiki, that Ginny left quidditch to start a family.

Ginny graduated in 1999 and presumably started playing with the Harpies soon after. I assume the seasons might run concurrently to the school year since the World Cup took place in the summer, likely when the league was off season. So Ginny starts up in 1999, with the first season ending in 2000. Three seasons of play takes her up to 2002. So she either retired in 2002 or 2003. It is possible she played 4 seasons.

So nothing specifically mentions how long she played so it is certainly not off canon if a writer has Ginny spend a year abroad before trying out for the Harpies or has her quit after a year. But from what we know about Ginny and her love of quidditch, it's safe to assume she joined up soon after graduating. But you're right; it isn't explicitly mentioned.

** Hate to self advertise, but I feel like this fic I'm working on now kinda fits your idea. Ginny and Harry do get back together, but they have issues.

Still kind of rose tinted but they're also still in the honeymoon phase, once she goes off to Hogwarts and him to Auror training it won't be as perfect.

  Ginny world is turned upside down when she is forced to read the Harry Potter chapter in The Life & Lies of Albus Dumbledore. Ginny learns that after the war there are no happy endings & the truth about Harry comes out when Andromeda questions him. After all, she's read the book too, & she needs to protect Teddy. Adult themes, child abuse, PTSD. 3 one-shots.
