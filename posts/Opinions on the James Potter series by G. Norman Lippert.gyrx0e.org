I want to read a (long) Next Gen fanfic, and I was wondering what people thought about the James Potter series by G. Norman Lippert. Is it good? Or would you recommend another Next Gen series instead?


** Just saw this. It's worth reading, definitely a far above-average fic, but not near the top of my favorites list.

There's a very intriguing political conflict in this book that's well thought out; it always irks me when Harry's legacy goes untarnished through next gen fics, and this notion is challenged in this series. I loved most of the characters except for Petra Morganstern and James himself. I thought Lippert wasted enormous potential to develop Harry's character into something really interesting, but he came across as super flat.

The plot is decent for a fanfic, a bit transparent and YA-ey especially considering the pretty significant emotional weight of the series. The pacing of the books is a bit questionable, much of the conflict is weighted toward the middle of a volume and he has trouble keeping attention until the end. There's a two-year jump somewhere in the series that also feels kind of awkward, and the ending is not very rewarding.

I'll give you some next-gen recs in tiers below, ordered within the tier. All these are on FFN except for Lippert.

Tier 1: Stygian Trilogy by Slide

Tier 2: Albus Potter series by Vekin87, James Potter series by Lippert, Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom, Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity

Tier 3: Fabula Post Bellum by Maverick.Heart, Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake by sheriff1985, The Chronicle of Halo Wiggins by Benedict Dragonpatch, The Belmont Legacy by Noralesong

*** Hey, thanks for this great response. I was tempted to give up the (first) book, but it's gotten more interesting. It's good enough to take seriously, but when you take it seriously there are details that seem a bit off, not like something JKR would write. Still, a strong effort. I'll make sure to check your tier 1 recommendation.

** It's been awhile since I read it, and I only read the first few books, but I remember neing amazed at how well the author captured the voice of a school child and the feel of canon magic. It is a delightful series but be warned, the writing quality is far better than your average fic so you may find it hard to return to other fanfiction.
