Flipper is a desktop application that automates the process of searching through other people's favourite lists on fanfiction.net by automagically finding favourite lists similar to yours and creating a merged stream of recommended fanfics from these lists. It further lets you filter, exclude fics and fandoms to further narrow down the recommendations and track your reading.

Current version: [[https://github.com/Zeks/flipper/releases/latest]]

Manual: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAquRcfpKMQQGEBKUeszk9o9_czIPQ7sysgqXtwcnkI/edit?usp=sharing]]

it looks like this: [[https://imgur.com/Tgyl10H]]

Updates since last version posted on the sub:

1.  Flipper can now read your whole favourites instead of just 500 displayed by FFN.
2.  Flipper now displays how up to date its fic database is on the bottom left. When the date there changes - it's time to regenerate recommendations.
3.  Finetuned recommendations a bit to better narrow down to user preferences.
4.  Introduced the initial setup window so that user enters the main window with recommendation already displayed.
5.  Tooltips everywhere. And I mean /everywhere/. Added back/forward navigation between searches that also restores filtering states.
6.  A bunch of bugfixes everywhere but mostly on rarely used paths.
7.  Flipper wil now periodically backup your database to AppData/Roaming/Flipper. If it gets broken somehow you will be asked to restore.
8.  A new "spoiler" quick tag.
9.  Rec Count sorting mode is now called Metascore.
10. (arguably) better new recommendation list creation UI

There's a fair bit more but it's too long for this post so you can find it in changelogs folder. In general though: more or less everything has tooltips now. Just hover the mouse over the elements to see what stuff does.

*[!ATTENTION!]* This version introduces incompatible protocol changes so the older clients will no longer work. If you want to use Flipper you have to download this version.

Feedback should be directed to Flipper's discord server: [[https://discord.gg/wX68gBW]]


** It sounds really interesting! Are you planning on creating a version for MacBooks?

*** It should be fairly trivial since the code is cross platform but I don't have a macbook to compile on. So the version will materialize as soon as someone appears to compile it for a Mac.Meanwhile people have been using it through WINE, but I have conflicting reports of whether it actually works there

**** I can try to get it compiled for macos when I get some free time, no promises though. I've barely done anything with qt so if I run into a problem it's not likely I'll be able to work through it quickly

** Is there a guide for how to actually launch it? I download it and extract the zip and there are just a bunch of files and I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this is a really dumb question
