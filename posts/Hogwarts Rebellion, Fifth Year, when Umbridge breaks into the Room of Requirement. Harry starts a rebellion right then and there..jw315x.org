***** That might be so, and could be enough to make things go sideways but then again, if you were doing the magical lordships and more politically based story line, The fact that so many heirs, probably from different political blocks/factions banded together and putting aside family obligation grudges and straight up feuds to take down one "person" would raise enough of a political uproar that even Fudge's anti-Dumbledore spiel would be drowned out entirely.

And then again, the fact that kids are being tortured, should be enough to get the people riled up enough so that the government really couldn't do anything to suppress or mitigate the damages. Pretty sure the possibility of being lynched is enough that a person's survival instincts kick in to the point that politics really don't matter anymore. Throwing Umbridge under the knight bus would be the best hope for Fudge at that point which would still allow him if he was cleaver to keep his position and keep on with his anti-Dumbles crusade

** The sound of cracking came again, and the sound reverberated through the walls, the first crack appeared on the mirrors.

"Harry?"

Harry turned to Neville, who was looking at him with a concerned and somewhat fearful expression.

"I think the gig is up, lads." Seamus said.

"Must be Umbridge and her Squad of Morons." one Hufflepuff said.

"More like Squad of Cun-"

Another crack interrupted Fred before Hermione could.

"So, do we surrender?" A Ravenclaw asked, turning to Harry, others soon followed him and Harry found himself gazing back at the mixture of concern, fear, and terror of the DA.

He knew what Umbridge was capable of, and that those that supported her could just as cruel, he looked at Colin's bandaged hand, and thought of his own pain.

Harry wasn't dumb, a group of armed wizards practicing combat magic in secret, he knew exactly how Umbridge and the Ministry would paint this, and the name, Dumbledore's Army, how could they have been so dumb.

Another blast and now dust fell from the ceiling and lights flickered, the mirrors had broke and the crack on the wall was much bigger, it would be at any time now.

And for some reason, Harry remembered his history lessons from Muggle school, on WWII and Germany, and with a speed he was only accustomed to see when he was in danger, he drew parallels between what was happening. What Umbridge was doing, he couldn't let that happen and they would have to stop her themselves, the teachers and Dumbledore were useless.

All this took a few moments, but many saw Harry's face harden in determination.

"Wands up! Like we practiced. We will fire on my command!"

Hermione's eyes widened, "Harry! What are you doing!? We can't ju-"

"We /have/ to Hermione! Can't you see what she's going to do to everyone here?"

"But she's with the Ministry! The government!"

"So were the Nazis, you read about that right?"

Hermione reached the same conclusion as his did, and she paled, before steeling herself.

The older students went to the front, along with, strangely, Susan Bones, who whispered to Hannah before nodding to Harry, "I studied Muggle history too, Harry. Auntie made sure of it."

Fred and George flanked the trio, Ron was pale, but nodded with determination nonetheless.

Another blast and Harry saw parts of the wall had already fallen, he idly noticed the edges reforming, but not fast enough.

"Alright, this is it, we know what Umbridge wants, and we knew what she would do if we were found, anyone that doesn't want to fight can go to the back of the room.

Harry was more than a little round when, after exchanging glances, everyone, even if some were shaking, positioned themselves around the door.

"We are with you, Harry!"

"Let's kick their arses!"

"Always wanted to hex that toad!"

"Let's see if her death eater minions can put their galleons where their mouths are!"

Harry felt himself getting worked up, his muscles getting ready for action, his magic flowing.

*** "Wands up!"

Almost as one, the DA raised their wands. He could still see some trembling but most were determined, and Harry guessed most were kind of expecting this to happen.

They finally heard the odious voice say, with the same sacharrine tone, but with an undertone of cruelty.

"Bombarda Maxima."

"Shields!"

The wall exploded, but the dust did not reach them, instead.

"Aspiro!" Hermione shouted while waving her wand in an intricate motion, and a wall of wind raised in front of them and pushed the dust back, eliciting many shouts of surprise from those that were outside, who began coughing and sneezing.

After a moment of surprise at the clever use of the spell, Harry decided to act.

"Fire!"

Suddenly a dozen red spells left their wands, some impacted the wall but others hit their mark as they heard others shouts of surprise and the sound of people falling on the ground.

"What's this, Rebellion! I knew it!"

There were some return spells but the older students on the front blocked them with their shields or even deflected them back.

"Again!Fire!"

Now almost every member of the DA fired a stunner, more than doubling the amount of red bolts, and with the dust almost settling almost all of them hit.

When it finally did, they saw only four people standing Umbridge, covered in dust and with a furious and scared expression on her face, two Slytherin upper years, and Malfoy, who was hiding behind one of them. All looking more than a bit bedazzled and with shields in front of them.

Before Harry could order them to fire again, Hermione stepped forward, "Surrender! It's over!"

Umbridge turned to her, wand raised, even more furious, "How dare you! Little Mudblood! I will put you in your place! Cru-"

She moved her wand, but Susan was faster, stepping forward with a murderous expression.

"Fulgur Hasta!" she stabbed her wand forward like a sword and a spear of yellow gold lighting was launched out of it with a crack of thunder.

Umbridge's shield broke like glass and she was launched back to the wall with a scream, falling down to the ground, twitching, and smoking.

"Bloody Hell!

The two older Slytherins took a moment to react, shocked by the brutality of it, the same situation most of the DA was in. The one in front of Malfoy sneered and twirled his wand.

"Avada-"

But Harry, Fred, and George were faster, the Twins launched a blue spell with a simultaneous shout of "Arietes!" one for each upper year, shattering their shields, Harry hit the attacking one with a Stunner and with a second spell hit the second at the same time Ron's own stunner did.

Malfoy was cowering and looking around at all his fallen comrades with terror.

"Y-You, you can't do that! My F-"

"Stupefy!" the spell hit him with such force he too hit the wall and crumbled, unconscious.

Everyone turned to Neville, who was still holding his wand firmly. He looked at them, a bit of his nervousness returning, "What? I can't bloody stand when he goes on like that! And he still had a wand."

There were some chuckles, before Ron turned to Susan, "That spell was wicked! Where did you learn it? Why didn't we practice here?"

Susan blushed at all the eyes turned to her, she looked a bit winded"My Aunt taught me, for... emergencies, and well..." she gestured to the unconscious group outside the room, almost everyone nodded.

Fred and George also chipped in, with Fred saying, "The same thing for us, Dad taught us that one." His brother nodded in confirmation.

Hermione was looking around more than a bit bewildered at not only how blas√© Umbridge had been at using an Unforgivable on her, but also how quick the other students were to fire back against a government official.

"Well, it's done now, what's the next step, Harry?"

Harry looked surprised at being asked, but before he could complain, the look on Hermione's face made he think better, '/I did put us in this mess, I guess'/

/"/Well..." he looked around to see if anyone had an idea, but they all looked back at him expectantly.

"Okay, let's...talk to Dumbledore and..." he looked to Umbridge, who was still smoking, but also breathing, "Take Umbridge and her toadies to the Hospital Wing, I guess."

Hermione huffed but nodded, Harry turned to Fred and George, who nodded before taking Lee Jordan and the Gryffindor Chasers to begin levitating the unconscious people in the hallway.

"What about the other Slytherins?" One Ravenclaw asked.

Harry thought for a moment, "Go to the Heads of your Houses, they will know what to do, we are going to talk to Dumbledore, and now he will have to act.

With nods, the DA moved to continued their "rebellion."

***

Dumbledore didn't look that surprised when they revealed the existence of the DA, but was very much so when they told him about Umbridge and Harry saw Dumbledore truly furious for the first time.

***

Minerva, Filius, Pomona, and Aurora, arrived at the Dungeons to a weird, but not surprising (according to Aurora, the only one who was a Slytherin) scene, all the more "suspicious" Slytherins were bound and gagged in the middle of the common room, surrounded by other students, mostly those who were half-bloods and of foreign origin, but amount them were also Blaise Zabini, Tracy Davies, Daphne, and Astoria Greengrass and surprisingly Hestia and Flora Carrow.

"Good evening, Professors, our housemates started getting a bit too agitated and we had to take steps to, protect ourselves, know that Slytherin House is with Hogwarts, always."

Minerva McGonagall looked around the scene, her eyes stopping on Tracy Davis who was polishing her nails while supporting her feet on one of the bound students.

"I see."

***

Professor Snape was "captured" so he could "convince" Dumbledore he had nothing to do with it and that the Dark Lord had nothing to do with Umbridge torturing the students.

***

That same evening, Minister Fudge was surprised in his office when he opened the door to see Albus Dumbledore, Amelia Bones, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Rufus Scrimgeour there, accompanied by other witches and wizards, among them Aurors, Wizengamot members, and some parents from Hogwarts students, all with their wands in hand and not looking friendly. He noticed Dumbledore was holding (more like almost crushing actually) a black quill inside of a piece of cloth.

"W-What is the meaning of this?" he asked deciding to forego any posturing.

Dumbledore looked at him, and the Minister of Magic(if he still held the post) found himself taking a step back, the expression was neutral but the eyes were cold and sharp, the light blue looked to be glowing, and /definitely/ not twinkling.

"Good Evening, Cornelius."

Cornelius Fudge had been a politician long enough to know that tone meant he was fucked.

Well, he thought to himself, at least if You-Know-Who is truly back(he must be if Dumbledore resorted to this) then he is fucked too if Dumbledore is looking like that at /him/.

** "Expelliarmus!" Harry's spell came first, disarming Umbridge as Hermione, Ron and other members took care of the Inquisitorial Squad.

Just as the professor's wand was flying away, another expelliarmus hit the woman, just seconds after his. This one came from Neville, and what happened next stun everyone to their places.

"Oh by Merlin!" It seemed like the expression had come out of Hannah Abbott, and it was totally valid, because the scene before him left Harry speechless.

Dolores Umbridge was curled on the floor, crying in pain after the second disarming spell reached her. Her very underpants had seemed to explode and now there were massive amounts of blood between her legs.

Harry turned to Neville, "Neville, Neville, What did you do?!"

But poor Neville was stunned in his place. He was pale and looking in shook at what he had just done.

Hermione was paralyzed, her had on her mouth as Ron seemed about to get sick.

"It can't be..." Cho whispered.

Everyone had stopped fighting, even the Slytherins. All eyes were on Umbridge who was bleeding up. Everything would go awfully wrong if she died, and they needed to know what had happened.

"What did that clumsy boy did now?!" Terry Boot asked.

"He blasted her bits away, that's what!" George yelled.

"Way to go!" Zacharias Smith shouted, but his triumph was cut short by Harry's hard look.

He didn't have time for Zacharis though. He needed to fix this, and soon.

"Neville, what di you do?" he repeated, this time shaking him.

"I-I-..."

"NEVILLE!"

That seemed to bright him back. "Nothing! Expelliarmus, as you taught us..."

"Then why... I don't get it..."

Umbridge barely raised her head from the puddle of blood to look at Harry. "You troll head. You don't get it? I didn't have a wand anymore. Your first spell made sure of that."

"Expelliarmus doesn't do this!"

"You don't get it Mr Potter." the professor said barely able to pronounce her last words, "It disarmed me. I use sex as a weapon."

Then the woman fell to the floor.

The silence extended for what seemed like forever.

"What the fuck?!" Ernie shouted.

Then, they realized their professor was not dead yet. She raised her head, blood spilling out of her mouth. "I used this weapon with your friend, Mr Lupin. He helped me get dirt on Dumbledore... that sexy Half-breed."

The woman collapsed again.

"Lupin?" Ron said, "Bloody hell! He had been shagging---"

"Ron!" Hermione stopped him.

"She did though," added Ernie.

Once they had time to process that, the Slytherins returned to themselves.

"You so did it this time! Pottah!" yelled Malfoy.

Before Harry could answer or even process what had just went on, Umbridge raised her head once more. And everyone gasped in horror.

"Your father heard about it too, Mr Malfoy, " said the professor, "My little weapon. Hope yours is not as pale and small as his."

The DA laughed. "I wouldn't laugh if I were you Mr Corner. I did your father too, at the same time than Miss Patil's.", her head went down.

"Is she for real...?!" Fred added.

Then Umbridge raised her head again, causing more gasps.

"Oh sweet merlin!" Lavender Brown complained, more annoyed than surprised this time.

"Shut up you impertinent bimbo," said Umbridge, "I did your father too, and uncle, and grandfather.... and mother. She has a birthmark on her left butt cheek... in the shape of a troll's bugger."

Lavender looked shocked.

"Stop that laugh Mr Crabbe and Mr Goyle!" UMbridge yelled, terrifying the boys. "I did not shag your parents," that seemed to relax the boys, but only briefly, "They were too busy doing one another."

Laughs erupted as UMbridge hit the floor again.

Everyone stood on their places for very long, staring at the body of Umbridge on the floor. Waiting, and then waiting more, and then some. Still, she didn't raise.

"Is that it?" Justin Finch-Fletchley asked.

Harry turned to Ron, who shrugged.

"Thank Merlin," said Marietta.

Then they waited more.

Harry sighed at last.

And she rose.

"Someone kill her already!"

Umbridge turned to Harry, "I did Hagrid as well. Big Hairy bum, that one."

And Dolores Umbridge fell again. tens of wands pointed at her, waiting. But she rose no more. She died, with the ghost of her last kinky laugh drawn on her face.

****** A thirty-year-old Rose Weasley stormed into her old house in a hurry. She was out of options, she knew it was forbidden but she didn't have anyone else to go to.

Once inside, she hurried upstairs. She knew it was October, so no one in Hogwarts age would be around. When she opened the bedroom door, she was shocked aplenty, for suddenly completely destroying the timeline didn't seemed as the worst of things anymore.

"Oh my god!!" she shouted as she stepped backwards. Trying to ignore the grunts and moans.

The naked bum in front of her stumbled and fall on the side of the bed, "Who the hell!!!??" her father shouted.

"Oh god, oh god, oh god.... that didn't happened, that didn't happened!" Rose forced her eyes shut as she looked away, trying to obliviate herself into unconsciousness. Yet she couldn't. Even with her eyes closed all that she could see was her father's sweaty bum going at it. All that she hear was her mother's hurried yells.

"Who are you and what are you doing here?!" Rose's mother shouted. She had hurried to cover herself with a sheet and had her wand firmly pointed at her now. She was panting and her hair had never been more tangled.

Rose raised her hands, and very slowly turned the lights on. Trying to stop herself from seeing any more flesh.

"R-Rose?!" her mother said, "But... you're supposed to be in school, and..."

"Way younger, I know." Rose said pulling a golden chain out of her shirt.

"A TIME TURNER?! But what did you do?!" her mother frowned. With the lights on, she could see the scared face of her father, who had his wand now, as well as a pillow over his lower half. Not that Rose hadn't seen way more than she wanted of that already.

"What did I do?! I travelled through time by accident and don't know how to get back. What were YOU doing?!"

"Er... shagging?"

"Ron!" Rose's mother said, her face way redder.

"What? Is our house? Can't we go freely at it at our bedroom now?"

Rose huffed, "I just came at a random time, expecting you seeing the telly or something, which is what I imagined you did while I was at Hogwarts and I happened to find you like... like this...? That's just my bad luck."

"Not bad luck, just the odds. When we're at home and you're at Hogwarts, we're usually here...!"

"Ron! Too much information!" Rose's mother gritted between teeth, then turned to her daughter, "We... we'll help you, Rose. I'm really sorry you saw that, but you can't really blame us... it's just that..."

Rose looked at her surprised, were they really at it that often, they must be on their late thirties at this time. "What? You have fun here five times a week whenever Hugo and I were away, oh don't mind me. I understand."

"Four times a week," her mother said without thinking.

"Seven," her father added.

"Ron! Okay, seven." her mother sighed.

"Some days twice." her father added with a stupid smile, and got a pillow thrown at him.

"Oh, why did I even asked?!" Rose complained.

"Come on Rosie, everyone is inside! And me and your mother have some good--"

"Don't you dare finish that sentence... and don't "Rosie" me when you're starkers!" Rose said, then noticed something, "Everyone inside?"

"Yes, Rose, there's a pandemic going outside. People at both governments are looking into it." said her mother.

"So it's 2020? 2021?"

"2020,"

"Oh, the first year of the pandemic, okay."

"FIRST!!!?" both of her parents yelled.

"Yeah, plenty of things you don't know. Like me marrying Scorpius, or the Canons finally winning the league."

Her father jumped in joy, letting the pillow fall, "The canons! when? how many wins? Who was the coach?!.... wait... Scorpius?!"

"Dad! The pillow!"

"Oh, yes, sorry."

"We'll help you Rose, with every thing. Just wait for us downstairs and we'll be down in 5 minutes." said her mother.

"Or twenty..."

"Ron... we're not going to..."

"We we're in the middle of something here, and she has a Time-Turner, why didn't she arrived an hour later?"

Rose throw him a menacing look.

"OKay, OKay, 5 minutes," Ron said with a snort.

Rose made for the door and accidentally kicked a jar. "Oh, sorry... I'll pick it up, wait... honey?" turned to look at her parents confused.

"It was for later... your mother likes that." Rose's father said, and her mother looked away guiltily, her shoulders and face turning crimson.

"Ugh!!!" Rose complained as she put the honey away with disgust and exited the bedroom. Halfway through the stairs, she noticed that there was some honey on her fingers. "You better have not used this jar yet!" she screamed.

** Alright, I want all of their wands off of them and over there. Hermione, Padma, chairs. Transfigure us some so we can put them somewhere. Neville, Ron, I want them bound up and tied in them, they don't move unless we say they can.

Everyone else, wands on them AT ALL TIMES. They so much as */twitch/* you Stun them again.

What do you mean, 'now what?!' We tell Dumbledore and anyone who asks, that they attacked us. Not only is it not technically wrong, it's also our word against there's. They may not listen to *ME* but they can't dismiss all of you.

And on top of that, the only people who'd jump to their defence are sat in those chairs too.

We've got this D.A.
