  Mirrors are funny things. They show us what we are, what we were, and what we could have been. When Harry and Haley Potter look into the mirror and see each other, a connection is forged that will see their destinies intertwined.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  A fallen rose, a green angel imprisoned in ivy, the amber eyes of an owl. By a dark edict of fate, a dying Harry awakens not in the afterlife, but in a time and place where someone else bears the scar: the 15 year-old Elise Potter. The Girl Who Lived.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

*** I remember this story! It was the one where the other characters feel attracted by the fact that, unlike the males of their universe, Harry Potter was clearly born into being a true Alpha Male.

In fact, I'm pretty sure that was an actual line in the story.

**** Not completely. It was a gender swap that was also a role swap. So Harry, coming from another universe, and the women of this world, had inherent aggressiveness, while the other men were closer to our universe women.

I don't know if it makes sense, but it was an interesting story.

22 years old Harry Potter goes to an alternate universe where there is a girl who lived (Rose Potter) and appears near her in her fourth year. And somehow he is de-aged to his pre-'final battle' self (approx. 16-17yo, no battle scars etc.). Harry/fem!Harry pairing. Incest in a whole new level. T rated.

PS. Last few chapters are not as good as the first ones but still not bad. Also it's completed. 120k
