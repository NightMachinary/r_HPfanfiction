What are your favourite fanfic parodies?

--------------

Ok this is a discussion and also kinda self promotion. I co-wrote this with my late brother when I was 14 and he was like 12. I lost the original email access(defunct email) and can't log in. It's ripe with typos and unfinished but the voice of it is just so Jord (my dead bro). He had so much comedic eccentric essence.

My brother died two years ago as of Feb 13th, so I am feeling nostalgic.

Anyways I think the story has potential as a PARODY and I would love to colab with someone to rewrite and extend it possibly.

"Harry Potter and the other Two Kids" on fanfiction.net under an old username maykitty11.

Also sorry if I broke any rules.

Also if it's super bad I'd like an honest opinion. Remember kids wrote it.

Thanks!


** I really like the tone of the fic; it's what makes most parodies entertaining so it has a lot of potential for a great rewrite right there. The starting premise has a ton of room for hilarious scenarios to appear and I think you can make a really fun fic out of the idea.

  When a Magical game of Truth & Dare goes wrong, the Gryffindor Quidditch team must 'bare' up and face the consequences. And as the news spreads like wildfire in mmail things get quite out of control.
