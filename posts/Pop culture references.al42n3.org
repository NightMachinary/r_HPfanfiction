Some fics use them really well to establish the time period, develop the characters and add some humour, but sometimes it's obvious that the author namedrops their favourite books/movies/bands just for the sake of it.

I like when Snape or Sirius are listening to some classic rock, but reading about Harry becoming a fan of some modern band is cringeworthy 9 times out of 10, even if I like it myself. Harry or Hermione reading Tolkien? No reason why they can't, but after seeing it dozens of times, I wish they'd pick something else. Muggleborns and Half-Bloods quoting movies can be fun, but only in moderation.

So, pop culture references: how much is too much? What are the best and worst ways you've seen them used in fics? Do you prefer subtle references or Harry in full-on nerd mode?


** I've read a few fics where Dean Thomas keep making Muggle pop culture references that nobody else gets, referencing things like Star Wars and Monty Python. That's pretty much the level of pop culture refs I like.

**** Right, because it would make perfect sense for students who have in all likelihood not had a great deal of exposure to Muggle culture to /not/ get references to Muggle pop culture. Like, Harry and probably Hermione would get them, but definitely not, for instance, Ron "is /Cinderella/ an illness?" Weasley.

***** Hermione would be more likely to get them than Harry, I don't get the impression he spends his little free time watching TV. Culturally he is sort of a clean slate, because even though the magical world lacks some sense, it is more accessible to him.

** As with anything, I think it's a matter of how it's done and why. I love references if they are done right, personally.

A few general pitfalls --

Time period: I think this comes through a lot with the trio's generation, when they like "recent" music (and authors conveniently ignore the fact that these books were set in the 90s. Recent then = now classic). Do some research. A lot of readers have eagle eyes for this stuff and it's a quick way to take you out of the author's world.

Self-Insert: it's super tempting to make your favorite character like what you like. This is where I think it's important that a reference has a reason (even if it's a something as simple as "X likes rock and not ballads because he's /edgy/" or whatever).

Personality: Snape and Sirius might each like rock but they'd approach it differently at different time periods. At Hogwarts, Snape wanted to associate with purebloods and Slytherin, so he'd probably like wizard rock. Maybe he grew from that as an adult and he turned his back on the Death Eaters. Or maybe he did like muggle music because of Lily and can't bring himself to like anything else. Sirius, meanwhile, probably loved muggle rock for all the inverse reasons as Snape. And the lucky bastard grew up in the golden age of it. He also had close muggle born friends and lived in London; it was easy for him to come by. But then if he listened to music after Azkaban, did it trigger him? Would he listen to anything new, or was it an auditory reminder that he was in jail for so long, musical styles had time to develop around him?

You can do a lot with pop culture references if it's not just a throwaway plug to your favorite band.

(As a side note: I have such a strong head canon that Sirius enjoyed Bowie, Zeppelin and the other 70s rock gods that Rowling herself could tell me "no" and I would still reject it outright.)

*** I totally agree, especially on Sirius' music taste.

Snape, I think, still listened to Muggle music, even if he was pretending not to when trying to fit in with purebloods. I really wanted to have him listen to The Clash in one of my fics, but the year was wrong (his 6th). But I totally see him listening to some post-punk later on, Joy Division sounds right up his alley.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15842229/chapters/40771931]]) i really enjoyed chapter 29 of this Luna/Hermione fic where they discuss space jam and Hermione admits to somewhat fancying Lola bunny which makes Ginny lose it as the idea of that anyones fancied a cartoon rabbit is hilarious to her. It really tickled me and was so 90s and fit the time period very well. Also harry refrences using his cloak to sneak into the ciniema to watch independence day haha

** It worked in a kind of Gamer,otaku,troll!Harry fic but 3 out of 5 times it was cringy or too obvious , so it has to be well done or not at all.

One of the things that make me drop fics immediately is when authors think I'll google whatever band they are using in a scene.

Something like; your MC is sad and looking at the moon or something equally sappy while humming whatever ( hate it even more when they put the name of the band and song in a parentesis lol) or Fight scene! Better recommend some music! Fucking no dude!

​

To me, music don't work on fics and that's it. It does in manga, weirdly enough.

And please, I've only seen this a couple of times but DON'T WRITE THE FUCKING OPENING IN YOU FIC, WTF?!

** Personally I like it. It gives the fics a more realistic feel since, legally, published authors can't do that of course.

I even highly enjoy fics that make use of pop culture as part of the plot. For example, Harry developing spells and abilities he learned from muggle fantasy novels he read at the library while hiding from the Dursleys.

It's also fun when fics introduce muggle movies and other media to pureblood children.

In my headcanon Hermione is obsessed with Doctor Who and will lament the fact that it's been cancelled to anyone who would listen. She found the movie interesting but still disappointing.

Dumbledore absolutely adored Tolkein's works and took inspiration to how he looks from Gandalf, by wearing long flowing robes, a wide brimmed wizards hat and a long white beard. He even visited Tolkien personally in the guise of a muggle and talked to him for several hours about magic in a hypothetical sort of way.

** Well, there are really two kinds of pop-culture references. There's the ones that the characters get as references in-universe (i.e. Harry & Hermione reading /The Lord of the Rings/, the Creevey Brothers quoting from /Star Wars/). But there's also references that only the reader is supposed to get, woven into the worldbuilding (i.e. one of Voldemort's ancestor was named Morgoth Gaunt, Dumbledore says a line that's a variation of something Obi-Wan Kenobi said).

The former are overdone, though they can as you say help set the time period. But I really don't mind the latter: they're a plus for whoever gets them but just feel like more background worldbuilding for everyone else, so everybody wins.

That's a good point, I didn't think of those kind of oblique kind of references. Those can be nice. 99% percent of the time it's just the annoying in your face "DAE seen the gem cult movie The Matrix?!?!" kind of references that make me groan.

Those can be great! I was so excited once to see Sirius offhandedly mentioning his distant squib cousin Bernard Black who owns a bookshop that it's my headcanon now that /Black Books/ exists in the same universe as HP.

** I hate when people go overboard with the 90s cliches. I am the same age as Harry's generation. I graduated high school in ‘99, and I still remember what we wore, listened to, did for fun, etc. If you want an example of “these are 90s kids” done wrong, watch Everything Sucks on Netflix. It tries too hard to hit you over the head with the 90s-ness of it all that every character ends up in flannel and drinking Surge cola. Please don't do that in fics unless it's a crack fic.

*** It wasn't all flannel. Some people wore neon and starter jackets. Some people were goth (the embodiment of the 90s look to me is a chick with black lipstick, a black plastic choker probably bought at Claire's, chunky doc Martin's, in a black spaghetti strap top and black-on-darker black plaid skirt with a few too many aestheticly placed safety pins)

Also, don't forget pop groups. At least /one/ character, statistically, would have had a Spice Girls poster over their bed in school.

** Almost anything is too much. I'll allow for one Star Wars reference, because that has almost become a staple of the HP fanfic genre ("Harry or Hogwarts students watch Star Wars for the first time").

If I want to watch a movie, I'll watch a movie, I don't care about your characters recapping their favorites. If I want to listen to music, I listen to music that I actually enjoy, I don't care about authors shoehorning in their favorite tracks. Just no. Focus on Harry Potter and its world please. It ruins my immersion to have Harry buy an *shuffles cards* Ipod so that he can listen to his favorite rapper *shuffles* TuPac.

*** I'm usually fine with it as long as it's either Classic Who or the fic takes place during a time period in which New Who was actually aired.

For example having them discuss the 9th or 10th Doctor in a fic set in the 1990's would just be completely wrong because the 9th Doctor didn't even exist until the series reboot aka New Who in 2005.

** Not a pop culture (or fanfiction-related per se), but I'm still amused by the fact that both the Dumbledore tombstone in Godric's Hollow and that of the Potters have Biblical scriptures quoted on them (IIRC from the Gospel of Matthew and either 1 or 2 Corinthians, respectively. Can't remember the exact Scripture.)

That's how you do something like that right, IMO. A subtle little thing that makes it a bit fun to read, without necessarily beating you over the head with it.
