I was thinking about Albus and Gellert's views and goals as teenagers. Thinking of muggles and inferior beings and that magical beings should rule over them as their superiors. This made me think of this idea. Rather than the canon paths of the two, they retain that level of intimate closeness and friendship strained by differences in views regarding the future of magical and non magical interactions, both consider the fall of the statute of secrecy inevitable. Gellert takes a Magneto style of view, that magicals are inherently superior and that muggles will fear and seek to destroy them when this happens. Albus takes a Professor X style of view, that magicals and muggles are different in abilities, but are equals, and that the strong should protect and help the weak.

Gellert thinks that the only way to ensure the survival of magical people is to break the statute under his terms, which include taking control of the muggle world, (through various plots such as imperious curse on world leaders, all out war, etc). Albus think that the best course of action is to ease relationships through efforts to show the positive sides of magic, such as magical clinics open to muggles, and teams to prevent the abuse of muggles by magicals.

â€‹

In many ways this isn't that different from canon, but I think it would be a really fun interpretation to read. Order of the Phoenix as the X Men, Grindelwalds army as the Brotherhood of Mutants. The breaking of the statute of secrecy would obviously be a major plot point, either as the goal of Grindelwald that Dumbledore stops, or something that succeeds and they both have to deal with the consequences of.


** Here's a fic that might fit your prompt: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17541269/chapters/41333240][before they convinced you life is war]]

Harry wakes up in an alternate universe where it's mutants vs. mundanes instead of wizards vs. muggles. In the backstory of the alternate universe Grindelwald and Dumbledore fill the roles of Magneto and Professor X respectively, and the members of the Order fill the role of the X-Men using Dumbledore's privately funded school as their base of operations.

** I was under the impression their canon dynamic was already very similar to it.

If Dumbledore was interpreted by Patrick Stewart, he would've defeated Tom in the Fifth Book while making a rousing speech against bigotry at the same time.

And one of the DADA Teachers would have been interpreted by John De Lancie and would annoy him to no end.

He would also call Minerva his Number One, much to her annoyance and confusion.
