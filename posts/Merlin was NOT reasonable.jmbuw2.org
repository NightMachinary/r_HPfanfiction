Ah, muggleborns... They come into our world in droves, all sparkly-eyed an bushy-haired, awed by simple tricks and all happy to be a part of secret society, to be special. Some, they consider magic to be some unreachable ideal, something incomprehensible... And so they fail to learn much, because as anyone who has ridden a broom can tell, magic responds to the esires of the user. It is not always obvious, but someone who convinces themselves that magic is something alien, other, will themselves rejected. If they believe they can't learn, they won't...

Others, they think our world is just a reflection of theirs, if older. Perhaps even primitive, some sneer when they think we do not see, do not hear... We do, and we remember. But it is always somewhat amusing when they learn something obvious to us, andthey can't reconcile it with the image they've build of the reality.

One such thing is the borders. African Union of Arcana, a prosperous nation spanning half a continent. Thousand Villages In The Mist, an alliance of Chinese city-states... They look at the borders, and they boggle, for what they see is nothing like they expected. Then they ask about the colors, and we laugh.

The British Isles are marked in royal blue. There are a far few more than muggles think, with only the largest and most populated uncovered in their entirety. There are some yellow dots, and orange markers, outlining small countries independent from any control. And then there are swathes of sky blue, covering most of the world. The Avalon Pact. The great British empire.

Former?, they ask and we laugh again, though there is little humour there. No.

In the end, it comes down to one man. He is not known as a Dark Lord for one reason only - it was war. It's been going for years, with invaders trying to conquer the isles.... And then he appeared. Somehow, they managed to poke the slleping dragon, and so they tasted the flame. The costly victories of the invaders turned to crushing defeats. His magic like nothing they've seen. A force of nature, a god in flesh, come to scorch the lands. In the end, they did the only thing they could. They surrendered, hoping to salvage something, to negotiate peace...

They came to the negotiating table together. All the warlcks and sorcerers of thirteen nations, each an army unto themselves. They hoped they could talk, present an united front and save themselves. He did not wish to talk.

He came alone, in his work robe and leaning on a simple, wooden staff. When asked for terms, he answered them: "Submit."

In the end, there was little they could do but obey. The oaths and treaties made on that day bind them even now. Magics hold strong even now.

We have never called upon them. The Choosing Stone, the anchor, lies buried in a sealed off cave below the city of Londinum. We try to pact and appease our neighbors, give back tribute we receieve as gifts... We could rule the world... But there is no one quite so foolish to lay their hand upon the stone and invoke the magics. After all, it would be not only them that were judged.... And who could meet the standards of Merlin?

Muggles say "oh, God" and "by the devil's warty arse". We say "Merlin". It suffices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I'd like to see a fic with a less politically correct Merlin (or other such personage) perfectly willing to throw their power around. Also, it tickles my fancy to have the British in a one-nation MAD doctrine, and trying desperately to keep diplomacy at least lukewarm, but that's less important. Merlin, Dumbledore, Harry... I'd like to see scenes where a powerful wizard listens to opposition bluster, then says "No." Without getting emotional, without becoming invested, and most certainly not bending over backwards to accomodate his enemies. I mean, honestly, it takes a certain state of mind to look at reality and tell it to kiss your arse. It is not a state most conducive to compromise.

Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus - I'd like to see that.


** This is some really interesting worldbuilding, I hope someone writes a fic based on this. I don't think I've seen a single fic that has a Magical British Empire equivalent to the historical one.

** I think I saw an one-shot (probably part of a collection) that did something along those lines from the goblin's perspective - in short the power of the goblins was more along the lines of a paper dragon and most of them were just bankers borrowing past glories to keep wizards from casually exterminating them, wizards being the dominating power because of their wands and Merlin in particular being the Goblin's nation collective bogeyman.

*** It was quite possibly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6739500/29/][this one.]] It was fun, and a breath of fresh air after all those goblin worshippers....

**** I know right! It's like they are not even characters anymore, just some kind of master-key plot-device to make the MC's power-trip go smoother.

** i would love to see fics where both Dumbledore and Voldemort are more than they are in canon, and so post Grindelwald, Dumbledore dominated world politics to the point that pepole were desperate to get someone to take him on, in comes Voldemort.

Voldemort who starts off sounding resonable, but as time progresses is shown to be far worse than Dumbeldore as basically the magical god, where they trade blows untill the phropecy is created and the next great is born.

Imagine year 5, Dumbledore is done taking the shit Fudge says and casually walks through the ministry staff to force them to admit Riddle is alive
