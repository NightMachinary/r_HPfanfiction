"Hey, look. I think I found a hair."

"Hm, let's see... Yes, human. You think it's from the thief?"

"Might be. If so, we're dealing with a bloody idiot. Get the Polyjuice."


** Coroner: Male, age 43, white, pureblood. *lifts sheet*

Investigator: That's a rat.

Coroner: Yes it is.

Investigator: Where the hell's the body?

Coroner: OH sorry, forgot to mention. Animagus.

Investigator: Don't they usually revert back to, you know, human form once they die?

Coroner: *shrugs* Guess not.

Investigator: How do I know someone didn't just kill a rat?

Coroner:

Investigator: I quit.

** First auror stares down at the body, all... mutilated and wrong. Where even was the face? Oh, right, it's over there. He shuddered. "This criminal act is... Unforgiveable. Sunglasseo Demitto"

/sunglasses fall from the sky and land on his face/

He grins.

Second auror looks at first auror and sighs. "This isn't the time for puns, wanker. Have some decency."

First auror slumps. "Yeah, alright." Vanishes the sunglasses.

Second auror clucks his tongue, shakes his head sadly. "Can't you ever be... Sirius?"

/sunglasses reappear/

"YEEEEEEEAH!"

"You're an idiot, Padfoot."

**** Heh, yeah. If this fandom ever took a stab at the Buddy Cop Police Procedural formula, it'd definitely end up being a mix of Lucifer and Castle. Quips, desperately longing romantic feelings and an explosive situation forcing them to admit them, and magical-CSU technobabble (arcano-babble?) worthy of Star Trek itself. :)

** /"But Harry, they are having trouble identifying some of the remains." said Hermione. She blushed as Harry turned to face her. "It was in the story on the front page." she finished./

/Harry shook his head. "They shouldn't be now. I suggested using poly-juice potion. Pluck a hair from the remains and drink the potion. You should be identifiable then."/

** Not exactly CSI but this is a buddycop story with Tonks and Harry. It's Harry/Ginny and Tonks/Bill but the pairing is only a small part of the story. The ending is bad and the villain is obvious but still the investigation is fun to read and Tonks and Harry have a great chemistry in the story. I would love to see a sequel or something that has the same vibe.

  After four years working overseas for the shadowy Department M, a world-weary and dispirited Harry Potter returns to the land of his birth. He meets some old friends and makes some new ones, as he learns that much has changed since he left home. AU, a 'Harry never went to Hogwarts' story.
