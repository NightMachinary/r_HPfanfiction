** Just for reference, the [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-original-forty][Original Forty list]] is on Pottermore.

I have never seen these ones used:

Stephen Cornfoot

Roger Malone

Oliver Rivers

Sally Smith

--------------

Lots of names got changed subsequently:

Trevor Boot -> Terry Boot

Queenie Greengrass -> Daphne Greengrass

Both Patil sisters

Hermione Puckle -> Hermione Granger

Neville Sidebottom -> Neville Longbottom

Draco Spinks -> Draco Malfoy

Gary Thomas -> Dean Thomas

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]], linkffn(11574569), uses lots of rare names such as Kevin Entwistle, Wayne Hopkins, and Sue Li.

Sophie Roper is Hermione's dorm mate in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] and plays a rather big role.

  Hermione Puckle -> Hermione Granger
#+end_quote

Headcanon: Puckle is her mother's maiden name, retained for professional purposes (she's Dr. Puckle at work, Mrs. Granger at home) and she is descended from the inventor of the Puckle gun. It's not a common name, after all.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
