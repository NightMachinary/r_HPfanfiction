#+TITLE: Each piece of soul that Voldemort uses to create a Horcrux is a different aspect of his personality. The part that latches onto Harry is Voldemort's prankster nature. When it attaches to Harry, it leaves him with a penis shaped scar on his forehead.

** Ron sitting across from Harry on the train.

Ron smirking, "Do ya...have theyou know?" Harry confused, "The wha'?" "You know..." Ron replied fighting down a fit of giggles, "...the scar." "Oh yeah." Harry replied lifting up his fringe to reveal what to some could be confused with the big dipper above his right eye. Ron howling with laughter, "WICKED! IT REALLY IS THE WHOLE PACKAGE!" Harry confused quickly covers it back up.

Even better if everyone else knows what it's shaped like but Harry can't make the connection for whatever reason.

Fred and George make comments about how girls must really dig his scar and he replied back you don't think some will find it gross? It's just a regular scar.

*** I was thinking more like Voldemort's cruel sense of humor but the words didn't come to me when I first wrote the post. That would explain why he was so mean during his second coming.
