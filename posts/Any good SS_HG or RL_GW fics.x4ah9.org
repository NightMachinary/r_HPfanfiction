Can be any rating just no Angst or Tragedy.


** There's a good SSHG called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/bChasing_b_The_bSun_b][Chasing the Sun]] which is really cute, and keeps them in character brilliantly :D

*** YES SO HARD. Here's some more, because I read SSHG far too much.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7454117/1/][Just To Be*]]: Snape, Hermione, and Harry work to make sure the orphans of Death Eaters can have a good life. Depressing at times, but SO in character, and absolutely amazing!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/][Pet Project]]: One of the longest-running classic SSHG fics. Not finished, dammit, but really good.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3733492/1/][The Apprentice and the Necromancer]]: Another classic. Marriage law fic from back when marriage law fics were something new and cool.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/][When A Lionness Fights*]]: This is tied with Just To Be for the place of my favourite SSHG fics. Basically, Hermione takes over Snape's job as the spy in the Death Eater camp. If you accept that Hermione would do that in the first place... It's really in character. And also amazing. And also a bit dark at times, as SSHG tends to be.

**** The Apprentice and the Necromancer was well written enough, but I really felt that the author pulled too much from Nix and that it wasn't as well stitched into the HP universe as it could have been. Good list though!

** There are thousands upon thousands of good HGSS fics but, I'm sad to say, a general dearth of good Remus Lupin het fics. In my experience, most fanfic writers see Lupin as gay for the Marauders.

**** THAT'S BECAUSE THEY BELONG TOGETHER!!!

But, seriously, I understand your point. It's the lack of information on other characters from that era, and him being such a father figure to most characters from this era that it seems weird to most people to pair him up with anyone younger. Not that there's anything wrong with that, that's just my understanding.

REMUS AND SIRIUS 4EVER!!!!

** Go to Petulant Poetess and look up "Potions Under Duress" for HGSS wonderfulness. They are my top selection for stories since OWL shut down. Here is my "short" list of stories from there that are excellent and 40k+ words in length. Most are more mature ratings. I wrote the list for someone and copy/pasted it here.

Princess of Gryffindor - BEST HGSS OF ALL TIME. (imho)

Heart with No Companion - Biggest Tearjerker.

A Change is Going to Come - Also called "Vanity" in a couple places, a time travel fic that is pretty good if you are ok with time travel fanfic logic.

Being Hermione Granger - I just remember liking it, not too much more about the plot though. Standard romance I think...

Care of Magical Creatures - Romance adventure, Marriage Law Challenge. I really like MLC and this one didn't disappoint.

Flight of the Prince - I know I liked it, I think it's an adventure romance, but I don't remember plot details.

For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble - This one was adorable. It reads like a Jane Austen novel. How to raise money for Hogwarts in the aftermath of the war? Have a historical theme week at the castle. Totally AU, but adorable.

Hilltop Cottage - Very cute romance.

Improbable Felicity - Another cute romance.

Phantom of Hogwarts - Hogwarts makes a production of "The Phantom of the Opera". Fabulous story. I also think it is the longest SSHG story in the fandom.

Phoenix Song and Phoenix Tears - Gradual romance, shows the behind the scenes of HBP and DH from Hermione's viewpoint.

Raven - The name sounds awful, but it's a good story! Gradual romance and had a few plot points that you don't see everywhere.

Sage - 30 years later and compliant with the epilogue while also coming across as plausible!

Southern Magic- Neat plot ideas. Totally AU. The story itself is maybe a "B", but it's different and is a nice contrast to traditional stories.

Spinster - Eventually a romance, good traditional plot. Some very funny scenarios.

The Godfather - Achingly beautiful. Just read it if you haven't already.

The Love You Take - Lovely romance.

**** Will do. I've been exploring my Whovian side lately, but I'm beginning to feel it's time to return to my HGSS roots. :)

** There's a [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=20498][BDSM SS/HG fic]] on Ashwinder that's pretty nice, if you're into that kind of stuff.
