#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts portraits are able to talk and move around from picture to picture. They behave like their subjects. However, the degree to which they can interact with the people looking at them depends not on the skill of the painter, but on the power of the witch or wizard painted.

  When a magical portrait is taken, the witch or wizard artist will naturally use enchantments to ensure that the painting will be able to move in the usual way. The portrait will be able to use some of the subject's favourite phrases and imitate their general demeanour. Thus, Sir Cadogan's portrait is forever challenging people to a fight, falling off its horse and behaving in a fairly unbalanced way, which is how the subject appeared to the poor wizard who had to paint him, while the portrait of the Fat Lady continues to indulge her love of good food, drink and tip-top security long after her living model passed away.

  However, neither of these portraits would be capable of having a particularly in-depth discussion about more complex aspects of their lives: they are literally and metaphorically two-dimensional. They are only representations of the living subjects as seen by the artist.

  Some magical portraits are capable of considerably more interaction with the living world. Traditionally, a headmaster or headmistress is painted before their death. Once the portrait is completed, the headmaster or headmistress in question keeps it under lock and key, regularly visiting it in its cupboard (if so desired) to teach it to act and behave exactly like themselves, and imparting all kinds of useful memories and pieces of knowledge that may then be shared through the centuries with their successors in office.

  The depth of knowledge and insight contained in some of the headmasters' and headmistresses' portraits is unknown to any but the incumbents of the office and the few students who have realised, over the centuries, that the portraits' apparent sleepiness when visitors arrive in the office is not necessarily genuine.

I would say they learn way better than people. From literally nothing to remembering, understanding and communicating in such complex areas as a school management (which includes many subjects).

In comparison it takes several years for a human to start talking property while being taught constantly by environment.

******** But for this to be a new thing, you'd need all wizards to be idiots- since they started making portraits. No one, not Dumbledore, not Flitwick, no one would have thought of using portraits as teachers. Because as soon as one did it, it would set an example, and soon every school would do it.

So, you need to either treat all wizards as idiots or adapt the entire setting to incorporate such portraits.

** I personally think there is one very important phrase in Pottermore's article about them:

#+begin_quote
  they are literally and metaphorically two-dimensional.
#+end_quote

I personally write portraits as some kind of "magical Alexa". They are incapable of learning by themselves, but they /can/ have information inprinted in them by active input from outside sources. You can add and layer enchantments on them, which give them certain capabilities.

Most portraits are just really flat depictions of people. Their characters, activities and desires kept for eternity on canvas, in one moment. A painted choir will never tire of signing, a painted hedonist never tire of sinning and so on and so forth.

Only if you add enchantments to them can they become more. For example, I once wrote a portrait into the Hogwarts Library that had the capability of searching through the contents of books. The headmaster's portrait is a good example for a continous adding of information - of expanding a database the portrait can access, if you will.

But I doubt that the vast majority of portraits would be overly useful. Only a percentile amount of them would even be able to hold a simple discussion, and even less of them would be capable of giving credible advise. Here too, the headmaster portraits would be a good example. Since they can no longer be updated, eventually the informations the headmasters hold would become obsolete.

********** Well yes, I was referencing the pottermore wiki, since you pointed it out previously. However, I think that 1 in 50 of portraits being powerful enough to learn does not equal to thousands of portraits learning year after year. Since portraits are likely expensive to create, they are also infrequently made (I don't recall any portraits of which there are more than one of, and the idea of reconciling age differences between two portraits is weird), and so perhaps only 300 to 400 a generation (30 years) worldwide that are produced. Furthermore, many portraits are likely not in any location where they are able to learn. They're valuable and the older ones are likely stored. Finally, many older paintings are probably lost. All of this probably leads to far less than your purported thousands of learning portraits.

*********** When referring to thousands of Portraits. I meant that there are thousands of Portraits in Hogwarts, then apply the ratio. And you do have a point about them not all of them being in a position to learn. I think for one instance that if lavender could find a portrait in the hall that can and willing to listen to gossip, she would be there for hours. By canon, we know there are portraits scattered in the hallways, at entrances of houses as entry ways, guarding secret passages, and in professer offices. It would be interesting to see how many would be worth talking to.

************ I'm not convinced that Hogwarts has thousands of portraits, nor that you can apply a ratio to determine that there are thousands more out there. The Harry Potter Wiki, for all its inaccuracies, mentions only 61 portraits seen in the whole story (maybe including the movies). Even as large and mysterious as Hogwarts is, there are likely far fewer than a thousand portraits. Most fairly notable families likely only have so many portraits, and places with the largest collection of portraits are probably schools, then ministry buildings, then finally very rich and distinguished pureblood families, like the Blacks.

** Personally, my head canon is that portraits aren't very versatile, can't learn, don't have the memories of the person they're made for, and aren't very bright. I don't know if anything in canon goes against this, but it would be world breaking if portraits were essentially immortal copies of the person they're made after.

** If you make it so they can only learn from their own subject (i.e. Dumbledore is the only one who can really 'teach' his portrait, apart from very basic things later on) that limits their usefulness significantly. Especially if you add caveats like 'the portrait will understand what is imparted to a lesser extent than the one teaching it' so you can't just read your portrait the encyclopedia and expect it to remember.
