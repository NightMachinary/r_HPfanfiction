Preferably completed and is dark-ish, though a morbidly humorous tone is also acceptable (I *love* M rated stories)


** As [[/u/yarglethatblargle][u/yarglethatblargle]] already said everything you need to know. I will add a few more:

Rogue's Bet - Linkffn(12240216)

Teenagers & Cigarette Smoke - linkffn(12432400)

Black coffee, with sugar - linkffn(12414949)

Days to Come - linkffn(10728064)

Dancing in the Green - Linkffn(Dancing in the Green by Pheonix Dawn)

And [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5smdn6/my_harrydaphne_recommendation_list/][in this post]], I listed some of the stories regarding this pairing.

  Daphne woke up to the smell of coffee, which was unusual, all things considered. Mostly because she didn't drink coffee.

** Not really. Especially when you want it darkish. But here are some that are good, even with some sort of stupidity involved

linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is probably the best of the ones I'm putting down. Really, the only thing wrong with it is part of the idea: making a good Harry/Daphne marriage contract fic. Not really a dark Harry.

linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerSpW): Another one with marriage contract bullshit, and pretty shit pacing. Incomplete.

linkffn(Uncle Harry by R-Dude) Can be seen as a 'sequel' to Contractual Invalidation. Oneshot. Not dark in anyway, really.

linkffn(I'm Still Here) Don't know why I'm including this, because it is crap. Has super special Harry bullshit, Harry/Draco/Voldemort from another dimension ending up in one with a fem!Harry and living James/Lily bullshit, bullshit Flamels (no, them [[/spoiler][being immortal because of an accident when they were younger is not more interesting than them being old because of Philosopher's Stone use]]), Light Side/Dark Side bullshit (Ain't Star Wars people, just stop already), it's on the route to harem-bullshit that'll include Daphne /and/ Fleur and probably Tonks, fucking terrible pacing (literally nothing actually worthwhile has occurred). On the bright side, not nearly as shit as her other really popular story I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.

James Spookie has a bunch of Harry/Daphne stuff.

But no, there is basically no top fanfiction tier Harry/Daphne (this is coming from someone who /likes/ the idea of Harry/Daphne for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4c39v3/so_can_people_explain_to_me_the_fascination_with/d1eneq4/?context=3][reasons of varying complexity]]).

WAIT A GODDAMN MINUTE. Almost forgot about linkffn(Unatoned) which is good if you like noir stuff. Also the entire first chapter is a brilliant homage to /The Big Sleep/. Top tier writing ability, though parts of the plot can be a bit wonky.

*** Daphne is often portrayed as a neutral pureblood -- doesn't support Voldemort or Dumbledore. This gives the story the opportunity to let Harry break free from the canon plot/manipulative Dumbs/etc. and pursue a strategy which includes politics/finance/diplomacy/etc. (because, you know, real wars are about logistics). Sirius and Amelia Bones can also fulfill this role in some fics, but Daphne offers more of a partnership while Sirius and Amelia in these fics are more patrons. As a Slytherin it's not a great stretch if she's willing to support Harry in being more aggressive with his enemies. There just aren't that many children in Harry's age group who can fulfill this role (Neville? Susan Bones? not really) so fanon Daphne fills this need.
