Any fic where Harry goes missing from Surrey(for whatever reason), and Dumbledore suffers politically because of it.

Could be something as simple as stepping down as Headmaster to something more drastic, like Azkaban. Coincidentally, if there's a story out there where Dumbledore suffers for appointing himself Harry's magical guardian in 1981, that's welcome too.
