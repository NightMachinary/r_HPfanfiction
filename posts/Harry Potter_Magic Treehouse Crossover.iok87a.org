I grew up reading the Magic Treehouse series. They were the first chapter books that I ever read, and the lessons they taught had a major impact on my childhood. They also eventually inspired me to start reading Harry Potter. I'd love nothing more than to read a crossover of the two.


** Would work well, really. Merlin is even a character in Magic Treehouse.

** Magic Treehouse was my favorite back in early elementary school...time flies lol. An interesting XOver could have them travelling to Hogwarts at it's opening or during the witch hunts.

** When I clicked on this I was thinking you were talking Enid Blyton's The Faraway Tree! Now that'd be a trippy crossover.
