/This year marks the 20^{th} anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, which ended the tiranny of the Dark One./

/This resulted in a sharp decline of muggleborn prejudice, and oddly enough, a culture boom for all things muggle./

/Now, 20 years later, it's not rare to see wizards and witches walking around with a Weasley Mirrorphone^{TM} in hand, and the creation of the Magical Instant Messaging system (MIMs) has simplified communications around the world./

(Disclaimer: I'm not a writer. This is not really good.)

Are there any fics that deal with a "mugglenized" magical society in the 2010s? I know one where Hermione writes an essay about how Harry created a magical-muggle industry, but nothing other than that.

**** That's fine, he's not for everyone. There is another story called Hermione and the Muggleborn Revolution (I think) but I don't remember who wrote it. It stats with a Marrage Law which sparks a third war (so maybe it was “Marrage Law Revolution”) sorry but it's been a long time since I read it

***** "Marriage Law Revolution"

It was an October Revolution knockoff with rather excessive purges of counterrevolutionary elements which escalated further and further (although some might argue that anyone supporting rape laws deserves the hangman's rope).

******** Then your statement of

#+end_quote

Is categorically incorrect, knockoff implies that it was another work that the new work is copying somehow (at least stylistically). This is compounded by the fact that your are in a subreddit about fanfiction, and discussing fanfiction so no ones first thought is going to be an historical event with 5 other names.

** A few choice quotes:

#+begin_quote
  Why did Colin Creevey's camera work etc?

  As a vast number of people have pointed out to me in the last twenty four hours (some of them related to me by ties of blood) Colin DID develop a photograph from his camera in 'Chamber of Secrets' (my previous answer stated that he never did so).

  Cameras, like radios (or, as the wizards call them 'wirelesses' -- they're always a bit behind the times when it comes to Muggle technology) do exist in the wizarding world (there's a radio in the Weasleys' kitchen and we know there are cameras because of the moving photographs you see everywhere). Wizards do not need electricity to make these things work; they function by magic, but in the case of such objects the wizards liked the Muggle invention enough to appropriate the idea without adding cumbersome plugs/batteries.

  I have an old notebook in which it says dev sol (potion) magic [indecipherable word] photos move. Adept as I am at interpreting my old scribbles, I can tell you that the original idea was that wizards would use a magical developing potion to make their photographs move.

  SO... as Colin's batteries can't work in Hogwarts, clearly his camera is running off the magical atmosphere and he is then developing his photographs in the magical potion that causes the figures therein to move. All of which goes to show that Colin has a lot more initiative than I ever realised.

#+begin_quote
  While they have no need of mundane domestic objects such as dishwashers or vacuum cleaners, some members of the magical community are amused by Muggle television, and a few firebrand wizards even went so far, in the early eighties, as to start a British Wizarding Broadcasting Corporation, in the hope that they would be able to have their own television channel. The project foundered at an early stage, as the Ministry of Magic refused to countenance the broadcasting of wizarding material on a Muggle device, which would (it was felt) almost guarantee serious breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy.

TL;DR: canonically, no revolution is needed to bring about "magitech", which is already a thing. Wizards are perfectly aware of how to make Muggle devices operate off magic instead of electricity and therefore function fine even in highly magical environments like Hogwarts.

It's a lack of interest, not a lack of ability, which prevents this from becoming more of a thing.

*** Cultural revolution then! Maybe jeans and t-shirts become trendy among the young purebloods? Stuff like that.

Edit: with the (partial?) defeat of blood purism, muggle culture becomes the "in" thing. Clothes, music start penetrating the typical magical culture, until they blend together.

*** Huh, what batteries?

Remember the story is set in the 1990s. Colin's camera is a film camera and those only use batteries for two things: moving the film around, which can be done manually (and IIRC, is done manually in SLRs) and to power the flash. We can assume the flash operates by magic (ie, something like a lumos spell). No other electricity or electronics are requires.

The Wizarding Wireless Network could be based on older radios using vacuum tubes so, again, no need of electronics.
