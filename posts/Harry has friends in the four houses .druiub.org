Hey guys, im looking for some AU where Harry's main group of friends are each one from a different house.\\
Exemple: Harry (Gryffindor) Draco (Slytherin) Susan (Hufflepuff) and Hermione (Ravenclaw)\\
That was just an example.

Things that i don't want in the fic.

-Dumbledore bashing.

-Slash.

-Normal pairings for Harry (H/Hr or H/G) i really don't like those pairings.

Harry first arrives at Hogwarts in 4th year after his name is pulled from the Goblet of Fire. His core group is Neville, Susan, Daphne and Hermione (here a Ravenclaw). They volunteered to tutor Harry and get him up to speed.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
