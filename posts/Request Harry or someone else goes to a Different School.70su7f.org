Looking for stories where Harry or someone else goes to a different school other then Hogwarts.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not then a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

**** It's not just an oc; this is a whole new society, with noone from the HP cast participating (except for a few references). This would stand very well as a seperate fantasy series - the only thing it shares with HP is the magic system.

As for Alexandra, she is certainly not a Mary Sue; if anything, at some points she is underpowered and gets shit on a bit too much for my taste. Otherwise, she is very well developed, just like most of the characters.

The strongest aspect of this series is the worldbuilding, for sure. The way the author has set up the various sub-communities of American wizards in accordance to region, actual history and ancestry is nothing short of masterful.
