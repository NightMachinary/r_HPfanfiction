I'm feeling ill (Not Covid, Thank Merlin) and am rather bored lying in bed. Any good long fanfictions? I'm fine with slash, het, or gen but please God no harems.

Don't suggest Fate, I /loathe/ it.

Many Thanks


** I really love [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/oliversnape/pseuds/oliversnape][Oliversnape's]] work - lots of Harry and Snape interactions.

linkao3(329404)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/][Finding Himself]] is about Cedric surviving the graveyard battle, but seriously injured. It is very well-written.

linkffn(4594634)

My favorite Hermione fic is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - Hermione's totally badass in these stories and so smart. It is complete and has a sequel.

linkao3(7944847)

Dudley's Memories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd][Paganaidd]]

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there are more.

linkao3(601542)

I've been reading this story ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]) about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time as a way to understand his character better. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. It is a WIP and updated regularly.

linkffn(13052940)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4787432][Fractured Skies by Orphan Account]] - features a deaf Sirius and the way signing is portrayed seems to really capture the poetry of the language. The story beautifully conveys the challenges of living on the fringe ... the otherness (not just Sirius, but also Lupin). Also, I loved how the Marauder's story was made mundane (not magical) with links to the original stories woven in. It is slash and has a sequel that is also good.

linkao3(10954928)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Linear Circle series]], is really brilliant and is part of a long series. It has a plot twist that totally caught me by surprise (in a good way) and deals with the founders as well as Harry era Hogwarts.

** I don't think you really get much more Epic than Wastelands of Time by Joe. Drawling Beat Poet Harry gets himself stuck in a time loop trying to stop Voldemort reaching Atlantis. It's big, it's powerful, he gets his arse kicked repeatedly, but lots of big Uncharted-esque setpieces happen and Harry crows at a lot of stuff.

Joe does turn Harry into an "I was born to run, sweetheart, dancing on the head of a nail balanced on the edge of forever" level cigar-swilling, whisky-smoking Film-Noir-Detective Narcissist, but it works quite well and makes sense with the level of influence he has over Eternity.

It's got 93 chapters and it's not finished. The author seems to currently have writer's block, but given the current length, you'd probably get an update while reading it.

Also;

**** From quickly skimming the beginning of it, it looks like the primary reason he first demanded to be Evans-Potter is because he wanted to try to convince the sorting hat to put Draco into Gryffindor, and he needed his last name to come before Malfoy. The fact that it seems like having to call him Evans shifted Snape's opinion of him was probably not intentional for him, but he definitely played it up.

** Linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and it's two sequels it's a great classic Harry finds a Denarian coin with a fallen angel in it who leads him down a road of corruption starts out with a small crossover with Dresden field which becomes more prominent over the sequels. Harry is a massive dick in it but it's written well and the fight scenes are amazing

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** Linkffn(The Merging; Renascentia: From the Ashes; Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux; Black Luminary). In order: Harry takes a far more active role in the war, leading to an AU take on OotP and HBP, some characters are /really/ OoC, but it's enjoyable, overall; Regulus survived the cave incident but ran away to France, only returning to England after Voldemort is resurrected in GoF, he's then forced to live in Grimmauld Place and discretely help the Order while hiding from them; the horcrux in Harry's scar becomes sentient while he's living with the Dursleys and begins to slowly corrupt/manipulate him; and finally, a massive AU where Grindelwald had a much bigger impact on Britain, Voldemort never rose to power, and the politics of modern day Wizarding Britain are fucked six ways to Sunday.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict.

** linkao3(Fate is a Four Letter Word) does feature a slash triple (is that the word?) pairing, but I promise it's worth it. Excellent characters and an amazing plot. Does have quite a few explicit slash scenes, but they're easy enough to skim and skip over. Loads of great courtroom stuff if you're into that.

But, if you'd prefer something more action based and gen, Id recommend linkao3(Turning of the Times) which I am currently reading and is a fantastic Harry time travels to the Marauders Era fic

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
