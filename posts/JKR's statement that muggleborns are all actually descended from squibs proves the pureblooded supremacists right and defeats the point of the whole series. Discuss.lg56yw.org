** Exactly how does it prove their point? They don't steal magic, they're born with it, and they can be just as powerful (for all we know). Their point against Muggle-borns is that they were born and raised as 'Muggles' and so that makes them 'Mudbloods', but they still have the right to bear wands. Their great-grandchildren or grandchildren will even be considered pure-bloods by most wizards' standards.

In other words, all Europeans alive today have among their ancestors the same man or woman who lived around 1400. Before that date, according to Chang's model, the number of ancestors common to all Europeans today increased, until, about a thousand years ago, a peculiar situation prevailed: 20 percent of the adult Europeans alive in 1000 would turn out to be the ancestors of no one living today (that is, they had no children or all their descendants eventually died childless); each of the remaining 80 percent would turn out to be a direct ancestor of every European living today...expanding his model from living Europeans to living humans, and [got] an estimate of 3400 years instead of a thousand for the all-ancestor generation.]]

** If magic is a boolean, recessive genetic trait, then the pureblood supremacists are full of shit. Their argument is that you can get more magic by having more magical ancestry, and that you get less magic when there are more muggleborns, and since more magic is better than less magic, the number of muggleborns should be minimized and the number of magical ancestors of each magical child should be maximized. But if magic is boolean, heritable, and independent of what other people have, like sickle-cell anemia is, then the best way to maximize magic is to encourage all wizards and witches (regardless of blood status) and all magical-raised squibs to have as many children as possible, with any willing partner they can find. Even if they mostly have squib children with true muggles (as opposed to muggle-raised squibs), the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle guarantees that homozygous recessive magic will show up again in a few generations.

Actually the best strategy would be to give the Statute of Secrecy the finger and offer free genetic tests to identify muggle-raised squibs, and encourage them to have more kids too. But I can see why that might be politically unfeasible.

JKR cannot both claim that magic silently passes down through untold generations only to pop back up again suddenly, /and/ mock Trelawney with a “skips three generations” gambit.

This statement from JKR is worth dismissing as nonsense. Like that “wizards used to soil themselves before modern plumbing” nonsense. Not even animals do that.

**** Trelawney herself knows that it's a weak argument. The entire tone of the passage is that there is no way Trelawney could reasonably have expected to have inherited this gift from her great-great-grandmother, because gifts don't skip three generations.

The implication is that Umbridge found a weakness, not that she invented one.

***** How does Trelawney know it's a weak argument, though? Like as in, while she may have been told that it was, does she actually /know/ that it is? Because unless JKR randomly changes the curriculum of Hogwarts tomorrow, biology is hardly even taught to the wizarding world in basic education. Thus, while someone may say it's unlikely for her to have inherited the trait, for all we know, that's just a statement farted out from lack of proof. And unless Trelawney isn't actually related to her great-great-grandmother, she is all the proof needed to prove that the latter is true, considering that she is a legitimate seer who has given legitimate prophecies and predictions.

I guess I'd be more willing to give credence to the claim it's unlikely if we had actual, canon proof from a wizard biologist or something like that. However, since we don't, it's more easy to assume that it's not, especially in a society that has a pretty bigoted elite that was in control of the government and possibly the curriculum of Hogwarts as well.

****** Sure, I'll give you that there isn't a breakdown of genetic expression anywhere in the books.

But I was talking about the text itself. When you read the passage, Trelawney is plainly aware that it's not a strong argument by whatever standards their society expects magical inheritance to follow. The whole class is on her side, but there is a collective kind of “oof” when Umbridge brings up this point - the whole class realised that Umbridge has found a major weak point.

Later, Lavender is very upset about this.

There is no “proof”, in that Umbridge doesn't pull out a peer-reviewed article about seer inheritance, this is just the invited reading of the text.

TLDR: The invited reading of the text is that magical gifts do not typically skip three generations.

******* Again, how do we expect these people to know anything about genetics if there is no formal biology education taught to them? I get that the text implies that Umbridge is right, but Umbridge is speaking to a room full of people who haven't been taught anything about genetics -- including /herself/. How are they to know that she is wrong? Because the society that is run by bigots who presumably have the same lack in education told them so? Plus, how are you going to react if you're a 15-year-old and you see your Professor (no matter how much you like them) believe what another person is saying? You're probably going to believe that that other person is right, and since that section is in Harry's POV, it taints the narrative as a whole.

********* And if the seer gene had a physical trait, I would agree with you. However, since it does not, the only way that a person can be “proven” to be a seer in this world is through a prophecy or correct prediction, which then raises the question: is a prophecy still a prophecy if someone else hears it?

I mean, for all we know, Trelawney's parent/grandparent/great-grandparent all could've given a prophecy, it's just nobody was there to hear it. In which case, since the trait was expressed when no one was around, nobody thinks that they actually had the trait because it's not physical. If it was, I'd agree with you, but since it's not, unless Trelawney's family had someone with them every moment of their entire lives, there's no way anyone can know for sure she's the first seer in three generations.

Also, yes, you're right, modern science is not the only lens that we can look at this stuff through. However, at the same time, if modern science does not apply, then why raise your point at all? Because if modern science can't explain the seer trait, then it can't explain the existence of muggleborns either.

*** Three is a suspiciously specific number of generations for an inherited trait to skip. Recessive genetic traits often do skip random numbers of generations, but there's no way one could reliably skip exactly the same number every time. It is of course possible that magical gifts like Second Sight follow a different inheritance pattern, but if that were true and well-known, Trelawney wouldn't act like she was making excuses.

** I think it could be interesting if sometimes this happens, like squibs get shunned a lot and no one pays attention to their lineage the way wizards would. Could be neat for a muggleborn to dig back through their family tree to the last magic ancestor.

I'd also love to read more about squibs. Since they're canonically different than muggles (can see a lot of magic things that are hidden) it might be interesting to see a 'muggleborn' squib who stumbles upon magic. Or maybe they're just muggles that have complete immunity to magic effects. Who knows!

** You're very wrong, but maybe that's because you didn't word what you were trying to say properly.

Pureblood Supremacist arguments are that those with Pure blood have more right to magic, that they are stronger, and that they are more powerful. Even if Hermione is some descendent of a lost squib line of the Dagworth-Grangers, she is still smarter and more magically talented than most purebloods. A line of squib blood diluted with generations of muggle blood and she is still a better witch than Draco Malfoy.

Now what I think you are trying to say is that the idea that muggleborns are descended from squibs proves the /Magical/ Supremacists right. This is a much more defensible position but it's still wrong and sad. The concept being that there is no such thing as a muggleborn; that not only can muggles not do magic, they can't even have kids that can do magic. That magical squib line children are special only because of who their great grandparents are, not because of an innate personal worth.

This is dumb because everyone is special because of their own innate personal worth. Being able to do magic doesn't make wizards /better/ than muggles any more than Usain Bolt's ability to run really fast makes him /better/ than the average person. He's better at running, yes, but that doesn't mean he as a person is innately superior.

** It sort of does and doesn't I guess. In canon the pure blood supremist movement is basically just putting muggleborns and muggles down by saying they have a big pureblood family tree. In fanon they give proper reasons but if you go based on only canon the purebloods would probably react to saying the only reason that a so and so muggleborn is actually talented in because of their ancestor. For example, if Hermione is related to the Malfoys, Lucius would either say that the only reason Hermione is smart is because of her 1 or 2 magical ancestors, or he would denounce Hermione completely. JK Rowlings statement doesn't really impact the pureblood over muggleborn supremacy much except improve muggleborn conditions. On the other hand pureblood supremacy over muggles gets a whole lot worse. Pureblood can now basically legally remove muggleborns from muggle parents stating that they are part of the family. Purebloods can state the muggles are hindering the growth of long generation witches and wizards. I know Lucius Malfoy would do such a thing if Voldemort asked him to as Voldemrt himself tried to recruit Lily Potter, a muggleborn.

**** Im quite sure idiotic pure blood supremists can find a way to do that. Muggles are seen as beneath wizards by most of wizard kind. Even Dumbledore the great muggle supporter feels that muggles cannot protect themselves and magical children. Pretty much only muggleborn in hogwarts actually think that muggless have some superiority compared to wizards. I can see Lucius Malfoy managing to come up with a law to allow a pureblood or halfblood family to remove a muggleborn from the care of the muggle family citing 'Abuse' or inability to protect/care for magic children. That would be a law that would probably exist tbh if it was known

I personally do not take JK Rowling's statement in the interview as canon as it is basically meaning that muggles are useless and magic from the magic world always stays in the magic world. I also see this means that eventually marrying with a muggle would be more and more common, not that their is anything wrong with that.
