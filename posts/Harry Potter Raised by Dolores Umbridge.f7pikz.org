As soon as I first thought of a Harry Potter raised by Umbridge, I could not get it out of my head. Please feel free to send fics that do not have Umbridge raising Harry as long as she still fills an idol or mentor role in Harry's life.

It's important that the recommended fanfics have Harry being devoted to the ministry first and foremost.

I would be interested in Harry raised by Fudge too.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]] is surely the classic of this subgenre.

*** Brilliant! I love how Dolores saw an opportunity to further herself and seized it - it's so beautifully /canon./
