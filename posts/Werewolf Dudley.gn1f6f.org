** If it was meant as “Looking for” post, then there is “Dudley Dursley and the New Normal” by alikat522 (I have EPub of the story, but apparently it was taken down from FFnet, so I don't feel free just to post it somewhere, available upon the request in PM by email). And just next of Dudley, there is linkao3(Tuum Fatum by DragonsAndOtters), which is about Petunia.
