So, I've been reading/skulking around harrypotterfanfiction.com for 8+ years and I've read most of the GOOD fan fics out there. I've read some authors that could rival J.K. Rowling. I have named multiple authors, whose works I have already perused, at the bottom of this post, I have listed them in no particular order and their writing skills range from above-average to completely excellent. At this point, it's hard to search through the site (hpff.com) for a *good* fic that I either haven't read or have attempted to read to find that the writing is too atrocious for me to even continue... I honestly want to be able to continue my addiction to the series but the pickings are slim for a good fanfic.

I'd prefer something that isn't smutty in nature and (optional) a small degree of romance, also I really, really would prefer no 'one shots' (I like to invest in a full story, hopefully above 10 chapters but I'll try any suggestions). AGAIN, if it doesn't have romance but it all-together a good read, I will probably devour it and it will be much appreciated. I am indifferent to the era, the pairings, the amount of mature content (in fact I quite prefer it to be mature, but again, optional). I just need something that will be able to captivate me. (as an aside, I've also been looking for a fic that does Luna's character justice.. Can't seem to find one that actually illustrates her character as it does in the books.)

The authors I referred to in my first paragraph are listed here. I'd recommend reading their works if you haven't already! I found each of these authors worth a try even though I am extremely picky and like to scrutinize each fanfic(P.S. I may have missed a few names but I will try to update) (P.P.S. if you're going to search these names, search them as I wrote them, spaces and all. The only discrepancy will be the capitalization of some characters which I did not accurately transcribe) :

| Name                    | Name             | Name             |

** I really like Starfox05's works. Very deep and broad in scope and world building. Very original as well. He also has been wire prolific for the past year and a half.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there. (Sequel, switches POVs)
