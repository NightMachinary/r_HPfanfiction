What if Aurors had been called in after the Basilisk attack? What if people investigated Harry's home life proper? What if people questioned Dumbledore's choices more?

I don't hate Dumbledore, I just think that he made a lot of very poor choices that could have been handled properly.

So, what if they were handled properly? Or by other people willing to help?

Or people who aren't relying on a child (Harry) to save them all. Et cetra.

If you have to have bashing in the story, I'd rather it not be from the Weasley's, as I just really love that family.

I don't want Harry to be Lord/Heir to x amount of families here or anything of the sort.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Other than that, go crazy.

If not a lot of stories like these, maybe someone would be willing to write it.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** AU, but still follows the canon plotline by the time Harry reaches school with variations, but I've been enjoying the Innocent series. Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
