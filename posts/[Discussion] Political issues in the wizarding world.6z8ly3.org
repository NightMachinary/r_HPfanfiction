British politics is weird, in part, because of the lack of revolutions in the UK over the last 1000 years. Change is slow and builds upon what is already there, instead of the tearing everything down and starting from scratch. In my AU fic I've tried to get a sense of that sort of history while making the Magical Britain work a little better (simple things like actually making their own food, etc).

I'm unsure just how out there this is, but instead of an official "party" system like in most governments, I've gone for a looser allies and affiliations sort of thing, with voting blocs and word-of-mouth agreements between family heads. I'm trying to work out what issues might affect Magical Britain on a regular basis while Harry is in his Hogwarts years. This is what I've thought of so far:

- Pro/Anti muggleborn sentiment. This is clear from Canon but would be relatively subtle in the Wizengamot.

- Similarly, the rights of werewolves and magical beings.

- Regulation vs Deregulation of "dark" magic and magical artifacts

- Regulation vs Deregulation on trade; also taxation

- International Co-operation vs Isolationist policy

- Funding raises/cuts for various depts and offices such as the DMLE

Other suggestions would be very welcome, as would any discussion on Wizarding politics.

*** Yes, Dark Lords were those who fought against the establishment and lost.

Those who succeeded in their revolutions became 'Kings', 'Ministers' and 'Presidents'.

** I expect Muggle relationship to become a key issue. The camps of 'more integration' and 'more isolation' would certainly trade blow against each other and could split friends.

*** You could probably expect the rift to be very subtle in the Wizengamot, with everybody trying to downplay its importance. In reality, it could be the one key issue which regular folks use to align their political views. I think it could be interesting to read about the mentality of 'muggleborns are the cause of all our problems' gaining traction in society and Wizengamot members slowly getting bolder with their discrimination. Could lead to some interesting complications, such as an anti-muggleborn minister being elected (assuming OP is making the position electable) and starting to legally diminish muggleborn status. Of course, he would have to clash with Dumbledore in this endeavour, which can only lead to great scenes.

**** I'm talking about postwar period, when Dumbledore and Voldemort were both dead, the blood purity movement was discredited, and Harry's gang had taken over Magical Britain.

This issue would gain more urgency as Muggle technologies has been advancing at a rapid pace and it became more and more costly to maintain the SoS. Minister Hermione Granger saw the danger and was deeply worried about its disorderly collapse. Muggleborn or not, she faced the difficult choice of opening up and preparing for the inevitable collapse of the SoS, or increasing the isolation and tightening the use of magic in Muggle areas.

The issue could tear their gang apart, because both sides had indeed good arguments.
