So there's a song in my mother-tong. it's about two people who suddenly find themselves in this strange situation: they always wake up in the same bed in the same place, whatever they do. They take a plane to different destinations, chain themselves to their respective beds (that's from my head, not from the song. I'm weird like that). So I had an idea. Maybe someone wants to write a fic about that. I think it should take place after the war and lean towards being a funny story. Of course, neither Draco nor Hermione are happy about this new hm... sleeping arrangement. They do everything in their power to stop it but it's hopeless. But when they start to fall for each other it suddenly stops. Do I need to say that it's a Dramione fic? No? Good.


** Sounds interesting. What's the song?
