:END:
I'm looking for a specific Snape/Hermione ff, I think I read it on AO3 but I can't seem to find it again. I remember ~ 4 scenes from it, here they are: 1) Hermione was with Ron at the beginning but one night touched herself thinking of S. He was there (somehow?) and they almost did it, but were then interrupted by Harry; 2) they have their thing like three days later, the scene is very long (like two chapters) and S tries to fulfill H's fantasies about him; 3) there's a battle in which both S and Harry survive, H is relieved; 4) they get at it again in a bathtub I think, then end on a bed and somehow they're engaged (? I hope I remember this last part correctly). There is also a scene somewhere in which Pettigrew does a bj to Voldemort (sadly no, I am not joking). To whoever helps me find it, thank you kind stranger!
