  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

** linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches) - A "Champions of Lilith" challenge response. Comedic (heavily inspired by "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood" without a lot of the more... /problematic/ elements), Lunar Harmony, bashes Dumbledore/Molly/Ron/Ginny.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin) - A "Don't Fear the Reaper" challenge response, one of the best.

linkffn(Reboot by Kallanit) - A "Don't Fear the Reaper" challenge response, but with a substantial twist.

linkffn(No Fate by AndrewWolfe) - Loosely inspired by RobSt's "You're My Density", the Ministry expelled Harry after the Dementor incident and wiped his memories of magic. Years later, he gets pulled back into the conflict as a member of the resistance against the Voldemort regime. It's seven chapters in so far, and they're still just preparing for the time-travel bit while doing everything they can to help the resistance.

linkffn(Ah, Screw It! by mjimeyg) - Crossover with Stargate SG-1. Comedic and with a strong element of fix-it, but for me at least manages to avoid straying into "too easy" territory.

** linkffn(Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat)

Honestly, it's a pretty well-written time-travel fic where Harry is transported to Tom Riddle's school era and has to learn to cope. All the while, Tom Riddle is trying to figure out who the hell this mysterious new person is and what he's hiding. It is a TMR/HP fic, but thankfully not slash-centric if you're not into that.

It seems to be discontinued though (last updated February 2019), so I probably wouldn't start it unless you don't mind it being unfinished.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back][Stepping Back]] is the main one that springs to mind. Its a Harry/Bellatrix fanfic, where after the events of Book 5, Harry is trained by the Unspeakables, and then sent back to the 1970s to stop Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13766768/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Conjoining-of-Paragons][Harry Potter and the Conjoining of Paragons]] is a very new time travel fanfic, as in I'm pretty sure it only came out a couple of days ago. There's only 1 chapter so far and its pretty much all setup, so we don't actually see him go back in time yet. The author has a pretty good track record for writing great stories though, so I assume this story will also be good. Its a Harry/fem!Riddle fanfic.

Canon ships: linkffn(Backward with Purpose Part I: Always and Always). I actually prefer part 2, but it wont make much sense if you haven't read the first part. Either way, the fic is good, and was my first experience with Peggy Sue.

Honks: linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass). This fic is what made me interested in the ship.

Snily: linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). This fic is what made the ship my OTP, after acquiring an (initially presumed brief) curiousity for it.

** ive LITERALLY been rereading my favourites all morning so ive got a bunch! most are on ao3 though, and im usually fine with every pairing, so these might not be everyones cup of tea. There is no bashing in any of these, and im not fond of op harry, so there is almost none of that either.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][of a linear circle]]

This one is one of my absolute favourite fics ever, and is an epic in ten parts ( around 1,8 million words so far) that still updates every friday. absolutely lovely rewriting of canon, but has quite a big focus on snape, and his relationships with other people. the time travel shows up in the second part, and becomes an important plotpoint later on.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12356376][Things you dont know]]

Again, this is a pairing that i usually never read (hermione/sirius). Its a very short oneshot, written from Sirius point of view, and basically tells the story of how hermione traveled back in time. bittersweet, and aching, and something that i think people should give a shot! both are young adults in this, so no underage or huge age differences etc.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17732855/chapters/41836616][the source of grief]]

a two part story, in which harry, using the name of hadrian gaunt (cliché, i know) travels back in time and starts to change things. everyone is confused, harry is scarily efficient (and HIMSELF, not the usual OP time travel lord that shows up in these kinds of stories). The ending left me very- sad? conflicted? happy?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21527806/chapters/51317527][princeps]]

First part of three or four! still updating. Again, this is one of the best ive ever read. Harry travels to the MWPP era, becomes a teacher and tries to stop voldemort by teaching the hogwarts students critical thinking, better defence etc. Gen, and filled with politics, powergames and the like.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/][eternal return]]

Oneshot. Harry dies in the last battle and becomes tom riddle (due to some kind of reincarnation i think? how is not really specified) The story is once again very bittersweet and suitably angsty. Harry basically battles with the morality of what he's doing, while not wanting to change the timeline.

** Well you can try the story HP: Dolen Amser by Jonn Wolfe. It's a Harry/Tonks story where via spell interaction Harry ends up going back in time to his first year but the original Harry is still there. So this older Harry is not allowed (swears on his Magic) to change the time line because of dangers of creating a paradox. Of course, that is easier said then done.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9235939/1/][*/Finding Time/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1361245/El-Reino][/El Reino/]]

#+begin_quote
  Remus wants to find out more about the new Potions assistant. He is curious about her secrets as she seems to know all about his. Hermione just wants to do her job and get out. Their timing was never right. EWE. Marauders and an eventual build up to romance. Drabbles. Complete.

**** Oooooh, I like this one! Maybe I will do a re-read. I am a sucker for Hermione time travelling trope, and after Chemistry&Timing, Hermione/Remus became one of my faves too.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
