I see a lot of people hating on Pup and Prongslet (which I really don't mind) but what nicknames have you come across in stories or on your own that you like?


** - "Lord Thingy". Cornelius Fudge uses it because he's too chicken to say "Voldemort", but too formal to say "You-Know-Who". It's my favorite Voldemort nickname and I wish I saw it more in fanfic, because it's so much better than Moldyshorts.

- Not fanfic, but "McGalleon" for Professor McGonagall. Came from a Potter-themed podcast where the hosts discussed McG running a betting book for the school quidditch matches, that's why she was so into the sport that the broke the rules and got a first year on the team with a pro-tier broom.

*** The best part about Lord Thingy is that it's canon.

***** I'm also American and I've never heard it used for anything but alcohol. But I grew up in the northwest, so pretty much the opposite side of the country from you!

** I once saw Harry call little James "JimJam" and for some reason I thought it was really cute.
