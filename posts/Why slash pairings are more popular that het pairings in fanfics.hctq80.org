Today I realised that slash pairings (at least in ao3) are more popular than straight pairings. Like, there are thousands more slash fics than het ones. Which puzzles me as, as far I understand, I thought there are more straight people than gay people. That doesn't mean that straight people don't write slash, of course, but still, I find it curious.

*** One of the reasons why FFn hit slash stories more heavily during the Purge is because slash writers tend to be more graphic/smutty, IMHO, on average.

Hetero stories that were just as graphic were also hit, too... though, porn without plot stories have slowly grown back on there over time (Megamatt09. 'Nuff said).

Also, those PMs are messed up. Don't let those cunts get ya down, man.

** AO3 in general has a lot more slash and femslash pairings than other websites, especially FFN, for most fandoms. I can't confirm this, but I feel like, though there are probably more queer authors on AO3, the majority of the people writing slash fics are straight women. I don't think that these straight authors are necessarily trying to fetishize gay couples by writing characters in slash pairings, but that they want to write compelling romances and the most developed characters are male, so they just work with what they have.

Overall, I think fanfic authors see that there's a lot more romantic potential between these existing male characters so they stick to developing that rather than throwing in a female character or gender-bending a male one.

*** Yeah, relationships between male characters tend to be much better developed than those between men and women, typically because a lot of the time the women are love interests and love interests only. I'm sure part of it is the fantasy fuel of guy on guy, but there's just more existing chemistry to work with too.

*** As a straight female writer, this hits pretty close! I don't write a lot of female characters into my romance stories because I don't find it compelling. It's more interesting to me to write about two hot dudes than a hot dude and a woman. Which is why I write fan fiction instead of real stuff lol

I like to read het pairings a lot of the time. It is just the writing where I can't really get into it.

** I've not checked the stats on whether it is or not certainly the slash section of reddit is smaller than this subreddit. Frankly, I've never seen so many people wanting to read het in one place! My guess is it's because reddit is a male-domained area of the internet.

Fanfiction is mostly written by women who enjoy both slash and het fics, but slash allows them to imagine two hot guys together. Technically speaking, studies show that women tend to show arousal whether it's men/men, women/women or men/women but that doesn't mean they'll decide to write each type equally.

Femslash is also typically written by women, for women which is why there's so little of it.

** Some of the appeal of slash palrings for straight writers is the removal of gendered issues and unequal characters. No matter what society you are in, men and women are treated differently, and children are socialized in gendered ways. Slash and femslash are able to ignore most of these issues by having characters that are roughly equal in relationships. A lot of women who write slash can then write about characters free from the societal constraints imposed on them because of gender.

If you can picture a setting like Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey--Maturin series (Master and Commander books), the male characters are much more free than any women. The captain and surgeon can interact and have adventures on a roughly equal level, while putting a women on a ship in 1800? The men would have to treat her very differently than they would another guy.

For example, if not the first mainstream slash pairing, is from the original series of Star Trek. Star Trek has so few female characters and a much more interesting relationship develop between Kirk and Spock (since they aren't friends immediately). Similarly, with Harry Potter, there are certainly more named female characters, but how many of them have a character arc? Honestly, Hermione is the most fleshed out female character and she is constantly described as being shrill, crying, nagging, and shrieking. (However much of this is JKR's internalized misogyny, I can't say, but the girls are not written nearly as well as the boys).

Harry seems to have a more intense reaction to most of the male characters, like his hatred for Draco seems more invested than the casual annoyance he has for Parvati, for example. Enemies to Friends/Lovers is a classic story, so why not slash with the protagonist/antagonist?

*** That's a very interesting opinion, and certainly true. As you say, our society still has gender roles and, even if we don't believe it, we have internalised them.

But is that the actual reason? Isn't it perhaps, an accumulation of factors? I would say human nature is complex, so we can't derive a conclusion by only ascertaining something.

Regardless, I don't really mind slash. In fact, I like them, as I am bisexual üòå

**** I wouldn't say that this is the actual reason, as in the /only/ reason; rather, that is my explanation of some of the appeal of slash pairings. Of course, there are many factors and motivations for writers both individually and cumulatively.

I would also say that this isn't about minding slash, liking it or not; it's just a partial answer to your original question.

EDIT: I'd like to add this note to contribute to my opinion (about antagonists and the appeal in relationships): [[https://cryptid-coalition.tumblr.com/post/188349450268/some-of-yall-are-like-why-does-this-villain]] So many villains are coded as gay, which just adds to the forbidden appeal

** Most authors and readers are heterosexual women or LGBT people, who probably like slash more than the average heterosexual man. When it comes to fanfiction communities, Reddit is the only place I've stumbled across where heterosexual men are the majority.

There's also the enemies-to-lovers factor. The female antagonists in HP aren't as popular as the male ones. Pansy, Umbridge and Bellatrix are widely disliked, but Draco, Snape and Voldemort are somewhat divisive.

** While it's true that AO3 is much more slash-heavy than ffn and many other sites, and that some slash is written by straight people, I think it's also likely that a disproportionate number of fanfic authors are queer, relative to the general population. The average queer person is probably more likely than the average straight person to get deeply involved in fandom (due to a desire for escapism, feeling like you don't fit in with peers, especially when you're younger). The average queer fan is also more likely than the average straight fan to engage with fandom in a "transformative" way (e.g. writing fanfic), rather than just obsessing over the cannon as-is, because they're less likely to see themselves represented in cannon.

It's also worth noting that, at least on AO3, the common belief that "most slash readers/writers are straight women" is probably not true. [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/AO3_Census:_Masterpost][This survey]] (though it's a bit out of date) found that about [[https://centrumlumina.tumblr.com/post/63112902720/heterosexual-female-slash-fans][1/4 - 1/3 of M/M fans]] identify as straight women. Anecdotally, it seems like a lot slash fans and creators are queer women, who would love to read and write more femslash but are limited by the lack of well developed women characters.

** Typically I don't like female characters/can't connect to them because they're written as cardboard cutouts with a single trait that makes them special.

I'm a 30 year old woman who has been writing fanfic for literally half my life, it's honestly easier to write male characters because they're already developed.

Also I enjoy reading power imbalance fics, boss/intern, teacher/student etc, I can't enjoy these in a M/F fic or story because it's honestly uncomfortable to read as a woman knowing that these are huge issues in real life, it stops being a fun fantasy and just makes me cringe.

Also two pretty men getting together is nice to picture :)

If I wanted to write Buffy as an OC in the HP world I'd get so much shit for writing a Mary Sue, if I wanted to create a character like any of Tamora Pierce's main characters I'd get hate for writing them. I flip the gender and suddenly these badass characters are ok

It sucks.

Well written women are amazing and I love to read them being amazing. Women who are only written to be the sidekick or love interest have zero appeal.

Tamora Pierce and Christine Feehan are two of my favourite authors, they write women really well, like we're people and not props for male characters. The Tomorrow When The War Began series by John Marsden is the same, the Abhorsen series by Garth Nix, Friday by Robert Heinlein, the Obernewtyn Chronicles by Isobelle Carmody... all amazing female characters that I love and could relate to

Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dollhouse, Cold Case, Criminal Minds, Farscape, Fringe, Leverage... all have well written amazing women

Tomb Raider, Horizon Zero Dawn, Dishonored 2, Dishonored Death Of the Outsider, Ciri from the Witcher 3... amazing badass women who don't need a man to save them and who would be offended with not being someone's equal.

They all get called ‚Äòunrealistic, unfeminine,' etc etc... but aside from superpowers they're just amazing women and a lot of people can't deal with that.

Harry Potter does not have well written women. It's really hard to care to much about them because they don't really have personalities, I'm not invested in them like I am Harry because there's nothing to get invested /in/.

What's Hermione's favourite colour? Food? Any relatives other than her parents? What does she like to do aside from read?

I can answer these for Ron, I can't for Hermione because JK didn't feel the need to tell us because she didn't think it was important and it's not story wise but it does flesh out the characters in a way that she just doesn't bother with her female characters.

If I'm not invested, I don't care and I can't write something that's centric to a character I don't care about.

** Ao3 draws in an even more overwhelmingly female audience than fanfiction on average (which to begin with is rather female). Women are statistically speaking much more likely to be comfortable breaking gender norms with romance and sex. There are far more bisexual women than bisexual men, though an even number of gay men and lesbians.

Thus, the predominately female citizenry of AO3 is more interested in shipping whichever two (or more) main characters they perceive as having a spark of romance, regardless of gender, than in shipping characters with respect to their canon sexuality.

Ironically, given the female population of AO3, the main cast of Harry Potter is predominately male. This is why slash is so common. It's not, like others have theorized, because women like to fetishize gay men. But simply because women are generally willing to break traditional romance boundaries, and will graft their own flexibility onto the characters they write.

For evidence that it's not just women fetishizing men having sex with one another, go to Game of Thrones on AO3, which has a much larger female main cast, and you'll notice that femslash is much more common.

FFNet is a lot more normative in regards to romance. If you're uncomfortable with slash, I recommend sticking to that site. Which shouldn't be a problem as there are 4x more HP stories on there than on AO3. FFNet is also less interested in shipping in general, with a far greater proportion of magical theory, power fantasy, etc. type stories.

** I created this a while ago: [[http://home.fiq.se/top30.txt][Top 30 Harry Potter AO3 ships]]

According to this, slash is more common than straight pairings, which in turn is more common than femslash.

Also, you don't need to be gay (or bi) to appreciate slash fics. While I don't care much for the explicit stuff, I've read plenty of slash fics in general. and I'm straight. I typically tend to skip the explicit scenes, though. And I don't see why writing would be any different -- I bet the vast majority of (fem)slash authors are straight.

** I dunno, but from my point of view - slash FFs were some of my first contact with non-hetero relationships (kid around 11-13, grew up in a Catholic country). And I didn't think much about that, just that it made sense to pair Harry and Draco or Sirius and Remus or James - they had so many interesting interactions there were plenty of ways to make these ships believable. And despite my rather conservative upbringing, I've internalized that these relationships are just as valid and never paid any attention if that's heterosexual pairing or not. So thanks ffs for learning me something important! I could easily write a slash ff not because I want it to be non hetero, but because for me it would be as natural as writing any other interesting pairing. And I'm asexual.

I'm asexual too. I've grown up in a country where everything on TV and movies is censored and 'clean'. Homosexuality was a criminal offence until 2 years ago so media references are hard to find.

I was quite confused when I first saw Harry and Draco paired up but I reasoned that they seemed to have more chemistry than Harry with any other female. Before I knew it, I was down the rabbit hole and found a fic on asexual Charlie. I am thankful to that fic for helping me find who I am.

** Because until Kickstarter and other self publishing options, there wasn't anywhere near enough "real" published fiction that had queer main characters for the people who wanted that to be satisfied. Fanfiction is the easiest outlet for novice writers who aren't at the level of being able to make an original story out of whole cloth but can dang sure write a good story about Kirk and Spock kissing, so a lot of people who wanted some queer fiction turned to fanfic.

** I think partly it's the same answer as to why fanfic is popular at all. We love the original content, we want to see more adventures in that world AND we see potential for more - for different interpretations.

For tv based fandoms in particular there is often a lot of potential chemistry between characters, and unfortunately producers and/or show runners are not yet in a place where they will allow that potential to blossom on screen (outside of subtext)...At least not when the original character bios are 'straight'.

Enter fanfic - a place to explore, enjoy and re-write the canon to be more inclusive. As a viewer, it's very satisfying to read an expanded world where that potential is realised. I think that's also why there are dominate pairings, they are based on actual chemistry and potential (and you don't have to be gay to notice that and desire to see that story told).

Its the same as world building in HP fics, we all see that potential and so it's a popular & satisfying area for writers and readers.

** My experience way back in the dark ages (early 2000s, started in, believe it or not, Real Ghostbusters and A-Team fanfic) was that a lot of fandoms had very few female characters in general, and specifically very few well-developed female characters. Star Trek is also guilty of that, the original series, at least. Harry Potter is not much different; Hermione is the only reasonably well-developed female character. Ginny is a two-dimensional love interest.

The upshot of all this? If you want to write a fic with a relationship between two well-developed characters, often your choices for the two lovers are overwhelmingly male. This results in an unexpectedly large number of slash fics.

AO3, in contrast, was built by fans (many of whom were slash fans) and designed as a community-funded non-profit specifically so owners and advertisers couldn't be pressured to remove adult content. So really different communities/values underlying the two sites which is one reason why you end up with different kinds of stories.

Also it most certainly is not porn. A lot of it is literally that a lot of writers flesh out extremely interesting character dynamics for the male characters while doing nothing for the female ones other than designating them a love interest.

I'll admit I'm biased because I'm not straight but like holy hell it's not about porn man. So much of it is legit about just interesting characters that have far more chemistry than their delegated canon love interest.

**** No, completely straight twenty years married man, father of two children. So, yes, my opinion about what's the real about being a homosexual are purely from the second hand. And yes, being who I am, I usually try to avoid slash (both male and female version, although I am able to survive femslash better), not because I would have anything against homosexuals, but just because it is an experience which is completely alien to me.

I am just saying that linkffn(11396276) doesn't describe deep problems brought on by being lesbian. And that linkffn(13285012) is just very soft (and a way better written) version of the same.

The only story I have met so far which seems to me real is linkffn(12507814), and yes it was written by somebody who wrote about his problems.

  When Harry wakes up one morning to find himself suddenly transformed into a beautiful girl, all hell breaks loose in Hogwarts. At least Ginny doesn't seem to mind. Harry x Ginny, fem!Harry x Ginny, femslash, gender bender, and much lesbian fun! Hermione x Luna (Moon Sage) established!

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.
