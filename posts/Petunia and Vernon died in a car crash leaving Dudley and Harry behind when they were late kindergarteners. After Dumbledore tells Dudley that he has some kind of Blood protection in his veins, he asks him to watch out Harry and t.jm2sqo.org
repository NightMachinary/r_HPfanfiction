And of course aunt Marge doesn't want to raise Dudley with Harry around


** I mean...5 year old Dudley won't understand the concept of "blood protection", and also wouldn't pay any attention to a random stranger telling him to act differently than his parents had shown clear approval for him to act like.

Realistically what would happen is Marge would take Dudley, refuse to take Harry, and social services would put Harry into a group home or foster family of some sort.

Honestly, having Harry adopted by another family because Petunia and Vernon die is a pretty good way to give you complete flexibility to change most of his character. You can give him whatever sort of childhood you want based on who you have him adopted or not adopted by.

You want a cunning, sneaky Harry? He was constantly rejected by foster families because of accidental magic, kept getting sent back to social services by families that thought they might adopt him.

You want smart, well educated Harry? He's adopted by a rather academic couple who prioritise a good education.

You want warm, loving Harry? He gets adopted by a huge family, think the Weasley's but muggle and all adopted kids. He grows up surrounded by family and love.

So many different options for ways to change him, which would have a massive impact on the story.

*** > I mean...5 year old Dudley won't understand the concept of "blood protection", and also wouldn't pay any attention to a random stranger telling him to act differently than his parents had shown clear approval for him to act like.

I actually think about it in my head: Basically when Dumbledore visits the Evans cousins after the accident, Dudley mistake Dumbledore for Santa, Dumbledore plays around and don't necessarily tell Dudley about the blood protection (maybe it's automatic?) he just say that in that hard time he needs to reconcile with Harry to confront the hardships they will endure together and make it more bearable which eventually make Dudley open up to Harry (and as horrible as it is, it will be easier since his parents are not around anymore to influence him).

> Realistically what would happen is Marge would take Dudley, refuse to take Harry, and social services would put Harry into a group home or foster family of some sort.

well yes which is why I said that Marge will not take them since Harry need a close relative with him, or else the death eaters will get him, so the wizards will not let it happen.

** I've been writing a crackfic where Petunia dies in childbirth and Harry is raised by Hyacinth and Richard Bucket from Keeping Up Appearances. It's something to make myself giggle and I'll probably never post it but Harry still has blood protection because Hyacinth and her sisters Daisy, Rose, and Violet are maternal relatives of Petunia and Lily. It's mostly told through letters written back and forth from the characters. If I were more skilled it would be more fleshed out.

** Dudley, being a precocious little shit, does not take this random old man's words to heart and instead resents Harry out of a misbegotten belief that he caused the car accident (Big twist, he actually did.). What was once mere copying of his parents turns into genuine hatred as the two share lodgings at a foster home or orphanage. Dudley is also struggling with feelings of grief and fear during this time and these emotional disturbances lead to the big reveal that Dudley is indeed magical (His accidental magic throws Harry down some stairs. Thankfully Harry's own magic made him quite bouncy.).

Harry meanwhile is having a horrible time, hating his life, you know the drill. When their Hogwarts letters come Harry is overjoyed and Dudley is conflicted over his but still quite excited. The two go to Diagonal Alley with Hagrid and after being introduced to Quidditch Dudley takes much of Hagrid's attention, leaving Harry to handle his shopping. They separate for a while and Harry enjoys his little bout of freedom. Dudley and Hagrid meet up with Harry again at Madam Malkins, just in time for Harry's meeting with Malfoy. Draco is his typical arrogant self and gets all disgusted with Hagrid and Dudley. Harry is feeling none too keen with either and rather disdainfully introduces Dudley to Malfoy, letting slip that he's a muggleborn. Malfoy makes the offer for him to come see him in his compartment on the train if Harry gets sick of playing with the pig, then departs. Harry then gets chewed out by Hagrid for wandering off and things continue as normal.

On the big day Harry gives the slip to Dudley and spends the trip with Draco and his crew. Crabbe and Goyle turn out to be quite different once you get to know them (Goyle likes poetry, as it turns out.) and the arrival of the usual near-OCs is met with relief from Harry as Draco is a rather awkward person to talk to. After arriving at school it's time for the big sorting and Harry, being the lame old sponge that he is, is sorted into Slytherin. Dumbledore seems rather put out and Snape somehow looks even Snape-ier. Dudley is sorted into Gryffindor, which seems to match his boorish personality and propensity for fighting.

Not going to write out the rest of the year but I think that's a good starting point for some divergence.

** Good prompt, but a little input for anyone wanting to British it up a tad - I did a quick google and apparently Kindergarten goes until age 5. In the UK, 5 year olds would be starting Primary Education. They'd be in what we call 'Reception' (or called, anyway. It's been a fair few years since I was in primary school).
