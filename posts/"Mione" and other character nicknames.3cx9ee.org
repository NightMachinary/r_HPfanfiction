How do you feel about common nicknames for different characters?

I know a lot of people have strong feelings on Mione, though personally I don't really care. I think it makes sense for Ron to shorten her name occasionally, though I don't like it when everyone uses it.

I think there's a big difference between a fic where Ron calls Hermione "Mione" every so often when he's being lazy, and a fic where Ron only calls her Mione. Or a fic where literally everyone calls her Mione.

So what nicknames have you seen for characters that you like (assuming they're not overused and mostly used by the character's SO or something)? Which ones drive you crazy?

*Harry* - I've never seen his name shortened. Occasionally he'll get an actual marauder nickname, which are usually a bit stupid. I've read a few "Sirius rescues Harry from the Dursleys" fics where Sirius will call a pre-Hogwarts Harry by some nickname like "Pup."

*Ginny* - Ginny is obviously a nickname already. I've heard people complain about Gin on the grounds that Ginny is already short, but I don't think it's that unheard of to shorten a name twice. My sister has a 4 syllable name that she shortened to 2 syllables, but sometimes when I'm really lazy or speaking offhandedly to her, I'll use the first syllable (which is like two letters).

*Ron* - Already shortened.

*Hermione* - Mione. I read a fic where Ron would occasionally use "hen" when speaking one-on-one, which actually seemed to suit her.

Other characters?

The next gen get a bevy of nicknames. I've heard:

*Albus* - Al (Canon per the epilogue) Plenty of next gen fics have him using Al most of the time, which I think makes sense.

*Teddy* - Teddy is used in the epilogue, I've also heard Ted.

*Victoire* - Vic, Tor, Torie. The last two don't make sense to me since it's not quite how her name is pronounced. It's more of a "twa" sound.

*Dominique* - Nicki, Dom

*James* - Jamie, Jim (Jim mostly as as a joke at his expense)

*Roxanne* - Roxy

*Lily* - Lils, Lee (I actually like that last one)

*Fred* - His full name might be Frederick. Then again, JKR wrote "Fred/Roxanne" on the family tree and I don't see George as one for tradition.

*Scorpius* - Scor, Scorp. There's not much you can do with his name.

All of those are used by various family members. I do think that they would tend to shorten names if they grew up together. Teddy might be Teddy to his pseudo-cousins and Ted to most adults/friends.

For the marauders, I've heard

*James* - Prongs (obviously). That's pretty much it.

*Sirius* - Siri (never liked this one), Padfoot, Pads, Paddy.

*Peter* - Pete, Wormtail, Wormy (canon bc Lily uses it in her letter in DH)

*Remus* Remy (ugh), Moony. His name doesn't really lend itself to shortening.

Others:

*Neville* - Nev

*Angelina* - Angie

*Severus* - Sev

*Draco* - Dray (ew)

*Voldemort* - tons of nicknames, obviously not to his face. I don't like Tommy or Moldyshorts, Peeves uses Voldie but I think it should be used very very sparingly if at all.

*Umbridge* - Umbitch (obviously not to her face). Mixed feelings about this one.


** Frankly, I just don't understand why people get so upset over "'Mione." Hermione is a long name. Out of canon character names, it's definitely the one I would expect to be shortened into a nickname. I've seen people use "Herms," which is just weird to me. Who would want to be called "Herms?" At least "'Mione" (which I read as "Mine" and not "Mine-y", to be clear) is the stressed syllable of her full name. I don't really see it as a pet name, it's just a shortening of her full first name. Repeating a full 3 or 4 syllable name (depending on who is saying it) would get old before long.

*** But her name is "Her-My-Oh-Knee" (source: Goblet of Fire and JKR)...so, "mine" isn't correct because you're missing the "oh". When I read Mione, I hear "My-Oh-Knee"...which to me is just weird. I don't know how you would shorten it..."My-Oh"? I can see a little child butchering it so bad that they just settle on "Knee-Knee". That'd be cute, but she doesn't have any siblings. Harry's kids?

I do agree that Herms is worse though.

**** Well, when you say Hermione, you don't really put much stress on the "oh" syllable, and it would almost certainly be reduced and pronounced more like "uh," unless you're specifically trying to enunciate everything. So "Hermione" ends up sounding like "Her-MY-uh-nee," with the stress on "my." The "uh" sound is sandwiched between the two stressed syllables "my" and "nee," so you could pretty much get by just excluding it entirely. I don't know how common it is in Britain, but in America, I've noticed that most people who aren't big HP fans just pronounce it "Her-my-nee" anyway.

Besides, the whole point of Hermione having the nickname "Mione" is to shorten the length. If there's no issue with the "Her" being dropped, what's wrong with losing the "oh?" Things aren't always spelled phonetically.

***** I'm in America, and I've noticed that, but I know for a fact that JKR says it's 4 syllables because she had a little phrase to say with it. It was something like:

#+begin_quote
  Her - as in - "Her brain is so large!"

  My - as in - "My, my! Her brain so large!"

  Oh - as in - "Oh, she has such a large brain!"

  Knee - as in - "I scraped my knee."
#+end_quote

This struck me as a child for two reasons: 1) I had been saying it wrong, and 2) that's quite funny. I know that I say it more like "Her-My-Uh-Knee", but I think we say it like that in America because our ears interpret the British Accent as being said with an "uh" sound...because their "oh" sound doesn't sound quite like our "oh" sound.

Regardless, saying it with three syllables is pronouncing it wrong. Nobody says "Elizbeth". They say all four syllables...because we usually know somebody named Elizabeth and we know how THEY prefer it said. I'm sure Hermione goes around correcting the pronunciation all the time...and frankly, most people would try to make an effort not to be corrected again if they actually knew the person in real life.

Usually to get a nickname (or at least a shortened version of the long name), you hack off syllables in the beginning and/or the end...or you just change the name completely. I can't think of a single one that deletes syllables in the middle. Correct me if I'm wrong, of course.

I personally think Hermione would have hated "Mione", regardless of how it was said.

Usually people aren't named Hermione. And, again, this is more of a southern thing, but I hear people drop middle syllables of words all the time. No names come to mind at the moment, but I'm sure there are some. It's a colloquialism, nothing proper; it's just about making things easier to say.

I feel like she'd be fine with it among friends, especially Ron and Harry. Plus, the whole thing about Ron only saying it when his mouth is full is a perfectly natural way for a nickname to form. When my my uncle (whose name is George) was a toddler, he would call my dad his "buffer" because he couldn't pronounce "brother," and everyone's called him Buff ever since.

**** I could see a nephew/niece of hers giving up halfway through and just calling her Aunt Nee.

So if you're enuicating Hermione's name properly, it's her-mi-o-nee. But the third syllable is soft to begin with, and her name would frequently get truncated to Her-mi-nee. The first syllable isn't emphasized as much as the other two, so if you're dropping a syllable to shorten it, the last two are the only survivors. Hence mi-nee.

** I have a deep disdain for nicknames as a general rule. But it is probably just based on my own experience. I have an extremely uncommon name that is really not hard at all to say, but it throws people for one hell of a loop for some reason. Three syllables is not hard to deal with. I won't list my name for privacy reasons, but it's along the same pronunciation lines as Beyonce in that each syllable is supposed to be said a certain way in order to not butcher the whole fucking thing and you may or may not know what that sound should be until you hear it said by someone who knows.

Hermione is like that to me. I consider it disrespectful to not call someone by their given name unless they have expressly given permission to do so. Nick names tend to be chosen not by the named, but by the namers. Nick names that are not based on your actual name are a little different... Titles like Sissy or Junior, sport related like Speedy or Slick, etc.

So, TLDR: I dislike and disavow all nicknames everywhere unless it is the chosen name of the person in question. But in HP FF, I don't let it dissuade me from an otherwise decent story.

** Hmm, there are some that are just plan annoying. The only time I like the nickname "Gin" is if her Quidditch teammates call her that...because sometimes if you're in the middle of a play that's all you can get out. If Harry called her that...umm, that is stretching it a little bit, but I don't mind.

I can't stand "Mione". I've seen hen before (little0bird's stories?), which is sorta cute...but I don't know if either Ron or Hermione would be the type to use pet names. Harry, maybe, because he's a huge dork. The only justification I can think of for Ron using a pet name is because obviously his dad calls his mom "Mollywobbles". Which is hilarious.

My general rule of thumb for shortening the name/using a nickname is whether or not I would use it, or I've heard it used. My husband and I don't use pet names for each other, but I've heard some silly ones from friends. Also, there's a difference between what a parent would call their child, and what the friends would call the child. My dog's name is Lucy, but she hardly gets called that (Lulu, Luchee, Loosey Goose).

I'm seriously tempted to name any future son of mine "James" (also my father's name, not that big of a dork). I love the nickname "Jamie", and my father goes by "Jimmy". So those are totally likely to show up in a story of mine. Maybe not for Harry's father though.

*** Hermione's name is so long that I think Ron would end up shortening it at some point. Not for everyday use, but for personal conversations and just when he's being a bit lazy. Though everyone else would probably know better than to try and use that name. Hermione's would probably be something either derived from her name or something that didn't sound too generic/sappy. Like I have a hard time imagining Ron calling Hermione "sweetheart" or "honey." Little0bird uses hen, and I think I read another story that used it as well (maybe they borrowed it from little0bird).

Ron doesn't really need a nickname (his name is already one syllable) and Hermione's not really the type to come up with a cutesy romantic nickname.

Ginny/Harry's names are short enough that they don't really need nicknames. I can see Ginny throwing around generic pet names with Harry more (like "love"), because I think on some level, Harry needs to be reminded that he's loved.

It's funny, my family has a dog named Lucy and we've never called her anything but Lucy. Though we do call her Luuuuuucccccccy sometimes. I love Jamie/James, I want to use it as a boy's name.

I also think age should be taken into consideration. Like I can imagine "Albie" as a nickname when Al is an infant, but he would grow out of that one pretty quickly. I know someone with a daughter named Molly, and she used to call her Mollipop when she was much younger. Super cute.

Mimi's kind of cute as a nickname. Not something canon Hermione would use, but it's like the antithesis of the name Hermione. Which is sort of nice and gives your hypothetical daughter flexibility.
