*** Well the actual story needs a complete rewrite but what do you think of this prologue outline and general premise

PROLOGUE OUTLINE Story starts out in a subway car in New York Heavily scarred Stranger in a ripped old jacket surrounded by alcohol and clearly homeless is introduced Character show to be Harry Potter and then a series of flash backs show how he got here Parents died when 1 like canon but diverges from there Raised by Sirius he knows of magic from a young age and Dumbledore knowing Voldemort will return starts to train him. Training discussed and shown to be in depth and very thorough but Sirius counteracts the intense training be joking with harry teaching him the marauder way of pranking and flirting. Voldemort returns(horcruxes dont exist in this AU he survived due to the way the killing curse rebounded it destroyed his body not the soul instead of the opposite) War much worse in this reality and harry is on the front lines similar to the war in learning to breathe. Harry becomes very skilled but as the war progress more and more die until the final battle where he kills Voldemort and the death eaters follow him but as a walks through the battlefield he sees everyone he had left died in the battle at some point by some plot device harry gets control over the people he kills in battles bank accounts making him absurdly rich. Harry leaves for America to escape leaving behind Britain to rebuild. He somehow ends up on the street and believing he doesn't deserve a good life he stays there. Quick recap of his life living on the streets that clearly shows he has very several ptsd and survivors guilt and is somewhat suicidal. Blames himself for all the death cliche.

*** I mean, unless it is literally a "Hitler did nothing wrong" or "The State of Israel must be destroyed" manifesto thinly disguised as HP fanfic, most people around here will be constructive with their criticism. This ain't DLP.

**** Haha its nothing like that. But this is my first attempt at fan fiction and my first draft of the story and it is just sooooo bad. To be fair i write code not stories and i suck at English but still its awful and It's kinda embarrassing how bad it is

Edit: its way to embarrassing now that I'm re-reading it ill have to re-write like 90% before I'm not to embarrassed by it

***** Welcome to writing. All first drafts are heinously embarrassing. You should see some of the stuff I've written for NaNoWriMo. Absolute dreck. But it gets the idea out. And then you just have to sieve through all the shit for the nuggets of gold.
