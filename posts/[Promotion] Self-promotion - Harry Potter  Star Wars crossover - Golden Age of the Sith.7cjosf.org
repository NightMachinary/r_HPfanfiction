As the post title suggests, this one is a crossover, and as the story title suggests, it's about the Sith. It has Harry has a main character, so you can guess on which side he is.

The proper events of the story begin to take place during the holidays before what would be Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts in Canon. Except this isn't canon, and Harry is not a student of Hogwarts. Also, while Harry's parents are alive and he has a sibling, this is NOT a "Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived" story. Harry is the BWL, and everyone knows it.

Anyway, here's the summary:

/"In old times, the Sith Empire flourished under the reign of the Dark Lords of the Sith. But as the Great Hyperspace War leaves the Sith species and their teachings nearly eradicated, the descendants of a group of survivors must look up to the stars, and wait for the day when the Sith shall return to a new Golden Age."/


** You know, the Sith Remnant on Earth reminds me of the Lost Tribe of Sith in the now Legends continuity.

** Is Harry evil in this? Not criticising if so, lots of people like them, but evil Harry stories just aren't usually my cup of tea, so was wondering before I invest time reading.

*** It depends on how you look at him. He's not an omnicidal maniac who kills people for breathing or walking past him. Nor is he a lunatic who goes around "laughing evilly".

As of now, the worst things he has done in the narrative are [SPOILER ALERT] killing a lowlife who attacked him in Knockturn Alley, and his actions during a "favour mission" given to him by a Sith Lord, which involved killing rival Sith. Oh, and he roughed up some Death Eaters.
