After Rita Skeeter writes a terrible article about Nevil's family and does a lot of damage, a drunk 21 years old Harry bumps into her in Diagon Alley and when she provokes him he just snaps and kills her with the killing curse.

He receives a fair trial and is sentenced to lifetime imprisonment in Azkaban. Thanks God at least dementors aren't in there anymore.

At first Harry and the death eaters in Azkaban have nothing but hateful insults for each other, but spending years with your mortal enemy being your only regular companion mellows you toward them. It's been 8 years since Harry's imprisonment and one of Harry's and other prisoners' favorite pastimes is an imaginary radio program called Azkaban Cast run by Harry.

“Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the 3rd episode of Azkaban Cast!” Called Harry enthusiastically. “Today in the first item, our esteemed Russian singer Antonin Dolohov will sing us a song of love and loss in Russian!”

“It's Ukrainian, not Russian you filthy half-blood.” Dolohov called from his cell across Harry's, tone rather mild.

Harry grinned. “Fine, fine. Russian, Belarusian, Mongolian, whatever you say Antonin. And about being a filthy half-blood, well, it's not exactly my fault. Azkaban doesn't exactly have regular shower times. Hermione tried to get them to add it to the humanitarian improvements to Azkaban, but you know how those bastardly politicians are like. Now, sing away! sing away my friend!”

Dolohov snorted. Then cleared his voice and started to sing in his pleasant baritone voice, accompanied by Harry beating the familiar rhythm on his metal bed. Other prisoners came closer to their cells' door to hear the song better, some humming nonsense to the familiar Ukrainian song.

After the song ended most of the prisoners in the high security wing of Azkaban applauded the performance.

“Excellent! Truly excellent! What a splendid performance!” Harry cheered. “As you see, Mr. Dolohov clearly has more talents than just torture and murder!”

As this Dolohov gave him the finger.

“Tsk, tsk, Antonin, did you know that gesture belongs to filthy muggles?” Harry admonished.

Ignoring Dolohov's rather unkind words that followed, Harry continued. “Now in our second item of today we are going to learn a rather nasty curse from the talented albeit psychotic Mr. Rabastan Lestrange!”

*** On one hand, its a prompt to give you a creative push to write something, not something to be followed rigidly. You should pick and choose what elements inspire you and abandon the rest. On the other, I have read hundreds of "hurr durr the ministry is stupid and evil and sent innocent harry to azkaban hurr durr" fics and they're all universally terrible. You'll get more readers being more original, like Harry actually deserving to be sent to Azkaban.

After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
