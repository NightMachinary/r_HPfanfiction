But yes, I just inexplicably wish for fics where Harry Potter crosses over with a furry or partially furry universe.

My Little Pony, Star Fox, the moogles from Final Fantasy, Zelda Rito, I don't care too much. But not too much smut, please.

Saphroneth's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8768612/1/The-Unicorn-at-Hogwarts][The Unicorn At Hogwarts]] is a decent example of what I'm looking for, by the way. Though it never got very far, unfortunately...


** Somewhere in the darkness... red eyes open, accompanied by a hiss of sinister wakefulness.

**** 'Tramples Death' as opposed to 'Flight from Change'? I doubt you'd catch him sleeping, but it does seem more sinister.

** Don't downvote just because you don't like something. This is a valid type of fic for someone to want to read.

*** All the downvotes have gotten this thread to near the top of the Controversial list, therefore ensuring this thread's visibility to anyone who browses HPFanfiction and has a bit of morbid curiosity.

They're lucky I didn't ask for half-shifted Animagi. I've been sitting on an idea involving minotaurs, nagas, and Draco Malfoy refusing to get involved in what he thinks is a creature-inheritance fic.

**** It just really bothers me when people shit all over things that other people like that they don't. They seem to forget how a lot of people look at fanfiction.

***** Mm. I wonder, do these people see the title and downvote because they can, or read the post before downvoting?

I'm semi-tempted to post a request with a super scary title (like 'LF: X-rated she-male Lupin with forced-bonding, harem slaves, incest, animagus' or something) with a 'just kidding' in the text field, and see how many downvotes/comments it gets from people who don't read past the title.

  We all have imaginary friends when we're young right? Well, as it turns out, Harry's might not be all that imaginary at all... Chapters 9-11Rewritten. Story Complete.

** By furry you mean animals that are anthropomorphic or sapient and capable of speech while maintaining their typical forms or people who think they're actually a fox incarnated wrongly as a human?

** Closest I can think of (though no doubt there's some sort of MLP/Potter crossovers out there, aside from pics on deviantart) is the smut-fest 'HP and the Midnight Sun' by Vanir, on ficwad.

Harry gets it on with several Huldr- Norwegian forest spirits that look like humanoid foxes. He also hooks up with a number of otherworldly semi-humans like the spirit of a lake and Gabrielle Delacour in close to harpy-mode. Contains outrageously over-the-top sex scenes, Norse mythology, and bike races.
