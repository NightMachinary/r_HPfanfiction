I am working on an indepth queer Harry Potter zine. If any of that interests you at all I would be appreciative if you could take the time to fill out this questionnaire. It will help me get a better idea of what to include in the zine and the general opinion of the population outside of social circles and the selective fandom sites I follow. The questions are long answer but, I have edited it so that you can skip most of them if you would like. They are long answer so I get more opinions outside of my own to keep in mind and include.

** That's interesting! I'm quite curious about fanzines (I'm just discovering the concept).

Just to make sure, before answering, is it anonymous?
