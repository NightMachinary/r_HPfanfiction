"So I was thinking earlier, there isn't all that much point to the house points system, it's all just numbers and words. So right now I'm thinking of it, like, giving points is a compliment and taking points is criticising or being insulting."

And then whenever teachers take away points, the students tell them off for being rude. And award each other points for being nice.


** Snape would probably give the student who tried that detention for talking back, and all the other students would feel embarassed for them because they said something so lame.

*** I mean, sure, the point system is totally useless once you're mature enough to realize there's literally no reason to care about one day with your house's banners, but Jesus, that's like something a 7-year old would say.

**** Okay then. Given the premise of 'a student responds to having points taken by satirically taking points off the teachers', how would you write it so that it doesn't come off as 7-year-old-ish?

***** I don't think you could. That response comes across as 7-year-old-ish no matter how you put it. :)

***** That's like asking: "what is a mature way to throw a temper tantrum?" You can't, that's the point.

** All the griffs laughed uproariously while the slyths sneered as hard as they could.

The Weasley twins got up on the table and did a jig with each other in merriment.

At that time Dumbledores mail ward he had placed on Harry due to his continued manipulations crashed from the magical backlash of the exorbitant joy inside the great hall which allowed a Gringotts owl in to Harry.

Harry opened the letter and learned he was the descendant to Merlin, Salazar, Helga, Rowena, and Godric.

At that time the school wards shifted to Harry on claim of the founders families. Then Hogwarts herself feeling the desire so strongly from Harry that moldy shorts dark wanker extraordinaire was no longer alive sent her magic to instantly destroy Tommy boy and all his horcruxes.

Harry lived happily ever after with seeing as he was now the richest person on earth....oh wait. What's this!? “Aw shucks. That totally unexplainable magical blast sent me back in time all the way to my 12 year old body to do this all over again.”

The End.

Credit roll

Cut to after credit scene we see Snape brooding in his house over a bottle of fire whiskey. He lifts his fist up and shakes it menacingly. “I'll get you Potter. And your scraggly mutt too!”

** Reminds me of that fanfic Snapped that gets recommend here on occasion. Everyone's constantly in awe of Harry's "witty" remarks.
