Can I please have a dark or grey Harry Fic with some Dumbledore bashing and Ron bashing? I always thought Dumbledore was a little off his rocker, and Ron was just a jerk. But It doesn't have to be that way, Just OP Dark Harry as a requirement


** Go into fanfiction.net and look for harry and daphne pairing you are guaranteed to find at the very least grey neutral harry if not dark godlike harry with light side bashing

** So one of my all time favorites is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] It's a slashfic which might not be your thing and Harry is called Izar in this which takes a bit to get used to. (Slowburn Harry/Voldemort) Apart from that, I still highly rec you to check it out. One of the best Death Eater!Harry fics I've read. It has a very interesting plot and plot-twists. Features manipulative!Voldemort, smart!Harry, a good character developement for Harry as well, cool world-building, especially in spell developement, alive Lily and James, Death Eater raids, clashes with competent Aurors.

Minor spoiler alert but an explanation for the premise: So basically Harry (Izar) is a product of an affair between Lily and Regulus Black - Lily seduced him in order to get intel for the Order of the Phoenix. She gives him up to an orphanage. Thus Lord Voldemort never got defeated the first time aroumd, but the Order is still fighting hard against him

I linked the complete fic on ffn above, but an edited version is currently being posted on ao3, chapter by chapter which is that one Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26953177]])

Also additionally a shameless *self-rec* here. linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine)

Don't know if you're interested as it's a wip and the pairing is Harry with male!Death. Premise: Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it. Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.

Some additional info: Basically, MoD!Harry get's influenced by Death and slowly turns dark, though he starts out rather grey already. I've put a bit of focus on Dumbledore's manipulative side as to justify some resentment Harry displays. He's not a dark Lord, more indy!Harry. I've got a few cliché tropes in there but it isn't my intention to delve too much into them. Basically his main motivations are to reunite Voldemort's soul and getting Sirius a trial but he doesn't care much for anything else but Death

Harry will end up at some point staying with the Death Eaters.

He kills people, not feeling very guilty about it, though body counts will only start later in the story

*/GENERAL DARK!HARRY RECS */

So some of these recs contain classic/cliché tropes and most of them if not all are slashfics, hope you don't mind

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855][Stand Against the Moon]] contains technically Harry/Death though it's more a Harrymort fic. Nonetheless it checks all boxes in the dark!Harry department. Features Time Travel, Werewolf!Harry, Dark Harry, Dark creatures The sequel is also really good

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10642821][Love They Haven't Thought of Yet]] Boy Who Lived, Saviour of the Wizarding World, Defeater of Grindelwald, never received his Hogwarts Letter. Five years later, a 16-year-old Harry Potter is found on the streets of London and immediately sent to Hogwarts, where he catches the eye of one Professor Tom Riddle. When Harry is sorted into Slytherin, well... that just makes things a whole lot easier for him, doesn't it?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589][Evitative]] Classic Dark Harry fic. Drarry. Harry gets resorted and ends up in Slytherin. Features Dark Rituals, Dark magic, Sirius being awesome

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5745595][Sleeping somewhere cold]] Lucius has twin boys. Voldemort is asking for his servants' firstborn child. Thinking it's an honor; Lucius gives Voldemort the healthy child, Draco, who happens to be the younger twin. Harry grows up the black sheep of the Malfoy family and befriends Mudbloods and the boy-who-lived, Neville. Eventually, he ends up being disowned from the Malfoy family. Things spiral out of control when Voldemort finds out Harry is the firstborn. He'll stop at nothing to get Harry on his side. After all, the ritual Voldemort wants to use will not work without Harry. For the Dark Lord wants to eat off the children's magic once they are of age.

  HP/LV Slow Burn. Major AU. Orphaned and having no tolerance for Muggles, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by both the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. His loyalty, however, is not to the Ministry nor to the Death Eaters, but to the cause of bettering himself and becoming his own force in the Wizarding world. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

  "A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped in front of a bench and turned to look at the being. "A second chance at what?" "Life."Harry laughed bitterly. "Because that has worked out so great the first time?"Death tilted its head. "You've changed," it stated."Life does that to you," Harry said and his mind felt clearer than ever, "Or should I say the last seven years. I never really left this place, have I? I lived a life feeling not quite dead and not alive either," he spat. "I know how you feel," Death said after a moment, grinning."Oh, do you," Harry retorted and pierced Death with a look. The being's smirk widened as it leaned closer."Bored." Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.
