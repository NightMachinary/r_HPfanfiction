I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] and I do so love this fic. What I like about this story, and I'm looking for others similar to it, are the whole loops of time travel that go back for hundreds of years before closing, and how Harry (Jasmine in this fic) deals with being thousands of years old in the 20th century.

Other fics I've found that are similar are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8337871/1/The-Wizard-from-Earth][The Wizard From Earth]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time to Spare]].


** Well, all those fics seem great, I somehow missed all but time to spare, I'm going to check them out after I finish the fic I'm on (Of Wands and Kuani, a Naruto and HP crossover.)

Anyway, to answer your question, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966314/1/DOOM-Day][DOOM Day]], quite good, it's a loop set on the day Harry and gang (the "Ministry Six") go to the Department of Mysteries to rescue Sirus from voldyshorts.

He trains, and trains hard, in ways I hadn't ever seen in any other fanfiction, goes a little crazy at times, and eventually figures out how to bring in others. It's one of my favorite HP fan fictions, and about as an unconventional ending as possible, never seen a time loop story end this way before.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8218585/1/A-Goa-uld-s-Life][A goa'uld's Life]], where Harry absorbs the hocrux, gets cocky, and Dumbledore hits a time turner he's wearing with a spell, sending him an extremely long time in the past, gets a Goa'uld in the throat as you can likely guess, and he lives through the millennia, attempting to conquer the universe.

*** Thanks for the recommendations! I'll update my comment as I read through them with feedback :)

A Long Journey Home is one of my favourite fan-fictions at the moment, up there with The Lie I've Lived and Stages of Hope.

Edit 1: I've not really understood a lot of the first few chapters of A Goa'uld's Life, but that's because I've never watched/read and Stargate SG1. I'll probably skip it.

Edit 2: Stayed up til 3am to finish DOOM Day, and I still can't find an uncensored version :( but it was a fun read, if a little confusing in the later chapters because it jumped around timeframes a bit and I didn't understand why.
