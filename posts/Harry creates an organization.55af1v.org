Hello!

I would like to know if there are any fics where Harry creates an organization, recruiting people in it.

This organization could be something like a research team dedicated to discover new kinds of magic, or using muggle technology with magic. Or other things like that.

No "light" organization please, only grey or dark, as I don't want it to be chained by regulations.

Thanks.

  Oneshot from Ron's POV. Ron tries to explain to the twins just how Harry made the Ministry of Magic make a new classification for magical creatures, and why the puffskeins were now considered the scariest magical creature of all time. No pairings.

  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-
