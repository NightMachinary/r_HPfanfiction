This would be a crossover with Batman: The Animated Series. Batman would have known her just before the flashback scenes in Mask of the Phantasm. Her parents find out about their relationship, and attempt to have him killed. But even teenage Bruce is faster than an oridnary human. He escapes, vowing in a letter he left to her to return one day. But, of course, he got caught up in being Batman, which meant he was not there to prevent her from starting to hate muggles, which was in part motivated by him seemingly abandoning her. He finally returns to Great Britain during season 4 of BTAS, also known as The new Batman Adventures. The fic would explore the complex relationship between Batman and the new Bellatrix.

What do you all think?


** Batman would kick her ass and arrest her while brooding and angsting the whole time about how it was all his fault and just one more regret forhis long list.

Honestly, she tortured and murdered innocents, Bruce tolerates Selina because she just steals stuff, Talia is very complicated but she still has morals, and even then, he would take her in if he could.

With Bellatrix, he would just get extremely angsty and snap her wand before sending her to prison.

By this point, he had met Zatanna and IIRC Dr.Fate the latter of which would solo Voldy and his Death Eaters.

*** How would Superman handle her in the same situation? BTW, he's not weak to magic. It would affect him and Batman equally.

**** +Depends on who's writing+ A realistic Superman, would depend on how was his relationship with Bella, he might try to 'reform' people, but he's not as naive as some people make him be, he's thrown people in the Phantom Zone for less than what Bella and Co. have done.

It would also depend on how well informed he is about magic, if he doesn't want to be hit, he won't be hit, period. HP Wizards are peak human to slightly above in reflexes, and Superman is just way too fast.

***** Fun fact: In The White Knight, Joker is reformed, and Batman goes evil. I think something similar COULD be possible here, but I haven't read The White Knight. Joker, obviously, is far more evil than the Death Eaters. He doesn't even have a motivation, he just kills and tortures while gleefully laughing. To quote the Nostalgia Critic, 'He's in Nirvana, Nirvana on a rollercoaster'.

It's...a lot more complicated than that, it's a good Batman story, but Batman doesn't go evil, he just never trusts that the Joker was reformed(it's not actually the Joker but the personality he was before he became the Joker).

We could have classical brainwash!Bellatrix and Batman kicking the crap out of the Lestranges.

******* Or, have her be on Hate Potion. Like love potion, only it makes you hate something.

***** You could in theory handwave even an /Avada Kedavra/ on Superman. Superman's survived death so many times, and /All Star Superman/ basically says that even if Superman dies, he becomes a sun god.

****** Eh, I wouldn`t go so far, maybe with kryptonian armor, magic affects Superman the same way it does humans most of the times. Sure if people use a cutting curse or bombarda it should bounce off easily.

People who would be immune to AK would probably be Diana, Dr. Fate, Thor, who aren`t Mortals per se. Dr. Strange would probably have a magical shield who could take it, guy has a magical shield who can absorb much worse.

******* I was actually thinking of Bellatrix taking the old quote from Marcus Aurelius about how the 'best revenge is to be unlike him who did the injury'. IE, becoming the opposite of Bruce in everyway.
