So, I'm looking for fics with a murder mystery in a locked-in scenario. The classic 'bunch of people are in a mansion, one gets ganked and the others can't leave until they solve it' sort of deal (the mansion is negotiable, though :D). Essentially, it's as the title says - I'm looking for a fic with a Cluedo-style Whodunnit. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

PS - And yes, Clue is only Clue in America, everywhere else it's Cluedo. I didn't know why, but apparently it's the same as Sorcerer-Philosopher's Stone - the publishers thought Americans would be confused by the British references and changed it with the belief it would sell better under the other name. Every link I found on the first page google search agreed, so I'm taking it as valid for now, but I don't know for certain.

  'When Pratt sold his game to Waddington's, he named it Cluedo, a blend of clue and Ludo, the name of a 19th century board game that's Latin for ‚ÄúI play.‚Äù When Parker Brothers picked up the rights to the game in America in 1949, they shortened it to Clue since Americans had no knowledge of the Ludo game.'

** I don't recall any such fics myself, and would question how to go about making an HP-style Cluedo fic...

I mean, magic tends to obviate a lot of the mystery with Whodunnits. Magic leaves traces which wizards are capable of finding and tracking.

Even if no magic was used, there are still liable to be spells which can point out who last used what as well as confirm what people were doing when.

It's less cerebreal, and more "we use magic to find the clues, and then use magic on the clues to find the culprit."

‚Äã

However, if there /is/ an HP fic done in the Cluedo-sytle of Whodunnit, I'd be very much interested in giving it a read too!

So, have them muddy it somehow - maybe casting a whole bunch of spells makes it difficult to separate them out, or something akin to planting random magical signals that overpowers the spell. Maybe there are spells to fog-up the clues somewhat and frame other people - or more prosaic tactics, like perhaps people with very similar wands can use them, but really badly (so a cutting curse might be more of an axe-hack than a sword-swipe).

Or just have the murder be committed with an actual weapon - can't trace magic that isn't cast. Someone sneaks in with an invisibility cloak, knifes the victim, then leaves.

Or maybe they're stuck somewhere with no wands or that suppresses spellcasting (which plot-wise could be what provides the killer a chance to strike).

And yes, assuming they don't have immediate access to Veritaserum. That potion is just ridiculously OP.

** I'll read it if there are three potential endings...

I suppose you could restructure the question to be any good HP murder mysteries but I still think you'd have little to no options. ‚òπÔ∏è I'd definitely be interested! I read one Hermione/Theo mystery fanfic but it was so laughably obvious it didn't cut it for me.

Also, it's also "Clue" in Canada. üòä

*** Really? Clue in Canada? Huh. Google lied to me. :D

I've only read one actual murder mystery - that one where Narcissa finds Harry and returns him to the Wizarding world to play investigator (which has some special term in the WW that was also the name of the fic) because Draco had been accused of murdering someone (Cho Chang, I think?). It wasn't bad, actually. Can't remember the title, but it wasn't immediately laughably obvious who the culprit was, so... might be worth hunting down.

And three potential endings, huh? Well, AO3 technically allows Choose-Your-Own-Adventure stories, so... could be workable.

**** What, AO3 allows WHAT now??? I must investigate this. Holy crap.

Yeah, the three potential endings refers to the Clue film - have you seen it? If not, you're totally missing out. It's Tim Curry in his heyday. An absolute classic.

***** Yep. They're not as good as they sound, unfortunately, but they're workable enough to be fun. There's a tutorial on it below, if you're interested on how it apparently works.

Ah, okay. I have not, actually. My Tim Curry experience is mostly his Rocky Horror, Discworld, and Legend end of things. I'll check it out. That man is a delight in every incarnation. Could totally see him as a Doctor (as in Who) at some point.

EDIT - sorry, pressed send too early, forgot to add everything after the link.
