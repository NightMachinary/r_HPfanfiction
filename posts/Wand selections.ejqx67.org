It always seems that when a custom wand is made the go to process is wave your hand over these and pick out the ones that feel right.

What other more creative and unique procedures for choosing wand parts are there?


** I personally like the idea of someone raising the magical creature that comes to them either through some spell or ritual, for a set length of time (new moon to new moon, perhaps) in order to secure a perfectly loyal wand, that will never work for someone else.

** Well, in the same way as there are rectal thermometers, I suppose it's possible to stick a wand where the sun doesn't shine. It's probably inappropriate for everything but crackfics, though.

** Is it even needed? Voldemort has a normal wand and unless you went your protaginst to be more powerful a normal wand is enough in my opinion

** one of my OCs that i'm slowly writing into a fic made his wand out of a dead enemy's femur and iron extracted from his own blood, so there's always that.
