I am writing a fic where this happens.

The Nazis win World War II, in a world where Grindelwald never existed. Its a scenario born out of a visual novel I've been reading.

German Wizards align themselves with the NSDAP, due to its Anti-Bolshevikism. They help the Nazis win against both the Western allies and the Soviet Union(In the visual novel, the Soviet leader is Nikolai Bukharin, one of many former soviet leaders killed by Stalin). The ICW's General Assembly is destroyed by the Nazi Wizards, with every delegate and magical leader killed in a magical explosion.

By the end of 1945, the very CONCEPT of the Wizarding World is effectively gone.

The former Allies integrate their wizarding governments with their non-magical counterparts. Wizards in the Organization of Free Nations(The organization the allies created at the end of the war), and the areas of the world under neither the Allies nor the Axis come out of hiding. The two worlds integrate. The Wizards literally have no choice. Germany exposed the Wizarding World and eliminated their only means of keeping the muggles unaware of them.

What I am wondering for my fic is this: What might this world look like? What might a united Muggle-Wizarding world, held together by hatred of fascism look like?

*** Okay, maybe I exagerated. That's not the ONLY thing holding them together. The two worlds have learned to work togetehr. To integrate their tech with their magic. The OFN is a Star-trek style utopia. I guess the Reich would be like 1984 on steroids.

**** You think the US could withstand the Nazi power, after both Britain and Russia being defeated? You think the Wizard Supremacists within the MACUSA could withstand the allure of Grindelwald's Greater Good?

At least the on the Muggle side, things would look something [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUWHskLEses][like that]]

***** Grindelwald was never born in this world. The US surrendered to Japan after Germany gave them an a-bomb, which they then used on Oahu.
