*** What magic besides the patronus does Harry do that puts him in the advanced/powerful category?

**** Dumbledore also calls his Summoning Charm "Mastered" (Rosmerta's Brooms), Harry also cast two of the Unforgivables when even Fake Moody says 3 years earlier that Harry's class "Wouldn't have the power to give him a nose bleed" even with a AK.

***** I really don't believe Harry "mastered" the summoning charm. He spent a few weeks working on it, if even that. To say he mastered it is kinda silly. And I wouldn't call the summoning charm an advanced and powerful magic.

Neither are the unforgivables. Harry uses /Imperio/ right the first time, I think it's safe to say it's not a hard spell to get right. /Crucio/ just requires you to really mean to cause pain. /Avada Kedavra/ requires you to really want that person's death. I wouldn't call any of them advanced by any means.

****** I think you are over simplifying the Unforgivables. The whole point to them is that you have to want the effects, and believe them. Imperio requires the caster to want to enslave, dominate and control the mind of the victim. The Cruciatus requires you to want to hurt someone, and enjoy their pain and suffering, so much so that you would do it even without the efficiency of the magic. The Avada Kedavra requires you to want to kill someone, that you truely believe that someone deserves to die, and that you are going to kill them. It can't be out of self-defense, or righteous anger, because those are not the right mindsets. You have to understand that you are permanently depriving someone of their life. I would honestly expect only morally bankrupt people, or psychopaths to be capable of the curse.

I honestly think you are falling into the same trap as Harry at the end of the fifth book, assuming that all that is required is that you want it, when in reality, it requires that you actually be willing to do it in cold blood.

****** Hell, even if he did, then he "mastered" what? The Patronus, the disarming charm, the summoning spell and that's it? Even if doing so took him months, what did he do otherwise, you can only play wizards chess with Ron so often :( especially if you are always losing (mastering so few spells implies a low tolerance for frustration, so Harry wouldn't play Ron that often!)

Hell, Bart Simpson is a fucking overachiever compared to Harry (and it's not like Voldemort was after him every hour of every day for years...hell, especially if he had been, then he should have tried to prepare more for an encounter (the Patronus doesn't work on Dark Lords, neither does a disarmer (Priori Incantatem is a damned cop-out IMHO!) or a summoner, so in essence Harry is defensless without plot-armor (Priori Incantatem effect)...nice going, Potter! See you in the next life! Hey, maybe you can challeng Voldemort to Wizards Chess? :( )

ps: I like neither Snape nor Draco Malfoy, but they sometimes are (sadly!) right about Harry, he often rests on his laurels (Snape!) and if the universe were fair (and he didn't have plot-armor!) then the Dark Lord would end him easily and be done with it (Draco)

I really prefer a normal hero's journey over success through being a meek underachiever who won't even stand up for himself in most cases (I'd have complained to McGonagall/Dumbledore and even the Board of Gouvernors about Snape, because what that guy does is NOT teaching!)

******* Yeah, it's something that always bothered me. Supposedly, not many adults can even cast a patronus and Harry chases away 100 dementors at the age of 13. But then it seems like Rowling decided to make Harry be incredibly average. I mean, if I was him, if I spend a god damn decade in a cupboard, I'd be ecstatic over magic. I'd be learning anything I could. And don't even get me started on Voldemorts return. You'd think he'd try a bit harder in 5th year. ESPECIALLY in 6th year. Albus tells Harry that he needs to be the one to kill Voldemort and Harry doesn't give a fuck.

** Not really, I asked this a while ago. JKR alludes to nonverbal spells, animagus, super pranking, secret passage ways, awesome transfiguration, original spell creation, discoveries of shortcuts (hbp) in potions etc. and yet Harry is like...meh I don't really care to overachieve.

I've wanted to write a fic where he and Neville get sorted into hufflepuff and become determined to work hard.

I think the general consensus is they are literally seventeen when they are done, who is fully developed at 17? But my argument is why would JKR allude to all these awesome things and then have Harry explore NONE of it. /rant

*** Just because he and or Neville are Hufflepuffs, does not mean they will automatically start working hard, because it's "in their nature". I mean, Cho wasn't a genius at Magic (partly why she joined the DA) just because she was a Ravenclaw.

I think that a Harry who is ritually bullied by his house, hexed in the halls by members of his house, and is verbally lambasted by both members of his house and teachers, would be more likely to attempt to rise above them and show them up by being the prodigy we all want, and there is only house that fits this descriptor, Slytherin. If you want a Powerful Protagonist, you have to make him alone to do it, it's almost a rule of thumb in all literature. And who will an alone, friendless prodigy, attract most of all? +Oldmen!+ Dumbledore. This could be a good stepping stone for a Mentor!Dumbledore fic.

**** True. In regards to hufflepuff I meant more that they would work hard not because hufflepuff works hard as a house but because the chosen one was put in the "worst" house and would likely be ridiculed. I think Neville would mainly be there as a friend who helps Harry on his way

**** That would be great, I'd read it - especially since a Slytherin Harry would not totally agree with Dumbledore all the time (IMHO a mentor/student relationship is greater if mentor and student aren't on the same page all the time!) because his very house would expose him to different ideas and ideals than what Dumbledore believes in!

Sadly most Slytherin Harry fanfictions have Dumbledore either forsake Harry (as in ignoring him like in book 5, at least until he does something like save the stone in year 1) or try to control him (which Harry of course fights!)

***** Not too sure about the lack of trust, in fact, Harry would likely trust Dumbledore *more* than in canon, because that will be his only friend. I imagine that Dumbledore will, however, force Harry to get friends in a way, by either directly creating collisions with him and other students, or he will make it a mission of sorts.

*** I totally agree - I mean I could understand it if Harry is weak at say Transfiguration (because he doesn't really care for the subject - at least until he learns about animagi and that his father was an animagus, IMHO Harry should have gone at it with a vengeance to learn enough to be able to become an animagus (as a link to his father and later on: Sirius and Remus!)), but Harry is also not all that great at charms and saying that he's better in defense than his year mates is saying NOTHING (especially when his most used spell in book seven is still a fucking disarming charm, how he ever thought he could fight Voldemort with THAT (!) is beyond me! Even if he might manage to disarm the Dark Lord, then Voldemort would either use wandless magic (which is part of canon if I remember correctly - there's even cultures that still teach that to kids, which is IMHO great...over-reliance on wands is kind of stupid!) or sick his DEs on Harry (so in the end Harry would be just as dead!))

Harry is IMHO almost completely lacking any sense of wounder (which should make people work hard to be able to do it themselves one day, I mean plenty of students in RL these days are fascinated by physics, maths etc. and study hard to go into those fields and magic IMHO would have much more of a draw, because in the very first fucking charms lesson you learn to freaking tell gravity to fuck off!), kind of makes me sad for him!

** Isn't this basically an oxymoron? Overpowered Harry stories usually have have him steamrolling people. Overpowered, but a cautious Harry isn't a thing unless we're talking about something like time travel as it was in Faery Heroes because Harry, Luna and Hermione needed to keep their ages long, skill and involvement with the fae a secret.
