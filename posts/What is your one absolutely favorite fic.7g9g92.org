****** FWIW, Seventh Horcrux gets much better as the story goes on. First few chapters are a bit simple.

The main appeal, I think, is that the main character is essentially one step below insane, but that everything still ends up working and staying internally consistent. The writing gets more complex as well, with foreshadowing, callbacks, more complicated (but not confusing) plots, and so on.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) I like it for its worldbuilding and for the characters. How it takes a trope where Voldemort is usually portrayed as someone who just crucios everyone for no reason (usually to the point where it's surprising that anyone actually follows him) and humanizes him and reverses your perspective on some things. I like how most of the time it's not super dark, but full of light moments and humour that is balanced with seriousness when needed.

** /Applied Cultural Anthropology/ by jacobk.

For those who haven't read it, it's a Slytherin!Hermione story, but written without the usual garbage you'd expect. No "I'm a real pure-blood now" background, no terrible shipping, no unearned acceptance by her house ... I could go on about it for a while since I'm a total shill for this fic, but I won't. Instead, I'll just say that I really love it because it's about Hermione [[/spoiler][becoming a Muggle-born parallel to Tom Riddle.]]

linkffn(9238861)

And, yes, the listed characters are Hermione and Snape, but that's not at all a pairing. He's more of ... an unwilling mentor, if anything.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Sorry [[/u/Ihateseatbelts][u/Ihateseatbelts]], but I'm going to go with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone) (I flipped a coin).

It features many of the things I look for in a fic: Good/Great worldbuilding, subtle/involved magic that isn't intent based, Harry living up to his strengths (his drive, his ability to rise to complex challenges, etc.), character development, a realistic point of departure from canon (applicable to point of departure or near-canon fics only) and a highly entertaining plot.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** I have at least ten or fifteen favorites, but since it's one only today Imma go with linkffn(Messing with Time). It doesn't get much love on this sub because it's not very complete, and it's not super unique, but it's the perfect blend of everything that I like. Time-travel, OP harry who can kick ass and run circles around his opponents but is not insufferable and is still very vulnerable, some fix-it with Sirius rescue, great humor, great writing, and even a few angsty moments when people Harry admires think he's evil. It's pretty cracky in places but you are genuinely scared for Harry in other places.

It's the fic that made me want to write my own fics. If I could choose one fic to be finished by the author, it'd be between "Messing With Time" and "C'est la Vie".

Now he is eleven again, nothing is going the same as before, and people are starting to ask questions, especially the Malfoys, the Hogwarts professors and, most worryingly, Mad-Eye Moody. Harry is beginning to suspect that he might not be up to this Master of Death business and everything that goes along with it.

It's probably never going to be finished, but I can't stop thinking about it. Can there be a happy ending in this messed up world? Why are humans so awful? I feel like the inversion of characters is so well done and plausible, and I love the creation of a different version of mudblood.

I have considered writing an ending just so I can stop thinking about it all the time. Sigh.

It's the first Slytherin!Harry I've read that doesn't seem unbelievable, where Harry has friends and isn't an outcast or immediately somehow king of Slytherin. The conflicts that develop flow naturally and are believable. Unfortunately it hasn't updated in quite some time. :( But it's still worth it!

**** 1) There's no sexual predator like grooming. All that's happened in this fic is that Harriet has a crush on him towards the end of it with Snape being horrified and disgusted. The romance starts gearing up in the sequel, and this is very much gen.

2) The summary literally says Future Snape/Harriet. There are also multiple warnings in the author's note before the first chapter itself so I have no idea why the pairing is a surprise to you.

** Right, I'm late to the game, but I'm going to have to go with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire][/Time is the Fire/]] by Oddment Tweak. It's a rare Harry/Hermione story where not only are Ron and the other Weasleys not bashed, but he actually comes off as a really great guy. It starts with the epilogue, but then moves both forwards and backwards with some really great time travel, but again, not in the typical manner - there's no creepy, 100 year old wizards going back into the bodies of 11 year-olds. There's one part during the camping-for-horcruxes trip that gets a little too angsty, but other than that it's absolutely epic.

** circular reasoning - very slow updates bit it's pretty long and worth the read

It's action heavy, quality world building and an enjoyable plot :D

kinda dark tho

linkffn(circular reasoning)

I'd also have to say twist of fate

It's one of the few good long fics about my man Harry and Tom growing up as brothers.

also a little dark

edit: the slash doesn't come near till the end of the fic. I don't think there's anything between Tom and Harry though if you're into that sort of stuff

Hope I linked it right :x

** Call Me.

After reading the 100th variant of the same three plots this one is a great break. No marriage contracts, no creature inheritances, no OP magic or animagus forms, no bashing, no evil Dumbledore, just magical teenagers doing teenage stuff. This story has great characterization and believable protagonists while avoiding the "common mistakes" you see all too often.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] is definitely my favorite story. I read this early in my journey into fanfiction, it confused the shit out of me. Several rereads later and I'd say it's probably my favorite piece of Harry Potter fanfiction, although I'm likely forgetting a few.

--------------

I had a few others I debated over, Circular Reasoning was definitely my favorite story, but a few others came to mind, I'd argue these are my favorite humor story, my favorite one-shot, and my favorite crossover respectively. In the event it wasn't clear *Circular Reasoning* is my favorite, the following stories are basically honorary mentions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts][The Thief of Hogwarts]], I always see Seventh Horcrux linked, but never this, in fact I've never seen this linked here once. I personally think this is one of the better humor stories, I would say best, but it's incomplete and dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/Concentric-Wavelengths][Concentric Wavelengths]], I'd rate this as my favorite one-shot, the only real contender for that position is a ~400 word batman crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12595819/1/Getting-Too-Old-For-This][Getting Too Old For This]], definitely my favorite HP crossover, although I can name 10 better crossovers, they just lack HP content. I suspect this came to mind mostly because it's active an

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and eventual sexy shenanigans, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

** I know this will not be a popular opinion but I will add here linkffn(2027554)

I love all characters in here - Harry, Lucius, Snape, Lupin, Dumbledore, Ron, Draco.. All of them feel right

The story is not too long, it is focused, everything written there is for a reason. Development of characters is superb. Author is showing rather than telling which is rare. It is finished and well concluded. I've read this many years ago and yet, I will always remember it and I'm unlikely to forget it (and I forget a lot of fics :-).

** Completed Fics: The Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs

Darth Marrs is incredible. What can I say; it's very well written and the best AU I've came across. A unique plot and a gripping (albeit dark) portrayal of the Wizarding World.

WIP: Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by leadvone

If this fic ever gets going and finishes I'd imagine it'd overtake the above. So far it's excellent and my most anticipated to update thus far. Highly recommend.

** Not a single Dramione fic? That's bad. Dramione is an integral part of the Harry Potter fanfic-verse whether you accept it or not.

I nominate Broken. linkffn(4172243) Sheer brilliance. And well loved in the Dramione community.

My personal favourite though is this not-so-well-known fic called Mugglefied. linkffn(11079134) No needless antagonism of popular characters, no melodrama, just a simple romance set in an intriguing setting of a wizard forced to lead the life of a muggle

** linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday) is one of my favorites that hasn't been mentioned here yet. It's a great, absolutely hilarious, canon-compliant fanfic for a first time reader.

** linkffn(8096183)

Sorry if I am a little late to the show, but this is definitively my very favorite HP fic. It /is/ a crossover, though, so I don't know if it counts. The author recently posted a chapter after a 3 year hiatus, but hasn't uploaded along the normal schedule since, so I don't really know what is going on with that, but eh, I love it anyways.

** linkffn(Slytherin's Potter by animeaddict56)

I love the extensiveness, the emotion, everything. I raged with Lily Luna when she did, I loved practically everything about this fiction.

*** I've read some of this and while the family drama is entertaining (and strangely compelling), characterization falls a little... flat. It reads a bit like Lily and her circle are actual characters while their enemies are basically evil asshole plot devices.

** The Code by Aduro. It's an AU starting in sixth year where Draco is a genius (secretly). And I know, that right there sounds pretty awful but man this story just hit all the right notes for me. Unlike other Draco-centric stories, it doesn't just have him suddenly switching to the 'light' side to make him likeable but she actually makes him slowly and rationally reconsider all the things that his family has taught him. With the help of Bill Weasley no less, who is on campus as a Ancient Runes professor. This story is the start of a four story arc (total warning the fourth story appears to be abandoned - for now, this happened during the third story and the author returned after a couple years). And yes, there are some tropes but ugh, I just love this story so much. I've reread the entire series so many times now. linkffn(2750775)
