*** I've read that fic several times. I still can't remember a single detail of it.

Not sure if that's good or bad about the fic itself

**** It may be a symptom of DisobedienceWriter's stories somehow being quite enjoyable despite a lack of any sense of real challenge to their protagonists.

***** Probably. /+Knowledge Is power+ Knowledge Is useful, but power Is power/ also left me with a similar feeling.

On the other hand, Robst doesn't know what Challenge Is, and yet their stories are easy to remember.

****** I think it's less about challenge and more about the lack of actual conflict. The things he did were interesting... but there wasn't conflict because everything was just presented to him on a platter via the Flamels. Still, I found the story enjoyable lol

******* /u/[[https://www.reddit.com/user/will1707/][will1707]] and [[/u/hrmdurr]] i think in writing class they teach it as tension. whether it is a challenging to the protagonist as hurdles to overcome, clues to solve or angst to resolve or something else. i think quite a few mainstream authors sometimes lack in this bit and just about all hp fanfics are lacking true tension to make the story flow

******** Um, those examples you gave? Two out of three are conflict. Conflict is man vs man, man vs environment, man vs self etc. Clues, and foreshadowing, and things like that are tension - tension realized is conflict.

The fic in question is lacking in both, tbh. I mean, they're there: will he/won't he get caught staying at Hogwarts for the summer, will he/won't he find his properties, and so on. But they're... The story isn't really about conflict, it's just a mildly interesting journey/coming of age without any real obstacles.

********* Thanks. Conflict and tension then, two key ingredients to a good story. Would you say an Agatha Christie poirot is a man Vs self?

********** It's possible? I've never read Agatha Christie tbh - straight up mysteries have never really been my thing.

A famous example of man vs self would be Hamlet and the whole 'to be or not to be' thing - he's struggling with depression and considering suicide. There's also some dude that he's conflicted about murdering, but I don't remember the details at this point lol. Another would be pretty much the entire Fight Club book.

But yeah - you absolutely need both. I haven't taken a writing class before (it didn't fit my schedule back in high school), but my lit classes all focused on conflict over tension. Or at least they didn't call it out beyond the odd discussion about foreshadowing.

****** FYI RobSt has decided to readdress Knowledge is Power saying that his writing style has changed (I believe Knowledge was his first story). The revised/rewritten story is called Proud Parents.
