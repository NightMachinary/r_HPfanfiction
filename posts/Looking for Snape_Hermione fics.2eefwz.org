and this person's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eharmonybites][favorites list]] has a lot of good ones.

I get kind of burnt out on the pairing from time to time, but /Survivors/ is beautifully written and nicely in-character.

*** Yeah I get what you mean by getting burnt out, but then I switch to Draco/Hermione which I feel is the same but younger (if that makes any sense)

** I'm just going to link you to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2797253/RaseyafromRavenclaw][my favorites page]]. The /vast/ majority of those fics are HGSS and of decent quality. Out of them I would suggest: (long fics)\\
The Problem with Purity\\
The Twenty\\
Accountable\\
When the Lioness Hunts\\
Antigone\\
Heart over Mind

(short fics)\\
Baring It All\\
Broken Bird\\
By the Book\\
Enraptured

and so on

** I enjoyed the author Subversa back when I liked Snape/Hermione. She's on Mugglenet FanFiction and Fanfiction.net. Last I saw all of her stuff was definitely on MN. Master of Enchantment was her main series- one chaptered fic with some smaller stories following.
