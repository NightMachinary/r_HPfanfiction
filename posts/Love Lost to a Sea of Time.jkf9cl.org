I'm looking for any fics that do the following:

- Character is in a positive romantic relationship
- Character Time Travels to their past (Either into their younger body or separate)
- Because of the nature of time travel, the past relationship is no longer possible or desirable
- Character mourns the loss

Bonus

- Character time traveled knowing that this was the likely outcome, for the greater good.

Honestly, I think this would be a nice, positive setup to have non-standard relationships w/o having to bash all over existing characters.

What I'm not looking for:

- Character travels so far the original relationship isn't a possibility. (Ie, Hermione/Harry goes to the Marauder Era). That is just a standard 'you had a love back home you can't go back to' story.
- Stories that struggle with this but the original relationship wins out
- Stories this is merely mentioned but the character doesn't actually have to deal with the loss.

â€‹

Two that come to mind that sort of, but not quite meet this criteria is:

- A Little Child Shall Lead Them: Hermione came to the past knowing that doing so might mean she never gets together with Harry, and it clearly pains her. However, the story eventually has her get back together with Harry after they grow up, so it is a 'happily ever after'. (Can't be much of a sacrifice if you don't have to actually sacrifice)
- There was one where Harry found himself accidently in the past, and become defense processor and has to deal with the loss of Ron/Hermione's friendship, as they just didn't go through with him what his Ron/Hermione went through. It was done very well (and I think Ginny was mentioned here as well). However, the focus was more on the friendship loss and Harry didn't really spend too much time dealing with it, the focus was more on Ron/Hermione dealing with it. This is the closest to what I want that I've seen before.
- Red Knight: Ron deals with this a bit, particularly with Hermione hating his guts.\\

Don't think this is exactly what you're looking for, but it's a great time travel fic and one of my favourite fics of all time.

Harry mourns then loss of his friends to an extent but not a relationship.
