To give a bit of insight, the fic revolves around Snape and a person he meets while being imprisoned in Azkaban. The problem I'm running into, though, is that SOOO many things happen involving him between the 1996 and 1997 school years that it's hard to pinpoint when he would have been imprisoned (with as little detriment to the main story line as possible). I have a few ideas, but I thought I'd recruit some help.

My first thought was that he could be arrested at the same time as Lucius Malfoy and the other Death Eaters after the battle in the Department of Mysteries, but from what I've read in the HP wikis (timelines and whatnot), Voldemort doesn't break him out until almost a year later, which puts him out for FAR too much of the story. My second thought is that he could be captured either before or after he is tasked with killing Dumbledore, but then rises the problem of how he would escape Azkaban. THEN I thought, 'well, if I do it /after/ he kills Dumbledore, Voldemort would want to break him out of prison so he could gain control of the Elder Wand, right?'

So... any experts willing to lend me a hand, here? :3


** He could be arrested at the same time as Lucius Malfoy and then released a month later after Dumbledore intercedes. That's long enough for him to meet someone and sustain some Azkaban damage, but not too much.

*** Ooh, I'd love a second opinion on this, but that sounds really promising. Thank you, I hadn't even thought of that!

**** In the main storyline, Dumbledore did keep him from Azkaban. After the events of OotP, he would need around a month to consolidate his political power, given how quickly peoples opinion is changed in the HP Universe. Dumbledore's first act would be to get Snape out of prison. After all you can not fight a war with no intel. Snape would then run to Voldemort and proclaim how he tricked Dumbledore into releasing him from Azkaban, ect. That idea would definitely work

** You could do it anytime while Dumbledore is still alive, just have an overenthusiastic Auror bring him in because they catch a glimpse of his Mark or see him clutch his forearm when Voldemort summons him, or have Voldemort force him to participate in some attack or another where he gets caught. Then Dumbledore talks quietly to the right people to get him released, but it takes... however long you want it to take.

** If it doesn't need to be recent, there's scope for Snape to have been arrested some time soon after the fall of Voldemort, and to have actually been in prison for a few weeks prior to Dumbeldore giving evidence on his behalf to the Wizengamot.
