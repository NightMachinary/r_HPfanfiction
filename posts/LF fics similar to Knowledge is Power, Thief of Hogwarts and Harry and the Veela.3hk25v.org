** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is new and really good, updating regularly even though it's taking a break for August. Ah, it's not Harry/Fleur if that's what you mean by similar, but it is Slytherin Harry/Wrong BWL.

#+begin_quote
  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

#+begin_quote
  What happens when a person loses one of the very last persons he can depend on and the others betray him. A fic where Harry explores the very depths of magic and attempts to find the cure to his mother's coma and become the most powerful wizard. Some chaps have paras from orig but it's being massively edited for that. Kickass, Independant Harry/ Dimension travel/ No slash
