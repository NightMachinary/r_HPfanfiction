I've been on a binge of... What I guess could be called "slice of life" fics with harry after the war and just living his life, but I don't immediately remember seeing anything where he decided to come back to Hogwarts for his final year after defeating Voldemort.

Does anyone have any recommendations around that idea? While I had in mind something along the humor or sweet bend I'm not opposed to any genre if it's a good read

*** They don't like slash fanfiction in this subreddit, speaking from personal experience, avoid recommending slash fics unless they ask for it, even then, they''' ask you to post in [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]

Otherwise you will get downvotes. It's not worth it.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** I have three versions:

1. [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War]] and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War]]

2. Series by [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewuser.php?uid=13604][Northumbrian]], which is a way longer, but for this time period, it is linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian;Grave Days by Northumbrian;Aurors and Schoolgirls by Northumbrian), unfortunately, exactly the latest one these three, which would cover whole the eigth year is WIP, unfinished, and most likely never to be finished. There are more one-shots from that year, which make some idea what that eighth should look like.

3. linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) it was my first large fanfiction, and as with everything there is only one first story ;). Very angsty (dealing with PTSD is a substantial part of the story) covers first two or three years after the war.

All of these stories are more or less canonical, all of them Hinny.

  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. On the third of May, 1998, Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals, love and loss. Grave Days.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

********* Sorry, I think we're talking about different roles.

A research assistant or intern in the US often does similar work to the researcher or full-time employee, at least from what I've seen in STEM.

I'm talking about a young, at most fresh out of Hogwarts Hermione working in a research lab. You don't give the head role to someone inexperienced.

For something Hogwarts age, she shouldn't be a plot device.

Remove the Buckbeak distraction and extra irrelevant classes, third year could be about piecing together what happened with Sirius Black back in 1981.

I want the research to be actively written.
