But why shouldn't they? It's not like they'd make the /ritual/ public; and so if someone still made a Horcrux that means records of the ritual still existed no matter what. But if people know Horcruxes are a thing, and how to destroy them, then if another Dark Wizard ever uses them to cheat death, people won't run around being terrified because their scourge just shrugged off a fundamental law of magic, they'll just say "yep, looks like he did that loathsome ritual I heard about in History of Magic, let me just fetch Gryffindor's Sword or some Basilisk Venom and we'll take a-care of this here bad boy".

****** It is true. This is an item of fanon that has got out of control - the idea that all horcruxes require the same amount of damage to destroy, and that there's a specific list of universal "horcrux destroyers". If a wizard did nothing to protect their horcrux, it could be destroyed by an average Reductor Curse.

Horcrux mechanics in full:

1. You can't directly affect a horcrux. That's the point of a horcrux. You can't kill a horcrux with a killing curse, a Dementor can't suck a horcrux out of its receptacle, and certainly there aren't any medical procedures that can extract it. Even when you do something to destroy the horcrux, like stabbing one of Voldemort's horcruxes with a basilisk fang, you're not directly affecting the soul piece. The basilisk venom doesn't kill the soul, it destroys the physical object, after which the soul must move on. *The only way to destroy a horcrux is to physically destroy the receptacle*.

2. Horcruxes don't have default invulnerability. Something being a horcrux does not in itself grant that object any special invulnerability to damage. The Dark wizard creating the horcrux must enchant the receptacle to resist damage separately from the process of making it a horcrux.

3. There isn't a default set of horcrux-protecting enchantments that all horcruxes possess. The wizard creating the horcrux puts the protections on the receptacle, and what things that wizard chooses to protect against depends on the wizard's choices and capabilities. *Different horcruxes will therefore be protected against different things*. This is what it means to put a horcrux beyond magical repair (and thus destroy it): *you put the horcrux beyond that horcrux's specific ability to magically repair*, not beyond some abstract concept of magical repair in general. Basilisk venom for example, does not necessarily put something beyond magical repair: if you have phoenix tears, you can repair the damage of basilisk venom. So the horcrux in Harry wasn't destroyed by basilisk venom, because he wasn't put beyond magical repair by it, but it does destroy the others because Voldemort didn't protect them against basilisk venom. It's specifically stated, however, that had Voldemort had access to phoenix tears, he would have been able to protect his horcruxes against basilisk venom. *Basilisk venom is not some set-in-stone horcrux-destroyer, it destroys horcruxes simply because the ingredient necessary to resist it is so rare*.

All of this was explained explicitly in Deathly Hallows chapter 6.

Horcrux being tied innately to its physical container:

#+begin_quote
  “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”

  “Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.” Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all.”

  ”Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,” said Ron. Harry laughed.

  “It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione. “But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. *The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival*. It can't exist without it.”
#+end_quote

Protections on a horcrux are put there separately by the Dark wizard making it:

#+begin_quote
  “No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”

  “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, “because *it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them*.
#+end_quote

Efficacy of basilisk fangs in destroying horcruxes depends on horcruxes not being protected against it, due to the rarity of its single counteracting force:

#+begin_quote
  "From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”

  “What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.

  “Oh well, lucky we've got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”

  “It doesn't have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be *something so destructive that the Horcrux can't repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it's incredibly rare* --“

  “-- phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.

  “Exactly,” said Hermione.
#+end_quote

That is, the rarity of phoenix tears is the reason why dark wizards cannot protect their horcruxes against basilisk venom. So if a dark wizard got their hands on phoenix tears they could do so (though we don't know how).

******* Okay, first of all, hi. Apparently having you tell me off, specifically, has been some unconscious aspiration of mine for some time.

Secondly... well, that's it, really. You're right. I don't often get so thoughourly put in my place in regards to Harry Potter canon. <3

In my defense though, if I may, I didn't pick this up from "fanon out of control". I understood everything properly except for the slight, but absolutely significant, difference that Horcrux's have no inherent protection.

/Before I go any further, please remember that "But Magic" is the obvious catch-all that defies any logic I'm about to throw at this, so if "But Magic" is something you consider a valid excuse, you may as well just stop reading here. I'm not being passive aggressive, I just mean "But Magic" can be liberally applied to quite a few things and if that's what we're going to come down to, you're just wasting your time by reading. This is just a heads up./

To be honest, I've always disagreed with Hermione on the idea that Phoenix Tears would be able to save a Horcrux. If you don't mind me explaining my thoughts.

Basilisk Venom obviously has to be not only an extremely lethal biological weapon, but it also has to be one hell of an acid. After all, Hermione destroyed Hufflepuff's Cup with just a tooth. Unlike the Diary which could just be stabbed through, the Cup was made of some type of /metal/. It's unlikely she stabbed /through/ the fucking thing with a /fang/. So she gets some of the venom on it and the venom eats away at it until its destroyed. Acid. Or-Something-Like-Acid.

Now, I can buy Phoenix Tears being able to restore your body as the acid from the venom is literally burning holes in your entire body while /also/ being a cure-all for poisons and venom, but how, exactly, would it go about repairing damage to non-biological material? Could you hit a piece of wood with a hatchet, tie the pieces together, and then trickle Phoenix Tears down the side and have it be like you never struck it? That... seems like a far-fetched property of something that also restores biological material, even for magic. The usage would be too vague.

So, the idea that a Horcrux could be repaired after being, essentially, melted into a puddle by Basilisk Venom, simply because you have some Phoenix Tears on hand is, at least in my opinion, fairly unlikely.

Of course, you could posit that, should you apply Phoenix Tears and make the venom inert quick enough before too much damage has been done, that the Horcrux would still be, if damaged, not completely destroyed.

Except we've seen Horcruxes (Horcruxi?) be destroyed /pretty much instantaneously/ after the application of the venom.

Just my thoughts on whether or not Phoenix Tears would be, contrary to Hermione's implication, a valid method to counteract the Basilisk Venom applied to a Horcrux. I'd love to have your feedback.

******** I think the idea is not that the dark wizard invents some kind of clever "phoenix tears release valve" which dowses the horcrux in the antidote after exposure to the venom. That would seem oddly mechanical for HP magic (and also very limited, as you could just stab it again, after the tears have been used up). Rather, I would speculate that there is some way for the dark wizard in question to use the phoenix tears to imbue the horcrux with resistance to basilisk venom, such that when the venom touches the horcrux, nothing happens.

With regards to the mechanism of action for the venom, I am not sure that I would agree with your framing of the matter (poison vs acid). I would be more inclined to characterise it as a magical force with certain properties, not acting via a physical mechanism.

(With regards to "but magic", I would note that there's a distinction to be drawn between saying that magic operates on its own, magical rules which do not resemble physical law, and saying that magic has no explanation at all. Not all explanations are mechanical.)

Sure. I'm not saying it /isn't/ a valid line of thought. Magic can also be symbolic, which can really muddy the waters in what you'd normally consider rational thought.

******* Eh... it's true that Voldemort likely designed the Diary to easily enable the possession to take place, but it doesn't seem clear that he intended Diarymort to fully consume the victim and embody himself. When describing his younger self's intentions, Diarymort says "so that I could lead another to complete Salazar Slytherin's noble work" (quoting from memory here). He later says he could now "escape the pages of [his] Diary at last". To me, it sounds like Voldemort designed the Diary to more easily allow possession, but Diarymort figured out how to fully escape and become his own person on his own because he was unhappy with his current state of being conscious, yet still an inanimate object. Though I /could/ be wrong.

Either way, whether or not the incarnation was part of Voldemort's design, whatever he did with the Diary does pretty clearly seem to only be /encouraging/ an affect that Horcruxes /could/ have in any event. Locketmort gains emotional hold over Ron in /Deathly Hallows/ much as Diarymort had over Ginny; yes, it was slower, less noticeable, but I do think it was the same phenomenon. Perhaps because the Diary had indeed been designed to help the process along, Locketmort never got to /quite/ possess Ron, only managing to plant certain ideas and moods in his head; but given enough time he /could/ have, and he nearly /does/ fully possess Ron just before it's destroyed (Harry can see Ron's eyes "flickering red", again if I recall correctly).

** Likely not. I like GMWWemyss's take - covered under the Official Secrets Act.
