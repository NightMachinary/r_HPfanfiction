After almost 3 years I have decided to try and pick up writing this fic again.

To summarize Never Tickle a Sleeping Dragon: It's a Draco centric story where he is offered a chance to start a new life in the Muggle World after the war. He then meets Sherlock and begins to reflect about his way of thinking about muggles.

Hopefully I don't drop it again since I genuinely still like this fic idea.

*** Oh, don't worry. There will figuratively be lots of tickling of a dragon. :)

***** Don't know. I guess I should clarify it's more of poking the dragon and seeing what happens.
