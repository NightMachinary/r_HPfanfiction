It's basically a /recursive fic/, continuing the Alexandra Quick series from Anna Chu's perspective. I'm honestly not experienced at all with writing, and would love some constructive criticism.


** Note: I'm not particularly fond of the AQ series, having struggled through only the first book and giving up. So my review may be rather biased.

Any proposed changes are just that- propositions. They're merely my suggestions. :-)

*Nitpicking*

Chapter 1

- Anna Chu looked behind +her+ one last time /The word "her" is superfluous/

- Her mother gave her a soft “goodbye, Anna” in return, and waved to her, while her father just nodded and said, “Be sure not to get into trouble.”

/Change to/ "Goodbye, Anna”, her mother said in return, waving to her, while her father merely nodded and reminded her to get into trouble.

- Anna turned around and ascended the few steps toward*[s]* the clearly exhausted bus driver...

- In fact, it was a rather boring trip across, as trips across the Invisible Bridge went.

/Change to/ In fact, it was a rather boring trip across, as far as trips across the Invisible Bridge /[were concerned]/.

Note: A Chinese name is a string of pictographs. The phonetic pronunciation of a pictogram when spelled out is supposed to be capitalized, something that non-Chinese writers often miss out. So it's supposed to be Jing Wei, not Jingwei.

Chapter 3

- He looked up at her, his eyes going momentarily wide, and greeted her with a surprised “Hey. Haven't seen you all week.”

/Change to/ He looked up at her, eyes momentarily widening. “Hey. Haven't seen you all week.”

- “I've been really busy. Sorry I didn't say hi to you sooner,” said Anna.

/Change to/ “I've been really busy. Sorry *[,]* I didn't say hi to you sooner,” said Anna.

- The Chinese characters on the page dried slowly, so Anna had to wait...

/Change to/ The inky brushstrokes on the page dried slowly, so Anna had to wait...

- In that span, Jingwei had come back...

/Change to/ During that time span, Jingwei had come back...

- She'd been holing herself up for the entire week, working away...

/Change to/ She'd been holed up by herself for the entire week, working away...

- she was the last scion of the Chu family in America. Dude, it's */either/* the /last/ or /scion/. Having double helpings of nuts doesn't make your hot fudge sundae any more delicious.

*Content*

- Too much recap in the first paragraph.

- You don't need so many brackets, just write it straight into the text.

- Overall it's not too bad, the quality and style is extremely similar to the original. I just don't care for Alexandra much, with all the oh-so-subtle Harry Potter similarities, but Anna's primness is quite well portrayed and likable. Keep on writing, it's the best way to improve!

In-"canon", it's Jingwei. I'm following Inverarity's convention. I've studied Mandarin for 4 years, and I know the Romanisation rules...

But thanks for the feedback! I shall definitely make some changes. You should read the second and third and fourth books, if only because their quality is better than the first one.

**** Okay, it just drives me crazy when I see that kind of name, because I don't usually encounter that kind of "mistake" where I live. #grammar nazi
