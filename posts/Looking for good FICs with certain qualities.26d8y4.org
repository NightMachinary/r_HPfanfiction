I Have been reading Fanfics from about a year or so, and I'm looking for good fics to read with certains qualities, I have read the 'popular' stuff on fanfiction (most if it is shit) and also have read some that aren't as popular

My favorites right now are: Everything by Northumbrian (currently following strangers at drakeshaugh), Harry Potter and the Natural 20, Innocent and Initiate by MaraunderLover7 (Maybe one of the best Sirius Rises Harry+Harry/Draco Friendship out there), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9245090/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum]] (I Also liked Crumpets Aren't My Style), I liked A study In Magic until it went full retard with the Magical phones and stuff, Auryn is decent but the author hasn't updated :(

I'm Looking for stuff that has:\\
+ Not Dumbledore/Ron/Ginny/Snape Bashing\\
+ No Slash\\
+ Well Written\\
+ Crossover are welcome\\
++ if the crosover is with an uncompatible universe (i.e. Naruto) it has to have a believable reason for the crossover to happen (see Uchiha Fukurou, Auryn)\\
+ Time Travel, AU, Romances Are welcome.\\
+ No Power Creep (Harry getting the elder wand in his first year or some other bullshit)\\
+ Has Conflict\\
+ If no cannon Pairing, give a good reason why the cannon pairing is not happening (ex Hermione meet harry before Hogwarts so they became closer)\\
+ no OOC unseles it makes sense for the character to act different than in cannon (Good Example: harry was raised diferently so he is smarter or suff, BAD: Harry Acts slythering all of sudden because of :reasons:)

Extra plusses if a)it's finished and long (50K or More)\\
b)It's updating regulary (Weekly/Bi-Weekly/Montly or at least less than yearly)\\
c) has an interesting concept like

A character goes back in time other than harry (Dumbledore/Snape/Ron/Neville/Ginny/Vernon/whatever)

Crossovers with: Naruto, Stargate SG1, Sherlock Holmes

Harry is rasied by other family/Sirius

*** The DLP list has a problem, in that it has only one or two pages of stories that are both long and complete, and the ones left are classics that OP probably read already.
