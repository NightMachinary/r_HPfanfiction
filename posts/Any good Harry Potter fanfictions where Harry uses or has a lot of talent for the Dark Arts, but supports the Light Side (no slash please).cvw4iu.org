Just curious in an antihero-like Harry, or even an introverted one that finds that using dark curses (like the bombarda [explosion] curse) come to him more easily than anything else. So in a way, he feels that magic is just a tool. And that it really just depends on how you use it that makes a wizard dark or not.

Another alternative to this could be him using light magic in more... "creative" ways against the Deatheaters or whatnot. Like for example you could argue that if you a have cliff, or a spear lying around randomly, the levitating charm "Windgardium Leviosa" is just as powerful as an unforgivable if you use it right (throw the spear, or push/levitate someone off of said cliff).

-- I like fics like this that defy the general expectations of the regular lore of Harry Potter, and advance it or manipulate in more creative ways. --

As for pairs, I prefer Harry/Hermione, Harry/Luna, or even Harry/OC or some other character that's not too overdone (such as Daphne or Ginny), but I don't really care too much as long as it's not slash or some weird professor/student thing.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12155794/1/Honour-Thy-Blood][Honour Thy Blood]] comes to mind. It's a canon divergence fic where Arcturus Black survives in hiding, rescues Harry from the graveyard, trains him, and teaches him a blend of Potter and Black family spells. Turns out in this fic that Arcturus and Harry's Grandfather were decorated WWII era vets who fought together on the front line, and as such, a lot of the spells Harry learns are brutal, ruthless, and terrifying if learned by the wrong people.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** linkao3(The Hero With The Hidden Face) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20119738/chapters/47662957]]

This story along the lines of what you're asking. It's not gotten far yet (only 3 chapters) but it's about a Harry who learns about the Dark Arts early from notes left by his parents as a means of self-preservation, and the struggles he will eventually face balancing his proficiency in them while wanting to do good. It's intriguing! There's promise of in-depth exploration into how certain aspects of the dark arts work and such.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** First, I want to throw out that there aren't really 'Light Arts' in Harry Potter in the sense that most fantasy settings posit. Rather their is the Dark Arts, which are a malignant thing designed for the most base of human nature, and everything else. Intent matters obviously, but the purpose of the dark arts is almost exclusively to 'harm,' and often functions solely through the most vicious and perverse intents.

Anyway, as for Harry using the Dark Arts, well a lot of fics waffle on this without actually committing to the reality that excessive use is probably associated with character personality (violent person used by people who like violence, etc.). Nevertheless, some examples of Harry using the Dark Arts for the sake of good people:

- linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): hands down one of the best time travel fics that you will read with some truly imaginative dark magic. Short but absolute gold.
- Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): depicts a believable Slytherin!Harry using whatever means he can to survive, getting particularly vicious by 4th year.
- Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): an absolutely brutal display of magic, gore and destruction as Harry speed runs Voldemort's defeat in under 12 hours.
- Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): a lesser known fic, but has Harry learning from a pseudo!Tom Riddle in his head post OotP. Harry starts really throwing around the dark stuff by chapter 11.
- Linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): so there is a lot here, but a shorthand is at one point Harry learns how to use a Cannibalism Curse. Yeah, that happens. Best part though? Dumbledore taught it to him.
- Linkffn(The Denarian Renegade): sort of a crossover, but Harry is basically raised as a fire-magic happy arsehole with the barest pretensions to being good.

There's more, but those are certainly standouts.

** Linkffn(1795399) , linkffn(2569561), linkffn(3470741) This trilogy is long, but really good. I have read it through like 3 or 4 times. The antihero Harry starts to come into play more in the second one if I remember correctly.
