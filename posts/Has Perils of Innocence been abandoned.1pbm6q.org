I think I'm going to have to give up reading wip stories. It's just too much disappointment.

*** The author was going a pretty steady pace, posting chapters at regular intervals, updating twitter, etc. But then poof, nothing in a couple months =/

** I feel jaded, but I've given up on reading WIP. I LOVE reading stories and there is nothing worse then getting to a story that is highly recommended on ff.net and it not been updated in like 1.5 years or 2 years.

The worst to me is when there is a story and then they say it's going to be part of a multi-part story and the author completes some of it, and then abandons it.

** Better bloody not be abandoned! I've been following that fic with religious fever for months now. Its different, vivid, well-thought out and well written. And the author was really starting to delve into some interesting and canon-altering plot points too.

*** Hurray! Also that copy-paste lock is about as effective as subreddits hiding the downvote button.
