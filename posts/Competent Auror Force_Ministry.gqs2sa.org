:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I believe in this fic Amelia Bones was tipped off that her department may have death eater sympathisers in it and then began a mass cleaning of the ministry, she ended up working with the goblins so that everyone trying to enter the ministry had to go through that goblin waterfall that removes the imperius, takes off polyjuice and prevents apparition


** I think I remember that fanfic, the goblin waterfall being "The Thief's Downfall" at appeared in /Deathly Hallows/. Unfortunately, I cannot remember which it was, sorry...

  Starts out the day after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry and Hermione meet the Goddess of Love, and she offers to let them go back in time. Strictly Harry and Hermione. Minor - well maybe major Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore Bashing. Soul Bond - Time Travel
