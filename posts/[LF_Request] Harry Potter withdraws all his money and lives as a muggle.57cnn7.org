Fanfic in which harry potter is tired of the wizarding world and decides to make a new life for himself in the muggle world. Id like if in the fanfic: Harry Potter Being Rich/Millionaire , 60,000 words or more (not less) , Prefer no slash


** linkffn(Betrayed by kateydidnt) is pretty good.

** Linkffn(4828132) fits the bill in every respect except for the fact that it's a Smallville crossover so his time in the Muggle world, while full of him throwing his cash around, also involves new supernatural adventures.

** This is Harry/Draco slash but it's not graphic and doesn't happen until the end, so you can just skip the last chapter after Malfoy shows up st Harry's house beaten up. Linkao3(387467) features great sarcasm without bashing characters. Harry uses his inheritance to fund a muggle homeless shelter, great side characters.

  There are only three traditional choices for the cashed-up hero after victory. Harry Potter is too young to settle down and provide the wizarding world with a happy ending, and has too acute a sense of humour to spiral downwards into a spectacular flame-out. That leaves a life of good works. Choosing to lead it in Muggle Brixton comes with its own set of challenges, including Malfoys in the biscuit aisle.
