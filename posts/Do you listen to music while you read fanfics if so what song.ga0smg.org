I was just wondering if i was the only one who listened to music while reading a good fic to get in the mood


** I sometimes listen to my own Spotify playlist, sometimes to the Harry Potter soundtrack and for some stories which the mood requires I listen to the Witcher 3 soundtrack.

** Sometimes, depends on how easy I'm finding it to concentrate. If I'm ready and clear minded, then yeah I'll listen to music.

I might just put some game OSTs on. Depends on the mood I'm in too. Animal Crossing is good for light, fun, filler scenes and BOTW or Undertale is good for more emotional and plot related stuff.

Another possibility would be to flip on the radio. I sometimes just go on Apple music (without membership) and they'll have a couple stations I can tune into. It's fun to let the music dictate the mood of the scene, too, or even base them entirely off the music!

** Oh yes I usually listen to different songs with fics. I have a whole playlist of an artist for HP. Sometimes I repeat one song for a singular fic so then when I go back it reminds me of the fic (unintentionally). Does anyone do this?

** Basically anything, often something R&B or New Jack Swing from the 90's. If I'm reading an action fic sometimes it's just rap or prog rock

** I have an entire playlist of background music so I can find something that suits the mood of any moment in whichever story I happen to be reading
