I always see these sorts of requests ask for Dark!Harry that isn't evil. Give me the reverse. Harry who is genuinely malicious or evil, but doesn't use dark magic, doesn't raise the dead or eat babies or sacrifice virgins to [insert random fanfic rituals here]. No unforgivable curses, but bonus points if he uses what fanon has deemed "Light magic" to enact his sinister plot. Thanks!


** What you think is evil is going to depend on your definition (ditto for Good Harry), but here are some evil Harry's who are not necessarily dark wizards (or rather dark magic isn't really the go to for problem solving):

- linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): have you ever seen the old James Bond movies (60s to 90s)? Well Harry in here is sort of like a James Bond villain, but even more of a crazy genius. It makes sense when you read it.
- linkffn(Realignment): you don't really see Harry using a lot of explicit dark magic (except for a couple AKs here or there), but he is sort of like the Terminator in this fic.

I think the problem with this idea is that no one ever sees themselves as evil. Your actions are always rational; you are never the villain of your own story, at least from your perspective.

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Hermione doesn't see herself as evil in this one but if she's a brave Freedom Fighter or magical Britain's worst mass murderer with hundreds of 'respectable members of society' dead really depends on who you ask.

And she got a strict no dark magic policy. Obscene amounts of duplicated plastic explosives do the job of completely obliterating mansions full of Death Eaters just as well as fiendfyre, without the risk of an uncontrollable runaway reaction.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
