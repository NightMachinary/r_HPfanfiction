:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all!! sorry for formatting in advance, i'm in mobile.

I read this fic in high school so it would be 2015 or earlier. it was my fave and what got me into fanfic, I found it when I was diving down the rabbit hole of marauders tumblr. it's possibly/probably multichaptered

it's an AU where lily is a muggle and lives with petunia. lily thinks james left her when petunia lies to lily about james and him trying to reach out to lily.


** and petunia was a witch but lived like a muggle because she hated hog warts!!

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9506432/1/]]) Maybe this. It has Petunia lying to both Lily and James to try and breakup their relationship.
