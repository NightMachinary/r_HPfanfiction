  Wrong BWL. FEM Potter. James and Lily Potter has given birth to twins. On that Halloween night, they mistake the real prophecy child, leading to years of abandonment; which ends up being the biggest mistake the light side have ever made. There will be crossovers with many different worlds. Dark FEM Potter. Powerful & Genius FEM Potter. MOD Potter. Warning: Very Extreme M rated.

** This would be interesting because the wording of the prophecy would point to the brother because of the male pronouns.

It would be a good setting for supportive siblings and Harry just watching out for her brother and protecting his back.

*** Well, the pronouns could just be switched by the author.

**** Yeah, they could be, but I was thinking more of using the original as proof that divination is very subjective. Fem!Harry could realistically be the Fred to her brother's George and maybe having such a strong bond with each other against the world could make for interesting plot changes.
