***** As for why Umbridge is considered worse? I suppose because in canon, Lockhart suffered karmic retribution, and Umbridge really didn't. She had a bad night with Centaurs, but after that, she carried on being an evil bitch without actually facing any consequences beyond that.

******** The dementor thing is so horrifying to me. Like, people don't exactly die when they get kissed. They just, become shells? Do their souls get digested and cease to exist? Are they trapped inside the dementor for eternity, unable to move on or interact with any other spirits except those also eaten? Yikes.

In fact, I'm thankful that they're fictional.

****** Depends on how far you are willing to take the myths about centaurs at face value, they are sometimes shown as being mass rapists who will pound mercilessly anything resembling a female to death. Saw this depiction of them sometimes, while it's hard to feel any pity for the many fanon Umbridges I genuinely think that this was actually worse than cannon Umbridge deserved (locking her in Azkaban for some decades would have been better) though considering her ideology that was more karmically accurate. The story takes on a much darker turn if Harry and Hermione had thought the centaurs would do it and deliberately led her to their territory.

*** Lockhart is better than Umbridge for the simple fact that he initiated the Dueling Club where Snape taught the kids Experilimous - he was a terrible fraud but he was a terrible fraud who wasn't specifically opposed to practical lessons/experiences the way Umbridge was.

Hell, his first class (Pixies) was going to be a “practical” one but he didn't have the experience to back it up (an especially generous soul could suggest he hosted the dueling club to allow the students practical experience with a /competent/ teacher, but that may be going a bit too far)
