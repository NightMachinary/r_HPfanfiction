I read some topics from "What do you hate most about fanfics?" and I found things so stupid like "I leave a fic if a character says mum instead of mom". I also found things like:

- Americanisms - "My bad" and other expressions that don't change the story in ANYTHING seem to be the worst thing in the world for these guys. Also, /it is a crime/ that a British child know how to play baseball or eat chocolate chip cookies
- Study club - It's not like you have +1000 children at school and ONLY Hermione has that smart personality. It is strange that out of nowhere they discover super strong and advanced spells for their age, but a club of studies is totally normal
- Fan Pairings - Really? Mostly of the fanfics have
- Hermione likes to wash dishes - I don't like washing dishes, but my brother does. Like, it's not very unusual

What other things are overhated in fanfics?

*** Chocolate Chip Cookies are 100% a thing here - Maryland Cookies anyone? As is 'my bad' - these were undoubtedly imported in from the US linguistically, but they're here. 'Biscuits' and 'my mistake' are more common forms, but they're still valid.

Not to say that there aren't americanisms that haven't made the cultural leap yet - we still say 'boot' instead of 'trunk' and 'bonnet' instead of 'hood' for cars, we say 'rubbish' in lieu of 'trash' or 'garbage,' etc. But cookies are here baybee.

** I don't hate on much. Terrible spelling and grammar is my biggest issue and if I see “cuz” instead of “because” I'm not going to read it.

When it comes to Americanisms I assume they are young and/or lazy writers who haven't bothered to google something. If it's too much and is throwing off the story I just stop reading. But if Harry is head cheerleader and Ron is on the Hogwarts (American) Football team it better be labeled AU. (I haven't seen anything this outrageous, but you get my meaning.)

*** I do know that sometimes you don't even realize that the British will use a different word. Like all the basics (jumpers, trainers, biscuits, etc) I know, but sometimes somebody comments that "British people actually call it this" and I'm like woah, that's a new one. Sometimes I change it, sometimes they are just changed for ghe future chapters. But Google is a mess trying to find all the differences between the two.

*** I don't get the hate for americanism. Like come on, for one, it's the 1990s, air travel exists, americans visit brittain, Brittains visit america, there is GOING to be cultural bleed over. I think dropping a fic for using some american terms or phrases is downright pathetic and they should prob stay away from fanfiction unless they think that /only/ british writers should be able to write HPFF.

**** I think I remember reading a review once where someone was saying that the author using the imperial system was an Americanism and it just made me crack up. I mean sure, the metric system was invented in 1791, but quick research shows it wasn't made compulsory in France in 1837, and probably much later in Britain. So it doesn't really make sense for a culture that is 200 years behind the Muggle one and doesn't abide by their rules anyways to use the metric system, on top of all of the cultural bleed over that you listed.

** I've read a lot of trashy fics and I predict that I'll read many more in my future, but the one thing that'll annoy me enough to quit a fic is creatively awful punctuation. I can't help it - it gets distracting and I can't unsee it!

Dialogue punctuation has like three basic fucking rules, and the number of people who can't do it is /astounding./ To the point where, if an author manages to use a comma inside the double quotation mark (or outside if using British style single quotes) and then not stick a capital on 'said' I'm legit impressed. And that's just fucking sad.

That being said: gimme all the tropes. I like almost all of them.

*** Poor grammer is the only true non-trope thing that turns me away from a fic.

Trope wise, there are only a couple of tropes I will not read. I won't read any harry/male pairing. /NOT/, and I can't stress this enough, /NOT/ because I don't like gays, but because the pairing just doesn't do anything for me. I'm a straight male, so I just can't wrap my head around such a pairing, it provides nothing for me.

The other trope I refuse to read I'm not even going to name because I will get flamed into oblivion because of currant bullshit culture.

***** I will disagree as what you describe I think refers to as 'character criticism' rather than outright bashing.

In my experience, and opinion, there are 3 elements to bashing:\\
1: The character has NO redeeming qualities within the fic. They essentially exist only to be a fool, a flaw, and a mistake within the fic. They can LITERALLY do no right and will never do anything right.\\
2: the universe itself seems to hate the bashed character (Aka the author clearly hates the character and is just using the fanfic to partly 'punish' said character for some hate-boner)\\
3: The bashed character is WAAY too much in focus compared to what they should be, as they pose literally no threat to the main protagonist and the lead of the story. They are not a threat, they are not a danger, they are not an antagonist. They are a comedic entity that is treated as a serious enemy.

In short: The bashed character has no good qualities, the author clearly hates the character and they serve no function to the story beyond 'HA! LOOK AT HOW BAD CHARACTER IS! LAUGH NOW PLEASE!'\\
And therefore the bashed character should be removed from the story. It has no purpose and serves no real function for the story or plot.

The ONLY time a bashed character works are in a crack-fic or comedic take. You literally can't make a serious story and have a bash character be in there and have it fit well.
