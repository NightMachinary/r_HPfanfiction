Looking for a fanfiction where Harry is moderately powerful or has unique abilities. Prefer when he's a confident indivudal. No slash.


** In linkffn(Child of the Storm) and it's sequel Harry is the son of Thor, who was inhabiting James body, and is developing demigod type powers and gets quite powerful throughout the whole book and the sequel is shaping up to be just as impressive, power-wise at least.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
