hello there,

i am looking for a particular harry potterfan fiction i had started but cannot for the life of me find,

i do remember reading that harry helps a politician with his wife by giving him a potion, asking only that he does him a favour as they ( harry and hermione and family) needed support to do what they were planning to do
