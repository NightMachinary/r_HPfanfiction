As far as I remember, Harry was still a gryffindor, but didn't like Dumbledore. I think Voldemort was hiding out in the shrieking shack, but it also could've been the riddle manor. There's lots of banter between Harry and Voldemort, and Harry is a sarcastic little shit. I think Harry brings Voldemort all his horcruxes at one point. Harry is in his 5th or 6th year if I'm remembering right. I know it's very vague, but that's all I can remember about it.

  How does Harry react when he finds out the truth behind all of Dumbledore's secrets from Voldemort? Simple... he plots to kill them both. The only question is whether he'll change him mind about one of them in the end. SLASH - HP/LV

**** No, sorry. I will have a look a little bit later and see if I can't find it. I have a feeling it was set during fourth year though? Everybody abandoned Harry and there was also a cabinet link from the durstrang ship perhaps?
