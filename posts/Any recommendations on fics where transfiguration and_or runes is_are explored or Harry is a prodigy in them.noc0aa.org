**** Yeah, I definitely get that. I actually started reading it like 4 times and always stopped at a similiar point before I finally decided to push past that and pull through till the end. I think it was worth it in the end, especially for the fact that McGonagall is a rather prominent character, but I can see how and where most would be pretty put off by the story and its twists...

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** The ones where it's a primary focus have already been listed, but here are a few where runes are used in awesome ways but not the purpose of the fics:

Faerie Heroes has runes as a tool that's used a fair bit.

Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity has Harry using epic-level runic enchantment partway through.

Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon is largely based on a runic array (the beacon).

** A Simple act of Vengeance and it's sequel, has a Harry with a fucked up magical core. He's pants at precise Magic's like charms and enchantments, but a true prodigy with transfiguration and wide area of effect spells. He is unable to use a wand and the battles are anime like and action packed in design, and he relies heavily on elemental magic and conjuration. It ends in an extremely powerful harry, but one who has actually worked for his power and has clear limits defined. Good plot, good romance, good action. A great story. Sorry I don't know how to link stories, but it should pop up easily.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
