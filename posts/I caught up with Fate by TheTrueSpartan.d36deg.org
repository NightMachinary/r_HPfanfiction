It is a fanfiction where Ron can see the future and takes actions to prevent disasters from happening.

It is quite well written, especially the Entity and how it affects Ron, his obsessive desire to excel in every field he enters. It's definitely something different compared to the canon!Ron or the usual Ron you see in fanfiction, this one isn't lazy or braindead dumb but actually works real hard and is quite clever.

It also doesn't have unnecessary basing, and calls out a lot of the behaviour that the characters do; such as Hermione being upset/jealous because someone is outperforming her in classes (canon example being her reaction to the Half-Blood Prince Potions book, and how she didn't like it simply because it didn't follow the 'official ways' or how he got outperformed in Potions because of that), or Harry sticking his nose in other people's matters for unnecessary reasons (we've seen this one happen in every book, most notably example being how he saw Snape's worst memory), or Molly Weasley's over-protective attitude (something we saw in OotP with how he denied Sirius to tell Harry about the Prophecy citing that he's just a boy when he has faced a lot more than the majority of Order put together, or just in general, how she keeps going on and on about Fred and George getting a Ministry job or cutting Bill's hair for no reason).

I feel pretty sad knowing that I read all the chapters in like a week, and now I'll have to wait. Although the author updates pretty quickly, something I really appreciate and admire.

The most noteworthy thing I don't like so far is the current Draco Malfoy arc, I find him annoying and I'm sure the author will somehow redeem him, but for now, I just find him annoying and wish he isn't part of the gang.


** Most underated fic by far. I love it and yes I do agree with the new arc although the Kate's chapter with Drack planning to bring the group down is setting up something very good and interesting to watch it play out.

And the world building is perfect and I usually dont even care about it that much!

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

**** ...Holy shit. Up for 8 months and 1.45 million words? If he's writing that as he goes my hat's off to the madman. If it's all written already it's still off to him, because 1.45 million words.

** The best thing about True Spartan is how fast he updates. Almost one and a half million words within eight months. I was probably one of the first ones to read it, but I honestly thought it was a poor man's 'The Red Knight' and gave up. Job got hectic and had to give up fanfics for a few more months. When I came back it was long and was really interesting before I too caught up. Now I have to wait for him to update.

True Spartan updates amazingly as well. He almost always update within 2-3 days and they are not 1-2k chapters either. They are long, proof read legit 18-20k worded chapters. Amazing dedication. Story is really interesting as well. Character and plot wise. Needless to say it's the most regularly updated fanfiction that I follow. Definitely something that I'm looking forward to everyweek.

It does have an amazing 1k reviews, but I honestly wish people would check it out even more. The author deserves 2k-3k for his current work. It's Ron Centric so it's really good to see atleast 1k reviews. But the great thing is, people who are here after 1500k words are totally devoted to the fic. If you look at the reviews there are reviews as long as a chapter from multiple people.

Another amazing thing is, he doesn't bash any characters. Sure Molly, Harry, Hermione and even Ron has their negative moments, but it's just calling out their canon negative behavior that people tend to ignore.

The story also has a multiple fronts, so there is a lot happening. Usually when this happens fanfic authors ignores the characters, but True Partner always tries to develop his characters as well. If we look at the students Ron, Daphne, Hermione, Harry, Neville, Theo, Blaize, Millie, Pansy, Tracy, Luna, Draco and Ginny all gets developed really well. They all have their own identities. Even JKR didn't try to develop that much characters. And it's not a mess. There is an amazing plot holding it together. And on top of that there are amazing written non MC OC characters like the triumvirate, French veela characters, first years etc. They all have their own identities and they feel like they belong in that universe.

Please please give few chapters a try if you can. It'll encourage the author even more.

P.S. Despite the long comment, I'm not the author and not self promoting here.

** I've loved reading this one, too. I loved the separate arcs and the Greengrass/Chess parts of the fic. I would love to read more chess related fanfics in HP now.

The only issue I have is “payed” a few times. It is a word but has a different meaning than “paid.” Paid is financial while payed is nautical.

** I like the authors interpretation of Voldemort. That St Mungo's scene was chilling. I'm not sure how I feel about Snape and Dumbledore so easily accepting Ron so easily, even with all the explanations. It's still weird seeing 13 year old Ron strategizing with them, even though it's justified. But I do love his relationship with Daphne. It seems realistic and kind of sweet

Also the Silver Trio idea is really fascinating- reminds me of the parlor in the Changeling
