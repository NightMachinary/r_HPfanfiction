** The problem with much of this 'research' is that the internet is like an invisible echo-chamber. Thanks to the fact that we're only shown the stuff we search for (and the results of those searches are crafted by things we have previously searched for) we quickly come to believe that /actually/ most people believe the same things we do.

But that's an illusion brought about by Google and others corralling people into neat little groups of shared interests.

The best example of this is your Google search test. Of course you see Romione taking the lead, that's /your/ ship and Google knows it. When I do the search from an incognito browser I get Hermione paired with Fred (don't ask me why, I have no idea), Draco, Ginny or Snape. If I search for Draco all of the suggestions are Harry or Hermione. If I search for Ron I /do/ get Hermione, but that's simply because there are no other Ron ships.

So, by all means have fun trying to confirm your own preferences. It's unlikely to mean much, though.

Also, I did find the comment about DLP having died years ago to be amusing.

*** Isn't that something that only applies when you're logged in to your email though? Cos if it is, which I'm pretty sure is, I logged out so that wouldn't be the case.

** Off topic: the... pairing aside, Dr-arry sounds like a disease or something. Am I the only one out there?

** Okay. Can we talk about pairings without having to use silly combination names?

Also, DLP is dead? That's news to me, since it's more active than its ever been. Also, theirs is Harry/Fleur according to popular vote.

**** I'm pretty sure tumblr is too obsessed with slash ships to bother with something like Harry/Fleur.

Which is basically why it's impossible to figure out what the most popular pairing in the entire fandom is. Fans of different ships tend to congregate in different locations and, combined with the size of the fandom, it makes it next to impossible to actually get accurate numbers. Polls taken in different locations will bias different ships. As [[/u/Lord_Anarchy]] said, H/F is popular over on DLP, yet [[/u/slytherinight]] picked H/Hr as the most popular non-canon, whilst in my own experience H/D takes the lead, with Sirius/Remus also being exceptionally well-liked. I've noticed that the pairings people often claim to be the most popular are either their own OTP or, conversely, the pairing they loathe, but that makes a certain bit of sense: we notice the things we love and the things we hate, whilst paying little attention to the things about which we don't care.

** Lol someone is mighty biased! :P Harmony is the major non-canon pairing hands down. Ps. It's the matter of not looking for something you don't want to find in the first place. sorry for you.

*** Harmony is not more popular than Drarry, Dramione, Wolfstar +which is kinda canon tbh+ or even Neville/Luna (which pretty much everyone ships to a certain extent).
