** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21957445][Revelio]]

Separated from their families and friends Sirius, Remus, Arthur and Ron find themselves on the edge of Rivendell, while Tonks finds herself alone and in need of a hiding place of her own on the outskirts of Rohan to wait out the gap from her waking until she hears word of her family and friends. Because with a family like hers there is bound to be loud echoes eventually able to aim her in the right direction.

Book 2 of three, this is where the hp characters get sucked into Middle Earth by an accidental use of a book as a port key. Continues into book three where they find the other group that is searching for them and the Wizards have to settle down and find a place for their new cities and countries to be laid out with the hassle of keeping new alliances.
