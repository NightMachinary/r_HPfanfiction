Like the title says I am looking for recommendations for stories similar to Poison Pen by GenkaiFan linkffn(5554780). The story is on ao3 as well.

If you haven't read it I would highly recommend! It is an amazing well written story. No ship or romance.


** linkffn(Basilisk-Born) has a running subplot which is very similar to Poison Pen.

*** Ah yes, I think I've read it or started but found out it was a WIP so I abandoned it. Will definitely look it up again.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** When I first read it, about nine years ago, it was good.

Now, reading it again, it's riddled with bad cliches.

*** Yes only because 9 years have passed for those cliches to build up. Back then the number of stories posted was way less.

** I thought it was great... Until all the goblin bullshit, it was like the author didn't know how to wrap up an otherwise great fic and decided to implement one of the worst Deux-ex-Machina I've ever seen. Another detail I didn't like is in chapter 13 when he uses the press to directly condemn the reader... In real life you don't do that, EVER, it doesn't end well
