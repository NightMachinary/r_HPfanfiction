Just to focus on about and such? Or is he a character people tend to forget about in fanfics? I don't know many stories that primarily focus on him and I'm thinking about writing one where Dumbledore manipulates Dudley into attending Hogwarts just to push Harry to his full potential by constantly being on him (bullying) 24/7 is which would amount to plot changes etc but I'm unsure if anyone is really that interested in Dudley's backstory or character since he isn't really that focused on in the books or movies...

Thanks in advance.

** I would like to write a Dudley is also magic story sometime! And then him and Harry can be like close loving brothers against the world, instead of the distant hateful cousins they were in canon. :) Dudley and Harry having each other's back against Voldemort and anything else! :)

  Dudley Dursley: champion boxer, crass chav, cannibal?, bad boyfriend, good son, annoying cousin, best friend. It's hard to keep all the identities straight. Fin.

** linkffn(Dudley Dursley and the Quest For Truth) A Dudley-centric fic set concurrent to Deathly Hallows, chronicling the Dursley's stay in an Order safe-house, and learning more about his cousin and his adventures, while befriending several witches and wizards.

linkffn(8398832) Has a darkly humorous conversation between Harry and Dudley during the Summer of OotP, with Harry (whose sarcasm and wit are what's keeping him sane) who wonders if it "counted as doing something stupid" to Ron and Hermione.

** You know, I once wrote a one-shot where Harry was Shizuo Heiwajima and his brother, Dudley, was Kasuka Heiwajima from the anime Durarara. Rather than a crossover, I basically made Harry's and Dudley's personalities to be the same as those characters in the anime.

Harry is a volcanic spit-fire constantly picking up heavy objects, ie; cars, refrigerators, statues, etc and throwing it at people that pisses him off. And he's overwhelmingly protective of his brother, Dudley.

While Dudley was the quite, handsome kid with an aloof personality.

I would have wrote some more, but, I didn't know where to go with a Harry who's basically rage personified.
