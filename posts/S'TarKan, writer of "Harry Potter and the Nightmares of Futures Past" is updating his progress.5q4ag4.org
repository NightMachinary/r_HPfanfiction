** Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past didn't age so well. Dunno if he can scramble something from it.

**** I'd say that a great many of the Peggy Sue fics and many Overpowered Harry fics copy a lot of elements from Nightmares of Future Past, so much so that the field is oversaturated.

Having said that, Starkan generally avoids the most egregious elements of the overused Super!Harry tropes: No Daphne. Dumbledore is a puppetmaster, but he is firmly on the side of Good. No Daphne. The Weasleys are written well. The magical cores aren't so annoying as they could be. Luna is an odd child, but definitely not a sage. Have I mentioned No Daphne?

Considering that he started shortly after "Half-Blood Prince" was published, and is actually good at Peggy Sue, I'm willing to cut him some slack.

I can't wait to read more.

***** Ah, it seems like it holds a similar place like certain iconic films. They started trends that we now take for granted, and the qualities that made the original interesting in the first place has been diminished in contrast to the plethora of imitators and homages.

Also, no Daphne.

****** No Slytherin!Harry. No Hadrian. No Lord Potter-Black. No interfering with Ministry elections.

Seriously, how the heck did Daphne get to be so popular? I get the whole "blank slate Slytherin" thing, but still.
