***** Worth noting that this is based on ao3, which tends to have a higher concentration of m/m ships. Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione both had very active fan sites in the old days and are more popular than this suggests

maybe not enough to overcome drarry though, that ship basically ticks every single box for popular romances

**** Drarry has the yaoi/yuri boost, as well as:

1. Lots of ways to write one or both redeeming/saving the other from evil/abuse/etc
2. Actors who are commonly regarded as extremely attractive
3. Protagonist/Antagonist ships are really popular
4. Easy segway for 'Dark Harry' fics
5. Probably other things I'm not thinking of

** I feel like the most popular het ship is Dramione. In slash there is no room for debate, it's obviously drarry, it is all over the place (and I've contributed to both).

** This is only going to provoke fan wars...There's a rank on ao3 and ffn about ships popularity, go look at that.

*** Yeah, they do! I think many people are so strictly canon that they refuse to hear anything different.

Dramione, Harmony, and Drarry sound about right! Thanks for the reply!

**** this sub is pretty heavily influenced by DLP culture which tended to like the style of story associated with that ship (although not so much ship fics themselves, at least in later years)

also it got memed beyond irony on this sub
