Anybody know of any good fics where harry embraces his parselmouth and adopts a snake. Either replacing hedwig or joining hedwig as Harry's familiar

Edit: Since I saw a couple WBWL please don't give me those stories. I'm looking for a BWL Harry, and please no Voldemort/Harry shipping

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

******** I'm spoiling here a bit obviously.

Harry does not learn something at that point, because he doesn't realize what he's doing. He suppresses his bad deeds, concentrates only on making people, mainly VL, like him, get him to show him the affection he lacked all his life.

He is manipulated by those people, because of the fucked up upbringing he had. After what he did to Ginny, or during it, the only thing he was thinking about was VL cooing to him, telling him how good he is for doing that.

Everything he does will get back to him later on, he does realize what he did, and it will hit him hard, if you get to that part.\\
That's something I just can't let stand, because what the fic does great is, show how that neglect and manipulation during his childhood does to him.

Regarding the scene on the train, I don't remember it all to well, but didn't Draco only say a minor insult, before Harry blew up, showing his mental instability. Pretty sure he was pretty fucked up already at that point.

** As someone whose ready their fair share of fanfics I will say that there are a ton of the stories of HP having a snake familiar with the snake often times being a baby basilisk that he found or even created intentionally, some being a normal snake that he saved like a garden snake he saved from the Dursleys, sometimes a mythical snake like the double ended snake which are two snakes that are attached or an original made up mythical snake. Once the snake was the snake that Draco conjured up in their first battle and Harry took the snake and kept him as a pet before Snape could kill it. There are a couple of fanfics where Harry was raised by snakes and is a snake animagus. Most times those stories go on to ship him with Voldemort for their shared snake like appearance so be warned for those.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent) is the only one that comes to mind. I never finished reading it so I can't say if it's good or not. It's old, one of the alternate book-5 that came out in the space between books iirc.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
