So, there is a bit of a list of things that I'm looking for in a story, but having any of these would make a good read for me. Slash/Het/Gen are all acceptable, and I don't care if it is a one-shot or multi-chapter. I'm just looking for recommendations that have one or more of the following.

1. Harry is a self-serving s.o.b. He dosen't care what the Order or Dumbledore expect of him, and he dosen't care about Voldemort or the Death Eaters. He has his own interests, and they have priority above all else.
2. Lord of ... gone wrong. As a twist on a popular trope, Harry becomes the Lord of any number of houses, but these titles come with many responsibilities and other such bad things.
3. Slightly crack-y request. Harry gets his soul sucked by a Dementor in any of his encounters with one, and takes over the being's body. Now he is Harry the Dementor, and he solves all of his problems by simply floating towards them. He also has inner rants over the Patronus Charm.
4. Peter Pettigrew was actually a frighteningly intelligent individual who really is one of Voldemort's top Death Eaters.
5. Harry and Luna take over the world with their combined weirdness/surprising magical ability. Maybe Harry was sorted into Ravenclaw, and befriended Luna after noticing their similarities (bullying, loss of a parent). This is something that I have a hard time finding.
6. Harry is secretly working with the Muggle governments as a secret agent against the world that pushed him onto the Durselys.

There is only one thing that I would rather not read, and that is anything depressing or with heavy angst. I read fanfiction to get an escape from my issues in the real world, so I try to not read things that may bring my mood back down.

Thank you in advance!

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

** #1: Business, linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588]])

This isn't your request, but semi-related -- for /Remus Lupin/ as, pretty much, a self-serving SOB, there's The Uncle linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/839169]]).

2- Teenage boys think with their dicks except Harry Potter who can barely think at all, linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4975879]]). Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Slytherin has problems. (crack)

4 - HP & The Prince of Slytherin probably fits. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/]])

5- okay, not quite the world, but they /do/ take over Azkaban and most everything in it in All the Dementors of Azkaban. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/]])

*** I've read all of these before, but I had forgotten about most of them. I had a great time rereading Business! I'll have to go through the rest of them again.

** 1. Sum of their Parts: linkffn(11858167) Harry decides a dark lord is the only thing that can inspire change in the wizarding world. He, Ron, and Hermione work to make the future a better place for baby Teddy. Not exactly "selfish sob," but he spurns popular opinion for the change he thinks is right.

2. Where in the world is harry Potter? linkffn(2354771) Also not exactly the prompt, but Harry is basically op and works with Nicolas Flamel to discover uses of dementor blood. He ends up palling around a dementor named Bob. Good for a laugh.

   1. There was another (admittedly pretty shitty) fic where Harry was basically a super genius and did crime scene forensics? And it basically ended up being a crossover between HP and every US telelevision show that involves crime investigation? I can look for it if you're interested.

3. Make A Wish linkffn(2318355) Harry wants to live before he dies, so he decides to go on vacation. Due to dozens of wacky coincidences, international law enforcement comes to believe that Harry, or rather his alias Mr. Black, is professional law enforcement or a thousand-year-old dark lord killer. More humorous than serious, but still an enjoyable read. I think there might be a sequel?

I have a couple more fics similar-ish to your third prompt in that Harry has an affinity with one or more of the hallows and is able to basically ignore dementors as the master of death or even bring back souls from the dead. I'm on mobile right now, but I can add them when I get home in a few hours. Let me know if you'd be interested.

**apologies for the poor formatting!!! like i said, im on mobile. i'll clean it up as soon as i can!

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
