I'd like to hear your thoughts on stories where the muggle world is just unequivocally better. Also, pure blood wank fics.

Edit:combined another post


** You could've just rolled up both threads into one. I'm more accepting of the Wizarding World being better than the Muggle World than the other way around, because of the little things. A school nurse was able to regrow all bones in a student's arms. So the magical medical field is way ahead of the muggle one. The Weasley's are seen as one of the poorer families, and they honestly aren't that poor. They own a big house, own their own land, had plenty to eat and put seven children through school all on the wage of a single man. Wanking inventions like cars and airplanes makes no sense when wizards can teleport. The canon Wizarding World wouldn't have been a bad place to life if it wasn't for the social issues.

The only thing the muggle world has going for it is it's entertainment industry.

** Not a big fan of either. Am generally interested in fics where there's geographical variations and especially where Britain for one reason or another is unique, mostly because of Dumbledore.

** Both Pureblood Wank and Mugglewank fics can be done well, or they can be done in ways that need more work. I've enjoyed and not enjoyed fics focusing on both things. They're not intrinsically good or bad ideas, just tools for people to use in good or bad ways.

*** Is there anything in particular you enjoy for either trope? Or a function you think it serves well?

**** Content-wise, there's nothing specifically I enjoy, no. Whether I enjoy it tends to be more on how it fits in with the rest of the fic and how far it's taken. Is it just 'Magicals/Muggles, Fuck Yeah!' with little actual set-up or examination on how such a society might actually work? Then, no. I like them more when they're cohesive and don't come off like they've been written by someone thinking "Oh, fuck, I'm so tired of all the fics saying how fuckin' great the Muggles/Wizards are. Look at the /insert terrible thing/ they did, that's total bullshit. I'm gonna write something where the other guys are the best, and it's gonna be so cool - Muggles/Wizards, yeaaaaaah!"

/insert heavy stadium rock music here/

As an example of a function a well-used muggle/wizardwank trope might serve well, I'd put forward the 'Sociological Storytelling' vibe. If you don't know, it's a method of storytelling focusing on conflicts between institutions rather than individuals.

For a Wizardwank fic - Instead of Harry vs Voldemort, it'd be the Newly Popularised Ministry Departments vs the Declining Pureblood Aristocracy. You can get to know specific characters throughout, but instead of following along one or three people, you follow the Institutions themselves. How they work better than Muggle counterparts, how they can overpower and outmanipulate Muggles to their own ends, how the ways in which they are better than Muggles might fuel or dampen the conflict, etc. Iain M. Banks made a whole series out of conflicts between an idyllic utopian society and the rest of the galaxy (the Culture series), for example. Hell, you could look at how the Post-War Magical Society might rise to Wizardwank levels while the old order declines.

For a Mugglewank fic, it might involve the two governments colliding, and the efforts of their espionage and intelligence departments to keep the conflicts contained. Or it might just be a way to examine the societal injustices of Magical Society. Like, the Wizards live in a borderline feudalist society with a media controlled by the government and a government that can apparently order show trials and execute criminals without any real consequences or opposition. How does that affect their society? What would they see when they look at a Muggle society that doesn't have those issues? How would Muggle society see those people, and how would they actually go about changing a society that's lived in the exact same way for four-hundred years? How might the stubborn and staunchly traditionalist Wizards fight back against a Mugglewank-level society trying to change their ways of life?

Mugglewank and Wizardwank both just say that one group is so incredibly far above the other, and is so much better in every way. Think about how we deal with people who we perceive to be better, or lesser, than ourselves. There's so much story in that.

So, yeah. If the idea is taken and followed through to the logical conclusions, then it can be really interesting.

***** Another interesting idea for post war would be to examine the fight to prevent history from repeating itself. Since killing Voldemort doesn't make the problem go away. It didn't the last time. And seeing turned Death Eaters like Lucius Malfoy getting their ex-colleagues thrown into jail

****** Indeed. I've seen that done a couple of times (eg. Democracy, by Starfox) and it's been quite interesting. But yes, focusing on society and societal change can make for some really fun stories. :)

** I don't particularly care for Wizard wank stories, because they generally tend to be "if you've read one, you've read all" kind. The muggleborns/dumbledore are ruining magic. Traditions and the similar things are important, they are dying by the actions of the muggleborns etc.

It's not a trope I like and generally avoid. However if there are stories that explore the wizard world more, bring out differences and highlight the beauty of the magical world, I'd love to read it.

For example, chasing Snowflakes. The way the author expanded into the wizarding world through Katie Bell's parents, beyond the conventional professions and how the animals interacted, was something I loved. Don't know if it can be termed as Wizard wank though.

Coming to Muggle wank, I get why it's done, don't particularly like it and actively avoid it. If it was Muggle wank with respect to ideas, thoughts and philosophies, I would get that and appreciate it.

Democracy is one of my favourite fictions and I really do love it.

But if you talk about muggle wank with respect to small things like "Muggle clothes are better than robes"; "Pens are better than Quills"; it's fine but rather annoying because you start questioning why the MC chose to be a wizard if they really liked the Muggle world that much then, but you can still read on.

I feel the absurdity begins when Purebloods start losing their senses and going Gaga over things like

1. Movies - their world literally has moving pictures. If they find a way to incorporate sound, they'd be making them as well.

2. Airplanes. - they have broomsticks, which fly pretty fast in their own right. Why would they lose it by sitting in a large closed tube in comparison?

3. Cars. It's not as common but I saw a fic where Daphne loses it over cars.

4. Fashion. - the "wow there are so many different styles out there" - the bit where they refuse to understand that wizards won't have just one style, that a likelihood even an isolationist society might have their own trends and changes, and that despite said isolation they have a lot of interaction with the muggles and the worlds overlap in multiple places is ignored.

But unfortunately Muggle wank doesn't stop here. It goes ahead to really just make certain inventions and dietary habits muggle, when they are in fact, regional, and hence astound wizards.

1. Wizards don't know what coffee is. They only drink tea. Coffee is a magical invention that house-elves can't even make.

2. Wizards have never heard of Pizza. A dish that originated and is a fairly common and staple food in Europe.

So these things grind my gears for the inaccuracy of the same.

If there is Muggle wank where these things aren't the norm, I'd be open to reading it. But in general, it's a trope I actively avoid.

*** Those are certainly trends I notice. I have particular disdain for cars being a shocker. As they have a direct entrance into the center of muggle London and all that for their main shopping district. Could you link democracy? Or just the author's name

*** Concerning the Muggle Wank, I just want to add another point that is (in my opinion) the most annoying : in pretty much every Muggle Wank fic I have read, Guns (and Muggle armements in general) are the answer to everything.

Shield charm are broken by bullet. "Warded" zones can be found by locking for the "blank zone" on a map and bombed to oblivion. Even the strongest wizards (Voldemort and Dumbledore) are easily killed by a sniper. . .

I understand that, in the good conditions, a wizard could be killed by Muggles, but it's incredibly annoying when the Wizards seem unable to deal with an average Muggle, and when a team of 10 trained soldiers seem to be enough to topple their society.
