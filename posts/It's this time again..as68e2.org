** If you haven't read it already, Grow Young With Me is one of my favorite fics ever, and definitely my favorite romance.

** Sadly, very few of my faves have much, if any romance.

The only actual romance fic in my faves would be To Know You Is To Love You, which is a fic about Ron and Hermione undergoing a unique form of couple's councelling... essentially they're re-living vital moments from each other's lives. So the fic is in essence a re-telling of the books, from the POV of Ron and Hermione. We get to see what they were up to when Harry wasn't around, plus we get the adult Ron and Hermione's running commentary. It's great. linkffn(9094981)

Other than that...

Hogwarts Houses Divided is the only next-generation fic I actually like, It's about Teddy Lupin's first year at Hogwarts, and about the conflict between the four Hogwarts houses, with baggage from the old war nearly ruining things for the younger generation. linkffn(3979062)

Reign of the Serpent is the best large-scale AU I've read. It's a very different wizarding world where Salazar Slytherin rules as the immortal emperor and dictator, everything is more war-like, the world is heavily divided into strict castes (with the Mudbloods at the very bottom), Tom Riddle is the disgruntled Headmaster of Hogwarts, and Dumbledore is a wanted criminal and revolutionary. The main character of the fic is Hermione, who together with fellow Mudbloods Dean Thomas and Justin Finch-Fletchley manages to secure a place at Hogwarts and plans to join the revolution when she's older. Harry, Ron and Neville also play vital parts in the fic, and part of the fun is to see familiar characters in different roles. linkffn(9783012)

Then there's the Weasley Girl series, which is an AU in which Ron Weasley was born a girl, This is probably my fave gender-flip fanfic ever. It takes the set-up of canon and then butterfly-effects the hell out of it so that the story goes totally off-rail... half the time it does the opposite of canon, half the time it follows canon closely, in metaphorically different shoes. Also fem!Ron is adorable. linkffn(8202739; 11815956; 9932798)

Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is a crossover with Dungeons & Dragons, and it's a classic. Essentially, a D&D character somehow ends up at Hogwarts and hilarity ensues. Perhaps the best part is Dumbledore's one-liners... he's hilarious in this story. linkffn(8096183)

  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** A Marauder's Guide to Falling in Love - Sirius Black/Marlene McKinnon in Marauder Era.

It's complete with over 80k words. There's also a fully complete sequel and half completed third instalment being updated regularly.

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/178062105-a-marauder%27s-guide-to-falling-in-love]]

"So if its words that you are looking for McKinnon, I am fluently gifted with the art of speaking. But I'd much rather spend every day showing you exactly how I feel, knowing that you're mine and that we belong together."

Its Marlene's sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and she wants nothing more than to pass Transfiguration in which she is hopelessly failing. But her struggle to improve her grades means crossing paths with fellow student Sirius Black, who just so happens to be ridiculously attractive, arrogant, and unfortunately her best bet to acing the class. She doesn't know why Sirius has suddenly taken interest in helping her, but accepting his assistance doesn't come without consequences. Her best friend Lily Evans seems to think that there is something more to the relationship than meets the eye, but Marlene has convinced herself that she does not like Sirius in that way. However, things get a little complicated when her feelings become conflicted, and it doesn't take long for Marlene to begin wondering if Lily was right all along. Finally admitting to herself that her feelings for Sirius are more than just platonic, she must decide which path to choose. Suddenly, she no longer just has Transfiguration to worry about; she must untangle the complications of her love life and finally tell Sirius exactly how she feels.
