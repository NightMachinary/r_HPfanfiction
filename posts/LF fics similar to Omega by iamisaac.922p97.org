It's James Sirius/Teddy, Alpha/Omega. The things I liked the most were the sex, worldbuilding, and relationship between James and Teddy (I enjoy reading d/s type relationships).

Does anyone have any suggestions of similar fics? Any pairing is okay with me!

  Set when James and Teddy first go back to the Potters' house, this is Al's perspective on their relationship.
