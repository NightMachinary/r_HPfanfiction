I've just finished reading chapter 6, but I have no idea what the parlor is about. I know it's some sort of "sisters organisation", but why is it so important to ginny?


** Ginny's whole arc in The Changeling is about figuring out who she is and where she belongs. The Parlor is a place for girls who don't "fit", a place for Slytherin girls who are NOT typical pureblood society girls and would rather focus on things they love like music and painting and inventing. Ginny is accepted into the Parlor because Antonia sees potential in her to be something great for the other girls and for herself.
