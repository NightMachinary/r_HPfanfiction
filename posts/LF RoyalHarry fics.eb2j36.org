The idea of Harry as the High King of Albion has been stuck in my head for months now but I have no writing talent. Any fics still set in the wizarding world (not a nonmagic AU or a fantasy AU) where Harry is or becomes king, or otherwise ruler of Magical Britain?


** Linkffn(Gods amongst men) and Linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) both have Harry eventually become what you're looking for, either through legit claims or treachery.
