** linkffn(The Song of the Trees)

Only one that comes to mind that's even remotely good. It's a blend of noir, horror and mystery. There's a third side but it's not clearly revealed until some time in the story. At no point do wizards and muggles come together (muggles dont even feature), but there's plenty of murder, intrigue, mystery, plotting, assassination and more murder. And tension.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

** Maybe the magical creature world. I can see a lot of magical creatures and animals that would prosper better in a world without either wizards and muggles as the majority ruling populace. For example centaurs, dragons, werewolves, vampires, goblins, etc. The dragons would be able to roam freely wherever they wanted as would the centaurs and other creatures that live in hiding and are heavily restricted in their movements by the wizards.
