Getting back into fic reading after a few years off, and I was wondering if fellow fic readers could recommend some stories featuring particularly good characterization of Hermione. Thanks!


** There's two that pop into my brain immediately.

linkffn(Wit of a Raven) is a massively AU setting, with a hyper-competitive Hogwarts. In it, she is nearly a complete bitch, but it really works. Too bad it's abandoned.

linkffn(Forging the Sword) is the other one. It's literally, to my mind, canon Hermione had events at the end of Chamber of Secrets gone a bit differently.

** Off-ff.net: [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived by Diane Castle]] is a non-magical AU, where "Harworts" is an exclusive boarding school for training James-Bond-style superspies and related personnel for Britain's tumultuous Intelligence Community, and where skill, technology, and occasional superscience takes the place of magic. Most children who go there come from families in the Community, such as the "Wellesleys" and the "Malenfants", but some common children, like Hermione and Colin can get an invitation if they do something particularly cunning or vicious. The overall plot follows canon loosely (in that the big challenge of each year parallels that of that year of canon), but it's a plus in this case, because it's interesting to see how the magical events of HP canon are reflected in this spy-verse.

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) develops Hermione's more vicious and ambitious side.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew): Hermione as a rational!protagonist.

linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter by Nim-the-lesser): DurmstrangStudent!Hermione.

linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story by cosette-aimee): Hermione is a secondary character in this one, but it does interesting things with her character after she gets herself sorted into Slytherin for less-than-ideal reasons...

linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss): Unfortunately, abandoned due to the author's passing.

linkffn(One Witch and her Elf by Rumour of an Alchemist): Hermione somehow inherits Kreacher.

linkffn(A Pound of Flesh by Thomas M Riddle) and sequel: /Not/ Tomione.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord.

** Usually, people characterise Hermione as a know-it-all in most fics. It's annoying and very clichéd.

I remember reading this fic a long time ago that was a BWL!Neville and where Harry and Hermione were the OTP. Voldemort had taken over and Harry was a soldier, and Malfoy was his assassin (masked, I must add). It was a great fic, but I forgot what it was named. I'll try to find it for you.

It was the best characterisation of Hermione that I'd ever come across, and it wasn't because the author did a particularly great job -- it was because the author took the pain into making her something different... Something new.

** Personally I'm a big fan of Hermione in The Arithmancer linkffn(The Arithmancer) It starts Hermione off as a fairly easy to push around little girl, but she evolves and develops in very well thought through and explained ways, just like the real Hermione. It's my favourite characterisation of her I've ever read (aside from the original of course) and one of my favourite fics of all time in general
