1. Noone died from a lethal gaze. (book 2 + see below)
2. Noone was baited into looking into the snake's eyes.
3. Noone got eaten by a huge hungry snake that could swallow whole boulders never mind children.
4. Not one mega basilisks shit was found thus Tom Riddle proves to be a responsible owner who cleans up after his pet.
5. Not a single other pet walking willy nilly without their owners was bit or eaten.
6. Docile pet history of ownership for over 50 years with two exceptions. One was when a person attacking the owner was bit as they f*** should or what's the point of owning a deadly animal in the first place. Two when a person walked up to a creature with lethal gaze and stared it straight in the eye proving once and for all that Hermione Grangers and their predecessors of the world have no business telling people what to do and then crying afterwards in the bathrooms.
7. We shall not mention Hagrid's envy of Tom's pe.... snake that lasted for the next 50 years after Tom got his hands on Salazar's Snake and subsequent failure on his part to fill the void with cerberii, dragons, giant acromantula and God know what else.

In conclusion you'd have done much worse in Tom's position.


** Not sure if this is because you are desensitized but petrifying people at random times is probably a form of terrorism and causing people to lose months of their life.

** I would argue that as a XXXXX beast, the Basilisk is probably submitted to some kind of regulations. Can Tom Riddle provide a permit proving he is legally owning it?

Outside of that, Tom definitively placed the Basilisk in positions where he knew he was dangerous, and even if nobody die, I would count the petrification as some kind of magical assault.

*** Family herloom maybe? As a Slytherin descendant he could say it's his inheritance.

Ah the positions where a basilisk would be dangerous, not great hall or classrooms, or common rooms, but alas - random corridors and just outside a non functional toilet. Truly the work of a evil genius of crime!

** Theft/damage of property for Hagrid's roosters and blood on the walls. Framing Hagrid for a crime he didn't commit. There should be some sort of crime for possession, although knowing the wizarding world there isn't. Probably trespassing, as 'Diary Riddle' wasn't enrolled at the school. Conspiracy to commit murder. Crimes against the English Language for encouraging Ginny's Valentine.

** He killed Hagrid's roosters. There was also the graffiti problem, and that small issue of trying to kill Ginny.
