I'm tired of Harry being raised by Voldemort or Death Eaters and still befriend Granger and Weasley . I want some fics where Harry doesn't want to be friend with them/doesn't even like them bevause he believes in Voldemort's ideology or his own ( which doesn't align with the light's )

No dark!hermione or Ron ( or Weasleytwin ) betraying his family to follow Harry .

Any pairing is fine . As long as it isn't fem√ófem . ( I really like LVHP ) Thank you
