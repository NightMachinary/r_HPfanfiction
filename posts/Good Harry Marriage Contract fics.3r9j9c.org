  It's been done, but here's my shot at the old Marriage Contract type story. Harry and Daphne Greengrass find out their parents put together a marriage contract when they were born, now they must deal with it.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

** There's a very old fic, by a guy named "Clel" followed by several numbers. It's just called "the marriage contracts" it's Harry/Daphne and is a seventh year/post war fic. Harry spends large amounts of time with Neville, gives dumbles consistently more ridiculous tales of how he defeated voldemort, and turns down about 800 marriage contracts following his defeat of the dark tosser.

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.

***** No problem. I thought of suggesting it but it's not technically a marriage contract because Harry declines the contract only to later use it to save his relationship with Daphne.

I haven't read it since I got over my Hr/SS "thing," but I remember enjoying it, if you're into that.

  Clever Miss Hermione Granger believes that by marrying Azkaban prisoner 11652 she can effectively skirt the new Ministry Marriage Law requirements. A story about morality, mortality, and pickled walnuts.
