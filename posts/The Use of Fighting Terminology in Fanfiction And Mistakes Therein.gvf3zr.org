Hey all,

*Edit* Apparently I am incorrect. I've just never heard it used that way anywhere but in fanfiction. Who knew!

There is a mistake I see a lot in fanfiction and recently have seen more often and so I thought I would do a little write up on it. People who don't misuse the word "spar". I have a fair bit of experience with martial arts, mostly kickboxing, so I find it jarring when a word which is patently a verb is used as a noun.

Spar is a verb. One does not have a "spar" with an oponent. One spars with an oponent. A sparring match is a match in which one spars. If you want a term which means a discrete unit within a larger fighting competition one should use "round" or "match" (depending on the size of the competition).

It something that comes up with alarming regularity in fanfiction which focuses on dueling. Often used in a smilar fashion to this "The spar ended with Harry plucking her wand from her hand." or "Harry had enjoyed the first two spars; it was nice to have a change from his solo work in the Chamber every day." It's a real shame when it gets misused like that because I will be reading along enjoying the duel and the story and then suddenly there is this jarring misuse of a word which throws me off. It's usually used only a handfull of times and its easy to get back into it, but I would rather it just not be used this way.

Cheers,

Verdain


** Spar is also a noun. Seems like you might want to slow down with the sparring, brain damage is already kicking in.

That was a joke. In all seriousness though, I would check a dictionary before you complain.

*** Evidently I am incorrect. You learn something new everyday. I've been doing martial arts for about 7 years now and never heard it used that way.

** Your first step should have been to check a dictionary. From [[https://M-W.com][M-W.com]]:

spar /noun (2)/Definition of spar (Entry 3 of 5)

1: a movement of offense or defense in boxing

2: a sparring match or session

*** You're right, I probably should have checked a dictionary. I just assumed that in 7 years of martial arts I would have heard the word used that if it was useable that way. Evidently, I was wrong.

**** A reasonable assumption, but I've found that communities sometimes develop their own vocabulary, so to speak.

** Other people have pointed out that spar is a noun, but lots of verbs can be use as a noun. Walk, fight, talk, punch, drive, etc.

This is nothing about fighting terminology as it is about a weird quirk of English(It may be a thing in other languages but I only know a mediocre amount of French along with English)

If we take a look at French, verbs and nouns are much more distinct. "Parler" is the french verb that means "to talk". But the noun form ,"a talk" is "une conversation" or "une discussion"

In fact, this literary aspect of the English Language is /exceedingly/ common, in where you would use words as different parts of speech. Its called Anthimeria. For instance, if someone moved into a new place and redecorated it wouldnt be extremely weird to say something like "Gosh, you really Alexed the place up." That particular case is Noun to Adjective but Noun to Verb and Verb to Noun are also common.

*** That's all true. There is also often, though not always, a modification made to said word to make it a different part of speech. In the given example, "Alexed" I assume takes the name Alex and ads the "ed" to the end of it to invoke an action done by Alex. For the word spar to transform it into a noun I would traditionally have added match to the end of it, sparring being and adjective clarifying match.

I had just never heard spar used that way anywhere but in fanfiction after 7 years of martial arts. I gues it just goes to show that use can vary from place to place and discipline to discipline.
