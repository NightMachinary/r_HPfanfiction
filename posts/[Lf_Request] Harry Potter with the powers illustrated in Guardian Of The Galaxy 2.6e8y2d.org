** I'm going to guess you want a raccoon animagus with a fetish for technology. As this is obviously the coolest powerset shown in GOTG.

Unfortunately raccoons are not very glamorous and as such they are rarely chosen by authors for their characters to turn into.

Now if you provided more info specifically on what you want I may be able to narrow it down to either the technology fetish or the small mammal animagus.

I'm pretty certain something has to exist that has wormtail using a TV or something so that is like good enough right?

*** There's also a TON of fics where Harry's animagus form is a mongoose, so that's probably close enough.

*** I'm not sure if this is exactly what you want, as it is massively AU, but Harry does get some Celestial like powers. The part with his powers is late in the fic though.

Hell Eyes by Jezaray.

Warning you again, MASSIVELY AU. It's not everyone's cup of tea.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

** Or, y'know, you could describe these powers, so people who haven't seen the movie can give you recommendations. Just a crazy thought.
