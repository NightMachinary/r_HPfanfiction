** When Dudley Dursley sees his ten-year-old son going down the wrong path, he forces him to write in a diary every night. How can a bully and a failing student turn into the hero his father would like him to become?

A/N: Dear reader, this story is conceived as excerpts from an primary-school-aged student's diary. This is not how I, AnneNeville, actually write. Please bear with little Hal Dursley. Children do learn, after all.

A/N 2: This story follows an OC from my multi-chapter Next-Gen story, Even Unto the Seventh Generation.

*** You made Dudley name his son after Harry? Interesting

**** In my head!canon, an awful lot of kids were probably named "Harry" or "Harriet" in the years after the war. :-)

***** I suppose it's better than a sudden upsurge in the number of Toms... sadly.

*** Thank you! I'm still working through Chapter 9. Long stories are quite complex, especially when you have two POVs, have to keep them antagonists, yet both sympathetic, AND have to keep the overall plot moving. This chapter is the "Humble Albus" chapter, and I've got the beginning and the end, but need to find a little bridge for the middle.

I think writing more about Hal helped. Sometimes, it's distracting moving from story to story. Other times, it really helps clarify things/give the brain time to turn over your various ideas. Even with detailed outlines, plotting and character development is hard.

When you do get to EUthe7thG, I hope you enjoy it and let me know what you think. I /really/ appreciate concrit--its the only way to grow.

** Great read. Makes me wish there were more to read! Maybe something like letters to Dudley.

*** Maybe I'll do that at some point. HAMD is a secondary but getting more prominent character in my longer fic. I never would have written the above fic but for a challenge. I didn't really think anyone would want to read a fic from an OC's point of view, even if his father was Dudley (/especially/ if his father was Dudley?).

** And thank you ALL for the nice comments. I had a lot of fun writing this--it was for a challenge--and now I feel I know Hal better I think he's one of my favorite two secondary OCs (I think of the canon next gen characters as OCs too, since we know nothing about them).

I was bullied /a lot/ in school (like from third grade through sophomore year of HS), and have seen bullies reform--even apologize and ask for forgiveness at age 14! I've always wondered how they got to that place. This was one way I tried to explain it to myself.
