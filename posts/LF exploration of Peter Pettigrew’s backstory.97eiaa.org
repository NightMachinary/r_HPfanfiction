Looking for something getting into Peter Pettigrew's story. I'm not really looking for redemption or innocence, I'm more so looking for fics that explore why he made the decisions he's made.

I'd love to find something along the lines of A Difference In the Family in terms of depth, though obviously not with the same redemptive arc.

Thanks friends :)


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) Pettigrew is competent and terrifying. We also starting in book three get glimpses into how he ended up that way.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
