No offence.

**** That's a bit too much of a comparison. What Bella would then be doing, in terms of changing the magical-war-story, would be a complete and utter ridiculous twisting of pure and simple facts, without any reasonable foundation to stand on.

But as for the Holocaust, well, I'm not going to discuss that. It's a sensitive topic that's bound to attract aggro and keyboard-warrior sprees.

** Hmmm... seems like you might be either a redneck, skinhead, or someone who denies the Holocaust? There is no way to spin a genocide of a people as a worthy and heroic cause, bro.
