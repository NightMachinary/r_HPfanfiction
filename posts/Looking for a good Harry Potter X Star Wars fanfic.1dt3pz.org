Hi, recently I read plums fanfic [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9068231/1/Last-Second-Savior][Last Second Savior]] (if you haven't read it, I recommend) and now I'm looking for another harry potter/star wars crossover. I haven't been lucky so far and now I'm asking for [[/r/HPfanfiction]] for help.

He has quite a few good ones.

*** Thanks, but I alredy knew him, I read at least half of Broken Chains and I felt like something was missing and drop it. I am actually looking for one where Harry goes to Star Wars, not Star Wars goes to Harry Potter. But thanks for the help anyway.

**** Yeah, Broken Chains basically ends up with Sith!Harry steamrolling everyone and everything in his way with forcemagic and low grade SW tech. Voldemort briefly tries to be a worthy adversary. A pity, it had potential early on. Though some of his other stuff is very good, that one kind of fell flat.

I've been looking myself but I've found sadly little.
