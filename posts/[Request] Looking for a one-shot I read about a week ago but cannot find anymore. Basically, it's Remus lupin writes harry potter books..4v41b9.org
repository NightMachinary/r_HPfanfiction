Details: Remus writes a series of books featuring Harry Potter as a character-generally when he goes on a bender-under an alias. It's not really much by itself, but it's almost perfect as a set-up for something bigger, so I was wondering where I could find it... and who the author is too, since I kind of want to see if there are other little gems like that one lying around.

More details: it's on ff.net, it's a recent one-shot and it opens up with something like /Harry Potter exited the Dragon Reserve and bade his new friends farewell before going off to face another adventure./ and that's about all I can remember about it.


** Tried to help you find it but omg the amount of harry/snape dreck that has remus also in it... I feel i desperately need a shower.
