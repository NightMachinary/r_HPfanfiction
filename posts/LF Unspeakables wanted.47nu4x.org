#+begin_quote
  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

I don't remember if 'Path of his own' was actually good or just a generic harem fic, and I didn't personally like 'Vengeance', however they both feature unspeakables so there you go.

The other ones are great.

*** Summer of Change is just fantstic. I have read it multiple times through the years and it just holds a special place in my heart. Every once in awhile, i look to see if Lorddwar has returned. I know it silly but I would love for him(?) to carry on with more of the story and create a sequel (though for the select few of you who haven't read the story, it is very much complete)

**** Couldn't agree more. It isn't without its flaws and clich√©s, but despite not being "completed" in the sense that your standard through book 7 fic is, it is one of the most satisfying and engaging fics I have read.

I would love to have more, but at least it had an ending of sorts, rather than just having the author disappear off the face of the planet in the middle.

****** It's an older story, one of the first major Honks fics. A lot of the concepts have been taken and used by a ton of people in newer stories which gives it that feeling. Fics like Altered Destinies have the same issue where they just didn't age well because of how many similar stories were written later.
