I enjoy stories where something happens to Harry Potter before Hogwarts causing his life to take a different early path, but also where Harry is MIA to the Wizarding world and Dumbledore at first. He usually still ends up going to Hogwarts (either on time, or late, or occasionally from another Wizarding school), and usually ends up being more independent and strong (grey Harry, Powerful Harry). A change in his life has changed him and hes not the same boy in terms of personality, ability, power, strength, ideals, and so on and so forth.

Recently I started reading Breath of the Inferno and while those same sort of components apply, it had one of the more unique beginnings I had seen.

--------------

Spoiler (dont have to read it to recommend):\\
[[/spoiler][#4 Privet drive exploded due to magical backlash of some sort when he was being abused. He apparently became a dragon animagus suddenly and has lived 5 years as a dragon Animagus in a Goblin gold cave after driving them off.. (think.. LoTR dragons style). Then Harry is found by Dumbledore and Minerva and as a magical animagus he is stronger and more powerful and his personality is one of a much more confident and strong individual. They then bring him back to Hogwarts]]

linkffn(11502532)

While the story is not really focused on his early life (which is fine), I just found the concept extremely fun and interesting.

--------------

So, I am looking for stories that follow a similar path. His life takes a different path, likely one that has him vanishing or hiding from those in charge.... and he comes out of it as a different person and perhaps more powerful when its time for him to show back up (likely when going to Hogwarts at some point). If you didnt want to read the spoiler above thats fine, and while it gives a bit more insight on the components I am more interested, its not necessary to recommend. I love checking out all suggestions and recommendations in time.

Romance being included is important if possible. No male slash but any other types is fine. Mature ratings preferred. I dont have a problem with smut or anything but priority to the plot if possible.

Thanks!


** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), yet? He never went to Hogwarts in that fic.

--------------

Brennus likes Harry going to Hogwarts late or never. He is a dedicated H/G shipper, but Ginny in his fics are SIGNIFICANTLY different than in canon. She either did not have crush on him, did not know him, or was downright hostile to him:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9065880/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Butterfly-Effect][Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect]], linkffn(9065880): Flamels took him in. Harry only went to Hogwarts for the final year. Extreme Dumbledore and strong Weasley bashing, although Weasleys redeemed themselves in the end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9537818/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nameless-Man][Harry Potter and the Nameless Man]], linkffn(9537818): Harry never went to Hogwarts. He and Ginny met well after the War, and went to hunt a serial killer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Grindelwald trained Harry, and he returned in Year 6. Nobody trusted him, and Ginevra was in Slytherin and hostile to him at first. This is the ultimate bash fic with over-the-top sex and violence.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11054843/1/Homecoming][Homecoming]], linkffn(11054843): Harry never went to Hogwarts and returned to Britain several years after the War. He and Tonks were working on a case, and met Ginny accidentally. [[/spoiler][Daphne Greengrass and her father were the big bad]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): Harry never went to Hogwarts and was not trusted by the Weasleys. He however hired Ginny to accompany him on some adventures, but the ending threw a twist.

** Sounds like we have really similar taste, one user already mentioned the author Brennus, many of his fics will fit your requirements. Two more I think you'll like are linkffn(11868509; 5856625) . You'd also probably like linkffn(2567419) , it's a bit of what you're looking for but starting after Sirius' death. It starts during the summer that follows 5th year and has Harry breaking away from Dumbledore as he becomes more independent/powerful.

*** Ive read The Return of the Marauders, but did not really like it, although my opinion may of been colored by it being a Harry/Ginny fic.. and again.. not really a an of that pairing. It was a source of major disappointment in the original books. So unfortunately every time i read a fan fiction with it, my thoughts are already colored by that opinion.

However the other 2 are on my kindle right now and waiting to be read. I had just held off for a variety of reasons. Sounds like i need to give them another look. Thanks for the recs!
