^ A thing I remember is that Harry is asked to start a fake 'rebellion', it is also a Voldemort/Harry/Lucius. Harry really doesn't care that Voldemort won and still goes to Hogwarts. Voldemort, Lucius, or Severus is the Headmaster. I also remember that Voldemort and Lucius take him to a manor and take him shopping.

Thank you!


** Might be a Harry/LV fic called 'second chances' came to mind from the manor thing and going shopping, it had Harry pregnant with Vold's child so idk if it's the one you're looking for

*** It isn't, I think the one I'm looking for probably does not have mpreg but not quite sure, I don't remember much but random points, I also think it starts in the Great Hall, and I remember its more of a Voldemort/Harry/Lucius then just Harry/Voldemort. But I quite like Second Chances!
