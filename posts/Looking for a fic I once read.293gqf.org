It was a Draco time travel fic in which he returns to his 11 year old body in an attempt to change things. All I really remember of the plot is that he ends up petrified in second year while talking to Myrtle about the chamber and later is disowned by Lucius and goes to live with Snape. If anyone can point me in the right direction I would very much appreciate it.
