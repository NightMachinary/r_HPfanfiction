To be honest, the premise is almost a direct ripoff of The Denarian Trilogy by Shezza (with permission, supposedly) but makes Harry quite a bit stronger; it also has a bunch of cliches (WBWL, Harry's name is not actually Harry) and quite a few grammar issues, so I'm not extolling the writing or the story itself.

Having said that, the events starting from chapter 9 through the end of what's been written are my absolute favorite guilty pleasure to read. Harry is so ridiculously badass (almost over the top), has no qualms/regrets about any of the decisions he makes, and essentially does whatever the fuck he wants do.

So yeah, don't expect to find a great fic, but I wanted to throw it out there because I feel like it really matches up with what you're asking for. If you can get through or skim through the first 8 chapters, then the rest of the chapters are a little more enjoyable to read.

  He hated his life, his relatives, and most importantly, his own weakness. So when he chances upon a Denarius coin, he took it, even if it meant damning his own soul in the process. And now, he's a Denarian, the host of a Fallen Angel, and the Fallen is hungry for vengeance; and for him, absolutely nothing will stand in his way. Based on Shezza's Denarian Renegade. Slight HP/FD.

Harry does not give a fuck in this story. Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  Harry gets picked for the Triwizard Tournament. He does not like this. Mayhem, destruction, and HHR. OOC Harry. M for violence and frequent profanity.
