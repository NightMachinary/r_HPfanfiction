It's probably 15-20 years old, and I have no idea what site it was on. Harry got a job building furniture in Little Whinging and did a mosaic tabletop of the Gryffindor crest. Rita Skeeter somehow got wind of it and interviewed him for an article, which told the Death Eaters where he lived. They destroyed the neighborhood.

Later on (I think this was the same fic) Harry and Ron buy necklaces for Hermione and Ginny. The shopkeeper's wife explains wearing multiple necklaces is the style. The necklaces end up saving their lives. They find a phoenix sanctuary and bond with phoenixes.

Does anyone know what fic this is? Or remember it at all? It was one of the first fics I ever read, and what started me writing my own. I'd really like to read it again.


** Sounds like HP and the Refiner's Fire by Abraxan, at least the first part.
