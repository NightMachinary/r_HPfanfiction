I only remember that in this fic Draco has a dragon patronus and it is revealed that the reason he has it is because on his 5th birthday his family conditioned him so it would happen. I've been looking for this for ages, plz help!


** that's The man who lived by SebastianL. Great fic, highly recommend to anyone looking for a well-written postwar story.
