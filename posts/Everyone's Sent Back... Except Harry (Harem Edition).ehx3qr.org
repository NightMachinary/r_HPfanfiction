《Sort of a Crack fic》 The misty white afterlife version of Kings Cross Station. The Limbo Harry Potter found himself within before returning to finish off the Dark Lord once and for all.

It was his wife that found her way there this time. Ginerva Weasley, age 40. A tragedy to die so young for a Muggle surely, but even more so for a witch projected to live at least a century longer. But the years had been rough.

Her Quidditch career was out of the question as soon as it started. The Death Eaters wouldn't quit, and then those who hadn't taken the Mark but still held the values kicked around until they finally got the better of all of them. Taking her beloved from her on the steps of Gringotts, before finally making their way to her after she sent the kids off to safety. She wondered if Harry's own mother had felt such a crushing sense of love and loneliness when she fell to the green curse.

"Ah, finally. You're the last one here."

Crisp, sharp and just a little nasally. A figure in a suit, legs crossed and in a high back chair that hadn't been there before. That three-piece hanging from the scrawny figure as if one had attempted to dress a skeleton.

"I'd say 'take a seat' but you don't have time to. Father Time is pissed and won't hold off for much longer." He spoke, tone rushed. He did not give her time to speak. Wispy grey bangs shoved away by gloved fingers as his gaze was fixed.

"Hear's the jist of it. Over a decade ago, Daphne Greengrass raided her sisters husbands manor and found a time turner that allowed complete time travel, she geared up, emptied her vaults and travelled back in time to 1981."

"To help Voldemort?!" A million thoughts in her mind, where the Dark Lord didn't fall the first time. Or he was ressurected by a loyal follower form the future just after. The horror and misery that would befall their world at such-

"No. To fuck your husband."

She thought he was joking, his dead serious expression said otherwise, "Has had a massive crush for just as long as you have. Her most treasured moment, even when she went back in time at 23, is the time they brushed hands when forced to partner up in potions." A quiet snicker was present under his voice, "She's installed herself as the distant aunt of her younger self and taken control of the Greengrass fortune and is attempting to install herself in Harry's life."

"So you've called me to stop-"

"Father Time sent back another, though former, time traveller already." Quick but disinterested, flipping a sheet of crisp paper over in a clipboard she hadn't seen previously, "To both keep Harry safe AND mitigate changes to the timeline."

"Wh-who?"

"Hermione Granger. Plucked her from the instance of her death by Zabini's hand and plopped her soul in her younger self."

"But... what-"

"Then she decided, after a rather unhappy relationship and marriage with your bro... to instead try her luck with her other best friend." Flippant, but still amused, "Again, loved him since her first year, repressed the feelings cause she didn't want to harm their friendship. Secretly hated you for having what she always wanted. Do not expect help from her."

"Romantically that is-" It looked up from the clipboard for the first time, milky eyes on her disbelieving hazel,

"I gathered that." Ginny snapped. She felt as if the man was smirking, but she couldn't quite discern any solod facial features on the mans face.

"Next he came to me and asked to borrow Nymphadora from the afterlife. Made her pose as an entirely new student to the masses and privately aid him from behind the scenes."

She sensed the but,

"Turns out though, she kinda got attached. Got a bunch of the older girls into some Sisterhood intent on owning Harry Potter as their 'little brother.' Was funny at first, still kinda is."

It went on. Romilda Vane was next, followed by Luna Lovegood. Her blood boiled at the inclusion of a Bellatrix made younger who attached herself to him as a bodyguard in an alliance with a similarly youthful Fleur. However she TRULY wretched at the idea of a pair of Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape from a gender switched universe going back in time to also seduce her younger, oblivious husband.

She teetered and really wished she could sit down. Knowing this spooky, just out of sight, man was sneering over at her now. She glared and roared out her question,

"Why are you telling me this, to mock me? To gloat?!"

He frowned, he cocked his head, he radiated both utter bafflement and genuine mirth,

"Nah, I just thought that... well... do you NOT want in on this?" Leaning forward in his seat, that dreaded smirk there for her to see in all its teeth like tombstones glory, "I mean, there are over half a dozen witches from the present who've gone back in time to steal your man. Are you alright with just... allowing that?"

[PLOT TWIST: She wasn't.]

-《40 year old Ginny Weasley, sent back in time to ensure her husband marries her, and not these slags who got with him in fanfiction.》-

This got me thinking. You know how in most harems, the girls are somehow totally fine sharing the man?

I want to read one where they still have the hots for him, but are not-so-okay with sharing. At least not with so many others. Since they understand they might not win him over alone, they form alliances and compete to be his #1. Cue lots of backstabbing and intrigue and thinly veiled insults and catfights.

Basically, harem politics.

*** A lot/most harems have this outside of fanfiction. For instance, in Fate: Stay/Night, if Rin is closer to Shirou, she's fine with sharing him with Saber, but if Saber is closer, she doesn't want to share. Neither of them want to share with Sakura, but Rin won't compete with Sakura, and Saber's feelings vacillate between platonic and romantic a lot. That's not getting into Ilya or Mitsuzuri.

*** The name of the only story I've found that comes close to this escapes me at the moment, but basically all the standard Hogwarts harem girls Tracey/Susan/Daphne/Luna/Ginny etc. realize that they all want Harry and compete to win his affections. I think Ginny tries to team up with Hermione but Hermione betrays her so Harry ends up with Hermione and Daphne

*** There was this Light Novel called Sevens that had this. The girls all understood that their relationship with the guy is steeped in politics and holding the world together. So the inter-harem politics start. Alliances are formed. IIRC, it's completed and translated too.

**** I'm actually halfway through it right now, and the harem part is definitely fun, but the writing pattern where a character says this and the narration immediately echoes it is obnoxious and everywhere.

***** Yeah, I can agree with that. I only finished it because the political harem aspect was hilariously interesting.

The MC going all angsty all the time wasn't doing the stories any favors either.

** Plot Twist: Ginny has a moment of brilliance and realizes that seven people with the walkthrough is better than one. And that if you can't beat them, join 'em. And Daphne is hot.

​

I would read this. For the Sisterhood of the Little Brother. That seems like it would be hilarious. Especially if they have a Bravehart like scene where they all charge #4 Privet Drive to free their little brother from the wretched abusive muggles. The funny part is, they don't even have to be /that/ abusive. In the Sisterhood's mind, anybody who doesn't recognize the greatness of their Little Brother is worse than Hitler. That's why Dobby is their official House Elf.

*** My idea is that the Sisterhood stakes out Private Drive after hearing about what Dobby and the Dursley's did during the previous summer. Then, after seeing him blow up Aunt Marge they infiltrate the Ministry to take down Mafalda Hopkirk.

But end up recruiting her instead. Leading to the Sisterhood's slow but sure infiltration of the Ministry...

**** Second plot twist: Petunia was /also/ sent back in time, but mostly to prevent Dudley's death due to morbid obesity. She decided that, in addition to introducing healthier portions and rewarding exercise, she should help their anger issues - good for the heart. And part of that it making sure Harry isn't available as a convenient scapegoat.
