My OC joined the Order of Phoenix to fight Voldemort alongside the golden trio and others. Later, he defeated Kingsley Shackelbolt by a small margin to become minister for magic.


** - Voldemort remnants continue sabotage and terror attacks. You will be especially at risk from those still hiding in the Ministry
- Vigilantes hunt down any real or perceived Death Eaters. Your problem will be greatly exacerbated if any of the Ministry Six (the Trio, Ginny, Neville, Luna) actually leads them
- Foreign powers seek to expand their influences in Britain during its weakness
- Wizengamot, or the old establishment, unwilling to pass necessary changes and reforms

--------------

I personally have an extremely dismal view of the British Ministry of Magic. It resembled more of a failed state. Although it properly tyrannized law-abiding citizens, it was utterly useless against sadistic genocidal terrorists. For example, after Voldemort came out into open in Year 5, it failed to capture a single Death Eater, despite Harry Potter (their supposedly Chosen One) knowing every one of his inner circle members.

Then, 6 weeks after the great Albus Dumbledore died, it fell without a fight to Voldemort's hordes. Large number of its bureaucracy collaborated enthusiastically with those sadistic genocidal terrorists to exterminate a sizable minority of its population.

Finally ten months later, its own security force, along with that sadistic genocidal maniac and his minions, were destroyed at the Battle of Hogwarts by a group of teenagers and citizen volunteers.

This was an completely pathetic organization that should have lost all authority, legitimacy, and reputation after the war. The Ministry NEEDED Harry Potter, not vice versa, to become a viable institution again.

--- Friedrich Nietzsche

By throwing these kids to the wolves, by making them the frontline fighters against those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums, the old establishment of Wizarding Britain has created a whole generation of hardened and ruthless child soldiers.

They won a brutal victory against overwhelming odds, after experiencing unimaginable hardships and suffering, so don't ever expect them to go easy on their enemies. Even the Wizard Jesus could only take so much, and he would crucio any enemy who spits on his friends. His friends would be even less forgiving.

From their POV, Although they had scored a major victory over the evil, significant number of Voldemort supporters were still on the loose or even hiding in positions of power. Their own hold on the Ministry immediately after the Battle was tenuous at best.

But after the horror and suffering of the past year, they would NOT leave their fate to those soulless bureaucratic Ministry minions again. They would take matters into their own hands and forge their own destiny! You OC Minister must implement the necessary changes and reforms, but minimize excesses that come with every revolution.

--------------

Remember our lessons from the Nuremburg Trial:

- "I'm just following orders" is not a viable excuse in genocides
- "It was legal back then" is also not one. In fact, during the Third Reich, it was illegal to hide Jews, while it was required to report them to Gestapo so they could be shipped to the death camps!
- Torture, murder, terrorism, and genocide have no statute of limitations.

In real world UK, [[https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/offences/magistrates-court/item/funding-terrorism/][terrorist financing]] alone can send someone to prison for 14 years; and Muggle UK is significantly more lenient than Wizarding Britain in crimes and punishment. After what had transpired in DH, victims of that sadistic genocidal terror regime would demand much more severe retributions.

*** Good answer. Also, if you want people to cheer for your OC, they should not accept bribes. Sent the Malfoys' ass to jail. Crack down hard on the death eaters. Use veriteseum in trials.

*** one of the best fics I've seen to point out the sheer breadth of issues with the ministry of magic is a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6762790/chapters/15456556][time travel fic]] where Orion Black is investigating millions of missing galleons in the ministry and realises it's not just one person doing fraud but like, a hundred.

Another interesting thing they also point out is that there are just, hundreds of oathes and vows being broken on a daily basis, and the theory is that at some point magic will just, completely bail on this society of oath breakers. But even without that magical component it truly is such a corrupt establishment, and Voldemort took advantage of that to the point that truly there is no salvaging that institution

On top of that, the kids of two generations were made to fight a war, and all the grandparents seem to be dead, like even those who survived Grindelwald's bullshite seem to be absent, so their society is just limping along, with thee generations of trauma, as as much or more corruption in those who didn't fight in any of those

** I occasionally entertain myself with the idea of Minister Hermione giving House Elves the vote and they immediately vote to get rid of Hermione and replace her with a hardline conservative who wants to abolish the weekend, cancel Christmas, and create a maximum wage of 1 sickle a week.

** - Economy is shot
- No domestic wandcrafter (Ollivander is injured AND most of his stock and materials are gone/stolen/destroyed)
- So much knowledge destroyed. (You can guarantee that Voldemort and his inner circle hosted some book burnings, especially those written by lesser blood statuses)
- Hogwarts is in tatters
- Population is down by at least 40% from all the killings, people escaping, final battle, AND arrests.
- Morale is crap.
- ICW is going to stick their noses in. Dumbledore (and his successor after he got sacked/died) most likely actively lied (or at least undersold the situation) to keep them out.
- They might get invaded by another magical nation.
- Wizengamott won't help or will actively hinder any plans to fix the mess.
- Goblins are pissed off.
- Huuuuuge swathes of [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wandless][Wandless]]

-

Seriously, Wizarding Britain is facing a slow, drawn-out death.

- The first thing he should do is contact the ICW and have them help dismantle the government and wizengamott. That would solve a lot of problems.
- Negotiate a deal to buy wands/materials or to have transport arranged for wandmakers to come to the Britain or customers to go to them.
- Ask the Muggle prime minister for a loan, disaster relief supplies (tents, food, etc), and a building/tract of land they could borrow. Set up temporary housing for the Wandless. Use some of the borrowed money to replace the Wandless' wands with working as a laborer in lieu of payment. You now have a workforce.
- Yoink the Hogwarts students and have them "practice" their magic as laborers, potion brewers, etc. More slightly "skilled" labor.

Not even joking here. Magical Britain doesn't need democracy right now. They need either to be invaded and taken over or a benevolent dictator for the next 10-20 years while they reform.

** The population would be really wanting to move on and forget again, especially as â€˜forgetting' will mean that their various sins would be forgotten if not forgiven, and they can pretend everything is fine.

I definitely see them wanting to get back to normal, an potentially there would be things like we saw from the after math of the last war like throwing people in prison without due process, because they want someone to be the scapegoat

also major risk of the statue being broken. It was bad enough in 81 but there would be way more cameras in 1998, and the internet was in the majority of homes (in Australia at least so I'm guessing it was the same in Britain) by then
