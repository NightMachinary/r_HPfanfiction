I would really like to read a story where Snape is saved before he becomes a death eater! This can be from a character time traveling, an OC who keeps him on the side of good or really anything as long as it's plausible and interesting. Any recommendations?


** Snape do-over fics are what got me back into fanfiction after a seven year break! I find the concept so interesting. Someone has already linked The Moment it Began which is the cream of the crop. I also enjoyed linkffn(second start by 8thweasleykid) which starts kind of meh but gets better and linkffn(his greatest wish by andromedamarine). linkffn(come once again and love me) is a similar concept with a twist. That one's really good.

I also really LOVE linkffn(a dream carved in stone) which starts way more AU but is amaaaazing. The buildup and climax in that one is really good.

  It has been Severus Snape's greatest wish to go back and fix his life with Lily. What happens when he suddenly gets the chance, remembers everything, and has changed enough to avoid Slytherin? Marauder-era, pre- and established Severus/Lily. 50/50 COMPLETE!

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.
