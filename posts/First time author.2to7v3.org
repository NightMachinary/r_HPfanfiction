** Full disclosure - I have basically zero interest in reading a Hermione/Draco story. From my perspective, to make it work at all, you have to change the basic characteristics of their canon selves to a degree where I'd just assume read about two random OCs.

That being said, since you're giving it the old college try, and that's commendable, I did poke around your first chapter. You've got a couple basic red flags here:

Error in the first sentence; should be "Hogwarts Express," not "Hogwarts express." A minor thing, in the end, but to have a blemish in your very first sentence doesn't inspire confidence that this will be a fic with a high degree of polish or attention to detail.

Denoting POV: To step outside the narrative and tell us the POV character of each section is sloppy writing. If we can't tell whose head we're in from the writing, you have bigger problems, and if we can, it's redundant.

Short chapter: 1,000 words is not long enough to sink into. It's barely enough to be a teaser. I could live with this, if you did something in those 1,000 words that was blindingly fresh or tense or captivating, but...

All exposition: Your first chapter is like a first date - you need to put some real effort into putting your best foot forward. Introduce tension, conflict, newness. It should be plotted and paced within an inch of its life. Instead, this is classic 10th date, stay-at-home-with-Netflix-and-sweat-pants stuff. Nothing inherently wrong with it - a chapter of atmosphere and introspection can work as an interlude, for example - but you're not showing any leg, which means you're not doing a great job hooking me.

Show vs. tell: Another basic thing - okay, so they're meeting on a train, the war is over, they're going back to school, etc. You get a lot more conflict and tension and character development and all that good stuff out of presenting this kind of information as dialogue and action, rather than internal musing.

If you have Hermione think to herself, "the war was over and she had never felt happier to be alive," then you're just telling me she feels a certain way, and you lose.

If you can show me Hermione acting in a certain way, saying something to someone, injecting the pure, raw /feeling/ of what it means to come through a brutal war and be gloriously /alive/, and make me, as a reader, feel that on her behalf because I'm so viscerally right there with her and inside her head, then you win.

** Very interesting first chapter! You really made me curious about the story and so I kept reading :)

There were some redundant words here and there, and more sentence length variety would be awesome.

I loved how you put little snippets of detail here and there to really bring life to the scenes. Also, the subtle tone of each character's perspective was really nice.

Hope to see more chapters!

** u/Notosk:
#+begin_quote
  Heriome x Draco
#+end_quote

/Ugh/

I just skimmed thought it it seems decently well written, But I'll wait until you have more written to give you an opinion.

Edit: Just to say that, I don't like Hr/D because it's maybe one of the most unrealistic pairings in the fandom (after Voldemort/Anyone, Snape/Harry, Snape/Hermione). I understand the appeal of Nerdy girl x Bad boy but after all that happens in canon and how Draco treats Hermione (and Draco Values) I can't see a way for them to start a relation ship.

Also, there is Ron who people just hate for whatever reason so he ends up being bashed or becoming some kind of rapist caricature, although in canon Hermione was headsoverheels for him. people just tend to handwave all the develpemnt from canon.

I want to read a good, realistic, well written D/Hr, and i would like to think that your fic would be the one but on the other hand I don't want to be disapointed.

So in conclusion let me ask you a few questions.

You say this story is D/Hr. how will you handle the fact that Hermione hates Draco and Draco hates Hermione?, How will you handle that after DH Ron and Hermione are an Item?, How will you handle Ron?

*** To answer your questions I'm going to give you a couple of spoilers. First of all I'm going to deal with them hating each other by forcing them to live together. I was thinking to have them both named as head girl/boy and then make them live in the same dorm for their position. Then Hermione will attempt to be more open minded, and Draco having changed after the war will be more empathetic as well.

To deal with Ron, I think I'll just have him get jealous at Draco for spending so much time with Hermione. Then Hermione will finally realize his "idiotic" nature and kind of blow him off.

If you have any more questions Id love to answer them!
