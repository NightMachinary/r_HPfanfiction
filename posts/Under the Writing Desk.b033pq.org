Hey all! My girlfriend recently started creating Harry Potter fanfiction based off the game Harry Potter Hogwarts Mystery! She only uses Tumblr for now, but I'm trying to convince her to join a more welcoming (and larger) community like Reddit. Anyway, I hope you guys can check it out and see what you think!

​

P.S. Not used to posting on Reddit myself (more of a lurker :3) so I hope I followed everything to a T. :D
