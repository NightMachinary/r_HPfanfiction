I like sarcastic banter friendships and romances. Usually my object of affection is the "morally grey" or "evil but probably redeemable" character, and then I choose a partner for them that will create a great sarcastic relationship (they usually have excellent chemistry on-screen, which feeds into it). Either straight or lesbian, never gay guys for the romance, but sarcastic friendships between men is great.

Unfortunately, the characters I always fall in love with are usually never the main character and never “get the girl”. I almost always seem to end up in the category of /“most popular fanship that the writers will never do”/. On the extremely rare occasion it does become canon, I usually fall out of my chair in shock.

My boyfriend says I just like “mean” characters and that the general population doesn't like these kinds of characters. Hence, why they never “get the girl.”

I think I like these characters because they're confident and competent. Both traits are very sexy. The “goody two shoes” characters are often blundering idiots, or boring because they haven't suffered enough. Tragedy and the resulting conflicting darkness is interesting and makes a character complex and emotionally relatable. They've got a heart underneath all the crap. It may not even be a perfect heart. But it's still worth it. They just have “extra patience required” personalities when dealing with them. XD They're more complicated than /”aww let's hug and be friends!”/ You gotta hug them slowly when they're not looking so they don't freak out. Hehehehehe

Canon-ships are ***bolded*** to show you how rarely I like what canon chooses for us.

And I don't know why, but when they have a lesbian character, I always hate the canon-lesbian pairing and feel more chemistry between a straight pairing option instead. And vice-versa, when there's a lesbian pairing I actually want, they're always straight. It's like the writers have no feeling for actual acting chemistry and just slam two characters together for no reason. Lost Girl is even better. All of the pairings I want, aren't the ultimate OTP of the show. I don't plan to dislike the canon-OTP of every show, but it always works out like that.

I am with you here, banter is probably the most entertaining and lifelike way you can write a relationship since most of the body language and gesture-based interactions do not translate well to fiction.

That archetype is missing in the HP world IMO. Snape was a petty asshole who bullied children over a grudge with a guy who was dead for a decade. That seems like the opposite of confident or badass to me. Draco was all bark and no bite. Bellatrix can fill that niche, but she is a henchman, not a confident leader (and she is batshit insane). Voldemort, just no. He is the closest you get to magical Hitler, and he is so far beyond the hot-crazy curve that you can no longer see the line.

Also, they regularly get beaten by a schoolboy and his friends, so they are the definition of incompetence, with only Bellatrix managing to be properly threatening. Dumbledore has Snape leashed, Draco can't kill and Voldemort cooks up crazy plans instead of just going for the kill. Also, his strategy during the Battle of Hogwarts is so stupid that only the defenders' incompetence made it a close call.

I am open to pretty much every girl with Harry as long as you stay away from the fanon interpretations (Ice Queen Daphne, Goddess Hermione, Quidditch Girl/Soulmate Ginny, Veela-bond Fleur, "wants to see my face" Tonks)

*** Snape is talented in Potions, DADA, dueling, Occlumency, Legilimency. He is a very competent wizard. And Alan Rickman's performance at least is played with the confidence and control that he knows how talented he is.

I'm with the group that JKR intended (or later decided she liked better) Alan Rickman's performance of Snape. (Strict and sarcastic, but not as bad as he seems. And that Harry is an very unreliable narrator.)

I see the potential of what Snape could be, which is why I read fanfics that flush him out and make him a main character. We see so little of him in the books, and all thru the lens of Harry.

**** Snape is talented, I never said otherwise. But his need to bully children, especially Harry over a grudge with a bloke who is dead for 10 years, is just pathetic. The books are explicit in that regard. And he is one of the best defined characters and gets more background information than Hermione.

As for Rickman, he was a good actor, but far to old for Snape, who is 30 in the first book/movie.

***** I can see the Snape-haters are camping out in the thread already, with all of the downvoting.\\
He might get more background information than Hermione, but we never get to see Snape from a more neutral point of view ever. The closest we come is to the Spinner's End scene. Everything else is seen through the eyes of Harry or the Marauders. I'm not saying he was "nice", only that we are getting a heavily biased viewpoint all the time. We never see different sides of him. We never see inside his head. The viewpoint of him in the books is very one-dimensional. The closest we get to some kind of canon version of what is going in Snape's head in this: [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/the-harry-potter-books-from-severus-snapes-perspective]]

  " In the end, Snape performed his duty, killing his closest ally, and */his dearest friend,/* "
#+end_quote

That's a pretty strong description. Dumbledore is Snape's dearest friend?! We certainly aren't SHOWN this in the books, but something was going on, that Harry Potter never saw. The books do very little to flush Snape out as a three-dimensional human being. He's just the one-dimensional jerk as far as the Harry lens is concerned. But it's that one-dimensional veneer that allows fanfic authors the ability to explore so many different options with explaining what's /really/ going on beneath the surface.

We literally do when he gives his memories to Harry twice (and it is obvious he was cherrypicking a lot). You can even argue that the pensive bit in OotP was a set-up aimed to paint a better picture of him (or a worse one of Sirius and James).

******* hahaha, I have no love of Pottermore either. But Pottermore, The Book That Shall Not Be Named, and JKR's stupid tweets are technically "canon".

But do notice that after Snape gave his memories to Harry, Harry decided he was a "hero" and worth naming his son after him. So there's that.

It's probably just shitty JKR writing again, but how the hell did Snape cherrypick exactly the right memories when he's literally bleeding out from a snake bite? Like did he have some kind of "package" boxed up in his mind, ready for delivery, the instant it was needed? I would have expected a crazy massive information dump, or even if there was time to pick a few quick memories to explain everything as quickly as possible, still some random memories chucked in by accident. Now I want a fanfic where someone tries to pour their entire brain into a pensieve, either as a complete record of their knowledge, or as a strange method of immortality.

The occlumency lesson pensieve scene is great because there's about a million different interpretations/arguments for /'was it on purpose, was it not on purpose'/ that Harry had access. I put my money on Snape NOT wanting Harry to see it just because he was so angry about Harry snooping. But you can always make more complicated, layered arguments like /"Snape is furious Harry is a snoop. But just in case Harry decides to snoop, Snape chooses the best memory to punish Harry for snooping."/ But I don't think JKR is clever enough for that many intentional layers.

** I like romances between two people who are equals. She's not eye candy that's just there to fullfil the authors fantasies and he's not an emasculated pretty boy whose only purpose is to be humiliated (right, Potato19?). Both should be interesting, and smart and funny in their own ways, both should bring substance to the story on their own, and their union should be an even greater boon.

I like relationships that are cute and flirty and light-hearted on the surface, but when the going gets tough, the tough get going and so they should both be very tough---steadfast in their love and support for the other. Basically they kick dark lord ass together and then they frick.

Lastly, they should both be smart and mature enough to avoid all the stupid, contrived plot devices that surface in order to bring drama to their relationship. "I love you and I know you love me and I know we could be happy together right now if I wanted it but I'll marry your brother anyway" lol fuck you.

*** You sound like the type that doesn't get hung up on one character, but just looks for a solid romance of any pairing?

I think many fans get really hung up on one single character in a series, and then look around for options to pair with them. While the partner is often well-written, the partner is only well-written for the sake of the character the fanfic author is so in love with. Outside of that context, they would never choose to write about the partner.

*** If there's one thing I never liked in romance in fics is when the fic goes on and call the girl "the most beautiful girl in her year" or similar as an objective fact. It just makes them unapproachable and goes in hand with sayings like "she's out of your league" and similar. I much prefer fics focusing on personality traits and how they work well together as a couple. Not saying they can't be good looking but focus should be elsewhere.

** SSHG is one of the pairings I read the most. It can be done well. However, I don't really have much emotional investment in it and read it mostly because it's the most "safe" SS pairing (I almost only read SS-centric fics), and my preferred pairing (LESS) has an unusually high rate of bad endings. That and I've pretty much gone through all of them on FFN/Ao3 and there simply isn't any left anymore.

I've always liked Sev&Harry guardian/mentorship fics (but preferring the reverse the most -- Harry raising a young Severus due to time travel/de-aging), but I don't think that's the kind of connection between them you was thinking of.

*** If you're familiar with the WoWP fandom, Alex/Justin is the most popular ship in the fandom, just because those actors accidentally had amazing chemistry onscreen together. It was quite the "in joke", even in the show itself. Here's one "in joke" alluding to the popularity of Alex/Justin in this episode: [[https://youtu.be/oVeYZ2nxIXA?t=1049]]

"/Alex and Justin have such chemistry/." *obvious* *heavy pause* /"it's like they grew up together."/ AKA the show writers basically saying "guys we know you like this pairing the most, but we can't stick them together for you since they started the show as brother and sister." But it was really fun to see the writers subtly acknowledge the fandom this way.

​

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestYayShipping][Incest Yay Shipping]]: Jalex (Justin and Alex who are brother and sister) is the most popular ship for /Wizards of Waverly Place/. It may also be a case of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar][Getting Crap Past the Radar]].
- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble][Relationship Writing Fumble]]: Inadvertently or otherwise, the writers have added heaps of Incest Yay to Justin and Alex's sibling relationship. Consequently, Jalex is the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple][Fan-Preferred Couple]] of the show. In a Disney show. For children.
