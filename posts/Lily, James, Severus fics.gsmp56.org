I'm reading Echoes from the Past [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Valerie_Vancollie/pseuds/Valerie_Vancollie][Valerie_Vancollie]] and I kinda like Lily/Snape with James being her friend (Snapes too). Does anyone know any similar stories? This one Lily and Sev were in a relationship but had to keep it a secret and James was her friend and cover and eventually became friends with Snape. Their keeping it secret is why no one knows that James wasn't Harry's father. Most fics with Snape being Harrys father its usually Lily cheated or had her memories messed with (james too in Mpreg slash stories). I'm looking for the three of them (maybe padfoot and moony ) being friends but for some reason no one else knew.


** linkffn(Severus Snape and the Art of War by CypressWand) ... I usually really don't like good!Severus stories (because I think he was in the books objectively horrible person and even Alan Rickman cannot change anything about it), but this one (and linkffn(Reboot by Kallanit) ... that one however looses points by heavy mind-numbingly boring Harmony and bashing).

  After his death, Severus makes the decision to return to the world of the living, starting in the summer of 1975. With his adult knowledge on the upcoming war hidden inside his 15 year old body, he finds his way back to Lily, and his new position in the wizarding world. / This is a pro-snily story. (No character bashing) STORY: COMPLETE

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
