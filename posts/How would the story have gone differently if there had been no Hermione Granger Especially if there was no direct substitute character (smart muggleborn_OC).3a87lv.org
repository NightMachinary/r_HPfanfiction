I read 'Harry Potter without Harry Potter' and a couple of articles on Hermione's importance to the trio, and I was inspired.

What would the dynamics be like without Hermione to do all the heavy lifting and research for the boys and to be something of a moral compass for them, as well as a general asset?

Presumably Dumbledore would still be trying to mold Harry into a hero, but he'd be dealing with a boy who was much more all-round mediocre without Hermione as a study buddy to aid him.

I've never seen a fanfic with this premise, has anyone? Let's discuss it anyway.


** It's an intriguing premise, and if anyone knows of any fics with this idea, I would be interested to read them.

The sarcastic answer is that Ron/Harry would have been dead before their 12th birthdays, but I'm not quite sure.

I think Harry/Ron wouldn't have been as motivated to do the background work, Hermione was not only spearheading things like the research of Flamel, she was prodding them to make sure they looked into it too.

I actually had an idea for a fic like this, Hermione rejects Hogwarts and life goes on, and then she's somehow pulled into the wizarding world just after Voldemort returns.

But that would mean that she would miss out on a whole year of magical education! :D Seriously, I'm curious. There is a number of fics where Harry rejects/leaves the wizarding world, and the wizarding world (usually in the person of Dumbledore or Hermione) eventually comes to him, begging for his help with Voldemort, but Hermione doesn't have a Prophecy that makes her "indispensable".

The chances of the COS being found and Ginny saved drops dramatically without Hermione to piece together the puzzle. You now have a dead Ginny and a very alive Tom Riddle that has the benefit of only being recognizable to those that knew him before Horcrux production.

**** I was trying, but I can't figure out the best way to go about it.

Option 1 is to throw 15yo Hermione into the wizarding world as it would be if she didn't exist. So she shows up at Grimmauld Place, Ginny/Ron/Harry (?) are BFFs and she's an outsider who slowly forms a friendship with them that's still substantially different than the one we see in canon.

Option 2 is to throw 15yo muggleworld!Hermione into the canon universe, where she did enter the wizarding world. So either she's interacting with canon!Hermione, she's switched bodies with canon!Hermione and Harry/Ron want their best friend back. Either way, Hermione is presented with the person she could have been if she had entered the wizarding world.

The problem is that I still want Hermione to be useful and grow to be a solid member of the “team”. I don't want her to be a damsel in distress. And unless I portray her as a magical Mary Sue who's O.W.L.-level within two months, she's going to be lagging behind Ron/Harry magically. So she has to have some other skill or value that puts her on equal footing.

She also has to have a reason to enter the magical world (and stay for at least a short amount of time).

One idea I had was to give her visions of canon!Hermione's life or make her some kind of weird seer, but I don't love it.

Seriously if you (or anyone else reading this) has any ideas, I'm totally open. Would love to actually write this (even though I have like 8 other things going on), but can't figure out how.

***** 15y/o Muggle!Hermione from option 1 would presumably still be hugely intelligent, so she could be a scientist perhaps. It's not too far a stretch to have her possibly in a university course a few years early, and her grounding in natural/chemical sciences at that late stage could possibly surpass/match some of the teachers or professionals who (going by canon) only learn the magical versions of those subjects.

I can see her catching up on and making new forays into at least Potions and Transfiguration based on her existing knowledge of how chemicals, atoms etc. interact. She'd probably be balanced by struggling with charms and any of the more esoteric elements of magic.

In fact I can almost see her being brought into the fold and then quickly recruited by the Order as an advisor, perhaps striking up a quirky friendship with Tonks, rather than with the (at this stage) more immature Ron, Harry, and Ginny, who might have thus far been allowed to grow up just as normal kids.

****** I'm not sure. Hemione's smart, but she's not a prodigy. Her abilities in the books are in part because she puts in the effort. We see her at the top of her year, but we don't see her taking her N.E.W.Ts at 15. You could argue that she would perform better if she wasn't distracted by Voldemort-related adventures, but she kind of fell apart when she tried to take extra classes in PA. If she hadn't made friends with Harry/ron maybe she would have been more advanced in a few of her classes but I don't think she would be publishing papers in Transfiguration Today. And I'm not sure I think things would be significantly different in the muggle world.

And while she would be a fast learner, she wouldn't be able to master 5 year's worth of magical knowledge in a few months. Even with a scientific knowledge that might (or might not) help her.

******* Well, possibly. Canon/fanon is hazy on Hermione's intelligence.

I would also add though that there might be an argument for muggle/magical being a divide here. Pure-muggle Hermione would have been learning the same kinds of things from age 1 to 15; her middle-class, medical parents would likely aid if not push her (I'm pretty sure there's a line from canon that they wanted her to be a dentist), rather than shifting from one educational system into a completely new one at age 11.

In that context, to /still/ be top of her class despite presumably having had 11 years less magical education - at least in terms of theory and introductions, as well as picking up things from family members, she may be more intelligent than you give her credit for. That same intelligence honed from her early years on the same subjects without a switch in focus might be more advanced, if not quite a prodigy - and switching focus to magic at a more advanced level of muggle knowledge might well open the door to some innovative new understandings.

******** There's a line about them wanting her to use muggle dentistry/braces to shrink her teeth, but noting about her being a dentist.

Her parents might push her, but normally pushing a kid involves making sure they're taking honors classes or maybe maybe skipping ahead a year. Pushing normally doesn't involve a 14yo girl taking college-level chem classes. It can, but that's not the norm even if you're the parent who pushes. Also, I don't think we can presume that because her parents were educated (and it's worth noting that being a dentist in the UK only takes a 5 year bachelor and about 1 year of training) they would push her into much much higher levels.

And it comes back to what I said earlier about Hermione falling apart in PA. She's smart and motivated, but she really did not handle extra classes well.

You're right about the switch having an impact, but Harry performs on the same level as Ron and never really suggests that he believes his muggle upbringing to be a significant barrier to his academic success.

But she doesn't know anything about magic at this point. Maybe she's already taken her Chem GCSE at 15, but I'm not sure I genuinely think that would help her understand magic. I remember what I learned in chem, and I don't think it's that related. And even if there were parallels, Herminoe wouldn't notice them right away because she knows nothing about magic at all. She's not going to walk in and go "I know exactly how to mix the lacewing flies and the frogspawn because I already took my Chem GCSE." It's more like "I know how to correctly measure out the frogspawn."

***** Those sound like fun reads.

Option 1 would be a massively handicapped Hermione from what I can tell. Two main drawbacks:

1) she is behind five years in magical education compared to the others. And for all the genius!Hermione that seems to show up in fandom I don't see her catching up to all the rest in a short amount of time. That's not really a problem since even Harry with tutoring is nowhere near Dumbledore's or Voldemort's capabilities at similar ages. (Note: I actually like her much more as a character since she had to work for her ability instead of naturally being talented)

2) What reasoning would have a Hermione without any magical talent show up at Grimmauld Place? If this is around 5th year then it is serving as the HQ for the Order of the Phoenix. The only ones allowed would be people involved in the organization or those with close ties(i.e. the Weasleys and Harry).

Option 2 sounds iffy to me. Never been a fan of alternate universes for OOC reasons. And without canon Hermione it'd probably be much more of a crutch in the trio's quest to defeat Voldemort not being able to depend on canon Hermione's knowledge (unless it'll kick them into gear?).

I actually like your seer idea(Trewlaney 2.0, the irony). It could work to combine both options, toss a sheltered Hermione with no magical education into the Wizarding World a la option 1. Have her be of use by giving her visions of canon Hermione's life in the fight against Voldemort like in option 2.

P.S. Just found out you had an ff.net account from that Ginny diary thread! And a tumblr account! I really like your discussions and perspective on things so you now have a new follower on both. Nice job!

** Well, there are two ways that story could go-one, Harry does actually descend into an academic tailspin. However, there are two issues with that idea, namely the degree of isolation Harry experiences with Ron as his only friend and the level of support he's likely to get from teachers once it becomes obvious that his studying discipline is as bad as Snape suggests it to be.

The second direction is the one I would choose, though, especially after first year; essentially, Harry is discouraged from doing better than Dudley at school in most fanon stories (cannot remember if it's canon or not, so I'll just put fanon there) and is reprimanded when he does better than Dudley. When he gets reprimanded by the staff (possibly by Dumbledore himself should he get more than one troll grade), who know full well what he is capable of and cannot understand why he seems to be worse than Ron, well, I think that would change a few things.

Basically, he was never encouraged by his relatives to study, so despite the fact that he hides in the school library before Hogwarts and probably, as a result, enjoys reading, he does not see good grades as worth working towards.

In canon, Hermione becomes somewhat of a crutch, allowing him to focus on topics of interest while the girl basically points out the bits he absolutely /has/ to study. Without her, he is not told what is and what isn't worthy study material and therefore ends up having to check it all out to figure it out. And given his parents' smarts as well as the crazy insane level of curiosity the boy exhibits (not to mention his Deus Ex Machina-level eye for detail, especially when noticing Chekhov's guns all over the place), it wouldn't be long before boy wonder stumbles upon something of interest that gets him to study.

Now then, academia aside, Hermione played a key role in the series. Without her, Harry wouldn't have had a third opinion on whether to go Gryffindor or not ('Dumbledore went there' indeed). He wouldn't have had to go after the troll. He would probably have been thrown off his broom during his first quidditch match. Ron would have been his only companion to Draco's duel, meaning no alohomora spell and, thus, no Cerberus encounter. And even if he did, the whole 'there's a trapdoor' would have gone unsaid/unnoticed. There would have been nobody to point out that Hagrid raising a dragon in a wooden house was a bad idea, there would have been only two people dragging said dragon through the castle, the search for who Nicky Flamel is would have either taken a lot longer or never happened and Neville wouldn't end up petrified on the floor. Oh, and she wouldn't be there to set Snape's robes on fire either.

More widely, Harry would have had no direct emotional involvement in; muggleborn rights, house-elf rights, pureblood discrimination, general creature rights etc. There would have been no polyjuice potion in second year, time travel in third year, implicit support in fourth year, DA in fifth year, UST in sixth year and camping companions in seventh year.

That is, if Harry survived until seventh year which, without either additional support or a very, very thorough change in attitude when compared to canon/vast majority of fanon, is practically impossible.

Basis for reasoning here; Harry's the most passive wizard this side of Rincewind. Motherfucker spends the entire series reacting rather than trying to get ahead. What's even more frustrating is that there's so much fanfiction trying to make him 'independent'-i.e. more active-that Sturgeon's Law comes and bites us all in the ass on this one.

Quite honestly, I think Hermione's one of my favorite characters in the series simply by virtue of kicking Harry in the ass whenever he gets stuck in a rut. Without her, prepare for canon to be derailed via nuclear detonation very quickly.

**** It depends on how the OP is read. If you remove Hermione from the stories as is, with no change to Harry or someone(s) stepping in, then there is very little chance that the stories can remain very familiar. In that case no Harry wouldn't improve- but then he would be a bystander to the Philosophers Stone and so on down the years.

However Harry Potter if anything is a boy who gets into situations beyond him and somehow overcomes. This being the case and if reading the OP as 'what would change in the stories?' (and still retain a resemblance to canon) it would be that Harry's persistence leads him to overcoming the obstacles. This would almost certainly necessitate an academic improvement. for example: follows/overhears Snape- find out about the PS, hit the books and find info on the stone, hear growling behind locked door- find and learn charm to unlock, look beneath trapdoor- identify plant, find weakness, and learn spell etc. i.e. Harry puts himself in situations that require him to overcome his usual tendencies (duress) therefore he improves even though Hermione isn't there. Again the alternative, you are right, is that he remains mediocre, probably a little more so, in many magical fields. But not 'much more' mediocre as I somewhat disagree that Hermione's study guides, lectures, and useful spells did /that/ much to make Harry a notably competent wizard- at least he doesn't /show/ that he has continued learning loads anyhow.

I doubt either Harry or Ron would be affected too much as far as academics is concerned. They would put off stuff for longer at first, but they would learn soon enough after they get in trouble for unfinished Homework.

For all the Hermione masturbation in this thread, I'll point out that Hermione would have spent a long time in social isolation had it not been for Harry and Ron. Not that she would have lived for long -- the Basilisk would have killed her had Harry not been her friend and told her about the voices in his head, which was what led Hermione to figure it out and carry mirrors at the first sign of hissing.

So, for instance:

- In the 1st year, Hagrid is much more obvious in his “accidentally” blundered out clues and the Potions puzzle is much more easier;

- In the 2nd, Ginny is able to “fight for” enough control against Diary to send a SoS letter to her saviour with all the necessary explanations before being spirited away to the CoS;

- In the 3rd, Malfoy's self-preservation doesn't let him act like an idiot risking his life of an heir to a dangerous beast and the chaotic events at the year's end develop differently to allow Sirius to escape and Harry to cast the full-fledged Patronus;
