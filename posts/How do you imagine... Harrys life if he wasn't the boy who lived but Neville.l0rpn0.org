So I'm gonna try to start posting some "How do you imagine..." posts in the next day so just a heads up. These well deal with fanfiction cliches that in my opinion are either too rarely used (from what I found) or are often written but almost always different. I'll also give my two cents to the discussion by starting it off.:

So Harry Potter but not the boy who shit happens to all the time.

So I imagine Harry as still a prodigy in Dada but only when it comes to the defensive aspects of the class for example he can cast a Protego as easily as breathing and is capable of casting it wordlessly from 4th year onward but if he wants to cast an offensive spell like the Stupefy he has to use the correct incantation wand movement and internal visualization of what he wants the spell to do for it to work. I'm changing this aspect of him because I would want Neville to be capable in Dada and therefore have Voldemorts Horcrux give away the competency in offensive Dada.

Harry is also a lot less involved in the overall plot. I believe that the "protections" for the philosopher stone were a test, not real protections exception off Fluffy because as Quirel has proven knowledge of a Cerberus weakness to music is not common knowledge. Neville also gets the Invisibility cloak from Dumbledore.

The second-year isn't much different because Harry can't really help because he can't speak Phraseltounge. If I had to write harry in this alternative second year I would either have him be petrified as the 3rd or 4th victim and skip the second year or if you want him in the plot give Harry the cursed diary. He gets entranced and once he links the Heir to the diary be too afraid to admit his mistake because he fears that his magic is going to be bound and he has to back to the Dursleys.

3rd year is going to be interesting Sirius (if he is in prison) is linked to Harry and it does not matter if he is the BWL or not. He is afraid of Sirius but because he isn't after the Boy Who Lived Dumbledore doesn't hire Remus Lupin but charlatan Nr 25 named Herman Ulanes a retired Auror from Germany who is constantly drunk and sleeps instead of teaches. The dementors are still around Hogwarts however and this leads to Dumbledor teaching Neville the Patronus spell. Harry also learns the pell and can cast it Corporeal just like Neville because of his talent in defensive magic. The finale works out just like in the movie with Sirius being proved innocent to the heroes but not the ministry or Harry and Pettigrew escapes and finds Voldemort.

4th year I would exit the British Wizarding world. Harry travels abroad for one year because he is taking part in an internationally junior dueling competition that has been set up as a competitor to the Triwizard tournament by the other big Wizarding schools around the glove.

You might have wondered what Harry has been doing all this time if he wasn't involved in the plot. Well, this Harry even though he is a Griffindor is fascinated with Professor Flitwick and his dueling career. He still seeks a challenge and dueling is his outlet.

He wins this dueling competition in his age group but loses once he has to deal with the older Students. He arrives back at Hogwarts a weak before the final task and is preparing/Studying for the end of year exams when the Voldemort bombshell drops and is therefore not present when Neville reappears with the dead body.

Harry manages to get into his fifth year hurray and has to deal with Umbridge nooooo. Harry gets more involved from this point onward he joins the DA and demonstrates why he won the Dueling cup in his age group and is basically on par with Neville when it comes to a duel with Harry being the unbreakable shield and Neville the all piercing Spear who should win who should lose is up to the author. He is also involved in the Battle in the Department of Mysteries and encounters Sirius who he duels because he thinks That Padfoot is a death eater. Because of this delay, Sirius doesn't die but Neville gets torture by Bellatrix Lestrange until Dumbledore saves him. Sirius in the meantime has to deal with a Harry Potter who is pissed in front of him is the man who is responsible for all of his suffering at the hands of the Dursleys. This continues for about half an hour until Harry Runs out of Stamina and Sirius carries him to Ootp headquarters.

And this is where I'm gonna end this for now because I have to get up at 5 am tomorrow and I need sleep. Tomorrow I'm going to finish the last two years and ill write an aftermath. Youll find it under the

EDIT:


** I have a few questions. Is Dumbledore evil in this? Because if he isn't, I see no reason why he would give Harry's family heirloom to Neville? That makes no sense. You can just have it written off or Neville getting one of his own?

That also raises the question, if he isn't the BWL, what happens to his parents? Do they live? Die? Sick? Why is he with the dursleys?

Why couldn't he be adopted or sent to an orphanage?

Why was Sirius in Prison, why did he escape, and how is he connected with Harry in this universe? Sirius was in jail the first time around for killing muggles , which Pettigrew did, but yes. He escaped because he saw Pettigrew near Harry and the article said that Ron and Harry were good friends. And why would he be targetting Harry according to the public and why would the public care enough to gossip about it to a kid no one really knows or cares about?

Who are Harry's friends in this story? This is rather important.

How does Harry learn the patronus? Why does he learn it as well? Why can't Lupin be hired regardless of whom black is targetting?

The travelling bit is good, but if he studied or did a course somewhere else, wouldn't he have to take the exams there as well? If he went for a tournament, it wouldn't take a whole month.

Also if he was a prodigy, talented and as focused on duelling, as you've stated him to be, how is Neville his match or equal when he's trained for a fraction of how long Harry dedicated his time? Because then Harry isn't the prodigy, Neville is.

*** yeah, honestly I would say most of canon changes and happens differently not sure why it would stay the same. like what if Quirrell decides not to go to Albania and get a Dark lord attached to his head , or Pettigrew gets captured because James and Lily are not targeted so they survive. Sirius isn't in prison.

So much changes Snape doesn't give a Damn about Neville surviving either so he would still be a Death eater if Voldemort went for Neville.

*** Ok, so my belief regarding Dumbledore is that he is hyperfocused on keeping the BWL alive that's why he is handing Neville the invisibility cloak and doesn't hire Lupin. Black isn't after the BWL and because of that he isn't too concerned and doesn't hire Lupin as he has no connection to Neville. Of course, Lupin can be hired but I decided not to in this AU.

Neville is also a prodigy just concerning the offensive side of magic whilst Harry is more talented on the defensive side of it. Neville also unlike Harry has lived in the Magical world much longer and is therefore already trained a bit when he reaches Hogwarts. This is because of his Grandma, not Dumbledore.

Concerning the Patronus. Being surrounded by soul-sucking monsters seems like a good reason for learning the Patronus spell. He won't learn it until the end of the year and won't master (be able to summon it if a dementor is nearby) it until the 5th year DA.

I haven't given his circle of friends much thought but I don't think he would be friends with Ron and Hermione as they are plot-critical but not being friends does not mean hating each other. Harry is more focused on his studies and learning how to duel the first 5 years sure he plays the occasional games with his dormmates and talks with Hermione about Homework and school stuff but they are not friends more like colleagues.

**** Unless you want it to be a Dumbledore bashing or rather you want people to hate him, I'd really recommend you write that the potters don't have a cloak or you don't give it to Neville.

But from what I've gathered, it seems like it's geared towards manipulative/evil/ hate on Dumbledore fic - seeing that he is taking someone's property and giving it elsewhere without permission, pretty much stealing from an orphan, and he doesn't care a serial killer is after one of his students either.

I'm having serious doubts with respect to character growth of the characters because one prodigy has to work while the other doesn't seem to have to work as much. Neville didn't grow well under his grandma, she put so much pressure he was almost a squib for five years.

Also, being around dementors would be a good incentive, but unless you're a Voldemort-Dumbledore-Grindelwald level guy, you can't learn a spell like the patronus charm on your own. It's very difficult. If it was that easy, Hermione would've mastered it as well. She has the same incentive in canon as Harry in this fic, except she was more inclined towards studying.

Does Harry play Quidditch here or is he "Quidditch is lame"? If so, why?

Also you haven't answered any questions regarding black's imprisonment and what happens to Harry's parents.

Thus far it seems like a WBWL AU, except instead of an OC potter character, you have an OOC Neville.

***** Ok, so this Dumbledore is about as manipulative as the one in the movies. He does what he believes is necessary to achieve Voldemorts downfall if that makes him a manipulative character in your eyes then that's your opinion.

I envisioned Black imprisonment like this: Pettigrew tells The Lestranges where the Potters are hiding. They torture them but when Sirius comes to the rescue they kill the Potters -Harry who is hidden upstairs. Sirius enters the house sees the corpses breaks down and then goes hunting for Pettigrew original plot kicks in Sirius is in Prison.

****** There wasn't that much difference in the movies and books with respect to Dumbledore. Just some rather off character acting with inconsequential bits.

Even then stealing is beneath him, but it's your story so ok cool. I'd advice against it because that trope has sailed.

Ok, as for this bit, black abandons his godson again. But who collects him? Why does he go to the dursleys and not a magical orphanage? Or a foster family? Why is he placed with muggles?

And so essentially it's canon, with Neville and Harry getting their places changed, but Harry gets screwed over by Dumbledore twice and Neville gets better treatment than Harry originally did.

Why is Harry the protagonist of the story and why doesn't black attempt to contact him? Also with respect to third year, how does it go? He breaks out, people believe he's after Harry - he attacks Gryffindor tower, then what? Why isn't Pettigrew caught? Only reason he escaped was Lupin transforming in the third book.

Who catches black? Neville or Harry?

** Beware that if you give Harry's cloak to Nebille, you'd get called out for it. That would be theft and it is wildly out of Dumbledore's character.

You're also pretty much taking away from the main character and giving traits, abilities to a tertiary character in canon.

** - Why would Dumbledore give Neville Harry's Invisibility Cloak?
- Why Harry still lives with the Dursleys? Why the Potters are dead if Voldemort chose the Longbottoms and why Sirius is in Azkaban?
- Why Dumbledore doesn't hire Lupin? He didn't do it in canon because of Harry but because of Sirius, and Sirius is still an Azkaban escapee in your version, so why the difference?
