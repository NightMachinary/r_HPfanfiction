Its just always so out of place and feels really pretentious. Especially when its in Latin or taken from some ancient Greek work.

Ughhh.


** It depends if its somehow related to the story/chapter or not.

If not, it truly is pretentious and completely unnecessary.

** Quotes fall on the same page as song lyrics, for me. Well, I suppose putting a line from a song IS a quote, really. Anyway.

It can be done well. I've seen it done well. Emperor did very well with Sun Tzu quotes, for example. It's all dependent on the story and the author.

** I don't really care one way or another. If I don't want to read it, then I can skip right past. I usually skip them because I like to read each chapter with virgin eyes and the quotes often tie in to the chapter's content, like [[/u/12th_companion]] points out. I also haven't found opening chapters with quotes to be an indicator of a bad fic, unlike song lyrics.

** I am one of these authors. I use the quote as a teaser of what is to come in the chapter or story. I can understand why it might not be someones favorite and frustrating if it isn't in English, but it's easy enough to skip if you don't like it. It's an artistic choice.

** We'll have to agree to disagree, then. I find a good opening quote amazing, especially if it's paired well with the tone and tenor of the fic itself.

** Idk, there are a few stories I've read that will use a line from a song or poem, or rarely a quote, to set the tone at the beginning of a chapter. It in no way spoils the chapter (as the line is relevant but not the context), but it foreshadows in a vague way. It's also led to me looking up various poets and checking out their work.

A random line of essentially gibberish, or even a quote from a character in the story, that does bother me.

** I think opening quotes can be used really, really effectively. Emperor has done it well.
