** I know that "Hogwarts Houses Divided" by Inverarity is a stellar next gen fic, though I've not personally read it. If Alexandra Quick is anything to go by, it's bound to be a really well written fic.

*** As someone who /has/ read it, I assure you, Hogwarts Houses Divided is awesome and every bit as good as the Alexandra Quick series. I actually prefer it to AQ, Teddy Lupin makes a much better protagonist than pig headed Alexandra IMO, although opinions on the Alexandra as a protagonist vary wildly.

**** I love AQ as a story, even though Alex can be a bit of a jerk at times; the reason I haven't read HHD is that I despise next-generation fics, and the characters in general.

***** How on earth can you dislike the next gen characters seeing that they have /no/ character as per canon? Their character is what you make them, and HHD does it well, as do a bunch of other Next Gen stories.

On second thoughts, that might explain it. The best thing the epilogue achieved was to kill the hopes of H/Hr shippers everywhere. Ah, the sweet taste of their tears.

****** No, actually I like H/G a lot. Harmony tends to turn me off.

The reason I dislike next gen characters is that they exist. Why did JKR feel the need to do that? Regardless, I adore Inverarity.

******** To be honest, the recycled names are really what bother me. They could have been original names, but they decided to name most of them after dead people.

********* Exactly right! I would have been fine with Fred the second, but the rest could have been middle names, as a way to MOVE ON from the war, not constantly be reminded of it.

** I would go head in for the James Potter series. The author, G. Norman Lippert is a great great writer and he wrote for novels in this series. I mean, go download then NOW in jamespotterseries.com
