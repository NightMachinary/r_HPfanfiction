Anyone know any new or old fics where Harry is thrown back to the founders or marauder era or any where an OC (self insert or otherwise) takes care of Harry in his younger years, shaping him up to be an even better wizard

Edit: Fics

*** Since this is marked discussion and all I think any founders era fic where they don't just [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/chamber-of-secrets][drop drawers and shit on the floor]] is automatically AU.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** I don't know if this will have him shaping up to become a better wizard, but it does throw a 11 year old HP into the Marauders' era, when James and Lily are in their sixth year.

  Potter Family AU with plenty of complication. Harry gets a little more than he bargained for when he looks into the Mirror of Erised. His desire for his parents might be so deep that he's fallen into a place in the past where his parents are alive and whole...and have no idea who he is. Mostly takes place Marauder's Era, but Harry's right in the thick of it.
