I have, admittedly, just rebounded from a fic that I really didn't like, mostly just because the Harry X Voldemort, where Harry was being a simp for Voldemort, and I'm just seeking some shit where Harry fucking hates Voldemort and fights against him with all his will. Please send me recs! No Harry x Voldemort!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]]: Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. Together they are unstoppable, and Voldemort really gets to taste some of his own medicine!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]]: Both are time travels in which Harry viciously exacts revenge against Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]]: The only time travel in which Hermione kills Tom Riddle in his orphanage instead of raising or shagging him. She doesn't stop here either.

** There's Nightmares of Futures Past. Most of the time Harry has other things to do than just brood on his hatred, but whenever it comes up, he has very strong feelings about sending Voldemort "back to hell, where he belongs!"

FFN took it down for bogus reasons, but you can find most of it in various other places. The only source I know of for chapter 43 is the PDF/eBook on GitHub. The whole story isn't complete, though.

** The fight scene in the graveyard for this is amazing and brutal.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

** 'A Black Comedy'

'Time to put your galleons where your mouth is'

'Delenda Est'

'Of a linear circle'

â€‹

Those are the ones I can name off of the top of my head because I love reading about the black family. But really to find fics where Harry hates voldemort is basically every single fic excluding some Harry/Bella or some Harry/Snape and the whole of tommary. I would suggest searching old threads for fics where harry is powerful as usually he hates Voldy in those fics. WBWL is something to avoid then because the majority of the good ones have Voldy as a dad to Harry.

If you do see it could you please tell any good and long black family fics you know excluding the ones i listed.
