:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, does anyone know this fic in which Harty starts to break down in 4th year because of (i think) memory charms. But his mind is wirred in parseltounge so the only one able to help him is Tom Riddle. I think his mother was a paselmouth as well and Sirius tells at some point the stories of James and Lilys fights over it. Would be great if you could help.


** I believe the fic you are looking for is The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali.
