I know that this request doesn't make much sense at a glance, but what I was wondering if there are any fics that take place in the HP universe with Avengers elements but not characters. Witch/Wizard/Muggle superheroes all powered by Harry Potter Magic either by accident or by a Muggleborn recreating their favorite comic books.

For example:

Someone discovers ancient an Norse magical artifact (Mjolnir) that gives them the power of Thor.

A potion involving giant and troll blood goes wrong and creates a "Hulk" character.

An enchanted bow from Centaurs helps someone become "Hawkeye"

A potion is created using acromantula silk that acts like Spiderman web with the user constantly being under super sensory charms.

Armor enchanted with flying charms like brooms.

Etc.

I find the idea of using Harry Potter Magic to recreate other concepts interesting and wondered if anyone has done it well before.


** Damn, that sounds super cool. I need something like that in my life.

*** Yeah, I'd love to read such characters. And maybe with some worldbuilding like: Those old Norse gods or Greek gods etc. were actually Dumbledore level magicals in the past who lived very long and were very powerful and called themselves gods.

** Well, yes, there are a few fictions like that.

But most dont center around the powers of people fromt he MCU.

I remember reading some about DCU powers, where the main heroes left behind artifacts that formed Luna/Neville/HP and a few others to become like them.

I'll try to find the ID of the fic later

** It would kill my suspension of disbelief, too coincidental and they would probably end up forming the avengers anyway

*** Well, I guess OP has no problem with forming the Avengers. He just wants those characters to be magical and instead of technology or science gone wrong method of gaining powers, wants them to use magical means.
