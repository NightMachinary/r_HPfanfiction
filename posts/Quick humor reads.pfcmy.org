I need a spot of muse. I don't read as much variety as I should, and the HP reddit reads a very different set of fics than what I typically do. But I really haven't got time for the long stuff, which are the glut of suggestions, so I'm looking on the shorter end (< 3000 words?). I'm looking for witty fics that give a good laugh and preferably not Marauders era. Any suggestions would be lovely :)


** Here are a couple funny/short ones:

1. [[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/viewstory.php?sid=3878][Here's a Fred and George one related to that time they tried to do an unbreakable vow on Ron.]]

2. [[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/viewstory.php?sid=5291][Auror Ron and Harry]]

*** Awh, I read them both (perks of short fics!), and they're really charming!

**** Don't thank me, I didn't write them. Drop the dude a review, give him some chuckles back. God knows, the best I could come up with is a "hahah joo'r funny dude! For realz!", which doesn't really reflect on how good some of his stuff is.

I mean, Harry Moody... pure goddamn genius.
