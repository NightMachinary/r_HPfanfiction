I've read a few where this is a plot point, featuring a studious!Harry or something of the sort, and I really liked them. Home, being an example (though it seemed to become quite contrived as time went on?) and a few others (that I can't remember the titles of atm). I would love to read more if anyone knows of any!

Thanks!


** The only one that springs to mind is, I think, book three of linkffn(the pureblood pretense)). Can't remember what book three is called and I don't care to look it up. VERY AU, but one of my favorite series all th same.

***** It wasn't about the believability of the magic, but of the character interactions and how 11-13yo's behave. Some of it was just ridiculous and trite, and I honestly wound up hating the story by the end of it. I do have a --maybe wrong?--way of looking at reading fanfic as "If I didn't finish it, I can't bash/like it" so I did read it all the way through...

Riddle's character was fascinating, at the beginning. Hermione was interesting. Harry was ridiculous and not rational. /spoiler/ But by the end, every character seemed to have become a caricature of themselves. Seriously, unicorn-characteristics hermione? With diamond hard skin? WTF????? /spoiler/

But the dueling was certainly interesting.
