**** Hehe. This author is like that. I recommend Elizium next, its very self -contained and complete. Sitra Ahra I found to be genuinely terrifying and sad because of the true dark depraved shit that you can with magic. It's not crazy fanfiction male preg super harem crap or anything, but more malevolent than anything.
