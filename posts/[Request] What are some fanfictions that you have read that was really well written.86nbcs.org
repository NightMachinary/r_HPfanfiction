  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/renascentia][renascentia]] co-written by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi is a type of fic that really needs more attention. The fic's writing style is written in a way that I reminds me of a high level fictional read. Like the language is written by a extremely well verse writer, or in this case writers. A rare but delightful find in the fanfiction world. It's essentially a Regulus alive fic and what would he do if he was alive. The authors understood each character extremely well, especially on the background of the Black brothers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. From a story telling perspective, I absolutely enjoyed this fic. It is also original and different from the norm considering that the main characters involved were Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Audrey. I honestly never read anything like it.

  RRS: the Recourse Reserved Specialists, a lesser-known division of the Serious Organized Crime Agency, the subgroup where cases from the departments determined to be leeching funds and resources without results are sent to die. Only this time, it's personal. When Harry Potter, an unassuming barista from Surrey, calls in with information about Tom Riddle, and Draco Malfoy is sent to interview him, neither of them realizes how the investigation will disrupt what they thought they knew about their lives.[ This story is not in any way representative of how law enforcement really operates. Relatedly: influenced by Hannibal (the TV show) & Hannibal Lecter book series (...in separate ways, and without cannibalism). ]Updates: Every other week, through 2018
