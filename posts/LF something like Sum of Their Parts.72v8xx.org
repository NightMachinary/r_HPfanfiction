I've been seeing it recommended a lot on this sub lately, and it is one of my favorite fanfics (along with "Harry Potter and the Other Path" which got me into hpfanfiction and the "Pureblood Pretense" series by murkybluematter).

Does anyone know of any similar to Sum of Their Parts?

(also the charmed series is a decent read too, along the same vein as sum of their parts but not as good)

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.
