**** Though we don't really like to admit it, most people don't come to fanfiction for a well-written, engaging story with realistic character development, smart dialogue, and good action/humour/romance/etc.. What they come for is fan-pandering wish-fulfillment. This is precisely why indy!Harry harem fics get way more reviews and favourites than actually creative, well-written fics.

Robst provides that wish-fulfilment in spades for a certain subsection of the HP fandom: the super bitter Harry/Hermione shippers who have a chip on their shoulder over a fictional pairing. Not only does everything work out for Harry, these people get to see the Weasleys shamed and ridiculed in a way JK would have never even dreamed of, and they get a sappy (and wholly ridiculous) love story to tie it all up. Classic wish-fulfillment for those people.

In other words, few people come into the fandom expecting or even wanting the fanfiction equivalent of Mad Men; they come looking for Arrow instead.

****** I mean, I'm not judging you for it, but Arrow has kind of become a shippy, wish-fulfillmenty show. Especially when compared to Mad Men, which is like the Titanic of existential angst and not getting what you want.

******** It's neither a tragedy nor is it angst in the conventional sense. Existential angst is characterised by a sense of emptiness, which a lot of people approaching middle-age can empathise with. It also has some of the best dialogue in recent memory and one of the most well-drawn, engaging protagonists in the history of television. To be clear, you're welcome to watch whatever you want, but to describe the show as a tragedy is wide of the mark, and to compare the life and times of an ad executive to actual real life murder is hyperbolic, and I didn't want to give you the impression that it's what the show's about.

**** For what it's worth, in the realm of fanfiction, his regular updates and the multitude of finished stories are a major plus in my book. I am majorly disappointed when I come across a good story with an interesting premise that is unfinished. It is the epitome of "blue balls", especially when there is a lot of set-up and we don't to the payoff of the conclusion.

Not to mention despite his writing, most of his fics, other than "Harry Crow", fall below 200k words. Fic length is important when considering scope. There was one fic that turned me off when it went nearly 300k words from the start of 2nd year Summer and it hadnt even reached the school term yet. Robst in that respect knows what he's writing about and knows how not to lose focus over his ideas.

Lastly well, if you read one of Robst fics, you won't ever need to read any fics that have Weasley bashing and fewer fics that have Dumbledore bashing cause these tropes are unimaginative.

***** I don't think the last one is a good reason, to be honest; not necessarily bad but not good either.

That being said, the point about the stories being finished is a valid one. Doesn't make an iota of difference for me since I simply don't enjoy stories without any struggle on the protagonist's part, but oh well, that's my problem, not Robst's or anything.

**** Robst has a lot going for him. He updates regularly and often. He has finished all his stories so far. He writes without a lot of grammar and spelling mistakes.

His plots might not be full of angst and constant deathly dangers, where everyone dies at the end, but not everyone likes that kind of plot anyway. Some simply like happy endings where the good guys win and the bad guys get punished.

****** I'm one of them. I'm generally a fairly discerning reader, but sometimes I just want something executed with a baseline of grammatical competency and actually finished with no real thought-provokingness. Robst ticks those boxes.

The bashing of robst around here reminds me of the bashing of any silly not-deep-thought-provoking TV show (How I Met Your Mother, Two And a Half Men, etc.) People don't always want amazing characterization. Sometimes we want some caricatures having comical misadventures for crying out loud.

I am well aware that Robst's writing as writing itself is good, much better than what many other writers have, and that his ideas are interesting and often quite nice. But I am ... confused, over how shoddy-looking his plot progression can sometimes be (as if he meant to write what clearly is wish fulfilment, which I guess is a possibility), and the scene in this post really is terrible.

I have my own views and they may at times sound controversial, but for what it's worth with Robst what I wrote was just a figure of speech and more than anything I find what is happening with his stories to be quite sad as he clearly has the potential to make his stories better but gets hung on bashing and romance and delivers stuff that isn't the best he can do, and the occasional trainwreck like this one is ... well, kind of pitiful, honestly.

Me, I don't find his stories entertaining because I like to have the protagonist struggle and then get on top; many of his stories I tried to get through and failed because I couldn't find that. But this isn't an objective reason for why his stories would be the worst of the worst or anything like that, just a subjective reason for why I don't enjoy his stories as much as those who like his style.

********** People complain about a lack of challenges, but I feel there are too many stories where nothing goes right for the characters, where the threat and danger just keeps growing, and in the end, the characters need a deus ex machina or some contrived combination of luck and enemy stupidity to pull off a victory. That's not exactly earning a victory either.

Not every story has to be Star Wars, where you need to hit an exhaust port at the end or all is lost. WW2 was won by the Allies when the US entered the war. But the 4 years that followed were not boring, were not meaningless, and I think it would be insulting to all the soldiers who struggled and gave their lives to call their stories boring. And yet - the Axis powers had no realistic chance at all to win during that whole time.

Robst main issue is, in my opinion, that his plots tend to end up very similar to each other. "You're my density" started very original - Harry was obliviated before 5th year of all knowledge about magic, and Voldemort won. Hermione emigrated to France, then returns years later and tracks Harry down.

And then they return to their first year, to redo history.
