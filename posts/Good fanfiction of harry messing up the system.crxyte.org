Any good fanfics where harry just says fuck the system and just throws everything out of wack


** Linkffn(An Old And New World)

The writing style is a little rough in earlier chapters, but it gets fucking outstanding towards the end. This is a wip reupload, the author cleaning up his old work as he goes along.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Source)

First that came to mind. Even if the summary says its a crossover, you don't need to know anything about it. In fact, it is so minor, I actually forgot it is technically a crossover.

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with

**** "The Destroyer"

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Destroyer_(novel_series)]]

Had never heard about it before reading the fic and haven't stumbled over it since then. Pretty obscure.
