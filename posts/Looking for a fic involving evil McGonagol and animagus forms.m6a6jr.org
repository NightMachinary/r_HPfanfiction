:END:
So I distinctly remember the premise. But not the name:

So, it's a fic with semi evil McGonagol, and there was a weird thing about her putting a curse or spell on the Gryffindor tower that causes every student to end up with a lion, or at the very least, a cat breed for their animagus form.

At some point Harry gets sick of it and the trio breaks/ends it and the fic ends with them as 7th years and the next batch of students all showing off their unique forms as the older students all have felines (but not necessarily lions anymore)

I'm pretty sure it was on Ao3, but it may of been on FFN.
