** Linkffn(magicks of the arcane;havok side of the force). Those two are good Harry centric options. Some, if not, most crossovers are Harry centric and I would suggest looking into those.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

*** This fic has a great idea, implementation was ok too.

I also like the character developments, given their extreme circumstances.

But the ending and subsequent sequel were disappointing.

**** For my tastes the sequel was disappointing because it was abandoned, not because of any grave mistake by the author. In and of itself it was an okay SW crossover.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
