Hi everyone! As written in the title I'm looking for some Harry / Blaise fan fiction.

I would prefer a slow construction of the relationship and not a:

H: "Hi"

B: "Hi"

0.5 seconds later ... they f*ck like rabbits and swear eternal love.

I'm not against such fast things (coff coff), but it's not my thing.

The AU stories are welcome, but not crossovers.

thanks (a lot)
