Popped over to Annerb's AO3 page the other day to reread The Changeling linkao3(The Changeling by Annerb) and realized she had a Harry/Ginny coffee shop AU up - linkao3(half awake and almost there by Annerb) . I read it all in one night - short, sweet, funny, cute, and very much 'in character,' as much as an AU can be. It left me craving a lot more AU of my favorite couple though, so please rec me your favorite Harry/Ginny AUs!


** annerb has mentioned a few times on twitter that progress on changeling is happening.
