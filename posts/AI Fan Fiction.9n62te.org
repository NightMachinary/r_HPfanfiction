I started playing around with a tool that creates random text based on source material. I decided to use Harry Potter just for fun, and what it spits out really tickled me, so I thought I'd post some here in case someone else thought it was amusing. These are based on the Sorcerer's Stone.

​

#1

Right, we re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments! He looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't know.

​

Maybe he thought he was acting for the best! What is that to do with work, though. Wish I d had three wizard brothers. 78 Five, said Ron. He's used to walking all over people, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy.

​

Get out, even if yeh didn't know why he's doing-- Shut up! Harry whispered. I ve found him!

​

Budge up, yeh great lump, said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was explaining, Hermione and I saw him!

​

#2

Come on. But that part of the country it was in, he started to walk toward it. People who was on his side before... Probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the Dark Side! I m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to be expelled, he just taught us enough to help. I don't know what you re thinking about, Harry, an Hermione ll go one way an Draco, Neville, an Fang ll go the other.

​

Something bright white was gleaming on the ground? Silvery stuff? That's what you mean. I really don't think so, said Dumbledore quietly.

​

#3

I thought you weren't eleven every day. 32 Uncle Vernon wasn't going to be able to show me your other brothers and everyone. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I m a-- A wizard?

​

#4

The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the library. He said he d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the locker room, Harry had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the spectators were high enough to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry.

​

#5

Copyin lines! What good's that ter anyone? Yeh ll do summat useful or Yeh ll get out. If yeh know where to go, said Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to you this badly? Dudley asked Aunt Petunia.


** Oh, just got another funny one.

​

The Weasley twins were left singing along to a very lumpy parcel. My mom. I told her you didn't expect any presents and-- Oh, no, said Dumbledore calmly. Voldemort had powers I will never have.

** An interesting idea. Is the tool capable of first person/third person POV? I think there is room for some generic action scenes, drama scenes that can be put to create dialogues! With some editing, its a workable tool at your disposal!!
