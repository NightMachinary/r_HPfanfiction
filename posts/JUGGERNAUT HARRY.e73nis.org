Hello everyone, I wondered if anyone has ever done a beserker or juggernaut harry! fic. Like hulking harry decimating his enemies by use of brutal physical force. Kinda savage like or perhaps like the space marines from warhammer that kind of thing. All recs are welcome.


** Well, as you mentioned Space Marines yourself, check out the Inquisitor Carrow series. It is a HP/WH40k crossover that has Harry as a Space Marine in the wizarding world.

Here is a link to the first of the series:

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

***** If it's been a while there should be a lot of stuff you haven't read then. The 4th part of the series is still being updated at the moment.

Also, just as a small FYI, you replied to the bot, just saw your message by luck ;)

  Harry got more than he expected when he found the Philosopher's Stone in his pocket at the end of First Year. The Stone opened a channel to the power of Cyttorak, turning Harry into an Unstoppable Juggernaut. Super!Harry, HP/Marvel Comics crossover. Harry, Hermione, Dr. Strange, Spider-man, and others. Moved from Crossovers for greater exposure.
