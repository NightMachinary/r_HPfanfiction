  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

** Just a question, seeing you're not the first to ask for a fic like this on the reddit.

What is the appeal with that particular premise? Not saying its bad or good, but what attracts you to that sort of stuff ? Why does it matter if the traveler tells anyone or not ? Is it so there it has a smaller chance to have a paradox?

Just curious, seeing as I don't remember reading a fic like this.

The only non-time traveler who learns of the time travel figures it out based on evidence. It's not everyone's cup of tea, though.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*
