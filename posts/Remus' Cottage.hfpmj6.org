I'm trying to pinpoint where Remus lived prior to the series. I know his cottage was mentioned to be in Yorkshire, but otherwise its exact location is unknown.

Since I'm neither a Brit or someone with great geographic knowledge, I don't know where a good location would be for his cottage. I assume it'd be somewhere outside of a large city (since he was working muggle jobs), but far enough away that he wouldn't hurt anyone during his transformation. I also assume that the area has a low cost of living.

If anyone could help come up with a tentative location I'd be appreciative!


** Much of Yorkshire is very rural. Something like "Remus lived in a small cottage on the North Yorkshire Moors" would be enough geographical explanation I think. Don't forget, he can work anywhere because he can apparate, but if you specifically want him to be walking or cycling to his work it would be feasible to say he works in the village he lives in - lots of these villages in the Yorkshire countryside have a decent tourist industry because they're on rambling routes and "areas of natural beauty" so he could work in a cafe, or gift shop, or book shop? Or he could get the train to York or Middlesbrough to work?

Hope that helps

*** While he ran around on full moons with his friends in school, I can't see him taking the risk of doing that without them. I've been assuming he locked himself in a basement for full moons since he lost his friends.
