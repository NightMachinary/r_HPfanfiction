*Summary:* /She was destined for more than what everyone said. She wasn't the sidekick, the back-up and she definitely was not the good guy. If she had to play dirty to get what she wanted, so be it. If she had to be the bad guy to get what she needed, she'd embrace it, and if she were honest, she didn't really mind./

*Excerpt:* /She sighed, Harry had always been desperate to know more about their parents. Heather always told him that they didn't need them, all they needed was each other; Harry disagreed. He claimed that they needed family, someone to look up to, someone to love them. Heather, however, didn't believe that was true. She thought that all she needed was Harry and all Harry needed was her./
