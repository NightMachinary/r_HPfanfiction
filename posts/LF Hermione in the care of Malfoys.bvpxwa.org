This is very vague. It's main Hermione. Think it's still ongoing.

As a child (before hogwarts) comes into the care of the Malfoys (adoption, ward??). There was someting about her parents not being happy about magic. Anyways, the Malfoys arrange tutors for her and for plants etc she gets Greyback. Their first outing/lesson he is seems very angry/growly and makes several remarks about how she shouldn't be so small/weak and tells her to stop being small. One point he holds her by the neck to lift her up so she can see, but since she can't stop being so fragile he puts her on his shoulder. He is also muttering about her being a spoiled pureblood which makes her quite confused.


** The unexpected malfoy?
