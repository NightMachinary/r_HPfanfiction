I'm in the mood for something a bit different tonight..

Can you recommend stories where Voldemort is utterly outmatched and basically dealt with about as easily as Fake Moody took care of The Ferret?


** You mean something like Dark Lord Fudge in “A Bad Week at the Wizengamot by DisobedienceWriter” linkffn(3639659)?

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** There's a fairly new DBZ crossover where Lily married Goku instead, and Gohan fulfills the position of Harry.

Goku one shots Voldemort with a kamehameha when he attacks. The fic is set 10 years later though when Gohan gets his Hogwarts letter, but considering all the canon DBZ events through the end of the Cell saga happen ed Voldemort is presumably hopelessly outmatched by Gohan, but the fic is still pretty early in first year. Goku is dead because of Cell, but Lily is alive.

Although to be honest I like the idea of the plot more than the actual execution. The writing is kind of silly, which even when the concept of a fic is kind of silly I usually prefer the writing to not be.
