** As i remember it.... harry comes downstairs from while being in the Burrow and finds Ginny and Molly brewing a love potion for him to be with Ginny... Hermione was given a love potion to fall in love with Ron and Harry flips out on them..... There is a LOT more to this story as i know but that is the basis for the first chapter as i remember it....

*** This sounds familiar to the plot of Jbern's Bungle in the Jungle. Harry gets fed love potion by the Weasleys, initially to make him fall in love him Hermione. But then Ron discovers he has feelings for Hermione, so Hermione swaps Harry for Ron, and the Weasley parents start feeding Harry a GinGin-love potion.

Its a really bizarre and hard to believe opening plot, but it gets a LOT better. I'd only give (very few) minus points for the at times unbelievable character bashing.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.
