I've read a couple fics where somewhere in the castle there is a special room(s) for the Founders, the heirs, or if Hogwarts found someone worthy. In one fic it was bedroom/common room thing that Adult Harry/Draco and their kids used. In another it had dorm, common, and bathroom which Harry as heir could use.

Anyways I'm looking for fics with something similar. I prefer it be something he uses while attending school. Like because he is heir he can sleep/live there instead of in the dorms. Maybe his friends too? idk. I just like the idea that he has his own space.

The two fics I mention: I can't remember the first's name. I remember Harry leaving the magical world. Moving to California (i think). He has kids (twins i think) that are Draco's. Draco finds him ( I think Sirius does too) and for some reason Harry/Draco and the kids end up in Hogwarts, where others are hiding. Hogwarts makes this Founder room appear for the family.

The second is: Silver Tongue by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ShadowHiddenByTheMoon/pseuds/ShadowHiddenByTheMoon][ShadowHiddenByTheMoon]]

P.S. If your rec(s) have any Manipulative/bad/evil Dumbledore, selective Weasley (love the twins) bashing, Smart/independent/Gray/Dark Harry, m/m pairing, or Harry with a pet (not owl) you are my new favorite person haha.
