Title pretty much. I haven't read much FF in years(just recently started reading again), so throw whatever you got at me. I've read so many stories many of the ones I read years ago have become mostly a blur.

Not too picky about tropes, pairings, etc. Just give me your favorite stories where Dumbledore is super good, moral, etc, and your favorite stories where he's manipulative or evil.

Thanks guys.


** The most evil Dumbeldore would probably have to be the one from Partially Kissed Hero at some points it just goes beyond paradoy like at one point it's revealed that he literally stealing money from Orphans despite not needing it for anything and already being super rich.

** My favorite Manipulative Dumbledore is in Hermoine Granger and the Boy Who Lived where DD is a spymaster in a Supercience AU. We see Dumbledore and his antics through Hermione's eyes as she is the main character. This is different because the characters eventually realize they are being manipulated and try to do things differently, but they also realize that that is the name of the game and there are reasons to feel empathetic toward DD. The story is very nuanced in that regard.

** One of my favorite good Dumbledore was in Deprived linkffn(Deprived by The Crimson Lord).

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore stared at the frightened women bemusedly and then switched his gaze back towards Harry, whose face had turned a rather sickly shade of white.

  "It is the times like these that we must remember that focusing on the smallest of things will allow us to face the largest of threats with clarity and purpose."

  The old wizard reached into his robes and produced a bright yellow orb wrapped in wrinkly, translucent paper. The boy gave him an incredulous look. The twinkling in Dumbledore's eyes reached a crescendo in intensity.

  "Lemon Drop, Harry?"

** One with a really nice Dumbledore is "Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure" by dunuelos. The basic premise is a great Dumbledore (moral, took down voldie him self instead of sacrificing the ootp) dies from old age, and is given a chance to help right the wrongs of another dimension where a greater good Dumbledore was messing everything up. It's a feel good fic with little conflict but I liked it

** One of my favorites for Dumbledore is not a full fic, but the length is long enough to feel like it when reading, called [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/dimensional-shift-hp-private-sneak-peek/][Dimensional Shift by Keira Marcos]]. Basically, Harry's world dies and he goes dimension-hopping to look for his soulmate (it is H/D) and in the process comes across multiple Dumbledores and versions of the people he knows. Most of the Dumbledores are good, some aren't, but it's interesting just to see the multiple different versions of each character. Overpowered Harry abound, if that's an annoyance (she has a habit of that in her fics) but if you can ignore it, it works for the premise. You might need an account on her sight to read the fic though.

She also has plenty of the evil, tropey Dumbledore in her other fics as well. She loves using a lot of the tropes that I've seen people hate on though, so depending on how well you can ignore or like them in turn she has a bunch of stories to read (most are H/Hr, with a few H/D, and one H/Hr/D)

** I think a good contender for the worst Dumbledore would be the one in linkffn(Girl Genius' Animagus). That Dumbledore was explicitly trying to murder Harry after Voldemort was already defeated, gives Sirius to Snape to torture, teams up with The Other, makes liberal use of the Imperius Curse, and ultimately takes a Reductor to the face from Harry after being hit with the Slaver Wasp meant for Harry or Wulfbach.

  (Based on whitetigerwolf's 'Animagus Lover' challenge! Bashing!) Agatha Clay found an injured owl one day, and nursed him back to health. Two years later, on the day her story truly began, he revealed himself to be a wizard from another world...and he has vowed to protect her. But between Sparks, politics, dictators, and assassins from another world, will they survive?
