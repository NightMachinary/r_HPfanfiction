** Honestly, I really disliked Hinge of Fate and Pet Project. So, we might have really different taste but here are some long form fics I like:

Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7948797/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Crystal-of-Time]])

Of Myth and Magic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10822825/1/Of-Myth-and-Magic]])

Dark Gods in the Blood ([[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/DGITB.html]]): No overt relationship but a fantastic story with overtures.

The Bloody Stare of Mars ([[http://www.thechicagoloop.net/yahtzee/harrypotter/bsmindex.html]]): This is a good story but not a typical HG/SS.

Self-Slain Gods on Strange Altars ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8869173/1/Self-Slain-Gods-on-Strange-Altars]])

Roman Holiday/ Jewel of the Nile/Last Tango in Paris([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6u6dvo/roman_holiday_by_anna/]]): Actually three very long stories although not exclusively HG/SS. Also, the final story is sadly incomplete.

*** Thanks a lot! Hinge of fate was the first complete HGSS I've ever read years ago so it brings me some nostalgia and it was wen I fell in love with the concept. Also because it starts off with a traumatic event which is the only plausible circumstance (in my head) that would bring them together. I'm enjoying pet project because it's nicely written although there are some plot/character issues with it that I'm finding a bit hard to swallow. What I hate most about most of these fics is reading them and thinking “he/she would NEVER say/do this” that's why I really appreciate when they're faithful to the characters personalities making it believable. I appreciate your suggestions, I'll let you know if I like these :)

**** Yeah, I hear you on the first fic nostalgia. This is how I feel about Roman Holiday and Meeting of the Minds - linkffn(1895022).

To be fair, both Pet Project and Hinge of Fate are considered classics of the SS/HG genre and a lot of people love them. Teen pregnancy plots are just a big nope for me. And, I agree about Pet Project - there are some interesting ideas there but it just became too OOC for me.

  With the Order's safety hanging on the whim of a lovesick Ron, Snape calls his bluff... and Hermione calls his. Loosely based on the WIKTT Marriage Law Challenge.

***** Reallt? I didn't know they were considered classics at all. I totally agree, but I feel that in that story the pregnancy was necessary to force him to take responsibility. But it's a turnoff I'm with you on that. Anywhoo, thanks a lot ^{^}

***** Btw have you read any of these (and if so, how did you like them and are they too OOC): cashing the sun, when a lioness fights, looking for magic, the lioness prophecies, professors discretion. Some of them are rated as “incredible” and “outstanding” by some HGSS fans, but since we seem to have similar tastes, I'm curious to know your opinion in case you read any of them

****** I started Chasing the Sun awhile back - I couldn't really get on board with the characterization of Snape. As I recall, he seems to act less emotionally mature than Hermione. And, then I think there's a whole plot point about him getting raped by Death Eaters which isn't really my bag of chips, in terms of reading material. I might be confusing this with another story (I don't understand why this is a trope in SS/HG fiction).

The Professor's Discretion I started a long time ago but have yet to finish. Wasn't wowed.

Haven't read the others you mentioned but I'm adding them to my list to remind myself to read - thanks for the suggestions :)

As I said, I write short notes to myself on most of the stories I read (and if I've finished them, I rate them 0-5) so I can remember them. If you want to take a look at my spreadsheet, be my guest. Just one person's opinion, of course. It's 98% SS/HG but there are a few other/non-pairing stories thrown in there.

******* Oh lord if that's the plot of chasing the sun I don't think I will even read it. it's not my cup of tea at all.

Wow thanks for that! I'll save it and use it when I finish the one I'm reading. It will definitely help! Thanks a lot for your responses and your time :) can't wait to read your suggestions

******* Update: finished “pet project” last night. And for what it's worth, it's incredible. The first chapters are nothing special, but it gets better. So much better. I devoured 52 chapters in a few days. SS ad HG are very true to themselves which makes it so satisfying to read. The pace is very, very slow, which is great, otherwise it wouldn't be credible. This is everything I wanted a SSHG fic to be. All the other events related to Voldemort's destruction and what not are great too. It has its flaws and its silly moments, but the rest makes up for it. The final chapters feel a bit rushed, but we have to take into consideration the author took 8 years in real life to finish it (:o) so it's understandable that some things feel a bit disconnected. Plus, I love these fics for the journey, build up and antecipation, and not necessarily for the ending/climax. Also, the writing is really really good. Give it another chance if you can, I don't think you'll regret it :) now I'll take a look at your list and decide which one to read next

** I wouldn't say the top written, but I'm the author of an SS/HG/LM fic. BDSM features strongly in it with a number of original characters and settings. It's painstakingly edited, so updates slowly because we want to give you the best product possible. Definitely going to be over 100k words. Definitely. It's called Bound, I'm SilverAconite and this is the link- linkao3(13457028)

  When Hermione's magic pulls her away from her friends and Hogsmeade village to the top of a hill, the decision she makes will open her eyes, shining a new light on the world around her - a very hot light. With a lot of learning and some extra homework, she will learn that some people are FAR more than they seem. She may even find love in an unexpected place. **Slow-ish Updates** Set in Hermione's 6th year, beginning the weekend after her birthday. She is 18 at the commencement of this story. Just as you should be if you're reading it
