:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a lot of different points from a few chapters of this one fic but am open to similar ones.

So overall its supposed to be a fic with alot of students coming back for their last year after the battle at hogwarts.

For specifics: Snape gets assigned to be their head and mcgonagall is the new headmistress. Snape teaches defense and the first lesson almost goes sideways because snape paired hermione with draco. Ron gets pissed then harry volunteers to partner with him. Dracos and harrys characters are more subdued, harry ends up talking to snape aftrt vlass about hermione having issues but snape snitches to mcgonagall.

Idk, hmu if u know where my rambling is from
