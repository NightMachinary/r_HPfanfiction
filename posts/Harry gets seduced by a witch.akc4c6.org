Are there any stories where Harry actually gets seduced? Because honestly, I cannot remember a single story where he gets properly seduced and does not take the initiative halfway through without resorting to genderbent characters (FemVoldemort in that case)

FemHarry/F is also welcome, please no Death Eater revisionism and no infidelity.

** Recommend you find Harry Potter and the Charm of Venus by Marjorie Greene, in particular the version posted on her own site (marjorie.auroris.net). Despite mis-spellings and ignoring canon in various ways, it portrays all the involved characters as complete characters. The descriptions are rich, the emotions believable and the sex is varied. There are even some supplementary drawings by the author, with links within the story text. Fair warning - Hermione starts off quite out-of-character but for reasons that are explained later.

*** Thanks a lot.

Her homepage looks interesting. A little odder than what I expected or am used to, but certainly interesting. Do you know similar artists/writers who cannot be found on Archive or FFN?
