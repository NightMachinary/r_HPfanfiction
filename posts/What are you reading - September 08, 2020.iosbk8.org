** I've just finished a really wonderful story. Hermione, Snape and Dean Thomas are 'muggles' unaware of magic (or indeed the term 'muggle') but they feel that they are in the wrong world. Hermione and Snape meet outside Grimmauld Place and they have no idea why they are drawn to this particular street. I loved the writing, the dialogue and the characterisation. The displacement and alienation that the three of them feel was very well described. The fic does become Hermione/Snape but it isn't explicit and it makes sense in the context of the story. Hermione is 25 when they meet (Snape is still 20 years older) which makes it less icky. linkao3(2758970)

** Currently I'm reading a fic called "renascentia: from the ashes" by kuchikopi and tonberrys. It's very long (apx. 275k words, with a sequel) so I'm only about a quarter way through. In my opinion it is very well-written. The premise is that Regulus Black survived destroying the horcrux and went into hiding in another country. Around the time of Harry Potter's fifth year, he comes back to Grimmauld Place and meets Sirius. So far, the story focuses a lot on this brotherly relationship.

** Currently reading, but almost done with:

My Dark Protector, by DebsTheSlytherinSnapefan

Snape and Dumbledore rescue Harry from a Muggle woman, intent on using Harry for experiments, upon witnessing him using magic.

It's been a fascinating read. I love how Albus and Snape are being written, the trauma Harry went through, was awful, and the author doesn't just skim over that, and make Harry automatically better, it's a slow burn with his therapy, and that's been great.

I also love the interesting way that the author is writing Voldemort, and the way that they write Sirius, is rather believable, imo.

Voldemort might be iffy on people (plus Snape's way), but I find all of the major characters so far, to be written rather well.

Albus and Voldemort in particular, I'm in absolute love with how they're being written, so different from what authors tend to usually do, at least, from what I've read. But it doesn't feel ooc or anything (At least to me)

Edit: If anyone has any other similar stories, that they can recommend me, or interesting ways that characters like Albus or Voldemort are being written, I'd love that.

Only about ten chapters in so far (I read it once years ago though, but I barely remember anything) It's a next-gen story and Albus/Scorpius/Rose are the main characters. A mysterious illness has hit Hogwarts and there's only a few people unaffected and left standing to figure out how to stop it. It's the first story of the Stygian Trilogy, I'm looking forward to finishing this one because all those years ago, I never read the other two stories. Love the style of writing as well

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  Third in series, read prequels or be confused. Harry had spent his whole life wishing for magic to be more abundant, and that was precisely what he got. He wasn't even particularly upset about the many serious dangers inherent in such a thing, for what was life without challenge? The irony of ending up in Azeroth after all the references was a bit on the nose, though.

It's just feel like the story from a slytherin point of view.But actually very little happens, it's frustrating.Without spoiling me, can you tell me if it is like that all the way or do things actually happen at some point?

** Saw someone posted /Ignite/ by Slide farther down in the thread, one of my favorite fics. The writing in that trilogy is really good, and the dialogue and characters exceptional. Some people on this sub and the Alexandra Quick sub said the Anguis series is even better, and despite loving Slide's writing I've never really picked it up until today.

*Latet Anguis in Herba* (by Slide) is a collection of canon-compliant shorts centered around a group of four Slytherins in the class above Harry's. It consists of eight short chapters asynchronously interspersed between, 1993-1995, which both introduce the characters for the Anguis series proper and paint a picture of life in Slytherin during the time of the series.

This is the best portrayal of House Slytherin I've ever read. There aren't kid villains walking around, there are no power fantasies, snarking child politicians, "merry meet". Absolutely none of that. The characters are teenagers who make stupid decisions, get drunk, have legitimate familial issues, struggle and/or succeed academically to their potential, and in one case deal with their own parent being a Death Eater. The Slytherins feel no urge to stick their noses up at the rest of the school, but you see that veneer of being sneered at by the other houses from their lens, and the psychological effect it has on their identity. The portrayal of the house is just so good that just twenty minutes after reading it, it's become my headcanon.

The four main characters are all great, complex, diverse. Perhaps Gabriel Doyle is the only one that hasn't hit the spot immediately, but his son Matt became one of my favorite characters in the Stygian Trilogy, so I have hope for him. As usual for Slide, the romance is great.

Highly recommended and I'm looking forward to reading Shade to Shade and the rest of the series. Other than the fact that it's a war story, I have no clue what to expect. The Stygian Trilogy went from mystery to action-adventure to romance in three books and they were all amazing, so I trust Slide to keep me entertained no matter what genre she writes in!

4.5/5

** linkffn(Project Management for Beginners)

Published in August 9 by Snuffly22 and being updated weekly, this fic explores Harry using project management skills to actually make plans and think things through when facing a challenge. It shows Harry being ambitious and introspective and even going as far as befriending Slytherins in order to meet his goal: get Snape to not hate him.

Some key and noteworthy features in this fic that I personally like is: a Harry/Blaise friendship, Percy being helpful, Neville and Harry working to improve themselves, Inter-House mingling and unity, a Slytherin perspective, and people not being OOC (or at least not by a lot), to name a few.

A few things that I don't like is Blaise apparently knowing everything and having all the answers as well, to the point that Harry might not even try to think for himself anymore and go straight to him for answers, not to mention Blaise's interaction with Neville being a bit uncharacteristic for 13/14 year olds. Another thing is Ron being non supportive of Harry and his goal, though that could be due to Ron's insecurities, jealousy, and fear of losing Harry. Also the use of miles. Brits don't use miles, they use kilometers.

- France adopted the metric system in 1795.
- Britain formally adopted the metric system in 1965.
- Statute of Secrecy offically formed in 1692.

The British magical world would have no clue what the metric system is. Hell, at that time in the '90s, even the muggleborn wouldn't use it. There are still places that use imperial in the UK even today.

More info on this Wikipedia article: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_Kingdom][Metrication in the UK]].

Edit: this wasn't meant to bite your head off. I went down a rabbit hole trying to remember if the Statute of Secrecy predated the Metric system or not.

*** Thanks for the comments, and for reading my story. As a middle aged female who doesn't know any teenagers personally, they are a bit tricky to write! I've seen other comments about Blaise knowing all the answers and can absolutely see that. I'm working on some changes for future chapters as a result to address this point. Ron absolutely is jealous and insecure, and again this will feature more in the next few chapters.

**** Wow, I didn't expect to get a comment from the author herself, what a pleasant surprise! I absolutely loved the newest chapter and I'm excited to see how Harry's quest pays off and how it'll change character interactions.

I was surprised to see Percy go that far with his relationship with Harry, I assumed that they would just be friends but I'm glad that Percy considers Harry as a brother, it was very wholesome and touching. Maybe the reason that I enjoy this fic so much is because I like Percy and I'm pleased when authors write him as an actual character, rather than just dismissing him as a pompous git or “The Worst Weasley”. Personally, I find him to be a complex and sympathetic character and I admire when authors bring this up in their fics.

I was also pleased with the twins' interaction with Harry, in a way. I enjoy fics that showcase how cruel and sadistic they can be and I find refreshing to see them portrayed in a negative light, especially since they're fan favorites. I find it comical when people are genuinely shocked when they are told/shown how bad they can be, or when people try to trivialize or just ignore their misdeeds.

Also, I feel bad for Ron and how he was treated as a joke by the whole school. That being said, I'm happy that he is finally getting in on the action and I'm hoping to see him getting more involved.

Overall, I really like this fic and I'm excited to read the next chapter. Keep up the good work!

  Harry had never really properly planned anything before. The fact that his first ever plan was risky and filled with assorted dangers was not actually deterring him as much as it should. (This story explores how Harry's third year at Hogwarts might have played out differently if a little project management and an ambitious plan had been thrown into the mix.)

** Personally I just went back to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Daft Morons by sinyk)

As you might guess you have a clueful Harry, bad Dumbledore, Weasley bashing, and HarmonyIt starts at the first task of the TWT in year 4 and snowballs from there

+The only problem I have with it is the first 2 chapters are dedicated to setting up how this is an AU, and it's a bit of a slog+

It's a slow fic

*** Okay, I've reached chapter 10 on this because of your rec here and it's still utterly fucking awful. When is there some actual plot instead of X Head of House Y doing stuff with Q Head of House J and people falling over themselves trying to apologise for everything?

**** Yeah, sorry about that, not sure if I would recommend it to anyone, it was more of a what I'm reading right now (as the post said)

Looking back now, it's pretty much a slog trough the entire thing

You get plenty of Dumbledore being an idiot, then you move on to politics, eventually the pureblood wives hear about the evils of inbreeding, and form the Tapestry circle, and as the title said it's about "daft morons"

It's slow, it's not for everyone, I seem to have expressed myself incorrectly, and misled you, for that I'm sorry

***** Thanks for the reply. No need to apologise - as you said, it's just what you happened to be reading. I don't think I'll go any further though. Slow-burn is one thing, but this one isn't burning at all.

** Linkffn( Serpentine Advice by ubiquitouslyverbose)

Good take on Harry finds Slytherin's portrait in Chamber of Secrets. More ploting philophosing, than magic crafting. Politics and people are the main focus and no unnecesary bashing.

**** I have the same criticism for this fic to be honest. Just how, I guess, aggressive she's written as. I can kind of get the reasoning by the author for it, but to me it's coming off as shoehorning her as pairing bait.

  Following the events of Third Year, Harry Potter explores the Chamber of Secrets and finds a portrait of Salazar Slytherin. Following Slytherin's advice, Harry will attempt to break out of the games set upon him and finally be free. But how? And is freedom even possible for the Boy-Who-Lived?
