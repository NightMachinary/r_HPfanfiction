I can believe that Wizarding England would have a Ministry.

And that the United States would have its own Magical Congress (MACUSA).

But what about the other countries of the Wizarding World?

And what of Government Unions? Are there Coalitions of Magical Governments acting as one large governing body, like the European Union?

I'd like to think so. I have a Headcanon that there are such Unions that take place in the Wizarding World.

For Example, there is the SWA. The Scandinavian Wizarding Alliance. That union comprises of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Each of these countries has their own Governments, but they are apart of a larger body/alliance.

I've got lots more ideas about this, but I want to hear what you guys think!


** Russia is a magical empire that started on the constitutional monarchy path in 1896 when Tsar Nicolas II gave up the rule of the magical community to his distant magical cousin now known as (the late) Peter IV. The Russian Empire started to take a Muggle-born children from their families once they were detected by the book of acceptance in Koldovstoretz and the Muggle Act of 1920 made it a criminal offence to live inside or near Muggle areas and to be in any form of contact with Muggles except for authorised members of the magical government.

The Empire is divided between the Tsardom of Russia, the Baltic Duchy, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Principality of Crimea, the Kingdom of Ukraine, the Duchy of Caucasia, and the United Kingdom of the Central Steppes. Ukraine and Lithuania also have diplomatic corps in the ICW alongside Russia. The only difference in terms of borders compared to the Soviet Union's in 1991 is that Kaliningrad and Memel are German and not Russian and Poland still has its ‘Ukrainian' territories from 1936. The Principality of Crimea acts like Wales and the Dauphiné in France which is basically used for the Crown Prince/Princess to ‘practice' ruling before succeeding to the Imperial throne. Everything that used to be in Petrograd and Moscow like magical districts and seats of magical government were all destroyed/abandoned and moved out to Siberia and vast and abandoned territories in the Steppes.

Please keep in mind that I know this is not canon. I have also have a AU government for France but i'll see how people react to my Russia before posting it.

** Well the biggest one we know of is the International Confederation of Wizards (ICW). I'm sure there are other smaller ones but in the end only some of them will hold true power.

** There is something weird about Germany ... I will let German folks fill me in, but how come there is no mentioning of it in whole JKR books, and how come the Durmstrang-Institut für Zauberei with the coat of arms which is somewhere between Byzantine, Russian, and Holy Roman Empire eagle, and all that is located somewhere in the Northern Scandinavia.

However, that is not mine story to tell. What is more important for me is what happened at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeč]]), where sometimes after the murder of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus_I,_Duke_of_Bohemia][Saint Wenceslaus]] this whole hillfort (which was the capital of the Czech dukedom before) is abandoned. That's the Muggle history, proven by evidence.

The explanation (originally from the community around the server [[http://budec.net/]]) is that the biggest part of it, which contained the magical school, was hidden from Muggles, and the school continues there until our days.

*** I'm not German, but I would assume it's because Germany as a 'nation' wasn't united until the late 1800s, well after the Statute was put into place. At the time of the Statute, the German States would've been coming out of the 30 years War (during which about a fifth of the entire population of the region had died, up to half in some areas, and most of Europe was a complete nightmare of political and religious warring at the time. Basically, they wouldn't have been stable enough until years after to have a proper magical government, nevermind a Great School, and they were nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire, so Catholics would've been witch-hunting and such too. They could've had something before the war that collapsed, interestingly, but afterward they would've been too ravaged and looted a land to keep too much going.

On a meta-level, it's probably just Rowling's complete lack of interest in worldbuilding beyond what she absolutely needed for that particular book and the general English lack of in-depth knowledge about other places.

**** One is tempted to say that given her origins, JKR combined English ignorance with the French arrogance about anything outside of her world?

***** I don't have much of a comment on the French arrogance - my only two French friends have been lovely to this little English kid - but it is possible that it's just Anglocentricism again, yeah. :)

******* Heh. I got it on the English part, but I didn't know that was a French stereotype. The English have some reputation in most parts. We were very, very prolific arseholes for about three centuries there. :D
