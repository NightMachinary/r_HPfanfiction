How would it be?


** (Madame Pomfrey) "Mr. Potter, with the amount of time you spend in my care, one would not be ridiculed for thinking that you enjoy pain!"

(Harry) "Sorry Madame Pomfrey, just bad luck I guess"

(Madame Pomfrey) "regardless, here is your dose of Skelegrow. How you managed to vanish the bones of your arm without Mr. Lockhart's assistance, I shall never know."

(Harry) "aren't you going to give me something for the pain?"

(Madame Pomfrey) "certainly not, the pain of regrowing your bones will not cause any additional damage, and it will hopefully serve as an incentive to be more careful in the future."

(Madame Pomfrey) /walks away/

(Harry) /downs skelegrow and rubs hands together/ "let's get this party started."

*Four hours later*

(Harry) /wakes up from prickling in arm/

(Harry) "is that what I think it is?"

(Harry) /feels flashes of pain from arm/

(Harry) /dives for lotion and tissues, hits head on bedside table, passes out/

*Five hours later*

(Madame Pomfrey) "...ry, ar...y..., Harry are you alright?"

(Harry) "what happened?"

(Madame Pomfrey) "you fell off the bed and hit your head on the table, you must have been thrashing about in you sleep. It was likely the pain that did it, perhaps I should have given you a pain potion after all."

(Harry) "Oh, yeah, maybe"

(Madame Pomfrey) "well, your bones are done regrowing, and I've corrected the damage from hitting your head. You'll have a nasty headache for a few hours, or you would have, I dosed you with something to block it out."

(Harry) "really? You can do that?"

(Madame Pomfrey) /raises eyebrow/ "of course Mr. Potter, what did you think a pain potion did?"

(Harry) "aah, right, of course. And er, this potion, does it block all pain?"

(Madame Pomfrey) "yes it does, for roughly twelve hours. So do be careful you don't injure anything today while you can't feel anything"

(Harry) "how would I injure myself?"

(Madame Pomfrey) "You have quidditch practice today, do you not?"

(Harry) "aah, right..."

*Eight hours later*

(Harry) /stomps into the common room/

(Ron) "Hey Harry, you alright mate?"

(Harry) "just perfect."

(Ron) "You look like you could use some stress relief, how bout a game of chess?"

(Harry) /scowls and stomps up the stairs to dormitories/

(Ron) /turns to Hermione/ "was it something I said?"

** Go to AO3 and select Harry/Voldemort as pairing. Thinking about it Harry/Snape would also work.

Although, come to think about it, it's your pain, not Harry's in the end.

*** We don't kinkshame here. Also , I'll have you know some of the best smut I've read was Harry / TMR , and the only romance fic I liked was Harry / TMR , but that was like , either TMR does dark rituals to look like 20 yr old version of himself , or it was 20 yr old version of himself from the horcruxes.

Edits : Adding stuff and grammar.

**** You dont need to kink shame to be aware that most of those fics are poorly written, like even more than regular fanfics.
