Has anyone made an attempt to compile a list of original spells and charms, etc. that have been created for fics?


** Here's [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=4506][one such list]]. And [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=26133][another]].

** These aren't actually for any spells, but there's a compilation of some really neat fan made spells here. If you're going to use them, I'd recommend asking the person who made it first. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/2d3qcp/magical_theory_assignment/]]

** Not a list, but the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]] has the most fanmade spells I've ever seen. Not only are there huge numbers of brand new spells, but there's alternatives to a range of canon spells, expansion to wandless magic, and more detail into magical creatures. If you can get past AU & Draco/Harry then it's worth a read for that alone.
