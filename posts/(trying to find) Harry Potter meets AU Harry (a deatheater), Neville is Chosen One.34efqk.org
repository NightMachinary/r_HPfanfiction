I'm trying to find a specific piece of fanfiction I read a couple of years ago. Here are the most precise details I can recall (I do realize that a lot of these are fairly common tropes):

-Harry wakes up in a universe where his parents are alive, but where his counterpart is a good-for-nothing deatheater.

-Neville is the Chosen One, in constant training under his auror father to fight Voldemort. He complains at one point that he's much older than he should be because he's used a time turner so much.

-Harry is much skinnier/shorter than his better fed counterpart. Lily expresses surprise than her sister would have become Harry's guardian, since she hated magic.

That's all I can remember. Would really love to read it again. Thanks!

*** Is that the one where the AU's Harry was rude to his family?

**** I don't recall with 100% certainty, but seeing as how the AU Harry was a high ranking Death Eater, I imagine his relationship with his family was not all sunshine and rainbows.

*** Thanks, this is a good one, but Neville died as an infant in it.

EDIT: Actually, it looks like that one is quite new, sorry. I'll keep looking.
