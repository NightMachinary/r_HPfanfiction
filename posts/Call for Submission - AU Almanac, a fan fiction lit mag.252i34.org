  We are looking for fan fiction between 500-10,000 words, non-fiction essays of up to 3,000 words ...

Should Almanac entries be /this/ short?

Besides that, their (or I suppose your, OP) [[http://www.aualmanac.com/about/][About page]] doesn't specify how the copyrights are expected to be handled, and what's the point of opening yet another story collecting website in the first place. The fanfic writing communities are splintered between different hosting platforms as it is.

  We believe all fan fiction is good fan fiction.

Also, good luck with that.
