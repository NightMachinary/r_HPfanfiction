I'm sorry if this is not appropriate for this sub, since Rainbow Rowell's books are actual published YA fiction -- but they are clearly a homage to Harry Potter fanfic, namely Drarry fanfiction. Fangirl is about an undergrad who writes fanfiction about a famous wizarding school where the main character (Simon Snow aka Harry Potter) has a rivalry / romance with his nemesis (Tyrannus Basilton Grimm-Pitch aka Draco Malfoy). Simon even has a brainy best friend (Penelope Bunce aka Hermione).

I think by the time Rowell writes Carry On, which is a book entirely about these characters, the story takes on its own shape and becomes less of a Harry Potter reference. However, reading Fangirl as someone who has been an actual Harry Potter fanfic reader and writer for years just tickled me to no end. I'm just wondering if any other Harry Potter fangirls (and boys) had the same experience. Have you read these books? Did you love them? Did you hate them?


** I loved them, I actually just had the sequel Wayward Son delivered. Fan girl is definitely the better of the two, just because the concept is so much like our everyday lives as fan fiction nerds!

They're well written m, fun and an easy read. I've enjoyed RR'a style in her other books also.

** Actually, I had no idea fanfiction existed, I was obsessed with Harry Potter and other franchises but I had no idea fanfiction existed. Then I read Fangirl.

And then I started reading fanfiction and haven't really stopped ever since. So Fangirl will always hold a very special place in my heart, because it introduced me to fanfiction and nowadays I can't even imagine how life would be without fanfiction.

*** That's so cool that you discovered fanfiction through that book! Did it make you read a lot of Darry fanfic off the bat? After reading Fangirl I got back into fanfiction. I hadn't read any for years, and it made me jump back into the fandom.

**** Actually I absolutely hate Drarry. I never liked Draco, so I can't really see the appeal of this pairing and only read one or two stories on my quest to read every possible pairing out there. Snape was always my favourite character so I started reading a lot of Snape centric stories after reading fangirl.

***** That's the beauty of fanfiction: no matter who your favourite characters are or your favourite pairing, there's probably a bunch of fics out there to read. Draco has always been my favourite character, so I mostly end up reading Dramione fics, but I also love Snape as a character and have read some good Snape fics as well.

** I love Fangirl and how accurately Rainbow Rowell depicts fanfiction. Then again, she did say that she was involved in it herself. But for whatever reason, I'm not particularly interested in reading Carry On. Maybe because the excerpts in Fangirl of "Cath"'s fics didn't really appeal to me? And I feel like I'd rather read Drarry fanfiction instead lol. But I think it's cool how she actually wrote Carry On! That's like ficception.

*** I had the same reaction to Fangirl - it felt so accurate like it was written by someone who has dabbled into that world. I'd recommend Carry On. It's pretty awesome in its own right. In Fangirl it's just a cool plot device, but as its own story it's like a reinterpretation of the Harry Potter world but also a clear homage to it. It's hard to explain.

**** Remember that scene where Cath runs into a girl who reads Carry On and they used the word "love scene"? I was half-expecting them to use "smut" hahaa. Also I love how fanfixx.net (was it .net?) is obviously fanfiction.net.

Okay, maybe I'll give Carry On a try! I feel like I haven't been into YA for a while. I can reread certain old favourites like Harry Potter and The Hunger Games but all new YA series I've tried just felt too...juvenile. But I've read and enjoyed everything else Rainbow Rowell has written.
