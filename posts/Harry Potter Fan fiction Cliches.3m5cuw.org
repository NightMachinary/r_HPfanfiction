** This might not be a cliche, but fucking "Trenchcoats" "Harry and X pretty lady goes shopping and fucking 11-14 year old Harry buys a BLACK TRENCHCOAT BLACK SHIRTS A BLACK PAIR OF DRAGON HIDE BOOTS AND FUCKING BLACK TROUSERS/PANTS!"... I cannot begin to express my hate for this fucking thing. 1. You don't wear a black trenchcoat with a black shirt, that is wrong and bad a bad colour combination. 2. NO FUCKING 11 OR 14 YEAR OLD LOOKS "KEWL" IN A TRENCHCOAT THEY LOOK LIKE A LANKY DORKY FUCKING NECKBEARD! 3. If you want someone to wear a trenchcoat, can you atleast not make it "A kewl black leather trenchcoat or basilisk or dragon hide" If you actually want to use a trenchcoat HAVE THEM WEAR AS SUIT UNDER THEIR TRENCHCOAT! A full length trenchcoat doesn't look good on a little scrawny ass round glassed kid with an attitude problem. Which is what a lot of these fics base Harry around.

Sorry for bad grammar, and sorry for ranting, but I really dislike the "Kewl trenchcoats" and such. English is my second language so sorry for grammar :)

*** Mandatory bad fanfic wardrobe change is top of the list. Can't tell you how much I wanna strangle someone when I read these. Naruto fandom has this in spades as well and It is right their with Pedo fics and oversized harem fics as the fastest way to make me exit out of a story.

** I have an idea: have a chapter that's entirely internal dialogue. Like:

"she's pretty." he thought "wait where did that come from?" And then a massive wall of text about "NO! we're friends! wait but I think I fancy her. NO! We're friends. I'm jealous of her boyfriend, why is that? No idea because I'm an idiot..." etc etc etc. I just read a fanfic where the only conflict in the whole story was the two main characters not admitting their love to each other for years and it was quite frustrating.

**** No problem! And I think your idea has loads of potential. It gets quite frustrating, shifting through a lot of bad fanfics to find that one gem, so a story that parodies all those bad fics is very welcome, I think!

** Not only a HP Fanfic cliche, but a general one in Hollywood movies too:

Hero(es) get(s) captured by the villain. But instead of killing them quickly on the spot, villain decides to torture them for fun, thus giving the hero(es) chance to escape.

I'm glad Harry was captured only twice in the canon. The first time the villain, very much in his character, decided to play a little bit and was thoroughly disappointed. He learnt his lesson and didn't waste any time the second time.

** I thought I'd try to leave a comment on the right story. (:

For the second chapter, my suggestion might be to take out the Dumbledore sodomy line, or at least tone it down a little bit. The rest of the fic is a more light-hearted mocking of mpreg/bond fics, so that line stuck out as it was less light-hearted. I feel like it would be really effective to say

#+begin_quote
  Harry heard Dumbledore mutter something about a past relationship, but he was still trying to figure out... etc etc etc...
#+end_quote

I thought Harry's internal confusion in the beginning was effective. Play that up some more maybe?

*** Thank you for the advice. I like the sodomy line a lot(mostly the part about Gellert being a champ), but I will consider your reply and weigh my options.
