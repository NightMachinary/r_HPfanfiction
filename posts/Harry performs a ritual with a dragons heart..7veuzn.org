Looking for a fanfic that I can't name. All I remember is that Harry performs a strengthening ritual where, I believe, he ends up eating the heart of a dragon. I'm pretty sure it is based in his fourth year during the tri-wizard tournament, but I'm more than likely wrong.


** Oh, its linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), Harry kills a dragon and eats its heart to perform a ritual to try and give Mentor!Voldemort his soul back.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** There is a fic where Hermione is actually a [n elder?] dragon (they can take human form).

It's an HHR, and to give HP the power he needs, he and Hermione do this ritual where they rip out half of their hearts and exchange them.

This results in HP gaining a dragon-form and becoming quite powerful.

It is abandoned, though.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.
