#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

Is this some kind of Prince of Slytherin thing where the author deliberately crams as many cliches as he can into one story? I could barely finish reading the summary.

*** It does have one claim to an original premise: the WBWL already got to travel back once after screwing up the first time, and that's part of the plot - there are two time travellers, both convinced they're the saviour, one struggling with now-imperfect knowledge of the "future", the other gleefully twisting it's course.

*** I felt it was ridiculous when I first saw the description and so I decided not to tread it, but eventually I decided to try it and I enjoyed it. Of course it is strange, but I actually enjoy the story.

*** It's jam packed with cliches, Lord Slytherin this, betrothed 11 year olds, lords this lord that. It's somewhat fun to read if you aren't trying to take it seriously.

** This trope amalgamation is getting sort of ridiculous. Soon we'll have wrong boy who lived Harry time travelling into his younger self to read the HP books with his relatives who have only hated him because Dumbledore potioned them because he wants to kill Harry because he is really is Snape son, who is secretly a vampire. Of noble birth.

*** Why does Dumbledore want to kill Snape's son?

Oh, I get it. Dumbledore wanted to have a kid with Snape, and Harry's existence is a bitter reminder of where Snape's true affections lie. And while they've had a relationship since, Dumbledore realizes that Snape hasn't fully given himself to him -- because Lily Potter is still alive! Dun dun dunnnnnnn!

***** Well it has been quite a few years since HP came out and so the longer we go the more "interesting" stories may become as people push new boundaries and explore new and more unusual areas.
