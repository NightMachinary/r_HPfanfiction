** Depends on where in America:

Texas: not only are the demographics completely nonsensical, now everything is ridiculously and immersion-breakingly huge. The Great Hall is, like, a league long.

California: a lot of people making disclaimers when they speak. Everyone is even prettier.

Massachusets: ... actually, not a lot different from the books, except the Weasleys are from Southie. (Image Mark Wahlberg at his curse-iest. That's the new Ron.)

New Jersey: /Everyone/ is at their curse-iest. ("What the fuck, Harry? You put your fucking name in the fucking Goblet of Fire?" Dumbledore said calmly.)

Florida: Methheads show up from time to time and do... weird shit.

***** I think what it was for me was that it was billed as "Harry Potter for adults!" so I went into it looking for that same sense of wonder and ... yeah. I didn't like any of the characters and nothing about that world, either the real world or Fillory, was enjoyable. What really frustrates me is I've read several short stories by Lev Grossman set in the Magicians continuity and I loved them. Why couldn't the book be like the short stories?

** I'm not gonna use this as a chance to bust on the USA all "DAE America LITERALLY SUCKS BALLS???"

I always found that other than some language/slang, there's nothing THAT British about Harry Potter itself. Which makes sense - books written in America that take place in America written by American authors don't constantly point out the fact that they're in America. But ones that come to mind are:

Some sort of child services organization would have visited the Dursley's after a teacher noticed how thin Harry was and how he was always wearing ill fitting clothes.

More overall diversity in Hogwarts (I know JKR is trying to backtrack now but facts are, the UK is not as racially diverse as the UK. And that's fine, because that's how it is). It also would have had a bigger student body, but JKR bungled the math there.

80s-90s pop culture references from the muggle born kids EVERYWHERE.

** There would be incessant wank about how much better the American wizarding community was than every other wizarding community.

Then there'd be a bunch of aggressive actions taken by the MACUSA in foreign wizarding territory at their own whims and against the wishes of the International Confederation of Wizards because of the MACUSA's history of extreme fuck ups and dubious or even outright deceptive justifications. Then the series would revolve around absurd domestic policies MACUSA insisted on against the wishes of their magical population because they're so beholden to their upper class.

Think I nailed it. ðŸ‘Œ

*** Mindforge no. :( I am american but in my fanfic worldbuilding I do not make it better than anywhere else. I gave every magic nation its own positives and negatives. Magic america's negatives are that magic on nonmagic crime rates are way higher than anywhere else because they don't have a Trace system on wands, they just have you do a test and get a license and then just try to trust you to be good and responsible with it. But if you don't...well, you can go a long time without getting caught if you're not stupid. :( Most of the super rich CEO's and movie stars are actually magic, because they used magic crimes to get so rich and powerful.

** In all seriousness, here are the changes I think there would be. There is alot more in my head but these are the ones I've decided to type for now. Apologies for the walls of text.

First underage magic. I can honestly see it being more laxed in the US. Perhaps starting around 15-16 instead of 17 but with more restrictions on what spells can be used.

Secondly, I feel like there would be less slap on the wrist punishments, especially with zero tolerance policies and other rules schools have implemented these days. In the magic world, i could see there being more creative ways to punish a student without crossing ethical lines or just having them clean/ write lines each detention. I could see the protagonist being expelled from school (like in the AQ series) maybe around the fourth or fifth book (though the protagonist would find a way to come back the next year at the end, probably after a plot of exploring the country and meeting other wizards).

Third, magical transportation and message delivering. Apparition, portkeys, the floor network, and brooms would all stay. Though pehaps how they get to Ilvermony (?) (assuming this was still JK though an American author would have a completely different name) isnt a train. Personally, I like the idea of Zeppelins heading to each state to pick up students. Probably alot more enchanted flying cars as well. I can see eagles being used to send messages while a magical teletype also being put into works. A thunderbird as the US version of the phoenix.

Fourthly, the US magical school. Most likely alot more competent teachers (evil or good).With the way the US cares about defense, the DADA teaching position is mostly held by ex magical veterans/Aurors. I can see there being an equivalent to Yule Balls that are yearly Christmas tradition, maybe some version of prom for students about to graduate.

I can see there being a yearly visit/field trip to some magical area, foreign or domestic for students. I can also see one book (particularly if there is an equivalent to the Triwizard tournament) being almost completely overseas. Though most likely to Canada, the UK, or Australia so there is no hard translation to do (though there would still be stereotyped wizards from non English speaking countries).

Fifthly, magical society in general. I can see the anti discrimination message being alot more explicit, probably an aesop in the first book and continuing from there. Probably an anti sexism message too. Politics? There would be alot more than one Rita type journalist in the country and more media bashing. I can see the leader of the country conspiring with the main villain of the series.

Lastly, the protagonist. If he/she grows up with abusive relatives, after maybe the first or second book it stops getting played for laughs and treated seriously. The protagonist was also bullied at Muggles school, so they are more quieter and reserved for the first two books before learning to step up and start confronting their bullies.

Post villain getting resurrected? Treated ALOT more seriously. The magic world starts getting more on the defensive preparing. Hardcore ex Auror gets the defense position at school. The protagonist's nightmares are treated alot more seriously at the beginning and he would listened to. Maybe see some people and alot more comfort. There would still be some version if the DA. At the ending battle of the book there would be more than one death. Maybe even a student deaths in book five or sixth.
