So I kinda feel like Voldemort's resurrection ritual in book 4 was severely hampered by the fact that /Pettigrew/ was the only person doing it? So if Voldemort gave Peter the kiddie version, what would be the professional version? What other rituals could he have used?

I'm kind of imagining a corrupted 'Mind, Body, Soul, Magic' kind of ritual where Voldemort uses himself in Shade form, a Dementor, a Horcrux, and an Obscurus to give himself a body and make him stupid powerful. Since even one of those is really powerful, the ritual circle would have to be done with some combination of '/Bone of the Innocent, Forcefully Taken, You Are Only the First/' (Unicorn Bone), '/Flesh of the Servant, Unknowingly Taken, Your Loyalty Will Be Rewarded/' (Pettigrew's finger) , and '/Blood of the Enemy, Willingly Shed, Your Toil Was in Vain/' (easy to get, thanks to Harry's Hero Complex).


** Pettigrew isn't as stupid as people make him out to be. I mean he learned to be an animagus as a kid with no formal instruction. He just doesn't have the drive or personality to excel without a clear motivation. Clear Most breathing down your neck is plenty of motivation I think.

Edit- *Voldemort not Clear Most ðŸ˜‚

*** True. But Pettigrew is not on my list of 'capable of acquiring an Obscurus' regardless of Voldemorts breathing down necks.

**** I disagree that the canon ritual is the kiddie version, but your super ritual is a good idea. You should write it.

**** He manages it in linkffn(A Distant Storm). Granted, his orders were from Voldemort /and/ Grindelwald.

** I feel like chucking a load of individually powerful things into a pot and thinking that this will inevitably result in a powerful product is not how the HP system works. All of the elements of the canon ritual were symbolically important. Replacing "bones of the father" with "random powerful magical creature" doesn't really have the same symbolic resonance.

*** There was a one-shot someone posted on DLP where Harry has died and Dobby tries to put together the resurrection ritual, very hard. It was hilarious. Tragically, I haven't been able to find it since I read it.

** ...How was the ritual hampered? It didn't seem to require talent of any sort on Pettigrew's part. I don't see how adding an Obscurus, Dementor and sacrificing one of his Horcruxes would increase his power. Unless I'm misremembering, what made Voldemort more powerful upon coming back was the fact that he could now bypass Lily's sacrificial protection, not because his already ridiculous magical power was increased.

*** Well yeah the ritual he used brought him back to existence with his normal magic and stuff, but it really didn't require much talent. I feel like it could have been the 'your servants aren't particularly good at these' ritual, but ideally Voldemort would use a 'yeah, you're basically OPAF now' type of ritual.

The Obscurus/Dementor/Horcrux ritual would basically give him the magical power from the Obscurus, the basically indestructible nature of the Dementor, and the Horcrux to tie everything together? this is purely theoretical though.
