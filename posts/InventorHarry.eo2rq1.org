Looking for fanfiction's where Harry follows his family's footsteps and starts inventing new things. This could be potions, enchanted items, spells etc.

Basically, anything where Harry's creativity is a major theme.


** linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff)

Harry is ridiculously lazy and only ever puts effort into inventing things that allow him to do as little work as possible.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** One of my favourites, For Love Of Magic , sadly is not mentioned enough, probably due to a lot of smut, but that, while frequent, is plot relevant (side effect from one of his rituals). Harry basically does not believe in limits of magic, starts by creating rituals to enchance his body, learning wandless magic (through hard work, mind you, he even mentions that without the help of runes he carved into himself, his talent or tutoring by him it would take decades to even be half decent in it). He also recreates various items from video games, as well as spells (enchanting, runework, spellweaving).

Can not link because of underage smut and all that.

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  Everyone knows the story, the Potters attacked and little Harry left with his relatives. But what happens when the last Potter stumbles upon something left behind? What does someone with no preconceived notions about Magic do when they find out that it's real? Do they follow along just like everyone else? Or do they find their own path? Harry Potter did always like to make things!

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

******** I need to re-read following the Phoenix, as it's been a loong time, but I can remember thinking it was so at the time. The only thing is that the way Significant Digits starts kinda throws you off. And a bunch of OCs are introduced and are important factors. But when you take into account their goals and how they've planned to help the muggle and magical world and even combine -- it's a global undertaking. Lots of bitchin bitchin moments and plot twists, and full of good surprises
