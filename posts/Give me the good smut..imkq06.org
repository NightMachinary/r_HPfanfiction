You heard me. All the well written complete smut you can find. Don't care about ships. Anyone can work as long as its decent smut. Plot? What plot. There doesn't have to be an elaborate plot. Slash? Fine with me. I dont particularly want to cry over sad emotions but I'll still read it most likely. So hit me with your finds.

Fair warning: the only fic of his that I've tried to read was /awful./ Not even so-bad-its-funny.... just sad and cringeworthy. Prolific dude, however.
