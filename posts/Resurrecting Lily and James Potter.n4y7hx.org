After defeating Voldemort, Harry returns to the forest to pick up the discarded resurrection stone. As Master of Death, and feeling like he deserves something for his victory, he brings his parents back to life. (For real, not just as a ghost or whatever the stone is said to do in canon). But as with every deal with Death, there's a catch: Lily and James return as they were when they died. Now Harry has to navigate a relationship with his parents who are only 4 years older than him!


** Not exactly, but pretty close is ‚ÄúBlood Binding‚Äù linkffn(10382653). Post-OoP, not post-DH, and it is just one year of the story, but still it may be entertaining for you.

*** Will definitely check it out thanks! Another one that is kinda similar is Suprise! by FirePhoenix86 [[https://fanfiction.net/s/5253648]], which I just remembered. But in this, I think the Potters were hidden and in a coma, so their bodies have aged as they were dead to begin with.

**** You can reconstruct the URL yourself. =linkffn= means the FanFiction site, so the foundation is =https://fanfiction.net/s/= (=s= as ‚Äústory‚Äù) and then add the ID number from the construct, that's 10382653 here. So, the result is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10382653]] and ... yes, the story has been taken down from ffnet. Hmm.

So, the next best thing is that I put [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/cizi/Blood%20Binding-ffnet_10382653.epub][my locally downloaded EPub]] on the Web.

Yet, another piece of evidence that [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]] is crazily useful (either as stand-alone command-line application or a Callibre plugin).
