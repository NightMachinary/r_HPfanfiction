Voldemort: Imma kill Harry

Dumbledore: I have 100 years of magical experience, but I'm just gonna pick a kid and say he did it because he has a mark on his head.

Lily and Jame: Now let's banish Harry to the Dursleys for his own good.

Harry: I'm a dark sociopath now and I hate my parents

WBWL: I a conceited prick that can barely do magic now (even though I'm the child of two people with powerful magic)

------- 11 years later -----------

Sorting Hat: Harry Potter goes to Slytherin!

Everyone else: Must be evil

------ 5 years later -------------

Dumbledore: OMG guys I made a mistake. Harry is the real BWL.

Lily, James, and WBWL: Harry we love you

Harry: Screw all of you. I'm gonna go kill Voldemort and then leave with my fav person Snape.

Dumbledore: You have to listen to your parents.

Harry: Actually I'm Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Gryffindor-Peverell-Gaunt-Merlin-Morgana and I've been emancipated since the age of 5 and am friends with all the goblins, so... Bye!

**** Harrison sounds like an old, smart, ass dude who annoys everyone with that "UhM, AcTuAlLy..." Bullshit and his overbearing desire to rule everything.

But I honestly love Hadrian. It is elegant and lovely, rolls easily of your tongue, kinda sounds like royalty, at least to me and sounds old but also new. I like Hadrian more like Harry.

**** You're in the minority, I think.

I'm okay-ish with Harold or Henry, those names actually track for "de-upper-classing" to Harry.

Harrison is a patronym, "Son of Harry". It is not, contrary to popular belief, a way to make the name "Harry" more upper-class.

The closest thing to a lower-class version of Hadrian is "Adrian". It in no way, shape or form turns into "Harry". On an unrelated note, several baby-name websites I've checked will actually warn you away from "Hadrian" as trying way too hard to sound upper-class.

All of that said, it's usually the accompanying trope-fest that makes me not want to read the fic. I've had my fill of "Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Ambrosius-Christ-Caesar-Odinson gets betrayed by Dumbledork and the Weasels, luckily he remembered the name Griphook so the goblins will wipe his bum for him".

TL;DR if you have to give Harry a more "formal" name, use Harold or Henry instead. And please, avoid becoming Yet Another Lord-Potter-wankfest.

****** Saw it used in a cool way once in a story where Harry's family was descendent of that king that was deposed before the current dynasty took the throne, it was interesting because it was mostly just a throwaway bit of family story, no one outside the family even /knew/ about it and the family itself (including Harry) never even tried for the throne, their only nod was having everyone on the family having the names used by the royal family (Eg. Charlus=Charles, Harry=Henry, James, Edward...) which seems to be common enough on the UK.

** You know I actually read a WBWL fic that turned these facts on their head in an original way. Don't Ask me what story it is. Cause I'm sure it was long since abandoned. ANd I'd never be able to find it again. But here we go.

Tom shows up kills sirus who was babyitting. Cue black family magic protections.

Standard stuff.

But here's where we differ.

Harry who is boy who lived. Has a horcrux stuck to him. Everyone just thinks its leftover magic from Killing curse.

Enter Time skip.

3 months later said soul fragment is slowly killing harry and nobody knows what to do.

They decide after some heavy talking it's better he lives away from magic as a squib then die before 2 years old. Potters and dumbledore believing that magic is not the only thing that matters in life. That muggles can be nice and happy as well. So they seal away his magic and give him to dursleys with a lengthy discussion about why they are doing this.

Dursleys are distant but decent.

Enter Car crash for some reason. Everyone dies but harry and dudley. both infants end up in different orphanages. Exit dudley from story. No one knows what harry's last name is. so they give him the name riddle. (Partly as a Pun..Also riddle being a rather common name in muggle world.)

Now enter horcrux. Because his magic was seeal horcrux slowly weakens until Harry absorbs it. and thus breaking magic free. Has side effect of changing harry hair and eye color. Cue bullying from other kids that make harry sorta anti social. Finding solace in learning an d snakes.

Enter hogwarts letter to Harry Riddle at St. orphanage.

Cue Freakout from everybody who thinks Voldemort has a son who grew up in remarkably similar circumstances to his father and has many of the same abilities and talents.

Lily and James hate him because they think he is the son of the guy who killed off many members of their family.

Death eaters in the know think he is their future lord.

Dumdbledore does not trust him but feels like its his responsibly to not fail him by letting him repeat history and go the path of his father.

And voldemort wondering how His diary got free will and lost it's memories. (Thinking about maybe he shuld not have made 7 anchors after all.)

**** Real story... Last time I managed to find it was more than 3 years ago. Back in 2018, at least. I remember it well because I've never seen a fic like it since. Sometimes a fic stays with you. But I think it was canceled sometime in the beginning of CoS.. Before Filch's cat was petrified.

First year was pretty different from canon because Harry did not a a reason to go for the stone. So If any of that happened. It's in the background.

Never found out if the CoS would have even happened.

** I would really like a WBWL fan fiction where Dumbledore is entirely in the know of the identity of the BWL. So Dumbledore knows that Harry is the one who was marked by Voldemort, but purposefully misleads the Potters/wizarding population by presenting the sibling as the saviour. Why? It would mean that Harry is in less danger, is under less scrutiny and maybe allows Dumbledore more control over how Harry develops while having a convenient scapegoat who will be targeted.

This would allow for a different relationship between Dumbledore and both the Potter siblings, while also allowing the writer more freedom in how Harry deals with his problems (having Dumbledore secretly be on Harry's side and guiding him) while still having a lot of conflict between Harry and his family.

Instead, he was there hindering Voldemort and subtly protecting his innocent brother. Voldemort does not care to look into it because he is causing a divide in the family and is supposedly weakening Dumbledore, who is torn.

Harry and his brother exchange letters, actually have a very good relationship. After Voldemort is defeated, Harry works with James and Lily, attempting to mend their broken relationship.

The twist I want to see is getting what we think is a usual WBWL story where everyone eventually realizes that Harry is the true boy who lived but...

In the end it is revealed that it was the WBWL, a.k.a. dunce-prick, who really was the boy who lived. Kinda like those heist movies (Oceans Eleven, Now You See Me, etc.) where the trick is revealed in the end.

It can go either way, dunce-prick was actually hiding a cunning side or he was still a dunce but an incredibly lucky one and the defeat of Voldemort was a series of hilarious coincidences.

A mirror that was conveniently hanging precariously from the celling falls with the impact right in the path of Voldy's curse. The curse somehow reflects on the mirror instead of blasting it apart while barely slowing down like it should.

***** There (usually) isn't any blood magic. The justification for dumping Harry with the Dursleys usually has something to do with him being jealous of his brother or Lily and James not having time for him or everyone thinking he's a squib or Dumbledore hoping he'll quietly die because he knows about the horcrux in his scar or everyone just being stupid and cruel for no real reason. And Voldemort is gone for now and any remaining Death Eaters also think that Harry's brother is the Boy-Who-Lived, so there's no need for any blood protections anyway.

***** Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]]

It's abandoned during 4th year, but it's one of the most well known fics and is very good. Definitely a must read imo if you are into HP fanfiction.

The summary is

Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

It's all just so Harry can be abused and feel left out and be a edge lord. They don't shape the character choice to fit a logical conclusion with what we know of the characters. Harry in these story's is basically an OC with Harry's name or not even his name. Why not just make your own story at this point?

**** Also, why James and Lily have to abandonned him to begin with ?

Harry can feel neglected and a bitter while growing up with his special famed brother, that got all the attention, all the training, way more time with his parents since they are training the Chosen ones, while Harry also suffer from all the sacrifice made for Brother by his family.

James and Lily can still adore Harry but circomstances don't really allow them to spend as much attention and time with Harry despite how much they wished they could. Everytime they try, it's cut short for Chosen Ones stuff. Any of Harry own issues can never been the focus because Chosen One stuff will always be more important.

Harry's a child, it's easy for them to confuse James and Lily responsabilities as the parent of the Chosen One for James and Lily not liking him as much as his brother. And be resentful of that. And Resentful of his brother for that.

On the other hand the fandom itself is soaked full of Ron!Bashing, it sometimes seems like a competition among fandom!Ron and fandom!Dumbledore to see who is the most bashed and they are petty much tied at this point. Some say that it is because of how the movies gave his best moments to either Harry or Hermione and either white-washed or just jumped over his best and more endearing moments in the same way most of H&Hr worst moments were just ignored, kind of the opposite of what happened with Snape.

When I first got on reddit, I was honestly surprised to see how few people hated or bashed Ron after my experience on the rest of the fandom. Of course, there are still posts like "Ron Weasley is a parasite who deserves to die" and "The only reason Hermione fell in love with Ron was because he imperiused her", but overall reddit turned out to be pretty fair not to only Ron, but other characters as well.

As to the hate contest, Dumbledore is hated by more people while the hate against Ron is more intense. I mean, even Dumbledore doesn't have fics like this - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5248438/1/101-Ways-to-Kill-Ron-Weasley]] for the sole purpose of killing him.

But being seriously, it is not so much that we completely hate the premise as much as it is that there are so many stories using those tropes that could easily be copied from each other or that are just plainly bad-written (often both) that we opt to seek for originality by highlighting what we absolutely hate on the troop or come here to rant and unwind a bit with likeminded people.

The very fact that we know so much about the tropes is a sign that we have tried again and again to find those we like but had no success. After the thousandth time Indy!Harry defeats Dumbledore and his family by essentially screaming very loud and throwing a tantrum at the DMLE which should have better things to do than bend themselves to the whims of a kid it loses even the barest hint of enjoyment that it had in the beginning, if you are not there yet than you will probably get there if you stay long enough in the fandom.

As potter do his adventure, Neville simply start to befriend students from different houses & being middle-man & judge for a lot of house-rivalry problems, wich irks Slytherin at first because they think Neville will be bias toward Griffindor, but start to take that thought back when not only there are times when he sided on Slytherin against his own house, his advices for both side, while simple, it's good enough to make them better person eventually. Draco could be more cordial, or, at least, appear so for Neville since he's a Longbottom

Eventually, Griffindor become as diligent as Ravenclaw, Slytherins become as open-book emotionally as Hupplepuf, while the House members is still separared by rooms & core personality, there will be less non-academic related rivalry & students are more willing to hangout or eat together on other tables beside their house's, and Death Eaters will have a hard time getting new recruits from Slytherin (or actually have easier time, now that other houses members could also posses the kind of personality they can recruit & mold. I'm not picky. I kinda wanna see Griffindor Death Eater for once, blaberring how "The Muggles need to re-learn true courage & chivalry we, the Griffindor, posses")

Eventually, these students will be united to protect Hogwarts as one, lead by Neville Longbottom, The Boy Who Unites

**** It would be nice if there were more fics where Harry has a sibling, whether Harry is correctly called the Boy Who Lived or not, that didn't include any of those tropes. Like there's so many other ways you can do with that, but I can only think of a handful that don't use the standard WBWL template.

** It's kind of painful how accurate this depiction is. Nearly every WBWL fanfic that I've read has the same premise and they're all just a culmination of a teenage edge lord's idyllic world. Personally, I'd like to read a fanfic where Harry is just a little neglected because Lily and James are trying to protect BWL and figure out why he survived by consulting different magical academics. During that time, Harry becomes an introverted bookworm, learning to strengthen his magic, and then has a normal time at Hogwarts where he becomes the Tom Riddle or Albus Dumbledore of his generation--maybe delving a little into his journey and how different it is without the BWL title. The author could then take it either way with Harry being BWL or recruit Harry into the Order or smthn. Idk, just a thought lol. Better than having some of the most compassionate witches and wizards instantly abusing Harry because he's not famous.
