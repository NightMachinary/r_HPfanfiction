He makes different friends on the Hogwarts express, he has a different wand, he is in a different house, he has a different upbringing (I just read one where he grew up in Azkaban for example) etc.

No harems and preferably not abandoned


** Try Raolin's The Fires of Magic. It's got everything you asked for and is a fun read. It's a WIP that regrettably may be hitting abandoned status.

  The curse Voldemort cast on baby Harry had far-reaching effects on Harry's magic. Harry must now explore those effects, and magic itself, all while battling killer teachers, giant beasts, and more in a school that really needs a safety board. Luckily for Harry, he doesn't have to do this all alone. Harry/multi. Contains AU, OC characters, and more. Book One will cover first year and the events of the Philosopher's Stone.

** Hufflepuff Harry with Snape as his mentor: linkffn(The Best Revenge)

Slytherin Harry that is fairly close to canon at first but really takes off on its own arcs around fifth year: linkffn(On the Way to Greatness)

Slytherin Harry raised by Lockhart that sounds really cracky but is a funny and surprisingly touching story: linkffn(When in Doubt, Obliviate)

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!
