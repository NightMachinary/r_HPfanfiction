:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I can remember;

1.  Harry gets sent into the past (I think he fiddled with a time turner or something and he goes by a different name in the past.)

2.  He gets sorted into Slytherin and becomes friends with Abraxas Malfoy, another Slytherin and Tom.

3.  Him and Tom start a relationship and Tom gives him Slytherin's locket I think.

4.  Harry gets sent back to the future in the middle of the night after sleeping with Tom i think and is distraught about it.

5.  Harry asks Draco to tell Voldemort that Harry has his shirt (to get Voldemort to remember him). I think the shirt might be in the title as I remember it being a key point I think.

6.  Draco doesn't and lies to Harry (I think to try and protect him maybe?).

7.  Then Harry ends up at Malfoy Manor to try and convince(/remind?) Voldemort of their relationship.

8.  While there Abraxas sees him and calls him by the name he was knew by in the past confusing Draco and/or Lucius.

9.  I think the other Slytherin friend of Harry's might end up with Hermione as he comes to the future to talk to Harry about Tom.

10. Also, I'm not sure but Harry might possible hop between the future and past a little bit but I'm really unsure about this.

Any help what so ever at tracking down this fic would be amazing! I've been trying to find it for what feels like ages now so thank you in advance!! Xx

** Fates Favourite by the Fictionist sounds somewhat similar. Also Rebirth by Athey. Both are on FFN.

I also have this post saved, no idea if the one your looking for is on it, but there's a ton of Harry/Tom fic here[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/55if85/lf_fics_with_harrytom_riddle/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf][list]]
