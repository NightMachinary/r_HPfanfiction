** Best:

I really liked the interaction between Harry and Tom Riddle in the 2nd movie. It was suspenseful and just really good.

I also liked the one from the 4th movie where Amos finds out his son is dead

Worst (I have a few):

Shoelace scene.

Harry and Hermione dancing. It seems out of character for Harry and out of place considering what's going on

Final battle between Harry and Voldemort.

The epilogue. I don't like in the book anyway, but I especially dont for the movies. The actors just look awkward with how they were "aged up"

*** Second the Tom Riddle and Harry scene from CoS.

Personally, of all the movies, I think Chamber of Secrets stands the strongest, the actual Chamber scene being the best part.

Also, second-second to both the shoelaces and Harry and Hermione dancing being the worst. You can tell Steve Kloves just /hated/ the canon pairings so much that it bled into the movies, specifically in his treatment of the Weasleys.

**** Depending on your perspective I suppose, it definitely wins the "most botched" category so I suppose it could go either way depending on how you choose to look at it

** *Half-Blood Prince*

Best:

Slughorn's handing over the memory.

It's a fair bit different than how in went in canon, but my gosh, the acting is phenomenal.

I love the story of Slughorn's little fish.

*Worst*

Yeah, you can't really get much worse than "shoelace." The Harry/Ginny scenes weren't done very well in the movies, but that one in particular is awful.

*** Definitely seconded on the fish story! Probably my favourite change from the books to the movies.

Worst for me is pretty much anything involving Bonnie Wright. She just was badly miscast as Ginny.

**** I dunno, there were a few good Ginny scenes--the scene in the Chamber is actually pretty nice, though a good chunk of that comes from the /very/ good decision to have Fawkes heal Harry /after/ he vanquishes Riddle.

**** But I definitely agree that the Slughorn fish story was the best change from books to movies. At least in regards to things the movies invented from whole cloth.

** *Prisoner of Azkaban*

Best:

Lupin and Harry's conversation on the viaduct.

"Your mother was there for me at a time when few would be."

Breaks the books terribly, but dang, is it a good scene!

Worst:

Hmm, the bit where Harry flies the Firebolt--though the freeze frame is definitely part of this.

** *Order of the Phoenix*

Best:

The scene where Harry confesses to Sirius his fears that he may be "becoming bad" is very tender.

Worst:

Hmm, nothing comes to mind at the moment
