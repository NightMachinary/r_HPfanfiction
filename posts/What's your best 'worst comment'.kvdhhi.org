I'm talking the ragers, the all caps, the whiny, the just flat out wrong!

What was the most hilarious negative comment left on your fic? Tell us and we'll laugh together!

Mine was on a drabble challenge piece at 1.3k words. (Yes I went over a bit.)

"Scathing review: Change the names of your characters. Good about the match between the characters, but with those names, I'd rather see their personalities too. It's not impossible that Hermionie would get along with Fred without becoming a completely mindless, teensie who isn't embarrassed to kiss boys in a showy display on the Quiddich pitch. Fred is creative, genius even, with a particular ability to be an inventive businessman. An older Weasley boy could have held her attention. But this isn't Hermione, and that's not Fred. Take it easy with the dashes to express stuttering. How un-classy would it be to express the love scene in Pride and Prejudice with dashes. Say they gasped, or stuttered, and only say it once to show us their feelings. Self-indulgent, not that I have trouble with that. A quick read. It's easy to understand. I don't perceive this to be a serious read so a lot of people will like this, I think. It's perfect for"

And that's where it ends. Lol. It was tagged AU-no war on Ao3 but this was on FFN. My favorite bit is the negative comparison to Pride and Prejudice.

Also, I am not going to be some sort of jerk who requires proof of a funny anccendote, but if you want to leave your link I'll give your fic a peruse and leave a (hopefully) more positive comment.

  Now being REVAMPED! It's Fred and George's last year at Hogwarts, so naturally they want to break the rules... and get Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Ginny involved! Their list of 200 things they shouldn't do, but will do anyway... Told in snippets, R&R!

** My first fic's first comment was "I thought about reading your second chapter but then remembered I'd rather be doing literally anything else."

I was 13 and the fic really was rancid. Still, I went from excited giddiness that I had actually gotten a comment to absolute despair. Took me three years to have the balls to try posting again.

I'm surprised. I started writing at 13 and it was (and it's still posted so I suppose still /is/) hot garbage.

Typos and wrong words, obvious self inserts, boring rushed plot. It's terrible. But out of my 13 comments only one is negative left.... 7 days ago. On a NINE year old fic.

Is it still there by chance? I love reading old fics

***** Yeah, they didn't explain it very well, just shot off a lot of accusations. Like saying that I was the kind of person to send dick pics to gay women and then get offended when they stayed gay. Which... rude.

If you don't think that an underaged person (a /fictional character/ at that) can be trans, that's... well, I don't think there's an age that one has to reach before they're "allowed" to be trans, but whatever. But even if you disagree, "pedophile" is not the right word for that.

It was one of the weirder moments of my life as a fanfic writer, if only due to the sheer lack of sense the person made and the level of passion they had about insulting me.

** "I wanted to like this, but unfortunately it follows the exact same lazy writing conventions that all those pro Hermione, anti Ron bashfests follow. Not nuance, no reality, everything is binary. Hermions is wrong and Ron is right and a victim.

No one is in character, Hermione's flaws and faults are dialed to 11 while Ron bears no resemblance to canon and any of his actions are hand waved off or ignored. You come off as a Ron fanboy trying to get back at the Ron bashers, proving you're just the other side of the same lazy, tired, bashing coin."
