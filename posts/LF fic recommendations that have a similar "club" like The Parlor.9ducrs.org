For those who don't remember/haven't read The Changeling- The Parlor is a group of girls in Slytherin who don't fit the mold of pureblood women. This is a poor explanation, but if you haven't read it, you won't really understand it. Ginny is invited in her fifth year.

I love the concept of a sisterhood (in Slytherin or other houses) that is a bit infamous in its house but maybe not known outside of that. Or perhaps a known secret in the castle for girls. If this exists in any other fic, I'd love to see it used again.

I'd prefer if it wasn't Hermione invited into this "club" for obvious cliched reasons. Her friendship within the trio (imo) would have excluded her from needing something like The Parlor.


** I never knew I needed this, but I would love to read something like this! I loved it in The Changeling!

*** Right? I just read The Changeling (after quite a while of putting it on the back burner) and just became totally obsessed with it. It's so Slytherin and wonderful, I can't believe someone hasn't used something similar in another story. The idea itself is rather how people treat the "Head Boy/Girl" dormitories that don't exist in canon but are always used for shipping stories. I like this so much more.

***** I won't lie to you. I just had to reopen to check what you said. I'm pretty positive I just changed everything to past tense by default (I also correct sentences in my head while I read subconsciously) while I read. I never noticed that. And now it will bug me. Thank you. /s
