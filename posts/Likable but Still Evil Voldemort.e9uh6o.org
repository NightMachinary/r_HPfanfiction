So I just finished reading Wyste's Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions, linkao3(10588629). The story has been rec'd on here a lot already, but I was never sure about it. I worried that it might be a bit of a crack fic. I was so wrong. It was amazing and I can't recommend it highly enough. My absolute favorite part of the story though was the characterization of Voldemort (specifically coupled with the contrast to Harry, who is unequivocally good). Somehow Wyste managed to make this clever, funny, horrible villain and I absolutely need more... like now. I would try to give examples of what made this so compelling, but I worry they will appear to be crackish (i.e. torturing someone one moment, and then giving Harry research advice the next--or murdering people in such a way that it might even appear to be for Harry's actual benefit).

If you've seen the X-Men movies, the relationship between dark and light (Voldemort and Harry) is perhaps a bit like Dr. X and Magneto, with Dr. X visiting Magneto in prison and the two seeming quite companionable even though they'd definitely go to war with each other.

It also strongly reminds me of Voldemort in Prince of the Dark Kingdom--a horrible person, but undeniably compelling.

So I'm looking for more of that if possible. Harry has to be light and good and kind etc. and Voldemort clearly a bad guy, but somehow they still seem to like each other. This feels like a tall order, but it's just so good. Please help. Thank you!

​

​

P.S. The summary for the fic mentions that Harry hides out from Dudley's gang in a grad student's lab station and gains an interest in chemistry. The scene is never showed in the story... it starts out right in the middle of a Potions class. But Wyste wrote the scene out in one of the companion novellas and you should definitely, definitely DEFINITELY read that if you haven't. But only after you finish the Problem of Potions. Trust me, has to be after, not before.

Voldemort is a sympathetic villain. Still the bad guy but not a psychopathic racist like Canon. Also Fem!Voldemort

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
