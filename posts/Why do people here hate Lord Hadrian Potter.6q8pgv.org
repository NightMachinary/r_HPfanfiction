It's like the ultimate trigger taboo... I think these fics are great fun to read


** Because those types of fic are always /telling/ me that someone is important and powerful. Paragraphs and paragraphs about titles and shlock that doesn't mean anything because the damn plots always the same

** Usually, Lord Potter fics are anything but realistic or 'good' in the sense that they aren't very well-balanced, with Harry having all the power and all the antagonists being inept, which leaves the story with very little tension. They also tend to be quite... shallow? They're just fulfillment fantasies that pay little attention to plot and character development, have no deeper meaning to them, and tend to have a lot of angsty resentment from Harry being manipulated all his life. I used to enjoy them quite a lot, especially when I first started out reading fanfiction. But all that angsty resentment gets really old, really fast. Especially when it's always the same rant, Dumbledore manipulated my life, my friends betrayed me, they're spying on me, Dumbledick's stealing from me, yadda yadda yadda. I do occasionally return to them, however. Some of them are kind of fun to read, but never do I think of them as being 'good' fics, or even decent.

Tl;dr Most Lord Potter fics feature everything that you shouldn't do in a well-written story.

** I don't hate him per say. Do I find him and the normal associated tropes unoriginal and boring to read? Damn right. But a good Lord Harry story can be quite the fun read, on par with even a less cliched story.

It depends on the execution.

** It depends, some of them aren't bad...but why HADRIAN? That's fucking uncreative as fuck! Stick with Harry, it's probably on his ID, too (his teachers wouldn't give him a nickname, especially if he isn't a good student and neither would his friends (he doesn't have any: Dudley beats anybody up who tries to be friends with Harry))...or if you have to do some lordly name-change, then be freaking creative :(

Sorry, it's kind of a pet-peeve for me! I hate uncreative names (hell, I am still annoyed that my own parents were uncreative with my own name - Thomas - and didn't even give me a middle-name! I still sometimes think about selecting one and having it added to my ID etc.!)...I hate it with pets (especially cats and dogs...sorry, but can't you do your lovely companion justice and give him a nice name instead of an over-used name that lacks creativity?), fictional characters and even people (It got really annoying in school when we had three people with the same name in class (note: Luckily that's long past!)...why don't we go back to the fucking ROMAN system and call our children stuff like Secundus (Second), Tertius (Third) etc.? That's not much worse IMHO! Sure it's better than being creative and getting it wrong, but not much...ARGH!)

ps: Hadrian is a Roman Emperor for me and a guy who built a fucking wall in Britain

I agree with you Hadrian is a ridiculous name. They should stick with Harry. Or James, lord james sounds cooler.

*** Harry is not a very classy name, so it is kind of needed in some fics.. Harrison is still a most fitting name for those fics, as I can't see how Hadrian can become Harry.

Anyway there are tons of fics out there where he is a squib, or the entire universe doesn't have magic.. Hell, in some he is just a character named HJP with identical looks in a very different world. A name with a small change is NOTHING in fan fiction.

** I don't hate the name per se, however, it is kind of weird for me. Harry's name is so much a part of him that it's difficult to read him with a name like Hadrian. It's like having Luke Skywalker's name really be Lucius Skywalker but they shortened it down to Luke. Emotionally, it just doesn't work for me.

** I quite like Lord Potter fics too (thoigh I am resigned to the fact that most of them are shit which must be trawled through to get at the few good ones). I can quite see why some people change the name: JKR intentionally selected the most commonplace male name she could find, and if the author's purpose is to emphasize how extraordinary his noble titles make him, it is quite tempting to retcon his name into a nickname. Now that you mention it, Hadrian is my favourite of the options, given my love for all things latinate, as well as Henry, which is quite regal. Harold is OK (it's an ordinary Anglo-Saxon name, which makes sense for a character like him). Harrison however is far too American---in England it would be a family name!

I think if an author decides to do such a name change, they still ought to refer to him as Harry in most cases so as not to alienate readers too much. Look at Prince Harry---legally he is a Henry, but he is referred to as Harry everywhere but in official documents. If it's good enough for actual royalty, it's good enough for Lord Potter!

** when they make harry a public name with out giving True Names magical power over the person.

when i read those stories I cant help but think of harry as an idiot for announcing his so called true name to the world when there was probably a reason it was hidden in the first place.

the lord part is a whole other issue that i wont go into

** Lord Potter fics are one of my guilty pleasures, like crack-fics in a way. I usually enjoy them not because of stellar writing or anything like that; but because they simply amuse me and make me laugh. That being said, the name Hadrian does irk me. Simply because I feel like there are better names that could be used.
