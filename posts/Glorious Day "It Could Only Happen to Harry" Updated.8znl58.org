**** I dont think PotDK being unfinished would hurt as bad if it wasn't so close to the end. 1 million words of build up to... nothing. It's rough.

  The Sorting Hat has sorted thousands of students in the course of its life. If it makes a mistake or two, who's to say it's wrong? Certainly not Fred or George Weasley.

**** Wait, I read this on LJ forever ago. Like 06 or something. There was an update since? It was an old favorite. I even copied and pasted the text manually from LJ to add it to my library. Such a cute fic. Thanks for reminding me of it and giving me hope of parts of the story I'd not read!

***** I also copied and saved it on my computer. I used to do that a lot back in those days. I'm glad there are automatic programs for that now ðŸ˜† Glad I could let you know about it; I was pretty happy when someone told me.
