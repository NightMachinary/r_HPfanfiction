:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have found and lost this fic so many times it hurts. Most likely on archiveofourown or on Fanfiction but i have scoured both to the best of my abilities. I'm looking for a fic that, obviously is about Harry being Cinderella. His family abuse him, and force him to sit outside of the couch on the way to the palace, he almost freezes to death. He is saved by Severus and Lucius who end up thinking he's perfect for Tom Riddle, their king. They protect him, and treat him well and Harry learns the politics of his land. The first didn't involve magic. It had a sequel chapter where Bellatrix was a bad influence and tried to lure Tom into black magic.


** Similar, but not the exact fic you're looking for, is Dirty Harry by Lomonaaeren. Described as an AU Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast like fairy-tale, it does feature Harry being abused by family (actually everyone except James and Lily are abusive towards him), he lives outside the castle, sleeping in a shack, and works as a gardener. I'm just recommending this because of the similarities and if you enjoy fairy-tale AUs. linkao3(21447403)

#+begin_quote
  Harry was cursed to die at birth. His parents managed to hold back part of the spell, but it means that Harry is now cursed to be seen by everyone around him as a dirty servant. Only true love's kiss can break the curse, but how can that ever happen when Harry disgusts everyone he meets?
