Please help me because I am looking for a very specific Dudley is a wizard story I read two or three years ago? :( I cannot find it but I do remember a line from it and also a theme of the story I think and it goes: "Uncle Vernon seemed to have decided that if his son was going to be a wizard, then he was going to be the best wizard around."

And in this story that was true I think because Harry was STILL neglected by Vernon in favor of Dudley who was a wizard too. I also remember Vernon taking Dudley to Diagon Alley and being mean to everyone because Dudley needed the best of everything?

Please someone help me I think it was a very good fic and I want to read it again?

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
