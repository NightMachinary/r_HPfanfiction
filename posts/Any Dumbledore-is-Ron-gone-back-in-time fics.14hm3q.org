I remember that JKR once said that she almost made Dumbledore an older Ron that gone back in time, but decided to drop it near the end of the series. I'm looking for a fic that used that idea.


** ... Just a question for OP, when and where exactly did she say this? I've heard the theory but I don't think JK ever said anything about it.

** That is the first time I've heard of that. I'm a big time-travel ficcer, but I'm usually harry-centric or hermione-centric in my TT reading. I've never seen this senario, but seeing Ron travel is fairly uncommon. I did just read one story where it was Ron, Harry and Ginny. Or you sometimes get the Golden Trio or what I call the DA 6. or Harry going to Dumbledore's time. I'll keep an eye out and do a few searches, as this sounds like an interesting read.

But I honestly cant see Ron and Dumbledore as the same person.

****** I know you were not, the point was that I've been an active part of the FF community for 10+ years and I'd never come across peggy-sue or the name 'ministry 6'...Well, might've come across that one and never thought of it.

Though, in my defense, most of my reading is on ff.net, and I'm usually in Time-travel land.

**** I have not forgotten, I've just been busy. Sorry. Here we go: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5698899/1/Shiny_and_Blue]] It IS slash, but I think it was well done and not too lemony, silly at times, but great, and it's complete.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6261496/1/Forced_Perception]] no pairings, non-slash. Kind of a cool one where Harry is older than Albus (as opposed to being the same age). It's in progress, but it has been getting updated regularly, as far as I can tell.

Other than that, I dont recall. There are more I've read out there, but only as I come across them. Those two are nice long reads and I've enjoyed reading them, esp the first, as it's hilarious and silly at times.

Happy reading!

In all seriousness though, I'd be interested in reading what JK said about this. Not a lot of love for Dumbledore or Ron 'round these parts, so sorry if your request goes unfilled. ): I've never read anything like that either.

**** I see Ron, stealing things like the 12 uses of Dragons Blood from the future and generally abusing other types of knowledge, to appear one of the greatest wizards of all time. However he did not research time travel well enough to know that changing the time line would mitigate much of his future knowledge. He had Hermione help him with the research in the future, as a hypothetical of course (she was thrilled he was thinking academically after leaving hogwarts)

He accidentally jumps too far, back to pre WWII, and has to come up with a backstory. Now Ronald is not "dumb" just doesn't apply himself. He's the chessmaster, so he starts arranging the pieces.

But things keep changing on him, things keep trying to correct themselves, ripples in the timeline mean small things in the 1940's have repurcussions he didn't plan for in the 90's.

In the end, he is able to arrange for Harry to end up with Ginny, and he with Hermione (his plan all along) but then Harry/Hermione find out about the Amortentia! Harry is also just as immune to obliviate as he is to Impirius, it all goes wrong for him.

Hermione is ostensibly married to Ron thanks to the Amortentia after effects. But both her and Ginny's children are Harry's, and the three of them are happy together. Present Ron is kept in the dark about his future self (dumbledore) and is none the wiser about the kids not being his. I mean come on, red hair! hello? Forgetting that Harry carries a recessive gene for it from Lily.

Ron the Cuckold, Dumbledore the dead chessmaster.

Though when Ron DOES find out about Harry/hermione/Ginny being together, he decides to time-jump to fix things....

***** There's just one thing wrong with the scenario: Ron is not at all of the 'let's give second chances' type. He's more of the 'let's beat up the fucker now' type. There's really no way he'd leave Tom Riddle well alone when he was a kid.

****** Well, the original timeline had Hermione spending most summers at Potter Manor with the Marauders. Ron went back originally to get Hermione, which he succeeded at in this timeline for a little while. Possibly original Ron was a bit more capable than current Ron as well.

New Ron decides to go back to make changes, but is too incompetent to do anything but use what he knows about Dumbledore (once he realizes he IS dumbledore) and so his going back THIS time is only in order to maintain the current timeline, in fact reinforcing the WTF moments like basically sending the trio down after the Stone in first year (after all, if he never goes back in time, then Dumbledore doesn't exist, so the original timeline takes over. Where there WAS no Voldemort.)

That being said, there is plenty of Dumbledore and Ron bashing fiction out there that I'm surprised there is nt more of it merging the characters.

** ...Is this really a thing? I rather dislike both characters, but for completely different reasons and this Shamalanesque twist would totally ruin it for me, except the dying part...I cried the first time, then I read some fanfiction and realized just how much Dumbledore screwed up, or just how much he intentionally harmed people.

*** Well. I don't like them too. And Ron-centric fics is not my cup of tea. That said, a time traveling Dumbledore is something I haven't read before, Ron gets to do something other then ruin Harry's success rates, and it may give the DumbOldDork a reason to screw things so thoroughly.

**** Muhuwahaha, so the entire reason for Ron to come back as Dumbledore to make Harry marry his sister so he could marry Hermione (who originally ended up with Harry).

His master plan began with turning Tom Riddle into Voldemort by forcing him back to that orphanage every summer, then planting a fake prophecy for Snape to hear, which leads to Harry's parents being killed and Harry growing up poor (backfired slightly since he still ended up with his parents money, but Ronbledore didn't mind, because as Harry's magical guardian he had access to the Potter vaults anyway.) This also allowed him to send Harry back to the Dursley's every summer (in the original timeline, Hermione spends most summers at Potter Manor) and have Hermione stay with him at the burrow until they could "rescue" Harry.

When Harry and Hermione STILL looked like they would end up together, he had to "nudge" Harry towards Ginny with potions in sixth year.

Genius really, Ron was playing the long game

****** I haaaave been looking for something to get me writing again. I have dabbled in a few new fics but they all petered out... I think I used all my good stuff in Searching For The Power...writing 560k words will kill a genre for you for quite a while.

I'm actually already dabbling a bit in time travel with my HP crossover (with Incarnations of Immortality) so I'm in the headspace...
