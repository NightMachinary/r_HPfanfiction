Okay, I am kind of a Harry Potter nerd. After reading the books at least ten times each and watch in the movies ten times each, I think I have found what Avada Kedavra really does.

I think that Avada Kedavra is just an OP obliviate(memory wipe spell) that erases your body's ability to function. AKA makes it so that you don't know how to breathe, eat, drink, make your heart doesn't beat, etc. think that this is true because according to chapter 17 of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, " ...For the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage...". It also can't be killed by removing a soul because Dementors remove a soul but the victim doesn't die. Another thing that supports this theory is when Fake! Moody from GoF tells them that because they are all untrained that they would just give him a nosebleed. I think my theory explains this because if my theory was true then the reason it wouldn't work is that the students don't know the true nature of the spell and what it actually does. Avada Kedavra means "I destroy as I speak". in Hebrew/Aramaic which could mean "destroy all memories" or it could just mean destroy everything but the body. Also in Chapter 1 of The Goblet of Fire the author says this, "The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the bodies, and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangled, suffocated or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact, the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment, the Riddles all appeared to be in perfect health - apart from the fact that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face - but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?"

See, This is another example that shows that people affected by the killing curse dont show any signs of being affected at ALL! Which is absolutely insane!!!

This theory doesn't explain how Harry survived twice and how it leaves a scar. Another option that it could do is just stop the heart from beating. BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY.

also just wanted to mention i had this theory after reading the books the first time before i even knew fanfiction existed. i wanted to say this because the fic hp and the daft idiots had the same thing and i was so happy to see that. i am only posting this now because i just realized some people here would maybe like it... i also posted this theory in the fan theories subreddit and in the game theory/film theory sub reddit

The problem with your interpretation is that all of those things you mention (particularly not breathing, your heart stopping, etc.) leave damage that can be easily discerned in any half competent medical examination. It's a make you dead spell that leaves you /physically/ intact... cardiac arrest and respiratory failure are easy to distinguish so if you want to write about how AK works you have to think about /metaphysical/ damage. Things like, it severs your soul from your body or collapses your magical core.

*** This point was raised In one of the other places I posted it and I will try and find what the respondes were again. Also do you really think that wizards would know of things like cardiac arrest and respiratory failure?? from what I interpreted from the books wizards didn't catch any muggle diseases. There only way, I interpreted, that they could die was from magical causes or old age. And if that was true there would be no need to recognise these things. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/dvazul/what_avada_kedavra_really_does_harry_potter_theory/]] if you go to that link and the second string of comments you will find the muggle side of things. Also in those comments I said 1970s but it really would have happened around 1950s and 1960s.

**** Muggles were killed by AK and their deaths were investigated by muggle authorities and muggle medical examiners. Moreover, we've been cutting corpses up since the 1500s, established a normal anatomy by the 1600s and by the early 1700s we have the birth of clinical pathology with a treatise that describes gross pathological findings in cardiac arrest, asphyxiation, etc. By the 1900 there's histology to find microscopic findings associated with these diseases. You are *profoundly* underestimating medical sciences.

** Like other people have said, I've always been under the impression that it just kills you. No discernible explanation, no evidence of any bodily malfunction, just... Death. Iirc, the opening chapter of Goblet of Fire even supports this: the groundskeeper recalls that the Riddles died of no detectable cause.

That, in itself, is one half of the reason the Killing Curse is so terrifying. It can't be blocked, and that's definitely horrifying. But assuming magic is as versatile as Rowling makes it out to be, there are either countercurses or countermeasures to a lot of fatal spells. Spell that stops your heart? You've got a few seconds to cast the countercurse before your body goes into fight v. flight. Horrible lacerations? There's a spell to slow the bleeding until you can get to a hospital. Are you suffering from spontaneous tumor growth? Assuming there's not a preventative spell against that, you can just Vanish them as they appear. The Killing Curse isn't like that, though. You can't block, but more importantly, you can't fix it. You can't cast an anti-aneurysm charm on yourself to prevent it, you can't staunch the bleeding, you can't even react half the time because it's literally a high-speed Booger of Doom.

That's what makes Avada Kedavra so inherently terrifying. Not the fact that it passes through magical shields like a hot knife through butter, but because there's no vector from which you can stop what it does to you once it hits. Just... bam. Green light, and then nothing.

** Sadly trying to apply logic to the killing curse falls short pretty much any way it gets cross examined. It's magic. You just die. It's a spooky spell with no real counterplay except blocking it with other living things or I'd assume physical constructs.

If I had to guess though I'd imagine the killing curse is something that isn't exactly a physical reaction and instead a more spiritual one like the other unforgivables. The only way I can properly relate it is to a "wisdom save" in d&d as it's an imposement on a person and their will.

I only say this because I feel like the three unforgivables do that in some way shape or form. All relatable to dungeons and dragons spells.

Dominate person - Imperio

Power Word: Pain - Crucio

Power Word: Kill - Avada Kedavra

Imperio takes control of the mind and assumes control of the spirit.

Crucio incites pain, but doesn't actually physically leave symptoms. If we ran with the spirit thing and the idea it's torturing that directly. It explains why you can show no actual symptoms but still be broken from it in post.

Finally the killing curse simply destroys the spirit.

These are curses that lack any effect on a physical level. They all subjugate in some way.

So finally assuming we replace the word spirit with soul. Id make a simple idea adjustment that demontors actually collect the souls they kiss, but don't destroy them.

This allows the concept that in the Harry Potter universe: you cannot live if your soul is destroyed.

And have the killing curse do exactly that. Let dementors be the exception rather than the rule.

**** It's all good, you can write it however you want. It's just when you have the curse start having physical manifestations, those physical things can be sensed.

Another can of worms it opens up is. OK, can I hit someone with a killing curse but leave them hooked up to things that will keep their heart pumping, chest pumping, etc and just leave them brain dead like a coma patient? What if we do that and then reteach the body how to do those things? Etc

You're not supposed to be able to, and it's why physical explanations for the curse tend to fall short.

****** And then if you want to rule it that way in your story then by all means. But realistically, no it doesn't work like that.

At a certain point you just have to have faith in the established universe and the people "smarter" than you or I. And what I mean by that is theoretical powerful wizards well versed in the dark arts that have probably dissected the killing curse to hell and back to figure out how it works. That knowledge has both been lost and passed on through generations predating Merlin going back to a time before Jesus christ.

The killing curse kills you. The idea that you could theoretically hook someone up and stall an effect you have to assume has been done by your Anakin Skywalker of the universe trying to stop people from dying.

That's just being realistic. And the moment you try and introduce it otherwise as a plot device it either A: goes heavily against what people already sort of "agree" upon with it dealing with the soul.

And B: gets introduced as a "GOTCHA!" plot device likely introduced either by the protagonist or protagonist adjacent.

And the problem with "discoveries" like that being made is there are far smarter people than the protagonist. The only character in universe that I'd trust to actually know how the killing curse really works is Voldemort. I wouldn't even trust Dumbledore to find some super secret hidden effect and ways of stopping people from dying to it. I'd only trust Voldemort due to his capability, personal interest, and time spent researching dark magic.

** My personal HC is that the AK actually does just what the name implies and straight up kills the target instead of doing something else that would result in death. This is why there wouldn't be damage, the curse didn't do something else that then caused the death, it just changed the person state from alive to dead, this is why it couldn't be blocked (except for the whole blood protection thing), there isn't an specific effect to block or to reverse because that curse immediately kills the target without needing a medium.
