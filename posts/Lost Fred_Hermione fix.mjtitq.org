I'm looking for this fremione fanfic and I can't find it. It was based after the war and Fred dies but he ends up either haunting her or in her head. She has to figure out how to save him. There's this line in the blurb that goes ‚Äúa relationship with Fred weasley was never bound to be normal‚Äù or something like that. I'm pretty sure it was on Fanfic.net. Hopefully someone knows what I'm talking about lol. Thank you!


** Do you remember any more details? This isn't ringing any bells but maybe with some more details I might remmeber?
