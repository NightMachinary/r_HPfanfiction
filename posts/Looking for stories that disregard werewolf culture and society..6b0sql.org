So recently I found a story where Hermione gets bitten by Lupin at the end of PoA. Instead of being her usual social norm disregarding self she immediately accepts that she should become a member of a random pack of strangers instead of locking herself in the basement for a night every month and otherwise not giving a fuck.

So I wondered if there are stories where Hermione, Harry or Luna get lycanthropy but don't care about the subculture associated with werewolfs. Please no canon pairings, good Malfoys, Snape and Dumbledore or slash (femslash is ok).


** Just leaving this here so that I can find it later.
