** u/Hpfm2:
#+begin_quote
  in Harry's year there are five boys and five girls in every house.
#+end_quote

Do we? I'm pretty sure there's only 3 girls in Gryffindor, Hermione, Parvati and Lavender, right? Where did you get the number 5 from? And why would there be the exact same number of students on every house? THat would not only require us to have an even number of students every year, but for there to be a 50/50 ratio of boys and girls. Not to mention the fact that they'd be equally split amongst all four houses. Is the hat trying to fill a quota or something? "Well, this chick's clearly a gryffindor BUT they already have 5 girls so... SLYTHERIN!"

*** It's implied during the original bogat scene that there are more than 3 girls in gryphindor. Of course it's mostly just another incident on JKR's terrible math skills.

Also I vaguely remember an interview with JKR where she implied that she envisioned Hogwarts having around a 1000 students with only important characters getting names or screen time... or booktime?

  A suggestive bit of evidence against this theory is that every known Gryffindor - all three girls and eventually all five boys - belonged to the D.A., (...) and we know all the members - and no extra Gryffindor girls are among them.

Yap it's all there indeed.

******* And now we get drawn into the issue of *levels of canon*. In Harry and Me, JKR explained that she spent time naming the original 40 students that were in Harry's year.

And then what book do you take as the definitive source when there is a contradiction, PoA or OotP?

Personally I think it's the general 'shakiness' of HP's world building that makes it so appealing to write Fanfiction about.

******** Yeah, you can make Hogwarts bigger or smaller - shit, you can do it with the entire wizarding world!

If you want, you can have one million Wizards in Britan - we don't leave Hogwarts enough to have anything contradicting (except statements from Rowling that Hogwarts is the only school, but that's never said in the books), so you can introduce other schools.

You can introduce students we've never seen before (2 Gryffindor-girls), flesh out characters we only know by name (Daphne Greengrass), we know very little about (Amalia Bones), or just change well-known characters a bit.

We get like 200 pages of information about magic at most, and the students are in school for seven years, and constantly busy. So we know magic is more vast than described in the books. My personally favorite concept introduced in fanfiction is "Wards with Runes", but you can add Magic if you want to.

The Harry Potter world is such an optimal playground for fanfiction... I don't know any story that can come close to this - so many people are familiar with the world, yet the world and story is open enough so you can easily be innovative within.

** If we use JK's notes on her [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-original-forty][original list of characters]] in Harry's year, then eliminate those whose house affiliation we know, and assume whoever is left is a candidate, then we are left with either Lily Moon, Sally-Anne Perks, Sophie Roper, or Sally Smith.

Edit: As [[/u/GryffindorTom]] noted, the handwritten original list also includes the surname "Runcorn" with the first name out of the frame. Harry Potter wiki lists this character as "a witch" in Harry's year, because otherwise the list would be one female short of 20 in Harry's year. So Runcorn could also be the 5th Slytherin girl.

** To directly respond to OP's question, there's no 'mystery fifth girl', because there's no rule that there are 5 students for each gender/house combination. (Indeed, nothing says that there are 40 students in Harry's year; JKR just made a list of 40 names in case she needed them.)

If you want to include a fifth girl, Lily Moon seems to be the most popular candidate (I've also seen Laila, Lilian and Lilith Moons). As [[/u/DetentionWithDolores]] noted, Sally-Anne Perks, Sophie Roper, Sally Smith and ??? Runcorn are all Pottermore-backed names. (For some reason, I associate Perks with Hufflepuff and Roper with Gryffindor.)

** Variance is a thing. The chances of there actually being a perfect distribution of 5 girls and boys in every house is highly unlikely. But, JKR isn't good with numbers, and would use a throwaway line to enhance the whimsy of a story rather than actually lay down some hard facts.

FWIW, Lily Moon is the addition I see the most.

** Like others have said, I really don't understand why people think this is a thing. I mean, it's a frigging castle, with /magic/ and house elves, do they really think the fact that Harry turned up and went into a dorm with five four-poster beds, that all the first year dorms are exactly the same? I mean, it's obvious the Marauders had a dorm to themselves. I can't see them completely excluding a fifth boy to the point that he never comes up in anyone's stories.

I like to think that the population steadily went up every year after Harry, as the magical people started having families post-war. I imagine it was probably much, much higher back before all the wars.
