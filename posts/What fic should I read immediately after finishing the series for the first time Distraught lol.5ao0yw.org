** Hmm ... well, I presume that you do not want anything too ... distant from canon. With that in mind---and with certain things already recommended---I recommend taking a look at “My Master's Bride” by Paimpoint (linkffn(6435018)), a short story that ... well, do find out for yourself, I do not want to spoil the surprise. Then there is “End of the Line” by shewhoguards (linkffn(3673824)), a somewhat longer story that's ... well, since I don't want to spoil anything here either, I'll just say “emotionful”. And the final one of the things I'll give, “Six Years, Six Applicants” by Sarah1281 (linkffn(4772789)), an amusing story about Severus's attempts to get a certain job.

*Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), should appeal to readers who have just finished the series. It's a time travel fix-it fic that contains significant amount of canon rehashes. The writing is very good and quite emotional. There are also many scenes of graphical sex and violence that could not go into YA Books.

  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12209542/1/][*/Tamblin Demosthene and the Unwanted Remembrance/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8383306/Tlalcopan][/Tlalcopan/]]

#+begin_quote
  The third Tamblin story. Family issues. A descent into madness. A shocking crime. I wrote this story with a different style from the Harry Potter formula as an experiment. It begins in medias res, covers about half the school year, and is told through flashbacks.

**** I think this was the second fic I read after DAYD when I strated out. I found it scrolling through the favourites section and really enjoyed it. It sort of follows on from canon which I thought would help and it is a great fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] - The most famous next-gen fic, and a good one at that, even though it has quite a lot inconsistencies with canon. Focuses strongly on relations between houses, and students conflict with teachers. (Complete, but with sequel hook that probably will never be used)
