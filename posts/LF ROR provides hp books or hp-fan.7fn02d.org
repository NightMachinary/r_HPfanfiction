I just read this fic linkffn(5149431) And i think the premise is amazing! Any other fics where harry is using the room of Requirement and it provides either the harry potter books, or a fan of the books or fanfiction, that can help him out? I need more of this!


** linkffn(A Dramatic Reading): /Umbridge/ finds the books in the Room. After only skimming through them, she sees enough rulebreaking in the early books that she organizes a public reading of the books, intending to "expose the blood traitors' misdeeds". Obviously, this quickly backfires when she gets to later chapters involving the survival of a certain Dark Lord... The story as a whole is strongly recommended.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
