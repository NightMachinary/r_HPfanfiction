I'm playing around in the many fics I'm not actually writing and I was wondering if there's a term for killing an entire family or the last of it. For example, the Malfoy family is of note but if they had all been murdered it would be... something. Specifically in this society where, especially among purebloods, family lines and lineages are so important, that would be a Thing, right? If not, any suggestions for naming it, specifically as a crime? (Sorry if this makes no sense at all.)


** Lineacide? It's not a word but it fits with all the other -cide words. So to kill a lineage.

** I suppose a word for it would be extinct, as it means "(of a species, family, or other larger group) having no living members." so your example would be "The Malfoy family is of note but if they had all been murdered it would be extinct" and I suppose the act would be something like "rendering the Malfoy family extinct"

** Well, murder is murder. Are you looking for a term like patricide or regicide? As far as I know, there's no specific term like that for killing an entire family line. I've heard it referred to as something something the root and stem, maybe in Game of Thrones?

Hmm, maybe scionicide--killing the last scion of the family?

*** I know. I think I was thinking of 'line theft' but murder-y. Scioncide could work though. Thank you!

** /Familicide/ sort-of fits but is usually used to mean killing one's own immediate family, not root-and-branch extermination.

Harry hypothetically taking out the Dursleys would be classifiable as familicide.
