I know that for a lot of people they ascribe it to her being obsessed with books and the whole "it it's not in them then it's not real"; but she dismissed the idea of Thestrals being real, based on the fact that she couldn't see them, and it's almost guaranteed that information about them would be in a book about magical creatures. This to me suggests that Hermione is more of a stickler for empirical evidence, where her worldview is based on what her senses tell her exists.

** But seriously there's no way canon Hermione would start a revolution.

They manage to win the war and what do they do afterwards? They join the establishment instead of doing any sort of meaningful reform.

EDIT: going to edit my comment instead of doing individual responses. Cowardly? Perhaps, but I prefer to call it efficient.

First, Hermione's 'revolutionary' tendencies re House elves and Umbridge. Hermione's actions are to passively aggressively leave clothing out to free elves who don't want freedom, to curse a piece of paper and not tell its signatories that it's been cursed, and to lead Umbridge into a forest to get 'taken care of' by centaurs. Hermione's actions in these regards are hypocritical. She is supposedly more tolerant than Umbridge, yet the house elves don't want freedom and she doesn't care about that, she knows what's best for them (the treatment of house elves, as a slave race, and Hermione's efforts being depicted as worse than useless is a bigger issue entirely honestly). Yes, it's ill-advised, and it's /not revolutionary/. It's passive-aggressive, subversive, but not insurrectionist. The DA /is/. I will acknowledge that. But there's a far cry between studying archery to improve your hand-eye coordination and storming Area 51 with bows and arrows (and yes, they kind of do that in the DoM, but then what? When year 7 rolls around, they're not out guerilla striking Death Eaters, they're starving and hiding.). As for 'getting rid of Umbridge', the centaurs explicitly call her out as using them as a means to an end--a similar situation as the house elves--but she keeps her hands clean. Her actions are /subversive/, they are /rebellious/, and they are undeniably /clever/, but they are not *revolutionary*. Hermione has no grand vision to impose upon the world, no dream of a future free of blood purity--she just wants to pass her OWLs, get rid of Voldemort, free house elves, with no willingness for the dirty work.

Second, the evidence of what comes after. 19 years later is peaceful, sure, and otherwise we only have Cursed Child to go off of. Let's pretend the plot of Cursed Child didn't happen but the setting did--i.e. if the super Time Turner didn't exist, what does their society look like? We see a future where Hermione is minister, and Death Eater sympathizers can run around with powerful artifacts that can destroy their current peace itself--*20+ years later*. We can assume Cursed Child is shoddy worldbuilding (which it kind of is), but since it's the most authoritative source we have on the post-war era, it shows that there was no strong action in the wake of the war to crush the sentiments related to Voldemort. In that sense, CC suggests that the state of the Wizarding World after the war is not that of Germany after denazification, but the American South after a failed Reconstruction -- and that suggests the lack of revolutionary tendencies on part of Harry, Hermione, and friends.

*** I disagree.

What actually happened after the Battle of Hogwarts was the equivalent of a revolution.

The old establishment, the rich purebloods who were once the core of Voldemort's forces, would be destroyed or disgraced. The public went easy on them after the first war, but how well did it work? Reign of terror, genocides, and mass torture of their own children through Cruciatus! No, there would be no mercy this time, and even the Wizard Jesus was willing to use Cruciatus on a sadistic magical Nazi scum who had spit on one of his friends. Good people could only be pushed so far.

All their victims, who had been abused and oppressed by them for so long, would rise up and exact their rightfully deserved retributions. And at forefront of this revolution stood the Trio, the Order, and the DA. They didn't join the old establishment, they became the NEW establishment.

**** Yeah, but even if we assume that somehow they managed to imprison every single Death Eater or willing follower of the Dark Lord from any Ministry or Wizengamot positions (unlikely), that still leaves a HUGE body of sympathisers, collaborators and neutrals who did not technically follow the Dark Lord, but rather followed the Ministry's laws.

You have to remember, this is less a terrorist group and more a terrorist group who are latching onto a belief system that is supported or viewed as acceptable by around half (give or take) of the population.

I mean, aside from a few who were killed or fired, or resisted internally like the Weasleys, Amos Diggory etc, the VAST majority of the Ministry (which is the main employer in Wizarding Britain) was happy or willing to join in with, accept and promote the mass oppression of Muggleborns either due to moral failing or cowardice.

So what do you do then? Do you imprison everyone from the Ministry, leaving you with basically no Wizengamot or Ministry to speak of besides a few Order members and those they vouched for? Basically wiping out a huge chunk of the British Wizarding population? Or do you let some people go, keep their jobs, keep their power and wealth, and deal with the institutional inertia that they will create?

And what of their kids? Do we punish the kids for the sins of the father and mass confiscate wealth and power, creating a disenfranchised future rebellion out of the losers of the last war in a Treaty of Versailles style fuck-up? Or do we let them go, and risk them worming their way back into the positions we only just managed to get rid of their parents from?

‚Äã

What Wizarding Britain needed to do after the war was the same thing as South Africa after Apartheid. They needed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, followed by root and stem reform of the voting system, governance system and Wizengamot rules.

Instead, they just fired and imprisoned the most obvious bad guys and then had the good guys take their pointless bureaucratic positions.

So what do we do with Theodore Nott and his generation? They will likely sympathise with the Death Eaters, but none of them have actually done anything that we could punish them for.

Do we punish the children of criminals? Or do we let them go?

Because, in the British Wizarding Society, either option is pretty difficult to make work.

And that's before we get to the fact that my complaint about the punish everyone strategy wasn't that it is wrong or bad to punish these people, but that it's impractical and will lead to greater bloodshed in the future, just like the Treaty of Versailles.

************ And then, once more, what about the kids? Lock them up too? Morally repugnant. Leave them penniless, effectively orphaned, and blacklisted socially? Recipe for disaster.

At the very least, SOME amount of thought has to go into it beyond the barest level.

I'm going to mention the Treaty of Versailles again, but I'll actually explain why I'm making the reference.

The Treaty of Versailles was, morally and from a judicial standpoint, fairly legitimate. It severely punished the "bad guys" of WW1, stripped them of money and influence and put a significant crimper on their ability to restore these things, along with a restriction on developing the capacity to fight again.

But, in doing so, it caught as collateral a great many citizens who were manipulated, lied to or coerced into doing and supporting the wrongs of the regime. It also provided the genuine antagonists an opportunity to appeal to those citizens, holding the Treaty up in propaganda variously as proof of the enmity faced by the German people, the unfairness and evil of the Allied forces, the rightful fear the Allies felt of the superior German people, the fault of whichever pet group the current vogue of prejudice supports etc.

This, along with other factors, led to WW2.

Locking up everyone who supported or collaborated with Voldemort, while initially compelling and certainly justified, would do a similar thing. It would create a massive underclass who due to their unchosen familial and social relationships with "bad guys", were left penniless (as logically, each Death Eater's crimes would certainly take their full wealth to redress), socially blacklisted, likely openly discriminated against, and bitter at the fate of themselves and those they are related to. This will be on top of the already somewhat rooted prejudices these children and minor relatives will have been exposed to, all of which will suddenly look much more appealing. A new Voldemort would, in this society, have no trouble appealing to these people, sweeping them in with a modified version of the old lies - muggleborns and blood traitors hate purebloods, they want to steal and coopt our magic and our land and our government and our wealth, they're scared of how great we are - and if the Ministry and Wizengamot have not been fundamentally reformed, then all Voldemort 2.0 has to do is kill or Imperius a few of the new good guys, much like Voldemort 1.0 did in his time, and take advantage of the innate flaws in the British Magical governance system to easily take over and legislate, make policy, and judge criminal cases with a quiet and cowed populace unable to resist (and this time, no prophecy to save anyone).

This does not mean that I think Death Eaters should go free, nor that they should be spared heavy fines. It is to say that a lot more thought needs to go into it than just slapping those two things on the table and changing nothing besides who temporarily sits in which seat of power.

I'm talking a separation of powers, a bill of rights, expansion of elections, real and present reform that will outlive the current crop of idealists and act as an institutional barrier to future excesses and attacks on the fabric of society. Along with a detailed and comprehensive analysis of every single person in the Ministry and Wizengamot as well as relevant persons in wider magical society, with a precise individual sentence decided by a panel of diverse judges who are concerned with rehabilitation, justice and the maintenance of a functional society. Something JK never bothered to write.

I have an in-character essay I wrote as part of my Hogwarts Curriculum and general worldbuilding for the story I've been thinking about, but my ff.net account is too new to post it, so I'll do so when it's been 12 hours. It basically describes what I see as the optimal post-war strategy for dealing with Death Eaters and collaborators. I may write another on the political changes that would need to be made as well.

I'm not trying to defend Death Eaters or oppose compensation for their victims.

I highly doubt Voldemort has that many supporters. Please don't assume that most Purebloods support him, because the DA and the Order are both dominated by Purebloods too! Before the Final Battle, when Pansy Parkinson asked to turn over Harry to Voldemort, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw stood almost UNITED behind Harry. That's IMHO the best indication of where Magical Britain's population truly stood.

As I explained in the above point, there shouldn't be that many Death Eater children. They obviously need to be reeducated, to face the atrocities their parents had committed, and to understand that being born to a privileged family doesn't give them the right to abuse, oppress, and murder others.

Some will turn, but some will certainly not. Good behaviors will be rewarded, suspicious behaviors will invite more scrutiny and even sting operations. Draco Malfoy should play a good role model here. Malfoys should lose lots of money, so they can no longer bribe people at will, but they also keep quite a lot that Draco doesn't need to ever work again.

I think Kingsley pardoning Lucius Malfoy is really a good strategic move. It shows that the new regime is flexible and willing to reward good behaviors. This could definitely be part of a "divide and conquer" strategy. By avoiding Azkaban and selling out every his former comrades, Lucius has no choice but to tow the official Ministry line.

I completely agree with the rest of what you say, but my point is that the process of weeding out the bad actors from the Ministry and society at large is not as easy as it seems at first blush, and that without significant reform to the outdated, corrupt, massively flawed institutional frameworks of the Ministry, Wizengamot and Hogwarts Board of Governors at a minimum, it will only be a temporary fix.

I think you underestimate the fear factor. Voldemort and his scums would go to extreme length to intimidate his opponents. Install a puppet Minister, have a couple of your own guys (Yaxley, Macnair, Rookwood), few hardcore Blood Purists, and opportunistic minions as department heads, you get a compliant bureaucracy.

It seems the Ministry also has lots of "take orders without question" type minions.

But I agree with you, the Ministry seems to have a high percentage of Voldemort sympathizers.

*** I can't help remembering Hermione dressing down Barty Crouch Sr and Amos Diggory over their treatment of Winky at 14 years old, minutes after they'd had their wands pointed at her, Ron, and Harry. A couple of months after that, she starts S.P.E.W., and while it didn't gain traction, she was raising awareness for something that most of the wizarding world never considered. She also took direct action (however ill-advised) to try to free the house elves at Hogwarts.

In OotP, she's among the first people to see Umbridge for what she is from the jump, and it's Hermione who comes up with the idea for Dumbledore's Army, even though doing so is expressly going against the wishes of the administration. She doesn't hesitate to continue once it's been expressly outlawed, even though doing so would result in her expulsion. It was her idea to curse the parchment, which is the only thing that allows Harry to escape punishment for leading the DA. When Harry has the vision of Sirius, Hermione is the (only?) one to question Harry's impulse to immediately take off, but agrees to go with him if they can prove Sirius is gone. Later, when they're captured by the Inquisitorial Squad, Hermione's the one who figures out how to get them free of Umbridge.

And you say they join the establishment like they went to work for Fudge. Kingsley is the new Minister for Magic; there's no better time to join the Ministry than immediately at the beginning of the rebuilding after it'd fallen to Voldemort's allies. In the magical world, as in the real world, change happens when good people get their hands dirty instead of just bitching from the sidelines.
