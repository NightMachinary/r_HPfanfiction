Realistically speaking, though not without slightly suspending your disbelief, how could you see HP characters split themselves in to (at least) two major oppositions? And I'm not talking about being split by blood purity beliefs.

What could you see split the trio apart, have the twins join Percy (or vice versa), or have Snape agree with Luna on a mutual ground? Additionally, what could you see split the death eaters and Ministry apart, to the point where quite a few DEs would team up with someone like Kingsley? In other words, what could absolutely splinter the Wizarding World - turning friends into enemies (and vice versa)?

Are there any fics that explore this concept?


** I think the big conflict will be surrounding the Statute of Secrecy. In the 16th century withdrawing from the muggle world was easy. But today, muggles are everywhere, and hiding magic from them is becoming ever more difficult, as muggles have gained the ability not only to record photographs and videos, but also to share them instantly with the rest of the world.

Wizards have three ways to react. The first is maintaining the status quo. That means withdrawing even further, limiting contact with muggles to a minimum. That would obviously be unpopular with muggle-borns and half-bloods, and the problem would continue to exist as there will always be new muggle-borns to be integrated, which becomes more difficult the more secluded wizarding society becomes.

The second option would be to follow Grindelwald's ideology. A preventive strike to establish a wizard dictatorship over the muggles. Obviously that would be against the morals of the majority of wizards. Furthermore, before waging war on the muggles, who would surely resist a wizard attempt to seize power, the magical world would need to unite, whereas in the books it is very divided.

The third option would be a gradual peaceful opening towards the muggle world. It's a utopian idea, but I could see someone like Hermione try it. I think it would be the preferred outcome for most muggle-borns and half-bloods with a muggle parent. However, it would face resistance by most pure-bloods and other conservative wizards, but also by many muggles.

*** This is pretty much it. The Statue is defining so much of the life of wizards it makes almost a better conflict than blood status, so I'm really excited that the FB movies are about that.

It defines who you can talk to freely, restricts harshly what you are allowed to do (Misuse of Muggle Artifacts), but also allows for peace.

Muggles today would start a war, at least some countries do. Breaking the statue would mean death, it would mean war. And then it would lead to wars amongst muggles, amongst wizards ans between them - but afterwards, the world might have peace.

Heck, Muggles today would definitely hold the wizarding world accountable for "crimes against muggles" like Obliviation and stuff. That alone is grounds for war.

I can easily see how Grindelwald gained followers, and how this question can easily divide friends. Hermione's approach is too idealistic, Ron's "Let's just not change anything" approach is the worst of both worlds and Harry's approach means war. And like that you have the trio separated.

The biggest problem is they are using an "asshole cop-out" to settle the conflict for the viewers.

By that I mean, that instead of actually exploring the issue and what it means they are letting one side be represented by Grindelwald, who we know is a murderous villain who betrays the cause he supposedly stands for. So the audience will be forced to disagree with his stance because Grindelwald is an asshole, not because there is actually anything wrong with the stance from an ethical point of view.

They should have made sequals that actually pitted Hermione against Harry against Ron with no clear morally superior side. Now that is an interesting movie. FB? well, we already know how it'll end...

**** If she were smart about it, I could see Hermione hedging her bets:

- On one hand, she (or her faction) could initiate actions to take control of key Muggle institutions and organizations behind the scene, especially the media sector. Publishing the HP Series might be a first step to test the water. The result most likely exceeded their most optimistic expectation. Muggles generally liked the idea of magic, although significant percentage of the population still hated it. They also provided handsome profits to those involved, who then used those gains to widen their influence in the Muggle world.
- On the other hand, she could build secret, self-sustaining bases in very remote parts of the world that would not only serve as a refuge for an eventual collapse of the SoS, but also for extinction level events such as nuclear wars, asteroid impacts, or super volcano eruptions.

I always just figure that wizards could, in theory, just portkey a chimney up to Mars and then floo there? I don't know. But I can see something as simple as that be something fitting the HP universe.

I mean, wizards in their first year of education learn how to trick the main reason why we have problems going to space - gravity. Not just trick it. They learn how to elevate themselves over such benign things as the laws of nature, even though most of them don't realize it. I simply don't think that going to space is much of a challenge for magicals. I'd rather think that the final question for them is: "Why should we?" Mars is a red rock. Moon is a gray rock.

I also think that should be their fundamental problem: an extremely arrogant and regressive attitude. More and more of Muggle world is coming to the realization that we are ultimately fucked if we do not diversify into outer space. Staying put on Earth just means inevitable extinction down the road. We might still fail even if we tried for outer space, but at least we would go down fighting and trying.

They should last longer on Earth than Muggles. But if Muggles were all dead, then they would also die out due to terminal inbreeding.

**** I've always wondered what would happen with the Order of the Phoenix post-SWW. I can almost guarantee that there existed tensions between members on how the group should operate aka action vs. inaction, kill vs. capture and so on. Jumping forward to the years following Voldemort's final defeat, these surviving members are all (in)famous for their roles in the war. Celebrities, leaders and otherwise notable members of Wizarding Britain's community, essentially the new leaders to guide W.Britain to a new future.

So whats to say these conflicting ideologies surrounding the SoS are taken up by these now socially and politically powerful war heroes? Harry and his friends would of course get involved (or lead), which alongside or against their former comrades would make an intriguing story I think.

***** Apart from Kingsley and McGonagall, the Order was pretty much the Weasleys. There was also the DA to consider, in which Neville and Ginny had very significant influence.

I don't think there would be lots of mercy for the Death Eaters after the Battle. McGonagall had no problem with Harry crucioing Amycus Carrow, and she was willing to kill Slughorn even before the Battle.

Weasleys were a hot tempered and bloodthirsty bunch to begin with, and would be downright pissed after losing Fred and learning what had happened to Ginny at Hogwarts.

That left Kingsley, whom we knew actually little other than he was a capable fighter and administrator. Many fics had him giving Voldemort's Ministry collaborators a free pass, but I honestly doubted this considering how much he was promoting the DA.

I expect the DA to be the most bloodthirsty and vindictive group after being tortured all year and then losing so many friends. Kingsley inviting this group to take over Magical Britain's security forces led me to believe that Kingsley himself was also taking a hardline approach. However, offering leniency to the Malfoys showed they were still sensible enough to take a divide and conquer strategy against Voldemort remnants.

** I think a big one is the argument for killing death eaters vs incapacitating them. Take Dolohov. According to his wiki page:

During the first war he participated in the murders of Fabian and Gideon Prewett. He was caught, convicted and sentenced to life in Azkaban.

During the second war he was part of the mass breakout from Azkaban, took part in the battle @ the Ministry (almost killing Hermione) where he was recaptured /went back to Azkaban. After being broken out a SECOND time, he attacks Harry/Hermione/Ron in Muggle London before finally killing Remus at the final battle.

I get that these were kids books but continually allowing your enemies to regroup like that is not the way to win a war.

*** I get where you're coming from, but for this to be a believable plot point for me it would have to be written a certain way.

No one in the HP stories are soldiers - the Aurors are perhaps the closest, but even so the description is a rather vague combination of Policeman/Bounty Hunter/Soldier than specifically people who are trained for war.

From a utilitarian standpoint, there is no way to contest your argument. If one particular side wants to /win/, then they have to permanently disable opposition that cannot be swayed to either surrender or declare neutrality. In the case of raving, murderous Death Eaters, they would most assuredly just kill them and be done with it.

The /issue/ is the way that authors handle the above plot point. /Because/ none of the characters in HP canon (/particularly the trio themselves/) are soldiers through-and-through, they might not decide to kill opponents as readily as someone thoroughly utilitarian - or a soldier - might. And if they /did/ decide to kill their enemies, there's no guarantee that they'd just do it and be fine.

I feel like it could be a great way to explore a divide between the main characters of HP canon, but it would need - for it to appeal to me - to be approached sensibly, maturely, and with the right kind of considerations being given for things like psychological consequences and PTSD, as well as people potentially getting sucked in by dark magic or something similar.

And choosing to /not/ kill raving, murderous Death Eaters should never - in the words of Merciful!Dumbledore - be about redemption, or ending wizarding bloodlines, or whatever the fuck. It should be about a character's belief in due process (or an opposition to the death penalty, which was made illegal in the UK in the late 1960s/early 1970s), or their own /personal unwillingness or inability to take a life./

In all it has potential to be really interesting, but only if it's not approached by an author that's already decided which route is objectively best and spends the whole story going "being merciful/not-as-murderous-or-evil as the enemy is dumb".

** An issue I could see people argue about a lot is the questions of the Statute of Secrecy. Given different circumstances (muggles progressing, more surveillance leading to more "unexplained phenomenons"), the subject may be on the table again in the future.

I would think there are a few who would argue that the muggles have always been and will always be a dangerous variable and who prefer the Status Quo. I'd think that maybe an adult Harry would come to this conclusion. Maybe Snape and I'd think that Dumbledore also sees it that way (each of them with different words and examples, but essentially the same).

Then there are those who think coexistence would be possible since the muggle world is now enlightened and uses science instead of superstition. I could see Hermione be part of this group. Its an idealistic standpoint she would probably share with a lot of muggleborns who have a good home with their muggle-parents and halfbloods who saw this coexistence in their own family.

The third party could be of the opinion shared with Grindelwald - that wizards and witches are not protected from muggles, but muggles protected from them. I'd think that this opinion could probably be seen as valid by a broad variety of people. Essentially, it is true. Grindelwald made this point not even an hour before the MACUSA DMLE obliviated /New York/ - as in, the populace of New York. Within this group you could probably see two splitters. One wants wizards to be contained to prevent bloodshed, the other wants the containment to end which would inevitably lead to wizarding superiority.

The last group, and probably the most passive at start, is the one that simply says they don't understand them ("They're weird/crazy/idiots/...) and therefore don't want their own society to live with them. I could see Ron in this group. He doesn't have anything actively against them. But he does belittle muggles and doesn't care much for their culture or procedures. I don't think he would like to see a merge of the cultures, simply because it would rip him out of his comfort zone. And we all know, people eventually get aggressive when you rip them too fast, too far out of their comfort zone.

** Because of the Dark Mark and Voldemort's terrifying presence, Death Eaters were unlikely to engage in open civil wars. However, individual betrayals, defections, and noncooperations happened even in canon. Also, I expect Death Eater individuals or factions to go at each other covertly, a killing curse that missed its ‘intended' target was perfectly valid. We never knew whether Rowle's hit on Gibbon was truly accidental.

The ‘good guys' had plenty reasons of an internal split too. The myriads of Indy!Harry fics offer good evidence to how such splits could happen. An overarching theme here is that certain elements were fed up with using non-lethal tactics against Voldemort and opted for much more ruthless measures.

Of course not everyone would be happy with this decision. The more radical factions, including people like you, would not be satisfied until enough blood had been spilled.

********** But who will prosecute them? In canon, the only muggle official that has knowledge about the statute is the prime minister and considering how separated the worlds are, I doubt anyone well make an attempt to enforce international law, especially when you consider, that wizarding Britain is basically an autonomous country. Though if the statute get´s repealed, I guess the autonomous status of the various wizard governments would be challenged, and considering the number of dark wizards rampaging over the years, they probably would have to pay some reparations and maybe have to hand over some of the criminals that got away, to be tried by international law, I very much doubt, that it would cause war like some seem to think, at least not from the muggle side.

********** The point isn't that it doesn't make them guilty, though I'd argue that for something "minor" like uniform it might grant them leniency; the point is that the Ministry of Magic wouldn't have any inkling those rules exist (for that matter, they would probably dismiss them if they knew because they're Muggle stuff), and thus they wouldn't take it into account in their trying of Death Eaters, regardless of how harsh/thorough they're being.

*********** Time for some gravedigging, right?

As for the postwar situation, Hermione is guaranteed to know about it and Harry should have heard of it at some point during his muggle school-time. They were by far the two people who contributed the most to winning the war and that would put them in a position similar to the Emperor in the Colosseum. They could, through various means, force the Ministry's hand into any direction they want. I mean, Harry just 1v1ed the most feared man in the country and has the Elder Wand. There would be few who would oppose him and Hermione is no slouch either.

Edit: Also, not wearing insignias is no minor thing. Even Q-boats hoisted the proper flag before attacking. Fighting without insignia usually is punished with summary execution if you were caught, which goes double for insurgents.

************** From /their/ point of view. But, I mean, would Muggle authorities recognize it as a war? Hell, until the "Battle of Hogwarts", there weren't even any regular armed conflicts between the two "armies", just a bunch of skirmishes. The numbers at the Department of Mystery are still ridiculously low if you account for Wizarding Britain's small population. Nor were the Death Eaters a nation, anyway, by any definition. If it was any sort of war, it was medieval warfare at its finest.

The only parties that knew were harry ron hermione albus and severus along with the malfoys and Bellatrix and Voldemort. Four of those are dead. The malfoys arent saying shit. And harry ron and hermione are going to be quiet due to debts to malfoy and Narcissa.

***** McGonagall would at least suspect it due to Harry's actions in book six. He took the Dark Mark and boasted about it. We know that at least some Death Eaters gave names in order to get better sentences so I'm quite sure that someone would name Malfoy. And since the aftermath is supposed to be different from the last time, where everyone bought their way out of prison, liberal use of Veritasserum should be expected.

Would /you/ be happy learning that for the past few thousand years there was an entire society of people who had A) readily available cures for most fatal illnesses and B) actual methods for /immortality/ (Elixir of Life comes to mind), but they refused to share?

People were /dying in agony/ because these elitist, bigoted rich assholes with mountains of /literal gold/ refused to share the cure for cancer and the secrets of eternal life? Granny rotted from old age - /I'm condemned to die/ - because some stick-waving robed bastard thought he'd just - you know - /destroy the Philosopher's Stone?/ For what, some kind of - moral lesson?

Immortality is something these /freaks/ value so little they just toss out artifacts granting it with the trash?

"No, that weren't a spell; he's always had them horns." -- Genetic tracking and testing reveals that an infusion of muggle DNA every few generations isn't enough; if wizards don't all start having children with muggles (or at least trying), they'll die out or devolve into beasts within a few generations.

"It's not our fault that the dam broke, but how can we just walk away from thousands of people dying when a couple spells could hold back the flood without anyone seeing that magic was involved?" -- a small subset of wizards start using their magic like invisible superheroes, because they feel a moral obligation.
