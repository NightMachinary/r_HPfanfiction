I'm always reading about magical trunks with enchanted spaces and compartments like a complete wardrobe, potion storage units or even a real library but I have a hard time imagining them. Apparently the witch or wizard can access them externally so I can't use Newt Scamander's suitcase as an exemple as he has to get into it to access the enchanted space. Do any of you have seen fan art about these trunks? How do you think it looks?

And can we agree that it's ridiculous for Harry to have an entire apartment inside? I read fictions where Harry is the owner of 32 properties and still buy an apartment in the trunk : highly ridiculous. Then it gets more ridiculous with a floo inside the apartment which defies reasonable magic as flooing inside enchanted or expanded spaces sounds highly dangerous. Anyway sorry I got carried away (:

What are your thoughts?


** In my mind there are two different types of trunks/bags with enchanted spaces.\\
The first is a Mary Poppins style bag, you just put your hand in and feel around till you find what you want. I imagine it more as if the bag is like three times bigger or whatever, rather than infinite.

The second I imagine more like like a wardrobe with pullout shelving units. So you would pull up a piece of the trunk and it would pop out a part of a bookshelf, or part of a food storage cupboard/freezer, or would pull up to be a place to put your clothes away.

** I mean, the trunk /is/ canon (or at least movie canon, Moody was trapped in one for most of 4th year).

*** The trunk that is canon is a seven compartment trunk with only one that doubles as a room. If I remember correctly, the room is a single stone room that is threadbare with no commodities. No a bloody penthouse (:

** I forgot what fic I read it in but one had the trunk be sort of a student project, like it was Hogwarts tradition to personalize your trunk so first years start out with a standard trunk and by the end of 7th year it depends on the students creativity how bespelled the trunk ends up.

** I've always personally thought of them as like Newt's trunk, although it would only make sense to own something like that if you had no other properties. That being said, a lot of fics have them easily available to just buy in some random store, which if that was the case everyone would have one. It would be much more reasonable if they were either specialty items custom made, or something Harry makes himself after a lot of research.

As a lot of fics have him immediately buy 1 and then use it for convenience, it seems a bit like a cheap cliche.

*** Indeed, it is a cheap cliche. The fact that it is depicted as easily available is ridiculous. Moody's trunk was an Auror grade trunk and only had one room of extended space and it was threadbare with no commodities. It sounds stupid that trunks available to the general public would outrank the professional ones. Moreover it poses a security problem as you could ward the inside of the trunk or place it under the Fidelius charm and smuggle someone inside sensitive places such as Hogwarts or Gringotts. The most sensible trunks I've read about are the one with only external uses (so unlike Newt's suitcase) and the ones I'm most intrigued about. How does it look, how does it work...

**** I mean the threadbare part was probably because he was being kept there as a prisoner, but anyway.

Canonically, the Undetectable Expansion Charm is used by Hermione to make a handbag into a Bag of Holding, so it can be used at the very least on any sort of bag. It has (as far as we are informed as readers) unlimited space, but no sort of sorting/retrieval system beyond how you put things in. Harry has to Accio out the Essence of Dittany when he needs it, and when the trio escapes from the Burrow Hermione laments the books falling over. Keep in mind, that that handbag survived the trip into and out of Gringotts, no fuss.

Trunks like Moody's and Newt's seem to be much much more rare - they are so insanely useful that literally every witch and wizard SHOULD make it their first priority to acquire, yet for some reason don't. Which is either a case of A: their method of creation has been lost and only a few are left; B: they are so ludicrously expensive to create/buy that most people wouldn't bother; or C: the most likely reason, JKR put it in cause it's neat and magical without considering the consequences.

Which brings me to my final point: JKR is crap at writing her own magic system, or simply doesn't care that she unintentionally creates ludicrous pieces of magic and then never mentions them again, or retcons it into being less useful. Take Veritiserum, for example. Strongest truth serum on the planet, untraceable and flavorless! What's that, why didn't they use it on Sirius when he was first arrested? Just kidding, it's not 100% effective, and there are plenty of ways of resisting it, so it can't be used in court!

So, canonically speaking, it should be possible to Fideleus a trunks existence, fill it with hit wizards, and have an untraceable Trojan Horse situation, but then canon wouldn't happen so you can't do that.

** Putting the tropey trunks with huge enchanted library, time dilation and blood wards aside, I always imagine them as being a portal through another dimension. And I do mean dimension as in a fifth dimension.

Imagine we are 2d people and understand only a 2d level. Now imagine that we are in a layer near the tip of a pyramid. Going into a trunk would be like traveling to a different layer, which we can only understand as a different world whose size doesn't match what we usually know about our world but mostly it's still not that much different. Because if we understood 3 dimensions we would know that it's still the same world essentially.

** Newts trunk got to be ridiculously expensive, only makes sense if you travel A LOT. A trunk that's just twice as large on the inside seems like something every kid with upper middle class parents at Hogwarts would have, because it's useful.

***** It only makes sense. Perhaps the suitcase itself was bought with the charms applied but it contains different habitats and atmospheric charms which can only have been cast by Newt himself (as it was illegal for him to house magical beasts inside).

“The famous Magizoologist Newton Scamander was known to have cast various highly intricate and powerful atmospheric charms in his magically expanded suitcase, which he used to house his various magical creatures, to create weather conditions suitable to the habitats of individual creatures, in order to adequately house them.” -Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay

The expansion and atmospheric spells are only charm after all. Perhaps they are complicated to master but once they are they belong to the witch or wizard's arsenal.

** My uncle had one of those trunks, but the charms broke when he and all his things were inside... They had to bury him in it.

In all seriousness, I hate magical trunks so much. I hope I never have to read through another gratuitous description of Harry's custom expanded manor-trunk ever again.
