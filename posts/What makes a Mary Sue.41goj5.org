Recent topics have made me wonder.

It used to mean a self-insert OC who is "too perfect". I personally used to associate it solely in aspects of relationships: the "perfect partner". However, lately I've seen it used that doesn't fit into either of those categories. I'm not sure what it means for people now, aside from it almost universally being something "bad".

I'm almost finding it to be a pejorative along the lines of "faggot", though far less inflammatory. Is it just a term to refer to a reader's dislike for an aspect of a character that seems too good to be true?

Not sure if I should tag this as NSFW for profanity, but will attempt to just to be safe.


** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue][TvTropes has a very good write up on it]].

I typically consider someone who has too many unique abilities, the ability to constantly flabbergast everyone around them with their brilliance and/or sarcastic wit, and are just generally better than everyone to be one.

** Book Hermione is far from Mary Sue. Apart from her many obvious flaws, even her vaunted intelligence failed her many times: dismissing Draco's ploy in book 6, rejecting the idea of Hogwarts horcrux...

*** That's true, but keep in mind that many fans are very influenced by the movies, where Hermione virtually became a Mary-Sue, who performs the cool actions other characters performed in the books, steals their lines, isn't the least bit annoying as she was originally, and certainly better looking. And thus we get Fanon!Hermione, the next incarnation of Tom Riddle, Bellatrix Lestrange and Dumbledore combined, who pushes the wizarding world forward with her rational use of pens. (Am I the only one who remembers that one time where she went to buy more quills?)

** A Mary Sue/Gary Stu is any character that is essentially perfect. They have no flaws, debilitating or otherwise. Everybody likes them, even when they have reason to dislike them. They have no bad luck, everything goes their way. They are powerful, beautiful, and smart. A Mary Sue can be a character with any of these traits, or all of them.

A Mary Sue is a symptom of an author that simply cannot write conflict, strife, or difficulty to any effective degree.

*** Or their few "flaws" are actually portrayed as positive things and never have any real negative repercussions. A clumsy character is only clumsy in an endearing way- they trip in order to blush and be caught by the love interest, instead of tripping and spilling Flesh Eating Potion on them.

**** Or their 'flaws' are actually awesome things, but the character will whine about them like they're a true hardship. As in, 'Oh, I wish I wasn't so beautiful that every character I meet falls in love with me! How am I ever to choose between Harry, Cedric, Sirius, Remus, Snape, Draco, Lucius, Narcissa, Bellatrix, Tonks, Professor McGonagall /and/ young, hot, misunderstood Tom Riddle? (But not Ron or Voldemort, eww!) Curse my magnetic gorgeousness! Woe is me!' Somehow, the author will expect the reader to sympathize with this. -.-

This isn't true, they often have inconsequential flaws. Like Hermione-Sue and her crooked teeth and bushy hair. However the author will treat these things like they're debilitating, then fix them.

**** So true. I read the first fifty pages of Twilight and saw the the main character was occasionally clumsy at inopportune moments. Other than that she was basically perfect. It's not that they don't have flaws, it's that their imperfections are easily explainable, fixable, or relatable to the reader.

** Mary Sues were a lot more common during the Long Summer fanfics where often you'd read about an OC exchange student from America (where else?) visiting Hogwarts. Naturally this OC student was loved by everyone, was special, with inconsequential negative traits, gave other characters perfect advice, questioned the status quo (i.e. the OC would ask Harry why he has no Slytherin friends) with the consequence that there is a new improved status quo (i.e. Harry and OC are now friends with Slytherin, with no prejudices) and told characters to get together.

These type of characters don't really exist any more, as far as I can tell. But I'm sure many here will recognize a lot of these elements.

How many times have you read a story where Harry or Hermione questioned the status quo in the very first chapter? (Why am I friends with Ron? Why am I not dating Hermione?! Why am I listening to Dumbledore?) or a canon character gives Harry or Hermione this advice. How many stories out there in which Harry and/or Hermione are super special snowflakes (being part-Veela, Lord Hadrian Potter-Black God Emperor of Hogwarts or Super Researcher Hermione creating spells out of her ass) with no notable negative traits.

So while Mary Sue OC fanfics no longer exist, fanfics where canon characters have Mary Sue traits are incredibly common and popular.

*** Yar, it's just does having Mary Sue traits make a canon character one? Or if they have true flaws, issues, aren't well liked, etc., then are they not one even though they have some traits of it?

** This may be an unpopular opinion, but I like reading Mary Sues, especially of the crossover variety. In my mind they've already had their journey, overcame their obstacles, and beaten the big bad. Seeing them win just seems like the payoff for the shit hand they got dealt in their canon.

** I actually disagree with a lot of the definitions in this thread. A lot of Mary Sues are overly perfect, but I don't think that gets to the core of what a Mary Sue is. A Mary Sue is any original character who inserts themselves into the main character's social circle and/or becomes important to the central plot with unjustified ease and speed.

Think about it: a fic featuring an American exchange student who comes to Hogwarts and within a day is already exchanging banter with Harry, Ron and Hermione like they've been friends for years. This character is a Mary Sue even if they're useless at magic.

The essence of a Mary Sue isn't that he or she is perfect, the essence is that they feel like an invader into the story, artificially pushed by the author in a way that feels inorganic and overstates that character's importance.

** I honestly don't see a lot of Mary Sues in HP fanfiction, purely because Harry isn't really universally liked by a lot of people in most stories. I see him overpowered a lot, but as I remember it one of the qualifications of a Mary Sue is that the character has to be liked by a bunch of people. Most OP Harry's has Harry only having a very narrow set of friends, or followers, because *Edge* or something.

*** That's kinda my feeling, too, yet I see a lot of referencing of characters as Mary Sue/Gary Stu that I was curious how it was being used. I feel like other terms are more descriptive (and useful), since the boilerplate Dark!Harry is OP and a loner.
