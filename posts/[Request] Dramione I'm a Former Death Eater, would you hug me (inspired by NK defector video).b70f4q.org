Hi, I just watched this video and thought it would be a perfect premise for a Dramione ff. Basically, Draco tries a social experiment to see who would give him a hug. He's been standing there for a while and people keep passing him by. Some using their muggle cellphone to take pictures. Up to you who gives him a hug first but later, the Golden Trio happens upon him. Harry decides to give him a hug first. Ron may or may not, up to author. Hermione gives him a hug too and after this experiment, Hermione can't stop thinking about Draco.

Watching this video, I was angered by those who took pictures and then just walked on by. Then I thought this would be a perfect idea for a Dramione fic. Thank you!
