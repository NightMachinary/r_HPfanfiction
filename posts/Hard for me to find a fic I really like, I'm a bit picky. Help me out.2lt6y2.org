** It's canon pairings, but the collected works of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] might be to your liking, at least as far as the adult trio bits and staying true to the characters and canon.

** Hmm. Throwing a few out here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6896279/1/We-ll-All-Fall-After-The-Yule-Ball][We'll All Fall After the Yule Ball]] - charming, funny, (drunk!Katie is hilarious), lighthearted, firmly in the series timeline.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3920129/1/Sixth-Year-The-Steps-Toward-The-End][Sixth Year: The Steps Toward the End]] - canon personalities (Ron and Ginny excepted, not completely ooc but it's a stretch), rich character development, firmly in series timeline, drama but not tragedy or horror, Hogwarts-centric.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus][Vitam Paramus]] - post canon, Quidditch-focused, mellow, character-focused, Harry's stoicism firmly in character.

***** That's a very nice write up, of mine and the other nineteen fics. Your criticisms mentioned of SY are pretty common and very fair. Frankly, I'd say there are a few others, but anyway. Thanks again. I'm always happy seeing someone enjoyed my work.

** Anything by ChemProf on ff.net is real good. Stuff can be a little sexual but his stories are pretty fantastic.

*** With the added bonus of several being writted pre-DH (and I think one being written pre-HPB) so you get to experience the way HPfanfic was when we speculated on a lot of things

** I love Must Love Quidditch! Here are a couple of more of my favorite Drarry fics: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6560750/1/The-LipLock-Jinx][The Liplock Jinx]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9771843/1/Kitty-Kitty][Kitty, Kitty]]. Also, I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6119207/1/Obliviation][Obliviation]] and really enjoyed it.
