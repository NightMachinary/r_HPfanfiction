** Draco Malfoy hates muggleborn witches and wizards. Hermione is muggleborn.

*** Every time somebody says that Draco Malfoy isn't that bad and that he couldn't kill people, all I can think is "If the best you can say about a person is that he doesn't have it in him to kill people, then he's probably not a great guy."

*** This. I don't ever think you could ever make a discussion for being attracted to a man who pretty much called you the magical n word for nearly 7 years straight.

Albeit Ron's a huge dolt but he's never been that stupid. (There's probably an argument that he has been)

At the end of the day I like neither of them. /shrug/

** Way too TL;DR. I'll read it later when I have time.

I'll just say this: even with its flaws, R/Hr wins hands down. I don't see how any one sensible can say that Dramione works better than R/Hr.

*** Like Zeelthor said, people have an appeal for the bad boy. It's personal preference.

I don't think people realise that something as awesome as that just isn't compatible with someone like Hermione. They think the bad boys appeal to EVERYONE.

thats my 2 cents.

** I totally get the appeal of the bad boy. But let's get this straight once and for all. Malfoy ain't Spike from Buffy the vampire slayer.

Hell, he ain't even Damon from Vampire Diaries. He's a cowardly, snivelling little racist and turning him into anything but that is a severe breach of his character.

Ron has several moments of immature behaviour in the series, sure, and he's often annoying. That said, he's got balls. He stands up to a convicted mass murderer at age thirteen. At age seventeen or eighteen he stands up to Voldemort.

Consider that, his moments of immaturity, the good and the bad, and ask yourself if you were really any better at that age?

Can Malfoy be redeemed? Possibly. It would take a good author and a lot of time and, more than anything, a good motivation. Somebody he cares about more than himself. Barring siblings, I just can't see that happening.

*** YESSSSSSSS. This so much.

I think people have been conditioned to look for the bad boy in every story that involves romance, and since Voldemort is half a reptile and 73 years old, Malfoy was the only option. But the appeal of the bad boy is that he is confident and doesn't care what people think (or something), whereas Malfoy's most defining quality is that he is completely spineless. I really blame Tom Felton for making Malfoy appear to be anything close to a fully functioning human being.

D/Hr is one of those pairing that is so nonsensical that to make it work you'd have to completely change the characters' personalities, in which case you're better off just writing an OC.

** I didn't get past the first persons reasoning, but it sounded like dragging a lot of headcanon and fanon into the argument. In fanfiction you can make anything work. To make Dramione work you'd have to write a character arc for Draco to show that he changed his prejudice (as far as canon is concerned he didn't want to be a death eater, but for all we know he may think killing is wrong but muggleborns are still beneath him or maybe he was just scared of Voldemort) Whereas Ronmione is canon so you don't have to rewrite history to make them work.

*** You dont have to, it actually gets kind of worse.

To try and summarise everything that went on in this wall of text past what peter said,

The dramione shippers ship them becuase of personal preference and how draco wasnt a complete asshole and all the romione shippers said,

Well hey JK ROWLING said ron and hermione are together so they are together and also draco sucks.

Omg its worth pointing out one guy said that hermoinies whole family and friends would disown her if she dated malfoy.

** I still struggle with the idea that anyone mentions Dramione without making a joke, but assuming those people exist, my response is this:

The modern (muggle) Draco is the guy at school who is the coolest guy in a very not cool group of friends and can't understand why /everyone/ doesn't think he's cool, but knows that it's everyone else's fault. He goes to parties and says slimy/offensive things to girls as "pick-up lines", calls them a slut because they don't think he's amazing, calls random girls sluts on the internet (anonymously), before finally settling in to masturbate to some violent pornography.

He's learned to keep his racism and homophobia to his group of friends, but not his transphobia because he can still sort of get away with it.

The movies covered up his enormous character flaws somewhat with a pretty Tom Felton shaped mask, which I choose to believe (to protect my rather erratic faith in mankind) is the only reason we're having this discussion.

While I don't believe Ron and Hermione are very well suited to each other, their relationship exists within the world of Things That Can Actually Fucking Happen.

Now, if I ever have to type the word 'Dramione' again, I'll kill every last fucking one of you. Have a good night xx

** While I don't prefer R/Hr, it's plausible and I can see it happening. Can't say the same for D/Hr. The problem with D/Hr is that, in order for the pairing to work, you have to 1) significantly distort Hermione's canon personality to fit Malfoy's, 2) significantly distort Draco's canon personality to fit Hermione's, or 3) do both. All three cases result in bad writing that is not consistent with the canon characterizations.

** Look, I'm not a huge fan of R/Hr, but at least it's plausible. D/Hr, on the other hand, is on a whole other level of retarded. They hate each other's guts, full stop, and no amount of "Draco in Leather Pants"ing can fix that. It's fine if that's your thing in fanfiction, but don't try bringing it into canon because it's as likely to happen as Bellatrix suddenly declaring undying love for Harry.

To have an argument that long over which one of these pairings makes more sense is stupid.

One thing I do want to say though is the crux of the majority of these debates always comes down to "DRACO WOULD HAVE CHANGED AS HE GOT OLDER" and "RON IS A STUPID IMMATURE BOY" as if it's less likely that Ron would mature than Draco just dropping long rooted prejudices.

*** Ironically, I was initally pro-dramionie, but I now think Ron and Hermione would be more compatible after the debate and some thought.

As for very few people changing their opinion for what you say, part of that comes from the fact most people online will just mock you for being retarded based on your beliefs. Just look at some of the comments here. Nobody likes to be called a retard or something, and we definitely don't want to be proved wrong by that rude person.

I think if people weren't so derogatory when having debates, then debates would actually be more successful, I'm living proof of this. However some people will just stick to what they believe no matter what.
