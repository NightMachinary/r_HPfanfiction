So, I've seen a few different concepts that have purebloods getting the leg up by being able to do magic during the summer despite the trace. Only two really come to mind and wanted to know what y'all thought of them since I'm considering doing this in my first (and probably only) fanfic.

First, the old magical homes are so heavily magical/warded that the Ministry can't tell if it was from the underage wizard or the parents, family, etc. Could even extend to places like Diagon Alley.

Secondly, the parents' just have to fill out a form stating that they'll be tutoring said child during the summer and get the trace lifted, like it is for Hogwarts/Hogwarts Express.

I wanted Harry to learn ahead during the summer and not sure if I should just have him discover that say the Weasley's home, fits the 1st option but the Molly and Arthur just hide it from the kids. Which seems unlikely. I can't/don't want to do it the second way.

Which also leaves a third option, that the trace is tied to the wand and there's no getting around it for that particular wand at least.


** the trace seems to be a fairly big inconsistency within HP. In book 2 it seemed like its managed by household (Dobby doing magic within Harry's residence set the trace off, as Harry was the only magical within the area), while in Book 7, they were concerned about being tracked by the trace, which suggested that it was by wand. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never managed to wrap my head around how it works.

**** I just re-read that section in book 6. Morfin's wand was shown to have killed the family, though that doesn't explain why Morfin isn't able to remember anything, but the his memory showed that he was drunk and staggering already. Perhaps he really did pass out and Riddle took the opportunity to frame him. After all, Riddle had only just found out about the Muggles when Morfin told him that he looked like Riddle Sr., the man that his sister had run off with.

That suggests the trace is linked more so to the wand...

Edit: And a few sentences further, totally debunked...

It can't tell the difference between spells cast by the Traced wizard and other wizards in the monitoring vicinity. Therefore, where a magical child lives with magical adults, their Trace is constantly going off as the adults use magic in their vicinity, and so the Ministry just ignores it.

** From Chapter Seventeen of Half Blood Prince:

/"But how come the Ministry didn't realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?" Harry asked angrily. "He was underage at the time, wasn't he? I thought they could detect underage magic!"/

/"You are quite right - they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by - "/

/"Dobby," growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. "So if you're underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?"/

/"They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic," said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry's face. "They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obedience while within their walls."/

From Chapter Four of Deathly Hallows:

/"The Trace, the Trace!" said Mad-Eye impatiently. "The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know it, and so will the Death Eaters."/

It's confusing because it's certainly irregular, but this is relatively explicit. The Trace detects magic around under-seventeens, but doesn't detect the perpetrator. The Trace is apparently not on wands as it also detects house-elf magic and spells cast by "anyone around you".

*** They knew it was a hover charm in Harry's second year. So when Riddle goes to Morfin and then uses the Killing Curse 3 times and possibly an Obliviate, it should show the spells and there would still be the question of who the underage wizard/witch was to cause it to be recorded. It really doesn't make any sense. It must also give the location of the spell which was actually the Riddle Sr.'s place...so why would they suspect Morfin, an adult wizard who shouldn't have had the trace on him...

Edit: Anyway, I guess it's canon that as long as it's a magical enough area, the Ministry can't tell who cast the spell. Good enough for me and my plot.

** Some things to consider:

Hermione apparently managed to cast some spells, allegedly successfully no less, before getting on the train to go off to first year. Is this because the trace is applied at Hogwarts? Is enforcement just incredibly spotty? Does Hermione unknowingly live a house down from an adult witch that the ministry assumed was responsible? Also, given her opinion of rules at that point in her life, it's likely no one told her not to. Did they just assume a muggleborn witch learning how to cast spells without being taught how to wave the wand correctly was preposterous?

Say you were a witch working for the Wizengamot back when the statute of secrecy was first being implemented and the MoM was coming into existence to enforce it. What is your goal with setting up the trace? How would you setup your spell-work to achieve it?

*** From the Harry Potter Wikia:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione casts the Oculus Reparo spell on Harry's glasses in the former while aboard the Hogwarts Express and in the latter in public in Diagon Alley (the second use does not occur in the novel, with an older character casting the spell). In neither case is it indicated that Hermione is warned or punished. It is possible the Trace (in the film continuity) does not apply to magic use on the train - which could be seen as an extension of the school - or in the "Muggle-free" environment of Diagon Alley.
#+end_quote

So there is some precedent for overly magical areas, or at least muggle free areas. I would think the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery would then be aimed at preventing muggles from discovering magic through careless teens/preteens waving their wands about...The Weasley's do live close to a muggle village, but they have a hidden quidditch pitch they can use as long as they don't fly too high, so kind of wish washy....it's stated that their house looked magical or looks like it couldn't stand without magic so I think it must be hidden from the muggles somehow.

*** You're missing a possibility: the Trace applies before Hogwarts, and the enforcement is good, but pre-Hogwarts magic is not against the law. It's a loophole: the Reasonable Restriction on Underage Sorcery does not apply from birth, it applies from the end of your first year at Hogwarts (when they are told not to use magic outside of school for the first time).

Another possibility: pre-Hogwarts magic is illegal, and the Trace can and does detect it, but they assume that it's accidental magic, not deliberate.

**** We know it's possible to homeschool your kids in magic instead of sending them to Hogwarts (except in 1998), so the whole Restriction of Underage Magic-Law might be more of a 'school policy' that doesn't come into effect if you are not attending the only school they have.

So either the Trace is cast on you sometimes in Hogwarts. ( Chamber the first-years have to wait in before the sorting?)

Or there is a way to apply for a removal, which sounds like a lot of extra work.

******** I agree with the idea of the Trace being centralized versus be applied individually to people/wands. Logistically, applying the Trace individually seems like a lot of work. In a separate reply in this thread I suggest that the Knight Bus gives us good evidence that there are centralized charms with the ability to screen the whole population for specific qualities, actions and intents. See ch. 24 of Order of the Phoenix: the bus responds to Lupin simply raising his wand with the intention of summoning the bus. So the bus has a charm that is able to identify a quality (wizard), action (wand raised) and intention (need for transportation or the Knight bus specifically).

I doubt every wizard/witch/wand has a Knight-Bus-Summoning Charm on it. So if the public transportation has a charm that is able to make such a specific identification certainly the much more important Trace could operate the same way. Combine this with the fact the magic can identify subjective attributes such age, bravery, etc then no spell need be physically cast on individuals, because the Ministry can spy on your subjectives.

** I think it would be nice to make it so the trace is unbeatable by anyone. No pure blood privilege, no wards, etc etc.

I always thought a ministry summer camp/class should be a thing. Maybe that would work? It feels like it would be a good way that would make sense, and not have an 11 year old either A)Figure out how to conquer the trace, or B) Be just another story where there is a paragraph on how Purebloods have an advantage and how unfair that is, but as soon as the heroes figure it out they don't share the knowledge making them just as bad.

If they are a bit older (15 or so) then maybe a summer job where the ministry pre-approves spells while at work, for a summer job.

Edit: If you are dead set on Harry having super secret training in the summer then you could have just go to a different country where the laws are more lenient.

But, I'd kind of like for him to be a little more bookish. I just read again the first couple of chapters of GoF and once on the train Harry & Ron get in on Quidditch. Hermione then pulls out the standard book of spells year 4 and starts attempting the Accio spell. I'd like for Harry to be right there with her.

** In cannon there is a unnamed charm (not the Trace) that were are told affects EVERY wizard, that is, whatever charm the Knight bus uses to identify it's riders. It is very clear in cannon, all a wizard has to do is raise their wand up in their hand. Now I think we can agree that the charm isn't individually applied to every person or their wand. That's ridiculous. So the charm the bus uses must be able take a preset definition of their "rider" and the magic identifies those who match. Likely, the charm goes beyond the physical definition (wizard/witch with wand up) but also filters for intention: need for transportation, need to leave. Harry accidentally summons the Knight Bus in PoA when he is frightened by Sirius in Animagus form (accidentally raises wand, has intent/need to get the heck out of there). Consider that the HP verse magic that seems to be able to identify/filter the subjective: point-me spell identifying the desired target, magic hat sorting children or identifying bravery in action, wards interpreting intent, love as a literal power, curse on a teaching position, etc. So if we take what abilities the Knight Bus' charm has, a charm dedicated to a lesser task than preventing muggles learning about magic, it would certainly be possible that the Trace is not cast on any individual or wand. In essence it would be a subjective filter or search engine that covers the whole country that identifies 1. magic around underage wizard/witch 2. wizard/witch is aware of the magical world 3. The wizard/witch is in a non-magic location 4. or in the presence of muggles without knowledge of magic. There is also the fact that the Trace notice that Harry gets has his name and the charm listed. We have the example of the Marauders' Map. It displays the name of everyone in Hogwarts without a spell being directly cast on them. The Trace could likely do the same.

Now this has some holes just like any other explanation. First that comes to mind is if the Trace is so universal why are similar charms not used for other purposes. A charm could be designed to screen for wizards/witches performing an unforgivable. Aurors get a ping on the search, get the coordinates and then pop on over to stop whatever is going on. Maybe the charm is capable of this but the society/wizengomet is unwilling to put themselves under scrutiny.

Those are my thoughts.

**** The existence of the charm is only inferred, never directly mentioned. Qoute from ch. 24 of Order of the Phoenix "Lupin flung out his right arm. BANG. A violently purple triple-decker bus had appeared out of the air in front of them"

With that quote, and Harry's accidental summoning of the bus in PoA I am comfortable saying that the bus uses a very broad detection charm that identifies a certain wand motion + intent. There must be some connection between the rider and the bus. Either the whole population of riders (or wands) has a charm on them that signals to the bus or the bus has a charm that identifies riders out of the whole population.

**** It's possible that a house elf hears someone calling them due to a individual charm applied to the person, or maybe it's something unique about elf magic. Their magic system is definitely different: no wands or spoken words.

To bring it back to the origin of this thread, the Knight Bus provides a good example of a detection charm that is very powerful (looks for wand movement + intent throughout a whole population). If such a charm exists for a bus, the Trace could be a similar but even more complicated and accurate charm. If the Trace functioned like the bus it would not be necessary a 'trace' to be put on anyone or any wand because it is more of a broad net over the country.

** I think the trace is on the wand. I just think the ministry's really lenient about the rule, and only intervene when the child risks exposing the magical world to muggles or uses magic too often. So a hover charm on a cake in a muggle home in front of muggles would get attention, but maybe the same charm in the Weasley home would be ignored. They give out the warning to everyone and enforce it somewhat to deter the kids from using magic too often and avoid risking it being exposed, but they're not going to send out letters for every lumos. But I think they'd take notice if Harry started training and using a lot of spells and do something about it.

That being said, if the trace is on the wand and not on the underage wizard's body, they could get around it by using the wand of an of-age witch/wizard. So if Harry discovered his father's wand in a vault and didn't tell anyone, he'd have a traceless wand. (it's been a while since I read the actual books so you'd have to check if that is plausible.)
