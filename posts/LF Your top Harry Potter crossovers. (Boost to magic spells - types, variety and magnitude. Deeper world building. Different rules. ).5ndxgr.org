Share your favorite crossovers that combine the best of the Harry Potter universe (characters, magic and lore) with a more fleshed out worlds with alternative magic/energy systems, preferably from games and anime.

( To me, Harry Potter heavily relied on the story and your need to know what would happen next, the emotions and character building. However, details on how magic works, or how the magical world is organized, have always been kept vague and kind of left in the background, limited when it comes to explanations or a unified system. You learned about the world while the main character was experiencing it and that restricted it to Harry's POV, which is quite lacking when it comes to a getting a complete picture. So in a sense, the Harry Potter verse is a sandbox with lots of holes and a vague outline that lends itself to a lot of expansion.

Magic in the Potterverse was never quite up to par for me, especially when it comes to it's variety in combat. Avada Kedavra's very existence, a beam of green light traveling in a straight line that drops you dead, being the trump card and unstoppable shows you how lacking the wizarding world is when it comes to magic, especially since Lily's sacrifice was described as ancient and long forgotten magic. It's kind of a letdown that that the killing curse is the most infamous and feared one, especially since it is so casually used by a band of terrorists. It's just that magic in the Harry Potter universe doesn't really fit very well with the concept of awe when it comes to power and presence, as well as the ability to alter reality to your whim is severely underplayed. It's like getting a new game, but barely touching the surface of what it's truly about, because of your own inability to learn the rules how to play. )

So I guess where I'm going with this is. I'm looking for fics in which the lore of the Potterverse is mutually combined and enriched by that of a game or anime. Elements of or from Harry's world get mixed with those from another one. It could for example be remnants from the Elder Scrolls universe, or The Witcher, remaining as ruins and old texts. It could be that elements of one world (Bleach's Soul Society, Diablo's Hell, or TES' Oblivion ) are just on another plane of existence and rare to come across. It could have something to do with Portals being used to separate part of the magical society in a different dimension, or just a long distance away on another planet ( Negima, Stargate, Warcraft nether).

TLDR: Simply put, I'm looking for longer crossovers in which one world rediscovers the existence of another, whether it was only remnants of it from the past, or a clash of cultures, outright war or just exchange of knowledge in the present, or maybe even a few people going into the future. The important part is enriching the repertoire of magic available, expanding the worlds to include parts of each other when it comes to lore and creatures, races. Just bring up Harry Potter world magic and lore to the magnitude and complexity of stuff like the Narutoverse (handseals, seals, elements), Nasuverse, Warcraft, Witcher, Starcraft, Elder Scrolls, Avatar, Mass Effect.


** It's interesting what you consider deeper world building.

The issue for me, when it comes to worldbuilding, is this: the real world is enormously complex, and only partially understood. The efforts we have made to understand it are incomplete, incredibly complicated, and sometimes contradictory. The complexity of the real world is such that no person could have invented even 1% of it even if they were a genius who devoted their entire life to it.

For this reason I find most fantasy worlds incredibly shallow. Fantasy worlds which have a magical system which can be summarised to the reader in a few paragraphs, in which everything is understood and neatly ties up, where the systems are all perfectly logical and comprehensive... these worlds feel empty to me. They absolutely pale in comparison to the glorious complexity of the real world, and the way that certain people in fantasy worlds understand the nature of the world in a fairly complete way similarly pales in comparison to the complicated mess of real life investigation of the world around us.

For me, any world in which one person - or the reader - can understand magic is a world that is too simple to feel deep/realistic.

Enter Harry Potter. To me, HP feels among the deepest of fantasy worlds for the precise reason that it alludes to the existence of explanations rather than explains itself. We know that there are books on magical theory, we know there's Hogwarts library, we know that there's a Department of Mysteries... all of this points towards a complex mess of human activity in attempting to understand magic in a analogous way to real life academic/scientific investigation. Like real life, those investigations seem to be partial, contradictory, divided into distinct and irreconcilable branches of study, and used for different purposes. To me this gives a greater sense of depth than any 2-page explanation of "here's how magic works" like you get in, say, the Mistborn trilogy.

Edit: incidentally, you have misunderstood the nature of the magic of Lily's sacrifice, replicated by Harry in DH. When it is referred to as "ancient magic" it doesn't mean that it's a piece of magic that someone invented a long time ago. It means that it's a piece of magic that is fundamental to the world. See, for example, the magic in dragon hide protecting them from spells also described as "ancient magic". Lily didn't cast any spell to activate the protection. She simply gave her life under the right set of conditions, which created the magic simply through her actions. It was also not forgotten magic. Voldemort knew of it, he confirms as much in GoF. It's just that he failed to consider it because he always underestimates such types of magic.

Personally I like it that some of the most powerful magic in HP is visually subtle and understated. It feels... efficient. Like, huge firestorms and other "big" magic seems rather Lockhart-ish. Flashy but kinda silly, because if you're trying to beat another person in a duel, you don't need spells that level city blocks, you need spells that penetrate a single person's defences.

I leave you with the following quote:

  Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.

*** I would imagine that some of the more subtly flashy magic could be just as interesting. a powerful wizard (like harry/voldemort/snape/dumbledore) using a powerful lightning spell to decimate a group (like death munchers/aurors/whatever you call a member of the ootp). a replica of thieves downfall in the ministry/azkaban. that giant ward you saw in the movie that disintegrated death munchers until deaths bitch decided to spend three hours pretending to be an uchiha. mental communication. transfiguring the earth into spikes surrounding that one guy who you just can't hit, maybe adding spikes to the spikes for good measure. flesh out the castle's wierd moving. explore the magic that exists and the theory behind it. wall opening for diagon alley creates even more awe than summoning the moon to crush your enemies before putting it back so you can give everybody a wet dream(unless that was a /really/ good dream).

flashy does not mean fire and explosions, flashy is the billowing cape that looks bnadass but makes no sense, flashy is that gleam in the smile that with the light behind the head of the one smiling, flashy is bright light and subsequent falling unconscious of an army. flashy does not have to be loud, flashy has to be awesome. the entrance to platform 9 and 3/4 is flashier than any reducto or confringo. the patronus is loud and flashy but makes sense all the same and spells like it are definitely better plot elements that time turners and +brain tentacle monster mind rape+ actually nevermind brain tentacle monster mind rape the an exploration of the effects thereof could have been awesome. an explanation for why people even bother to use a disemboweling curse when avada kedavera kills easier would be beautifully flashy.

Of course, characters like the joker and deidara will always have a special place in my heart.

** Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. Ongoing, with currently iregular updates.
