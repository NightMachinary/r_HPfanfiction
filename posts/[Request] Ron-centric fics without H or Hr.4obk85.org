To elaborate on the title, I'd like fics where Ron is the focus but Harry and Hermione are minimal characters at most.

Stories where they are also /not/ friends would be preferred -- but I understand that this second request would narrow an already small field, so it's not a strict requirement.

Fics of any length welcome, as are both finished and unfinished works.


** linkffn(Invisible Circus by Sceneii) is your best bet. Ron joins the pureblood faction as a spy, which necessitates cutting ties with Harry and Hermione.

  Ron knows what he's fighting for, even if no one else does. Now complete!

** Choices is good linkffn(7467796). It has a seer Ron who is sorted into Slytherin, he has a different set of friends in Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass (my favourite interpretations of them actually). Harry and Hermione are still around and it might turn into a R/H pairing yet but the final pairings haven't been decided yet.

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. 2nd chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

*** This one has quite the unique premise. And the author really got me with this line: /"He was going to be murdered overnight, and for the rest of the year."/ I fear you may have turned me into a Slytherin!Ron addict. My thanks for the recommend.

** Linkffn(stay standing by windschild8178)

For the first 20 or so chapters of this fic Ron is on his own. There's more H and Hr involvement later but still very Ron centric and a good read.

*** I fully admit that I wasn't expecting a fic like this. It hits home in a lot of ways, and I really appreciate the introspective nature of the writing. Thank you for introducing me to this one.
