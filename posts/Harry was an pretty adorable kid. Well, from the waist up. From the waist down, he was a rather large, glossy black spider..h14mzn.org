Hagrid had stars in his eyes when he first met Harry, as opposed to the horrified tears in Ron's. The novelty of either Harry's species or simply the novelty of an eleven year old standing as tall as he did excited him, or though Harry heard Hagrid muttering about someone called Aragog enjoying a playmate.

Harry idly considered how his new life at the school would be. He wondered if his lower half would fit through the doorways at Hogwarts. If not, he'd just hope the windows were large enough to crawl through. He could at least count on such a large castle having vast enough spaces to build a web in. Harry did consider that eating the students would be a rather bad idea. Perhaps the staff wouldn't mind if the students were to unwillingly part with their pets. Harry would firgure it out later.

(Half-spider harry... Spider-centaur Harry... Arachnotaur Harry. Whatever the hell you call it.)

*** "I never knew James had such tastes in women," Dumbledore said.

"Yeah, you'd think the flaming, gaping maw of a spider would be a deal breaker," noted Remus. Sirius felt the need to defend his fellow marauder.

"Hey the top half isn't so bad!" he said.

"I wouldn't say 'half' considering the fact that her human bits are way smaller than the rest of her," Remus shot back. Sirius would have protested more if Remus hadn't reminded him of something that had been bothering him.

"Speaking of 'human bits,' where did james put his-"

"I do not believe we should be speaking on this matter any longer," Dumbledore interjected.

"Aw, why? I'm just curious," Sirius said. Dumbledore gravely stated that-

"James's wife is right behind us."
