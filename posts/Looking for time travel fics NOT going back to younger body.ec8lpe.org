I'm always searching for time travel fics on ao3 and ff.net and finding mostly fics about the characters going back to their younger bodies. I'm not interested in that at all. I'm just wondering if anyone can recommended any fic where any character goes back in time as is, preferably to a time that the books cover, although I'm fine with other time periods too. Honestly, I'm not even looking for good fics, they can be terrible I don't mind. They're just hard to find, that's all.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1978

  Hermione Granger doesn't know why she was sent back to 1992, but she's not going to waste this second chance. Even the Chosen One needs some responsible adults on his side. After all, Harry may not know it, but he's Hermione's best friend. As she takes up the DADA post, "Jean Watson" is not going to let anything happen to him-or any of her friends for that matter.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Linkffn(shiny and blue) is a pretty great time travel fic if you don't mind slash pairings. It does all those fun things that time travel fics can do by making the traveller accidentally cause their own future.

Also there's another fic I found ages ago that's not really time travel, but dimension hopping - Harry from canon does Harry from canon things, spends a few years post-DH doing canon compliant stuff, but then gets summoned to an AU where his counterpart is like, 15. Canon!Harry ends up teaching Divination at AU!Hogwarts under a new identity. Not sure if it's complete, it was unfinished when I read it, and I can't remember it's name. Hoping someone will recognise and link it because it kinda scratches the same itch.

And I know the dimension hopping/parallel universe one you're talking about! I read it too, and likewise can't remember what it's called, but it's been on my mind ever since I read it. If anyone knows what it is I would like to read it again!

** This is my guilty pleasure :D Some of these time travel fics are great... and some are pretty awful. (169 is probably the best of the bunch.... and I couldn't finish All the Wrong Choices because creepy/cringey Riddle is creepy/cringey.) Some of these have a... snap back? to their proper time period, though it isn't always permanent. And it's debatable if Galleons is actually time travel.

Enjoy! lol

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

When she's rocketed back in time by Voldemort, she realises just why he knew her so well in the 1990s - it was because he'd known her very well indeed, as Tom Marvolo Riddle, in an entirely different time. She had to go back because she'd been there. But will she stay?Time-travel Tomione epic, re-upload. Complete.

  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around.

  In an effort to escape her captors, Hermione Granger attempts to go back in time two hours. However, she ends up in 1977, confused and alone. How will she navigate the past when she knows the future? Can she sit idly by and watch those she begins to consider friends succumb to their horrible fates? Timelines are tricky things.

During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.
