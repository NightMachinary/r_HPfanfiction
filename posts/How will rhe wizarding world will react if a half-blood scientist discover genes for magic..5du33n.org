** Considering Umbridge was accusing Muggleborns of stealing magic just for being born with it, if the genes are discovered (stolen!) and can be awakened in ordinary people (they're killing magic! sacrilege! die muggle scum!), then probably the backwards (noble!) inbred (of pure blood!) magical society would reconsider their stance (they breached the stature! obliviate them! what are computorz? kill all their mad barbaric scientists!).

Seriously though, I'm not sure they would even notice at first until the news is widespread. After that some wizards with firmly rooted beliefs will mess everything up and display the common lack of sense magic induces.

** They'd ignore it, for the most part. It doesn't fit in their worldview. They might laugh about it occasionally.

Discovering the gene isn't the huge part. Engineering a retrovirus to add it to anyone exposed, that's quite interesting. Or genetic manipulation of embryos. The general idea of quickly increasing the number of people who can use magic, by means of SCIENCE!

And once that happens, chaos ensues.

Let's say I package that retrovirus as a disease that spreads quickly and doesn't have a huge effect on a person's health. (This isn't impossible by any means, but it might be tricky to make it durable, so the payload doesn't mutate, and reasonably infectious, but not harmful.) It /might/ be the case that everyone who's infected suddenly can use magic...or it might not affect them if they're adults, but twelve years in the future, all children will be able to use it.

Who will teach all these kids?

Where will they get wands?

Who will deal with accidental magic reversal?

Five generations on, when this is all sorted, the world would be better off -- magic is better at solving certain problems, and you need less equipment to solve a diverse array of problems. But it would be a tumultuous transition.

*** 1) For me it can be used with engeniering embryos.

2) I agree with you too much wizard will be the complete chaos. But if the technology is controlled, maybe the wizard could increase their number by 10% in 10 years.

3) this discussion is a way the confront magic with new science. How will this science influence the wizard .

** As [[/u/Satanniel]] has said, magical ability in the Harry Potter universe has an inherited component. Given that Rowling doesn't seem to know much about science, I'd guess that the reader is free to make up whatever rules for inheritance patterns they like.

Your question is certainly [[http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-tested-in-a-person-for-the-first-time-1.20988][topical]], but I've found that any story involving a potential Muggle/wizard conflict is a lightning rod for controversy. Readers have /very/ strong opinions on who would win and are loath to change their minds or listen to differing opinions without the whole discussion turning into a shitshow.

The biggest obstacle I could see would involve the discovery itself. Your scientist would need to study a population in order to collect enough data. Obtaining a large enough sample to definitively state that you've discovered the alleles for magical ability would be rather difficult and I could easily see how any such research would potentially violate the International Statue of Secrecy. This type of research isn't cheap and any results would need to be reviewed by others in the field before being accepted. So, who would fund it, why would they do so, and who benefits from any resulting patents?

Also, what does the discovered allele code for? Is it a component in cell membranes? An extracellular enzyme? In order for your story to distinguish itself, I think you'd need to be rather specific.

Even if such a thing would be possible, I can't imagine that the discovery would be widespread among Muggle circles, thus enabling wizards to easily contain the knowledge if it ever reached their ears.

*** So I thought about this when I was sleeping.

1) What I found interesting is the political debate among wizard only about that. Sur their will be faction. Like the one that think it should be destroy, the one who think it should be wisely use and the one who think it should be widely use. And because we talking about wizard, th S debate should be rather intense, enven leading in act of terrorism.

2) one or more allele enconding for an membranic enzyme, that enable the use of magic. I my point of view the power of the wizard is linked to other genes and epigenetic , like the one that make a normal person more susccesful than an other.

3) this study is conduct by a wizard that choose to have study after hogwart in biology. And to conduct his study he will break the law, not much. For the money let's say his family is rich.

Ps: yes CRISPR-cas9 is magical !

*** Yah but their is an other thing to be considered:

1) muggle world is increasing, demographically, technologically. Wizard world otherwise are scattered and seems locked in the past century

2) their is a scientist wizard that discover magic genes, and proposes to use this discovery wisely to increase slightly the number of wizard by transferring it in some muggle. So he will create muggle born.

3) He decided to reveal this strategy to the wizarding world, because he think that he can't take this decision alone. So their is a political debate in the wizarding world to know if the wizard should increase their number or not.

4) Of course muggle don't know about this discovery and will never know because wizard will obligate them.

**** Wizards aren't "stuck in the past" ffs. How soon do you see muggles developing teleportation, matter manipulation or time travel?

I hate that this belief is so widespread in the fandom just because wizards don't have TV or [insert your favorite band].

***** I agree. Wizards don't have electronics or lunar rovers or nuclear reactors because they don't /need/ those things. Muggles developed those things because they served a purpose. Cultural development went down another path in the magical world because of differing priorities.

Why develop TNT when you can pretty much blow up whatever you like with a casual wave of your wand? I'd think it would be more practical to research ways to make the magical explosion bigger/more efficient/less dangerous rather than finding some completely mundane method of doing it. Why research medical treatment to reconstruct shattered bones when you can just vanish and regrow them overnight? Magical people don't /need/ science the way muggles do, so of course there are facets they ignore.

Still, with things like being parselmouth seemingly being inherited through some manner connected to souls, you could have magic inherited in the same way. And it would be much better option.
