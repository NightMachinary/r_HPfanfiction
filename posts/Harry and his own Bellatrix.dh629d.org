Recently I started reading Harry Potter and the Accidental Horrocrux and i liked it a lot, for those of you that didnt know about it, basically is a Dark Slytherin!Harry story when the piece of VoldemortÂ´s soul in his scar gets sentient and start to communicate with Harry and influence him.

And one little thing i found interesting and funny was Daphne Greengrass characterization in there: At first she seems a typical pureblood girl, kind of like Pansy but less anoying... At least until Harry brokes Malfoy with accidental Magic. Then she gets a very morbid crush on him.

Voldemort even compares her behavior with the obssesive crazy way Bellatrix acted around him.

I wanted to know if you know simmilar fanfics. Like:

-Stories with a Dark!Harry getting some crazy girl/s obssesively following/working for him to try to gain his love.

-Stories with the typical good natured Harry suddenly getting some crazy obssesive fangirl/s. (Which kinda already happened in canon with the girls trying to get him to drink love potions).

-Can be or not a Yandere.

But for both cases, only fics where the relationships with the girl or girls are a major element in the story. Like Harry actually being shipped with the girl or girls.

*** Ginny is nowhere Bellatrix level when it comes to fear factor or ability (which makes people fear her). Bellatrix is the only Death Eater who turns out to be dangerous (killing Sirius, torturing Hermione, the 1 vs 3 duel at the end). Ginny is known for her bat-bogey hex.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to read a fic where Ginny gets the right-hand or brutal enforcer role, but canon Ginny is not that person.

**** Canon Ginny is not old enough yet, and I highly doubt Bellatrix was one crazy sadistic psycho at 16 (Ginny's age at Battle of Hogwarts) either. They all need time and circumstances to grow in that role.

Ginny in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), is definitely bloodthirsty, and has a penchant for torturing and looting her enemies.

She's absolutely Harry's brutal, fanatic, and violent enforcer in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971).

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
