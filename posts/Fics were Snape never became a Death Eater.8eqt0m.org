  *Edit*: 'where', not 'were'. Oops.

I've gotten into 'discussions' before with a friend on Snape, and thing that kinda came out of that for me was 'who else could he have become'? Whether he accidentally drives Lily away (or whether or not he manages to fix it if he does), or decides neither side are palatable and leaves the mess behind by leaving England when he graduates, or something else: What fics do you know of where Snape never became a Death Eater, where he took a different path?


** "Stages of Hope". In the AU, Snape and Sirius are best friends, both were sorted into Slytherin, and through Lily, made friends with Gryffindors.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Leaky Cauldron.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
