:END:
I read this story forever ago and just thought about it again. I don't know the title or the author. Ron and ginny hate Harry and Hermione because they think that they cheated together after the war, they sever all ties. Then ginny starts managing a quidditch team that Harry is on. Harry has night terrors that make him destroy things in his sleep. If anyone knows a story like this please let me know, I'm going crazy trying to find it!!!!!
