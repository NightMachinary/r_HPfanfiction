Rather he's escapes or freed earlier then in canon, escapes or freed later then in canon, or never sent to Azkaban to begin with is fine.

No Weasley Bashing.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. (Doesn't have to focus on pairings).

NO OP Harry, No Harem Harry No Lord Potter Stories, no Kid Politics.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** I'm currently writing a fic in which Sirius's mother and grandfather get him out of Azkaban and get him a trial. I'm only 4 chapters in at the moment but I'm expecting it to be about 20 or so.

** Hi! I'm currently writing an OoTP AU where Sirius's mother, Regulus, and his grandfather are all alive and living in grimmauld place when he goes to claim it for the order. He escapes here around the same time as canon, so I hope that's what you're looking for! Feel free to check it out!

** Does Harry being a dragon for comedy reasons count as an OP Harry?

linkffn(13230340) Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay. Pettigrew gets discovered during second year because of a pair of prankster twins (not the Weasleys!) discovering a rat reading advanced literature. This then leads to Sirius Black being freed.

linkao3(13760487) The Dogfather. 4-chapter fic with Sirius/Remus shipping. The Dursleys, instead of taking Harry in, hand Harry to foster care. Sirius breaks out pretty much immediately after getting put in Azkaban.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
