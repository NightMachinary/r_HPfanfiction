Three of my weapons would be portkeying mandrakes and basilisks as antipersonnel weapons and fiendfyre as antimateriel if my magical would be in little danger of being harmed.

Customizing Armour for my elite mundane soldiers and pimping the weaponry Would also be done(cooling charms on barrels, silencing spells on barrels, bottomless magazines, and so on).


** Polyjuice, invisibility cloak, and the imperius curse.

When you can control the other side then you control the war.

** Depends on the objective and rules of engagement. Like, there's no point in preparing a defensive order of battle when my task is assaulting Hogwarts. Also, what kind of legal framework are we talking about. Am I bound by restrictions about biological/chemical warfare or is it a WWI setting/the regulations are irrelevant since the other side broke them first?

For offensive operations, use muggle weapons and my magical forces to protect them. Ideally, shell the enemy positions with gas grenades until they surrender. Magic might protect you temporarily, but I can keep the toxic stuff coming for weeks if need be. At some point, the defenders need to sleep and cannot cast charms like the bubblehead one. If gas ammunition is restricted, liberal amounts of napalm do the trick. Burn the oxygen away, melt the walls. Again, I have time and can keep the inferno going indefinitely.

If my task is defence, trench warfare would do the trick if the battle of Hogwarts is any indication. If a bunch of Centaurs can kill Death Eaters with bows, you bet machine guns, artillery and mortars would do the trick. My magical forces would place anti apparation/portkey wards to ensure that no magical transportation can be used to outflank me.

If we are talking about the higher levels (Imperius to take out muggle governments), I'm fucked. Nothing I can really do about that.

** Heavy use of Obliviation combined with Legilimency (to map people's mindsets before going ahead with Obliviation) to induce delicate, but much more effective (compared to Imperius), control over people -- selectively removing their life experiences to completely turn people around. This basically boils down to a much more efficient -- and far more sinister (irreversible!) -- Imperius offense. You can do stuff like:

- Effectively save scum your interactions with people, making sure to make them associate you with good things and removing bad experiences, eventually causing total devotion
- Completely remove their trust in existing friends/lovers/whatnot by removing all their positive experiences with said persons
- Selectively remove parts of experiences, to cause implications similar to quoting out of context.

Abuse of Obliviation is very rare in fics I've seen, but fics which explore it becomes really disturbing really fast.

** I will unleash the following:

- Mind magic including Imperius, Legilimency, and false memory charms against their chains of command
- Dementors against their political and spiritual leaders. Religious fanatics and other ideologues will get priority targeting by them.
- Apparations and portkeys to enhance mobility
- Extension and Duplication charms to improve logistics
- Anti Muggle and other forms of magical wards to improve defense
- Magically enhance weapons such as expanded magazines, low recoil guns, invisible flying tanks...

** Depends on if you are fighting against muggles, pureblood wizards (with little knowledge of technology), or combined forces like your own.

Guns are always an option. Not good against a shield charm, but faster than it takes to cast one. Magicals are focused on breaking shields and countering hiding magic while normal soldiers tear anyone without a shield apart.

If Weasley can make a flying car in his garage, how about flying tanks?

Nukes would be impractical in most scenarios.

If the enemy has magic as well, I'm going to need a lot of Thief's Downfalls around my base.

My spying agency could make use of the Mind Arts and polyjuice.

** My magical soldiers will mostly sabotage the enemy (destroy command-posts, vehicles, place explosives etc.), do special warfare (stuff that Delta Force, Force Recon Marines, Navy Seals etc. perform), spy and infiltrate (they have the skills for that, invisibility spells (Dumbledore was not using a cloak when he confronts Harry near the mirror in year one!), polyjuice, animagus-forms etc.)

​

They will also recover technology from the other side (so that my guys can catch up!) and enchant weapons, armor etc. (hell, with magic you could probably make powered assault armor (SPACEMARINES!))

​

Otherwise I'd add a (very) limited number to the battlefield to support the regular soldiers with shields, healing, messenger service (can't intercept apparating with tech as far as we know, so they are the perfect messengers if radios become unrealiable etc.) and if need be destructive spells...kind of like psykers to in Warhammer 40K :)

​

ps: They'd also perform interrogations with legilimency and veritaserum :) - also: Imperius curse...damned, you could wreck an enemy's chain of command (if a commander has to fear that every subordinate will kill them or every soldier has to fear that his commander is controlled and will send them to their death...yeah, chaos!)
