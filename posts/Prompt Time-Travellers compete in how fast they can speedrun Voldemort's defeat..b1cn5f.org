** The fastest way to kill the horcrux in Harry is to just kill Harry. As he watches the speed runs he just sighs as everyone - /everyone/ - decides to just kill him. It makes for some awkward workplace chit chat and even more awkward dinners at the Weasleys.

** *Category: Prophesy, Harry, any%*\\
Time begins from the end of Trelawny speaking the "one with the power" prophesy. Time ends when Voldemort is without body and all horcrux are destroyed. Traveler is Harry Potter.

*Author Notes*\\
First ever Sub 2-yr! Thanks to @PettingGrew for TAS analysis, toddle-rit has a real time setup.\\
Previously, the controls for infant Harry were too rng dependent to setup the soul-link ritual. But if you can get James's wand (easy, thanks to "dada not mama" setup), before moving into Godric's Hollow, you can conjure a stamp with "glimbao guh buh buh buh". Depending on rng (about 1/60), the stamp's pattern will match most of what you need for the ritual circle.\\
Cut yourself on Sirius's knife--why is this strat so easy?!--to get the blood for the ritual.\\
Then it's just a matter of hiding the bloody stamp until the night of doom. Stamp yourself and pour just about enough magic into the ritual so that you're almost dead, and when Voldemort casts his AK, finish the ritual at the same time.\\
If you've done it correctly, you will become a Horcrux, and a moment later your soul and Horcrux will connect to the rest of the Horcruxes.\\
Spend the rest of your magic trying to cast a wandless fiendfire, and when you die, the run is over!\\
In this run, we got incredibly lucky with the stamp--perfect pattern!--, but we missed the early Fidelius break. Should be able to save a few days still. I might keep grinding this category, I dunno.

*Category: Prophesy, Harry, tas, any%*\\
*Author Notes*\\
Harry 3-day-old. Run improved by 2 days! It has been a long grind, but we finally found a window where you can do a prophesy lookup, double-soul-link, and commit suibabycide (sorry Harry, it's for the frames!).\\
The trick is in a previously unexplored strat--if you spitup in the shape of a Grim, usually that's taken as an omen and James and Lily pay extra close attention, and there's no way to kill baby Harry. But, if you do a Grim spitup and a diaper blowout, the Grim barely registers. James has a weird dream, and while he talks it over with Lily, you have a 3-minute window to go unsupervised.\\
@IamSiriusAndDontCallMeShirley is working on an early double-feed strat so you can get blowout a few hours early, so this run might be improved very soon!

** Now I want to read a fic that forces various characters -- whether they want it or not -- to try to ensure Voldemort's defeat within a certain time limit, the reward being a wish of their choice. Bonus points for backfiring wishes. To make the challenge at least plausible for everyone, full disclosure on Horcruxes are given.

Lucius Malfoy nodded, trying (and failing) to conceal an oversized battleaxe behind his back (just in case he got an opportunity to 'make a wish').\\
Voldemort sighed, "Well, there's only one solution to that, I suppose."\\
