I'm looking for a story I wanted to read but that disappeared from my bookmarks (I'm blaming the crazy house-elf for that). And I searched for it on my own but I must be really bad at it... so I'm counting on my fellow redditors who are always so awesome at finding lost stories.

What I know:

- It's on fanfinction.net (I'm a 100% positive)

- Hermione goes back and forth between the Marauder's era and the present several times (I don't think it's on purpose though)

-It was most likely a completed story. (because I'm just prejudiced that way)

...

That's all I remember, I'm sorry, but the plot is so unique that I haven't found others like it. But I'll recognize the fic I'm looking for when I see it.

Thanks for reading and helping


** Details of who she interacts most with and why, a rating and what not would help.

your description sounds like at least fifteen different stories I've read. Poor hermione gets thrown backwards and forwards through time more often than most.

*** Really, I never read another story where she's leaping back and forth several times in the same story.

Unfortunately I don't remember the specifics of pairing and rating, I'm so very sorry (and frustrated)!

** Does Hermione go back for Snape and in the present she is creating some sort of memorial out of Snape's house and she get's to the past/present I think by falling into a well?

Sorry that's so jumbled it's the only way I can think to describe it

*** Sounds like Hermione crossover with Alice in Wonderland :D

But no, that does not ring a belle at all. As I said, she goes backwards and forwards several times by accident. I can see falling in a well ONCE by accident, but not more than that.

Thanks for trying, I know I don't have much clues to give out.

*** It's not :( And I still haven't found it, although I tweaked the browser and filters on Fanfiction.net any which way. I'm starting to think I dreamed it and it's driving me crazy. But thanks for trying, I may read that story anyway :)
