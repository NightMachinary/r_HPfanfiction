In the fic she uses a special design time-Turner that was given to her by Dumbldore that allows her to repeat her summer between 5th and 6 year over and over again. In this fic she basically trains and becomes his assassin and is nicknamed "Dumbldore's dragon" by death eaters. It's also a Snape/Hermione fanfiction.
