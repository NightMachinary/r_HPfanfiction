*** A Harry Potter - Pinky and the Brain crossover could be amusing. Have it take place /after/ Voldemort is defeated, except where Wormtail is still alive. Wormtail accidentally finds his way into the lab where he meets a new master: Brain. Obviously, Pinky, Wormtail, and the Brain try to take over the World.

** Jane Shepard and Tali have a shuttle accident and wake up at Privet Drive, 2am on November 2nd 1981. Shepard finds Harry while scouting the area and decides that a door is not a suitable accommodation for a toddler. Tali hacks herself through the British authorities and forges an identity for Jane, who becomes Elon Musk and they make their own Space X, using future technology to revolutionise computers and space travel.

Meanwhile, Harry grows up with a cybernetically enhanced super soldier and an alien who has to wear a suit all the time. He tells everyone at Hogwarts and they just shrug it off because having an extraterrestrial adoptive mother sounds exactly like something the boy who lived would do.

** HP/P.G. Wodehouse's Blandings Castle stories. I'm not doing a crossover exactly, but I'm inspired by the general style, and there's a scene at the Drones Club.

** Harry Potter and the no good very bad awful day, in which Harry wakes up, Stubbs his toe on his trunk, drops his jumper into the sink, trips down the stairs on the way to breakfast, Hermione and Ron grab the last of the bacon, and then he still has to face the rest of the day.
