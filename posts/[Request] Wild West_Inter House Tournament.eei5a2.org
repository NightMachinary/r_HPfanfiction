Looking for several kinds of fics.

1. Wild West. -A story set in the HP world but in the wild west. Can be completely OC or canon focused.

2. Inter-house tournament. -A story with a contest similar to the Triwizard Tournament but with all four houses instead. Maybe Harry doesn't get chosen to compete but someone like Ron or Hermione do.

No slash pairings please.


** It's only intermittently in the Wild West, but it occurs often enough that I think it counts for your first request. West of Here, by MK-ONE. I'm not sure what I think of the fic myself - it's an interesting enough story with interesting enough execution, it just contains some elements of character that I'm not terribly fond of. Harry is something of a pillock in this one.

There's also a sequence in one of the Mr Black fics where he walks through a typical Wild West town and has some interactions with the locals, though I can't quite recall which one it was.

TheBlackHand724 has also done a couple - Wild West Harry Potter and Harry Steel Through Time - but I haven't read them yet so am unable to give you a review.

I've got one somewhere that's a crossover with Hard West - a weird-west turn-based video game - which I think stars Hermione as a bad-ass bookworm, but I can't recall its name and so can't find it in my to-read bookmark list. I'll update if I find it.
