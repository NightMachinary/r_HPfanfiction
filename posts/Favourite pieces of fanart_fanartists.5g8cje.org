I recently linked a fan depiction of the Severus v. Minerva duel, one of my favourites, in another thread: [[http://ehay.deviantart.com/art/Deathly-Hallows-Fight-part-1-367517893]]

What are some of yours?


** Seconding [[/u/wordhammer]] 's shout-out to Makani. I'm also a big fan of [[http://nesskain.deviantart.com/][Nesskain]]'s collection of HP comic panel works - [[http://nesskain.deviantart.com/art/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-509812228][this]] one in particular. It's my favourite depiction of the Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel by far.

** Goddamn, McG is good looking in that first piece.

These three are my favourite fanart pieces of Bellatrix, which is pretty much the only character I looked up fanart for, specifically:

[[http://makani.deviantart.com/art/how-bout-a-little-knife-elf-187025869?q=makani%2F22981441&qo=19]]

But my favourite pieces /ever/ are these comic strips and pictures by the amazing Nesskain. Here an excerpt:

I love this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/5ehzs9/loved_the_movie_had_to_come_home_and_paint/][painted niffler]] by [[/u/graphicgeek]]. They really did a wonderful job catching their mischievous nature.

** May I humbly suggest [[http://65.media.tumblr.com/a27fe7a5d4f4ed4682f0a28792549191/tumblr_nci021W1vg1riqrywo1_1280.jpg][this]] as a good representation of book Hermione.

Ohey- there's a [[https://cdn2.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/462/902/large/victor-hugo-queiroz-spew940.jpg][3D version]]

Please give all the artists a run through their gallery! I really like promoting other people's art, they are all amazing and should be more well-known.
