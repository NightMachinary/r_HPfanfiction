:END:
I can't remember the name of this fic or the general plot, but I know Harry had to live with Snape (for the summer or something) Draco either visits for a few weeks or is living there too. I cant recall if there was any shipping, but I'm pretty sure it was on AO3 and at least 75k+.

The only scene I really remember is Draco sending Harry off to some random room because Snape wanted him. Harry goes into the room and basically passes out from the toxic plant fumes. The spirits of Harry's parents end up waking him up to get him out of the room, and hes like super messed up afterwards from the exposure, and starts bleeding from his nose/eyes etc after hes found by snape/draco. It was very dramatic.
