I haven't read any fan fiction in a very long time, but I was wondering if anyone's written any decent SI's or OC fits lately that aren't the usual "yo my name is Gary Stu/Mary Sue and I'm here to suck some Marauders"


** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/umbrus-shade-the-incredibly-annoyed-ravenclaw-harry-potter-si.48980/]] Umbrus Shade the incredibly annoyed ravenclaw is a recent male self insert with daily update, give it a shoot it's pretty good.

** linkffn(Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal, And Other Morals) is pretty unique and rather good. linkffn(A Curse of Truth) is a more traditional sort of self-insert (going to Hogwarts, befriending the Trio, etc.), but done as well as it can be done.

I'm also betaing a very good self-insert story that hasn't been published yet. I'll get back to you when it is.

**** True. The Christian part is probably the most annoying part of the story, especially to non-Christians; but it never becomes unmanageable (so far), and what's left if you take those few parts out is a rather sweet story of family and friendships, which avoids rehashes, has some good worldbuilding of foreign magical lands (Hawaii), and has little to do with common self-insert plots.

***** Ah see, I actually liked the inclusion of that OC the Self Insert meets. I thought the author was doing an okay job developing the SI's relationship with canon characters. Not the best, but decent enough to keep reading the fic. And then he goes and starts spouting religion.

So I'm not Christian and I have no issues at all with Christianity or any other religion for that matter. And the SI describes himself as a Southerner so I expected a good amount of Americanisms. Which was fine. He also described his views to Harry once and I was okay with that. But then he started talking about something like "saving oneself for marriage" with the other OC and kept going on about his religion and that just killed the story for me.

Do keep in mind though that I'm biased myself since I personally don't like people who keep talking about their religion. It just feels like they're shoving their views down someone's throat. Not that they think they're doing that, they're merely talking about something that's an important part of their life. It's just I personally don't like that and seeing it in any story I'm reading kills the fun for me.

****** Hey, I don't either. But I find the rest of the story good enough that I skim through the religious paragraphs as they come up (and there aren't /that/ many) and enjoy the rest on its own terms. Note also that the author is aware that he is, in his own words, "a Jesus-freak"; and so in a way it adds value to the SI aspect that he's being /honest/ --- because if he really /were/ in this situation that is indeed how he would act, never mind that it can come off as silly and obnoxious to readers.

******* I do get what you mean, don't get me wrong. I'd rather have a character with flaws than a Gary Stu, it's just a personal bias thing as people who're too religious (well not too religious but people who can't stop talking about their religion) just wig me out IRL so I can't take it in fiction which I read to get away from irl problems and relax. So it's just a personal preference thing. It's not like his grammar was bad or anything. Just that the story wasn't something hong I prefer reading.

I'd be a hypocrite to dislike a character in a fan fic just because they're Christian for obvious reasons.

Your grammar was fine as far as I could tell. The pacing was a bit off in the beginning and your dialogue could use a little work. But writing a child is quite hard and your writing was improving every few chapters as far as I could see.

I apologize if what I said offends you, just trying to give a constructive review. And please keep in mind I am a bit biased about that whole “character keeps talking about his religion” thing.

********** I appriciate the feedback. I accepted a long time ago that trying to write a story that appeals to everyone is a crapshoot, and that I should really just write the story I want to tell since I'm not getting paid for it.

That said, it's baffling to me that people think the religion in that story came out of left field. David prays three times in first chapter alone, in the last one leading Harry in prayer. I thought it was obvious that was going to be a big part of the story.

*********** Perhaps left-field is the wrong choice of phrase as it's been over a year since I read your story. It's more like you rarely see religion being brought up in HP fan fiction and even then it's usually a form of "Wizarding" religion which is usually more of an amalgamation of Celtic religious practices with the author's own spin on things. And never so seriously. That's what set off the warning bells in my head that I might not like this story. But your prose was alright so I decided to push through it as self insert stories with a male protagonist are a rarity.

**** Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal is the one where an SI ends up adopting six-year old Harry (not really spoiler since he ends up with custody of him in the first chapter or two). The character is Christian and ends up converting his wife and Harry, but I wouldn't call him "super" Christian. Religion comes up as important in a small handful of chapters. The author spends more time soapboxing about eduction than he does religion, as I recall.

Overall, it's competently-written (for fanfic) and is an interesting change of pace that focuses more on the OC and the parent-child relationship with a much younger Harry.

Having said that, I really can't recommend it - as an actual story it fails. It's desperately thin on adventure/conflict/excitement. It feels like a novel of nothing - nothing happens, there's no tension, there's very little meaning to all of it. Like so much of fanfic it's got a handful of interesting ideas (the OC ends up having a weird sort of "power") but then fails to actually capitalize on them at all.

Curse of Truth is fun and heartwarming and had what I thought was a masterfully executed finish (so very rare in fanfic), but it does feel light on actual conflict/stakes.

Like most SI fics, the SI ends up being immediately popular, liked by everyone, and lusted after by whoever the main female characters are (here, obviously, Hermione). It's just about as well-done as this sort of thing can be, and if you're okay reading what feels more like the author's desperate wish-fulfillment of having been awesome in high school rather than a real gripping narrative, then this is for you.

Personally, I loved Curse of Truth as my guilty pleasure is exactly this kind of story. But the MC is an obvious Gary Stu and if you're not interested in reading that, then give it a pass.

***** Yeah I actually read curse of truth and the Gary Stu vibe killed it for me. I can read a few Gary Stu fics so long as I find the rest of the writing to be passable or the author brings up a new view on magic I haven't encountered, but I couldn't in this case.

It's been a while since I read "Time travel..." so I think I'm confusing his soapboxing about education with his views on religion. It's just the moment he starts talking about religion, warning bells began ringing in my head and once I came across those long monologues in that fic or his lectures or whatever you call them, I gave it up.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.
