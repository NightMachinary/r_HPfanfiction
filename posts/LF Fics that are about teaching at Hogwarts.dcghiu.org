I read Crosswinds of Fate recently and while I didn't love it, I enjoyed seeing a story featuring modern pedagogical ideas. I'm looking for stories where teaching is similarly important to the story. I would strongly prefer that it be told from the perspective of a professor and that it not be all that focused on the plot of Harry Potter. I would also rather it be femslash but I figure beggars can't exactly be choosers.


** linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday... by Twisted Biscuit) ... probably not what you expected, but excellent anyway.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** linkao3(15475770) SS PoV, where he's actually a good teacher instead of how he is in canon. Focuses on the act of teaching itself, rather than his life in general, which sounds like just what you wanted.

*** The summary looks great, but 11k words in 22 chapters makes me think it's more a collection of very brief snapshots than an actual story.
