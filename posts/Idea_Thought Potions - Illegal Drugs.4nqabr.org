I'm surprised that this is something never brought up in fanfic, even if it's understandable why canon wouldn't go that route.

Potions are shown as both utility and medicine, sometimes weapons. So why not narcotics? Hallucinogens? It would seem like these would be easy to make considering it's a topic taught to most every student. I'd imagine that the most limiting factor might that the ingredients might not be easily acquired.


** Calming Draught = Valium

Wide-eye potion = Ritalin

Wit-sharpening potion = Cocaine

Also, I'm close to convinced that Professor Flitwick is suffering from a lifelong obsession with Cheering Charms. it may have ruined his dueling career, but at least he doesn't feel bad about it.

** I've read fanfics where addiction to pain-relief potions have been brought up, as well as general narcotic uses of potions: by no means do I think it's never brought up.

I think there are some explanations - for example, it could be the case that potions are only ever made with non-addictive properties, as opposed to a Muggle opiate or the like, and it could also be the case that there are spells and potions to end dependences on certain substances.

I think the limiting factor, as it were, is just the difficulty there might be in writing the topic.

Addiction can be something difficult to tackle, as it's a complex and often subtle thing IRL, and most fanfics don't really want subtlety - they want instant angst.

I've seen fics that tackle alcohol addiction in an interesting way, and I've seen a mix of thoughts on cigarettes and smoking, but consider this: wizards, the original vapers.

I feel like most of what's learned in Hogwarts, re: Potions, is the equivalent of what I learnt in woodshop - I can solder a simple circuit, make a doorbell and a shitty birdhouse, but I couldn't build my own porch. Harry Potter might be able to brew a boil remover and some sleeping draught, but he wouldn't necessarily be able to brew the wizarding equivalent of crystal meth.

Much as I'm sure Snape campaigned to add that to the syllabus, I doubt his request was approved.

Don't be so certain. Slughorn praised Harry's Elixir to Induce Euphoria (Harry even wanted to drug Slughorn with it in order to get the memory, which I find hilarious). I've never experienced with hard drugs but isn't heroin/meth/cocaine supposed to induce euphoria?

Anyway, There's also this bit from OotP:

#+begin_quote
  Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine 'Outstanding' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons.

  ...'Dragon claw does work!' said Ron. 'It's supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours...'

** Potions are a pain to make, cost money, take time and can be lethal if not made properly.

Add to this the fact that children are taught mood altering charms at thirteen as a matter of course, I just can't see potions being the first stop for a wizard looking to get high.

** They're brought up quite a bit i've found. I've seen more than a few stories that discuss illegal potions, especially those used to permanently modify people or control them as shown in LittleWhiteCat's HP/40K crossover story.

*** I agree! I thought it was decently common. Though, you and I both also read a fair amount of Snape centric fics (or at least where he's a main character), where illegal potions is likely more prevalent compared to, say, Harry focused stories.

**** ooohh no no no no noooo. No. While Snape is an ancillary character in many of my favorite stories, usually shown in such a way to help redeem his character, but in no way do I EVER read SnapeCentric fics. In fact, when I do read bash fics, Snape is often the bashee of choice.

It's just a weird coincidence the stories I find the best written have a character I despise written well enough that I almost regret his eventual and cathartic death.

If you haven't read LittleWhiteCat's Harry Potter/Warhammer 40000 series, you should. Snape's portrayal is hilarious though sadly he survives the story. And Sirius's portrayal is pretty damn good too.

** There's Chapter 16 in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file]]), with a Dark!Trio in which Hermione is a drug dealer.

Me, I've been wanting to see a fic where Hermione goes through a similar character arc to Walter White in /Breaking Bad/. I think that it could work: both are very smart, decently socialized if a bit awkward, with a massive reserve of hubris and ruthlessness hidden underneath.

** For the most part you can compare potions to prescription drugs, which can be abused, but are legal. Usually they are given to you by a mediwizard/witch or healer, and occasionally taken yourself after being prescribed. Or in some rare cases, given to you by someone else legally allowed (like a master potion maker).

However by that same logic you can also compare some of the "darker" potions to illegal drugs of all sorts. And a good potion maker or alchemist could also cater towards the black market, similar to folks cooking up certain drugs.
