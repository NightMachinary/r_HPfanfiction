** "Oh hello there Terry," called out Molly to the student.

She reach out to him in a warm, bone-crushing hug. He stood there frozen in shock at the close contact. The Ravenclaw couldn't remember the last time anyone had ever hugged him. She suddenly looked at him in concern with her maternal eyes before pinching the skin on his side.

"My, my you're looking quite thin! I better get you lot some vittles fore' you head out for the big battle."

She promptly headed into the pantry and started noisily filling his haversack with food and other supplies. The rest of the DA stared awkwardly at the scene. To his dismay, he could see Ron turning red in anger.

In an attempt to stall a future thrashing by the Weasley, he rushed over to Molly and held up a placating hand.

"Mrs.Weasley," Terry stammered, "I really don't need anything, please. It is incredibly kind of you to do this but-."

Molly shoved a cookie in his mouth to shut him up before continuing on her task.

"Can't let you poor babies starve on my watch. Wouldn't be right."

As he chewed on the sweet and butter cookie, his resolve started to weaken. Maybe a few licks from Weasley was worth Molly's coooking.

**** No worries. I'm glad someone decided to write it after all. Maybe partly to prove me wrong. Maybe that was my plan all along...
