** I wish I could remember the title but there was one where Harry was a metamorphmagus as well and they both could fully change sexes and wanted to impregnate each other...

Now that I think about it there's probably a reason I can't remember the name.

** like a one shot lemon? or like a multi chapter thing? I remeber reading one with the plot along the lines of harry's excess magic after the final battle requires him to have sex a bunch of times. It has multiple partners but i remember tonk's chapters she role plays alot. dont recall the name though.
