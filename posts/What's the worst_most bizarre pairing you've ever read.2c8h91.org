For me it's Dobby/Umbridge. Also i'm not exactly proud to admit it but that was actually the first fic I think I ever read...

Edit: Also Dobby/The Sock That Freed Him...


** I don't read that much fanfic these days. Very picky about it. That being said, I was duped into reading something that eventually turned out to be Harry/Aragog.

It started out with so much promise and then I read the line, "Harry felt eight, hairy legs encircle him."

No. Just no.
