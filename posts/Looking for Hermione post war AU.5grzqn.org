So, in the fic I'm looking for, Hermione was banned from the wizarding world for protecting members of the order and others from a war crimes tribunal led by Harry and Susan Bones, and I think some death eaters? The story revolves around her refusing to name names. She is supported by Luna for sure, but it's been a long time since I read this fic and I just can't think of what else to look for. I've tried using google and looking through likely places, but I can't find it. Thanks for your help :3


** Ooh, I've read this one. She was protecting seven names of Order members who tortured captive Death Eaters to death... I think Cedric Diggory was the last name she was protecting, and after he died of old age she came back to the Wizarding World. Pretty sure Draco was on the war crimes panel. I'm not sure of the name.

***** Really? What about Cedric being alive?

DA still got formed, and yet Harry sided with Draco against Hermione? Are you kidding me?
