I'm looking for a fic that has Harry and smarter Voldemort actually talking and realizing that the actual foe is much more insidious.

  Harry Potter was nothing like the world expected him to be. He's slowly changing the game of how the world works; exposing secrets, lies, and plots no one wanted to know about but will have no choice but to accept and silently growing a following to right so many wrongs. Harry/Tom pairing. Ron and Dumble bashing.

** I keep suggesting these two series, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard]] have Harry and Tom working to fully separate the magical and Wizarding world, the first by moving to a new planet, and the second one by moving to another dimension. The separation is because it is getting harder for magical to hide from muggles and Harry wants to avoid a war between the two groups. While there is some bashing, no one is painted as 'evil' it's mostly done because Harry is more independent and so doesn't like being smothered. He eventually works things out with most people by the end of both series. Mischief's Heir has some of the minor characters being slash while Ninja Wizard has slash between main characters.

It's not got a partnership with Harry in it though. I'll give you the name, which may (or may not) be a clue about what it's about: /Tom Riddle and the Witch Queen/.

***** Yeah I can understand the time it could potentially take. I'm a writer (not a novelist...yet, though I hope to be someday). I find writing fanfics a lot easier at times because of the established universe, but it's also hard to be original since there are so many good ideas out there already. I'm sure you'll find it much easier considering your experience. :)

And thanks for the title! I can't figure out the clue, though that's probably just me. I'll keep an eye out for it. Happy writing!
