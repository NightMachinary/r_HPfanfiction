Last year, Shortly before McGonagall was able to send the Slytherin to their dorm

The Hall was quiet for a few seconds. Everyone was waiting for the next move as the air grew tense. For someone to say something. To do something. There were not disappointed. A second before McGonagall opened her mouth two Slytherins stepped forward. Two 5th year's called Hestia and Flora. The Carrow twins. They walked slowly towards Harry. A calm and collected mimic not showing what they were thinking. Their hands showing for everyone to see they hold no wand or other weapon. Despite that, they were watched like hawks, the other students just waiting for the right moment to attack should they try anything. But they didn't. They walked past Harry and stopped only two steps behind him. The Twins turned around, looked at the other Slytherin and Hestia began to speak: „We will fight.“ Her voice cut in the silence like a knife. No one knew how to respond to that and just continued to stare at the girls with wide eyes. „We will fight“, Flora confirmed. „We do not care about the light nor do we care about Potter himself. But we care about Hogwarts. Hogwarts is our sanctuary, our comfort and our home." Her voice rang true. There was nothing in it that could make anyone think otherwise. Then It was Hestia who spoke again: "Our parents are monsters. There is no denying it. We grew up being in the first row. We grew up being their lab rats. Being forced to drink their new potions, play target for new spells or were otherwise tortured, the Crucio included. Even if we do not care for Potter, this is our chance to get revenge on them. We are not the only one who suffered from our parents. This is your chance too to retaliate for all you have suffered. This kind of opportunity you will only get now."

And again, was the hall filled with silence. The fighters were watching the Slytherin, who looked at the ground, at the girls or had they head sunk low but closed their eyes in deep thought. „But that's not all. Do you know how He first started recruiting? He told our grandfathers and grandmothers that he wished to protect the wizarding world from the muggles and their weapons. He told them He would make sure that our traditions will not go extinct. He told them that He would protect the purebloods of becoming extinct. But, in the end, what did he do? He caused a war that demanded many, many lives. No matter if Muggleborn, Half-blood or Pure-blood. The last war cost us 13 Pureblood families to find their end with 285 other dead Pure-bloods. And that is the official number. Only the dead themselves know how many else were lost in explosions and other incidents."

"He doesn't care about us. He doesn't care about our traditions. He only cares about His power. He sits on his throne, kill anyone who stands in his way and make the rest his slaves to obey his every command or risking torture and death. We will not stand for that. We will not stand by and watch our world burn to ashes."

And together they said again: "We will fight. For our world, for our future, for our children's freedom. We will fight."

** Turns out all their proper Pureblood traditions mean nothing out in the battlefield.

Flora is caught in the crossfire of a Mandrake bomb and Hestia is used as a human shield by Zacharias

** This is great, it's always nice to see reasonable Slytherins that aren't just evil for the sake of it. Wish this was canon.
