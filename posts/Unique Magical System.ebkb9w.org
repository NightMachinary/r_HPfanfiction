** linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin) it takes many canon tropes and flips/expands on them making them better imo. The magic is more explained.

** I recently read this fic and that's why it came to mind but I'm also hesitant to recommend this one. It has a unique magical system for sure, which includes an OC hedge witch that teaches young Tom Riddle and time traveling Voldemort blood magic and also a method of divination that uses fire but also, both Voldemort and Tom Riddle are genuinely monsters worth fearing in this fic. Fairly early on, Tom Riddle sexually assualts Harry Potter. Its not brushed under the rug or forgotten and it has lasting impact on the plot, but I don't want anyone to click through on this and think that its a Harry/Voldemort fic wherein Voldemort is a misunderstood villain. There's amazing character development, brilliant world building, and I enjoyed the authors writing style...but /please mind the tags/.

** I got the fic for you. It's long as shit, good as fuck, and unfortunately abandoned. But the Druid magic system and story are worth the blue balls you have at the end without a doubt. It's for sure in my top 3 stories of all time.

Hermione learns how to craft spells. Things are a bit slow and close to canon in the beginning but soon things get going with magic laser beams and stuff like that.

** Linkffn(11160991) is abandoned and ends on a cliffhanger, but it massively expands on divination, making it an actual branch of magic focused on revealing information about the present, rather than predicting the future.

** Well Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality seems to fit quite well.

Its magic system is just a natural expansion of the cannon one, with a lot more creative uses of the magic.

It can be a little preachy sometimes.

And harry is a completely different character.

It really hits its stride around chapter 10
