:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Not going to lie, this is gonna be vague as all hell since I'm not finding it within my FFN favorites.

​

Essentially, the key point I remember about this fanfiction is that it's set during or after OotP and has a Harry who decides to disguise himself so he can fight in the starting war. Eventually it reaches a point in which Dumbledore and (disguised) Harry are becoming friends and talking/philosophizing through a pair of communication mirrors. I remember Harry and Dumbledore gaining an grandson/grandfather type of relationship themselves. I remember Harry being powerful enough that Dumbledore considered him an equal. For some reason, the disguised name that's coming to my mind is "Magnus", but that can almost certainly be ignored since I'm not sure where that came from. I think the name starts with an "M" though. I do know that it isn't just Harry that's setting up the disguises, but one of the girls is helping out, and even take his place during one of the mirror calls. If I remember correctly, there's a scene in which they are discussing disguises and rule out completely magical disguises, since they don't know who would be able to see through them.

​

Sorry for that block of text, but I'm sincerely hoping someone can help me find it, since I'm actually suggesting it to another person atm, and during the course of remembering it, I actually want to reread it now.

*** ... Huh. Well, fuck. Sorry, the situation is a bit hilarious, since I didn't remember that Dark Memories had that whole plot point, I just remembered the Voldemort Memories bit. As to the reason for the profanity...\\

  Voldemort didn't just give Harry some of his powers that night. He gave him all of his memories. With them, his allies and friends, Harry shall change the Wizarding World like no one ever before. LightHarry. GoodDumbledore. Chaotic magic. COMPLETE!

*** The story I was looking for ended up being Harry Potter: Dark Memories by Blueowl (linked above), but thank you very much and I might check out that story, since I've seen it around a couple of times.

**** Oh! Well I'm glad that you found your story. I think you might want to give this fic a chance too. Harry goes to therapy deals with ptsd after the death of Sirius but then gradually gets stronger as a person having a network of people ready to support him. And the way that he becomes more powerful and cool is really satisfying. The trauma and ptsd that he constantly has to battle really balances things out. Hopefully you'll like it! Voldemort becomes a twisted mentor in a way and Harry leads a double life.
