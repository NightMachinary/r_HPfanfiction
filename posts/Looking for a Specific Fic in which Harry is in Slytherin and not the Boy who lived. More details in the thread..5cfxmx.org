I try to recall this one fic I read a long time ago. I'm not even sure if it was written well. I recall Harry being the older brother to the Boy who lived. In the fic there is some sort of hierarchy in Slytherin and Harry is the King or Prince or whatever it was called in the work. I remember one specific chapter was dealing with the new firstyears of Slytherin, like Theodore Nott, Draco Malfoy and so on. On their first night in the Common Room they had to introduce themselves to the Leaders of Slytherin where it turns out Harry is the aforementioned Leader. In this chapter Tracey Davis is bullied for beeing a Halfblood but Harry shuts the Purebloods up by mentioning he is one, too. I believe this chapter was written from the point of view of Theodore Nott. Would be glad if someone could help me out. As said before I don't even know if the fic was written well but it drives me crazy not knowing which fic it was :P Thank you for your


** I haven't read this (yet) but I'm pretty sure you're talking about the Sacrifices Arc that starts with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]

*** It isn't. In the fic I'm looking for Harry is a few years older than his Boy-who-lived-brother. Also it wasn't slash. Thank you nonetheless! :)

** I also just recalled that I believe his most trusted friend was implied to be gay and being in love with Harry. Though it is made clear, that Harry is not gay. Not 100% sure though if this was the same fic

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
