So next gen fics are great. Getting to see the future generation of the WW is great. But I feel like most of them are a little... lacking, when it comes to Harry and his presence in the story. Which makes sense, given that they're supposed to be about the next generation and not him, but still.

So I'm looking for good Next Gen fics that have a lot of Harry screentime in them. Either he's heavily featured, or helps out the main cast often or in a huge way, etc.


** I am a bit hesitant to recommend it since the main pairing is controversial, but check out Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo on ao3.

Harry is over 40 and has a career as a carpenter. James and Al are graduated, but Lily is still in school.

Harry's life gets turned upside down when Ginny is murdered. To the ministry it initially looks like a death eater attack, then they suspect that it is a tale of a love gone wrong. Harry and his friends however suspect political motives and young and old must work together to catch Ginny's killer and prevent the rise of a new pureblood supremacist movement.

Most people hit the back button as soon as they see the main pairing, but this is unfair to the story and the writer. The writing is supreme, it is an excellent who-dun-it with plenty of plot twists and lots of witty lines.

Give it a few chapters and skip the sex scenes if they annoy you.

I love this fic for its portrayal of Harry as an adult with real adult problems and especially as a father to young teenaged men.

** Not sure what your standard is for Harry involvement, I'm gonna base it on the level of his involvement in stuff like Lippert's James Potter series or Vekin87's series, where he's basically a static father figure and sometimes helps out the kids in their own adventures.

There's a pretty major Harry arc in linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) and its sequels. It's not just swooping in to save the day for the kids.

Harry is fairly important in linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) but again this is just in your typical father/government role. Don't know if that's what you're looking for.

linkffn(Ignite by Slide) has some good scenes with Ministry drama that Harry's involved in, but I wouldn't say his character progresses that much.

I'll also never pass up a chance to recommend linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) which is a woefully underappreciated fic. The sequel, Snake Bites, involves quite a bit of Harry in a political role.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] has not Harry as the main character (it is Holly, Dudley's daughter who is a witch), but he is very relevant as the Mentor, Threshold Guardian, and Helper in her [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey][Hero's Journey]]. Significant thing is that he is very different from the standard nice Harry (as known from [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][the stories by Northumbrian]] for example). He is a way more rough and secretive.

** The second story in the Its Teatime series by frombluetored is set after CC and Harry features heavily. A great read and lengthy, the first is only about 5 chapters and sets up the events in the second well. Ao3
