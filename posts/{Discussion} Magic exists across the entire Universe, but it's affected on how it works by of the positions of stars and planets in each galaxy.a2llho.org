** Hmm...that gives me a different, but related idea; the positions of the planets /does/ affect what magic can be used on Earth, whether it be creation affinity, destruction affinity, life affinity, fire affinity, earth affinity, et-cetera.

Harry Potter British wizards use wands, because those let them cast a variety of spells without relying on 'spatial energy', being able to synthesise the power/systems/whatever they need for a specific spell instead at any time; magicals in other parts of the world who don't use wands instead can only use certain types of magic, depending on where Uranus/Neptune/Jupiter/Saturn/Mars/Venus/Mercury and all the asteroids are in relation to each other.

It may be that certain magical wonders, ultra-super-spells and such rely on a certain aligning of planets in the right runic configuration, and can't be repeated without that, hence the mythical wonders of the ancients that modern magical civilization can't reproduce. And that astronomical triangulation is a big deal to super heavy hitter wizards, who can get powerful advantages based on whatever runic configuration the planets form.

Hey, that could be a justification for including new and powerful magic into a fanfic! The planets aligned in a certain way in 1991 or whatever lets Super Harry use a brand new powerful type of wandless magic!

*** Magic is also affected by the culture of the user like most witches and wizards can't do wandless magic in canon if any but there is wizards in Africa who ONLY use wandless magic canonically.

** Sort of unrelated, but I've always been curious as to how something like lycanthropy would work elsewhere. What if the person was on a planet with no moons? What about two moons?

*** I vaguely remember a fanfic with a dark Harry where his group started colonizing the moon (there's..surprisingly a lot of that), and he locked Fenrir Greyback there as an experiment, but for the love of me I can't remember what actually happened... But thinking about the werewlf being affected by the full moon's light reaching his location... When he's on the moon, wouldnt the moon always be full for him, and always reaching his location? A world with no moon would probably make the lycanthropy dormant, but dayyyyym I can see multiple moons leading to avery big mess like SERIOUSLY
