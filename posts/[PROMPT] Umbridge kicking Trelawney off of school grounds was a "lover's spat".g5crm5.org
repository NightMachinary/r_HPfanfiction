** Trelawney predicts Harry's death in front of Umbridge. Umbridge want to learn more about Harry's death and her future. Trelawney gives vague inner eye speeches. Since Trelawney's predictions often have a sprinkle of truth in them she might confirm that Umbridge will succeed in her desires, referencing her managing to remove Dumbledore as headmaster and later become the head of the Muggleborn Registration Commission.

Trelawney appreciate's that there finally is an adult that takes her seriously and Umbridge appreciates that an seer sees success in her future. They start dating, this all crumbles when Trelawney predicts that Harry is going to life a long and happy life in that divination lesson Umbridge attends. Both of these predictions come true, Harry does both die and life a long and happy life, but it brings all of her predictions in questions. Umbridge declared her a fraud, but is mostly hurt her relationship was build on lies.

** I'd read this. Opposites attracting and an intensely ugly fallout. Sounds great.

*** It is peculiar I will admit! And a large amount of downvotes leads me to believe lots of people are repulsed by the idea. However, I figured it would be nice and humourous, serving as a quick pick-me-up during these lockdown times.

**** Umbridge appears conservative so picturing her in a relationship with essentially a spiritual person like Trelawny don't make sense. It would make more sense if they were sisters and had a falling out. Like Petunia and Lily. Like Trelawny tried to reach out to her to warn her about the centaurs and Umbridge was like “girl are you threatening me? Get outta the castle. You are not my sister”

***** Brilliant! It has certainly got more charm. I can certainly see that idea being fleshed out, especially as it would be easy to misinterpret Trelawney's general mystical aura as being slightly threatening. It would make for some interesting slice of life dinners.
