Are there any new interesting completed novel/novella length fan fictions ? ( no slash or no Harry /Ginny or Harry/Hermione please ) TIA


** I do have a rather good series i'm reading, it's a love story one focusing on Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy

It's BDSM so you might not like it if you aren't into that stuff.

Oh wait, you said no slash, sorry! I don't really read gen stories, but if you want you can still check that one out.

This is a gen story

It's part of a series.

By ScotlandEvander on Ao3

This is part of a pretty big series with about 9 fics in total, every fic has about 20 chapters as well, it's paired with a series of related one shots.

Draco travels back in time to fix the mistakes of the future, he finds himself in his 11 year old body, his first mission? Befriend Harry Potter. Gen.

That's all of my gen fics, but if you want to give a few of the slash a try i'll gladly give them to you!

Hope I helped!
