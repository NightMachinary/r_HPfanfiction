For me it's a harry potter/warehouse 13 xover with harry/myka.


** Not specific, but I'd like a Harry that doesn't immediately align himself with the local forces of good. Usually when he does he becomes just another member of a team (often just replacing the role of a different character) and nothing really interesting happens. In these cases it also takes Harry a while to really become invested in the world and people around him.

I want a Harry that has his own agenda from the get-go that doesn't necessarily put him into the good or bad camp that the crossover has defined. Maybe he's the Master of Death and has shit to take care of in that department. Maybe he falls head over heels for someone immediately and just wants to woo them. Maybe he wants to get back home and actually tries to make that happen.

*** You may like this LoTR crossover then, linkffn(11115934) The Shadow of Angmar. Harry does marginally align himself with the forces of good as you say, but only because the orc and the Witch King tortured him. I believe that it takes place about 1000 years prior to the beginning of the 4^{th} age, so some characters do appear like the Wizards, some notable elves like Elrond and the Witch King naturally. But Harry is mostly doing his own thing attempting to get back home.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Oh my god I've got so many crossovers I want to write.

First there's a Starcraft crossover where Harry gets the "need moar powah" itch to protect his friends and loots the black library to summon a zerg larva. Things devolve predictably from there. Then once that's done it turns into a Starcraft/Stargate crossover where Harry flees from the wizarding world because they were able to quarantine and exterminate his colony quickly enough, so he ends up in DC and sneaks into the mountain base and hitches a ride with the SG1 team at the last second. He escapes their grasp and then it's the Zerg against the Goa'uld empire.

There's another SG1 crossover I want to write where one of Hathor's children manages to escape the purge and flees to Britain, but while in the forest its body starts to fail. Queue Fem!Harry stumbling across a halfdead american serviceman and trying to help. Goa'uld transfers to her body, and then she, it, and Voldemort engage in a 3 way fight over her mind. Voldemort ultimately loses and suffers brain death, incapacitating him permanently. Harry and the Goa'uld get damaged in the fight and become co-dependent. Then Harry does the same trick as above, albeit more stealthily, and trots off to take over some Goa'uld's planet and start collapsing the empire from within.

THEN there's the HP/Mass Effect crossover where magic is revealed to the muggles and becomes severely weakened but widespread. (balance issues, ya know?) Researchers do their research thing and discover FTL travel and avoid the pit-viper trap that is the ME transit system. There's a whole lot more I have planned, but spoilers.

THEN there's the HP/Sailor Moon one where Fem!Harry gets her moon powers in the forest Death Scene. The Horcrux in her head combines with her pet cat (who followed her) to become her cat guardian named Tom. Harry herself becomes the Dark Knight of the Moon, gains some wicked black armor and a jetpack because it's a fucking jetpack that's why, and how else are you going to get around in full armor? And has the Sword of Gryffindor, naturally. Trots off to Japan because the all the Senshi stuff is starting to break the Statute and she has to deal with it.

THEN there's the Firefly crossover where Harry is the ship's spirit (I forget the word for it) of Serenity because he died in the cockpit long before Mal ever bough it. Proceeds to save the crew's asses one after another until they're all aware the ship is haunted.

THEN there's the Bleach crossover where Harry dies in the Forest and goes to Soul Society, but he gets lost in the Big Tunnel of Time Goop and winds up two hundred years ago, takes care of all the little orphans and then eventually goes to the Academy. Hedwig is his Zanpakuto and he gets literal wings for his sword release and, of course, the Gryffindor sword is his Zanpakuto form. BECAUSE I LIKE THAT DAMN SWORD. Still debating whether to have him become Visored because I can totally see the Horcrux becoming his inner Hollow. Then he flees with Urahara and Yoruichi to Earth and then we wait until the present day for canon shenanigans.

THEN there's the Skyrim crossover where Harry gets sucked in the the Mirror of Erised and joins the Thieves' Guild. Eventually Dumbledore finds him, but now it's 5 years later and Harry doesn't really want to go back. Eventually he is convinced, but the Dovahkiin is now his adopted parent/relative and goes along with them. Queue shenanigans.

OH YEAH AND THEN there's the PJO crossover where Hades gets pissed that a foreign necromancer is practicing on his soil. It's Harry who is raising an army of undead to storm the ministry because they threw his friends through the Veil of Death because they broke him out of Azkaban in which the Traitor!Ministry threw him. This then turns into an Overlord crossover because transdimensional Veil trope. Then there's shenanigans of all kinds, and THEN it turns into an Avengers crossover where Harry resurrects a bunch of dead Asgardians from the crypts so that they can fight gloriously once more against the Chitari.

That's all that I have for now, but I forget and remember ideas daily.

Also I will probably write all of them with Fem!Harry because I'm obsessed like that.

** It'd be HP/Elder Scrolls, though I've no idea how that would happen. I like the idea of the Dragonborn coming to the magical world and being a mentor to Harry, or Harry going to Tamriel and getting into quests, though not necessarily the main questlines. Maybe he becomes the Archmage at Winterhold and he becomes a respected a figure, maybe he becomes an avatar of Magnus and gets involved with the Gods.

I don't know, but it's probably what I'm going to write after I finish The Life He Leads.

*** I'm actually musing on a harry potter MoD-translates-to-remembered-reincarnations where each chapter would just be vignettes of Harry's reincarnations from birth to death:

Harry's eyes focused for the first time and he looked into his mother's face. She was covered in dirt but was very pretty. He sighed as his lips latched on to her nipple. Every time he reincarnated he got a beautiful mom---even if this one appeared to be rather poorly equipped for living---and it was always annoying. Getting an erection as a baby and his new mother giggling at it was always a little disheartening to have his manhood giggled at.

Timebreak

Harry stared at his groin. He was a girl this time‽ That would explain the name of Noni this time, he realized. And realized he was rather excited to be a girl full time. He wondered if he would be hetero or homosexual. The last time he'd been attracted to other guys and that had been a bit weird for him but he figured it might be easier this time if he was.

Her mother finished changing the diaper then kissed the tip of her nose, making Noni giggle.

Timebreak

Sitting in the yard of their home in Novac, seven year old Noni exhibted her first sign of accidental magic when she banished a board of nails into the massive radscorpion that erupted out of the ground.

Intense concentration let her vanish the results. She had yet to see anyone use magic and living in this wasteland, she didn't want to cause her sharecropper parents problems.

Time-break

14 year old Noni watched the stranger in town kill the owner of the hotel then showed them all the bill of sale, showing the woman was a human trafficker working with the legion.

** Oh, so many. I ended up writing down plot bunnies because I couldn't get them out of my head. Here's some.

1. One of my stranger ones is a Skins crossover with Harry/Effy and Ginny/Cook. Things are merged so that they're all magical. Tony Stonem is a formerly-charming 7th year Slytherin who was cursed and is basically suffering the same effects of the traumatic brain injury he had in Skins. Effy Stonem is a 5th year Slytherin and a naturally-gifted legilimens, though nobody knows because she's spent the first 4 years in Hogwarts refusing to speak. James Cook is a shockingly wild Hufflepuff. Their paths finally cross with the trio and Ginny in an OoTP AU. I wanted the crossover so much, I actually made icons and manips with these people.

2. Buffy: Sirius takes Harry with him when he runs in third year. Deciding he needs to settle somewhere for Harry's sake, Sirius works to a build a life for them in Sunnydale. Somehow, Sirius/Joyce happens. Buffy and Harry (and Dawn later) become a family.

3. X-Men: Dudley is a mutant. After accidentally revealing himself, he runs away. Harry follows because he has no faith in Dudley's ability to take care of himself. Harry learns to control his magical outbursts to the point where he's considered just another untrained mutant. Dudley, predictably, makes troubling friends.

4. Hannibal (NBC): After Harry is expelled (OoTP AU) and Privet Drive no longer deemed secure, Dumbledore arranges for Vernon to get a new, better job and house in Baltimore (unbeknownst to the Dursleys.) While there, Hannibal murders Vernon/Petunia and pins it on another killer. Harry and Dudley are caught up in the investigation led by Will (until Dudley too gets murdered). Harry ends up partly in the Abigail role while still being himself.

5. Merlin: Suffering terrible nightmares after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry ends up purchasing a powerful dream bracelet from Borgin and Burkes. However, instead of erasing dreams entirely, he begins to share dreams with Morgana. He becomes more and more obsessed with this dream world as Morgana loses her mind and looks for a way to get wherever she is.

6. White Collar: Neal Caffrey is the child of Charlus and Dorea. Harry tracks him down after the war. I don't usually like long-lost family fics, but I want Neal to be written as a Potter so bad and he's just squeezing in at the right age to be Dorea's son (born the year she died.)

Set in 1984 and not featuring Harry in any way shape or form, it would have been an Auror story and something to do with the Observatory being built in the grounds of Hepzibah Smith's house. (My stories do tend to be complicated). It would have starred Alistor Moody and a female OC.

Either reincarnation or some sort of dimensional displacement are both fine. Possibilities I think are interesting include, but are not limited to, Naruto, One Piece, MHA, KHR, FMA, Attack on Titan, RWBY, Star Wars, LotR, aSoIaF, Pokemon, Doctor Who, BtVS, and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

However what would make it my dream crossover would be fulfilling all of the following characteristics, which is hard to find.

- Well written
- Good characterization
- Good dialogue
- Not abandoned
- No romance
- No bashing
- Not full of annoying tropes from said fandoms
- Preferably no deities being involved at all. At the very least if one is involved in the beginning, then they are never mentioned again and have nothing to do with the plot and are barely mentioned in the setup.
- Other stuff I'm probably forgetting

** I've mentioned it before, but I tend to gravitate towards crossovers where the main character is someone other than Harry. Almost always the Harry-centric crossovers either has Harry raised by someone else to become more badass, or he's all "Master of Death" which means he's the most uber-powerful powerhouse ever... and I'm kind of tired of all the Harry-worship in fanfics, so I'm all for fics that lets someone else shine.

I'm not sure what my "dream" crossover would be... something akin to [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4838629/1]["Not Quite A Maia"]] without the early goofiness, perhaps.... and without the, y'know, being abandoned thing. It's a HP/LOTR crossover that kind of take a goofier tone with the Middle-Earth canon and sometimes feels a little crackfic-y... but I really began getting into it when Fred and Dumbledore returned from the dead to parlay with Saruman and befriend Radagast.

(Seriously, Fred and Dumbledore made for a great duo. They got some really funny banter going on, but it never felt like they were just one person talking to himself, like Fred and George sometimes can feel like.)

** The main one that keeps crashing around in my head is a crossover with /The Order: 1886/. Maybe because so much story potential was wasted in the main game, I dunno. Either that or the sorta-steampunk-dark-fantasy-thriller-conspiracy setting of the game could do with a spot of magic.

The parallels with the Arthurian origins of the game - and the absence of any 'Merlin' figure in /The Order/, despite having numerous pseudo-magical elements - and Harry Potter I think would be ripe ground for Harry (or another HP character, but who are we kidding, it'd be Harry) to end up in /The Order's/ timeline and start making some waves, potentially getting caught up in a large globetrotting conspiracy while they're at it.

** Hogwarts x Hellblazer is the one I'd really like to see. There's one that got ten chapters in and ended with John seeing Harry for the first time ... ".... Tim?"
