what if voldemort wanted to take hogwarts down from the inside? the youngest of the death eaters, children caught in the wrong time and circumstances brought together by fate, to rise and join the fight against him and take voldemort out from inside the ranks, these are the DE students and this is their story.

** There is a story called The Slytherin Royals on Wattpad. There is definitely Weasley and Dumbledore bashing, but also Bad Voldemort as well. Very well written, 80+ chapters and still updating. It is Draco/OFC.
