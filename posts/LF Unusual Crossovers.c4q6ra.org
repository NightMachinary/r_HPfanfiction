I'm looking for crossovers with fandoms that Harry Potter fanfiction is not often crossed over with. For example, Disney movies.

Requirements (AKA things I would prefer):

- Preferably slash (gen or het is fine, though)
- Harry-centric
- 30k+ words
- “Legible” (it doesn't have to be that well-written, but enough that I can read it comfortably)
- No female Harry (unless it's really good)

Thanks!!!


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the girl who walked on water) is rather unusual. The main relationship is a golden trio threeway which makes sense given the horrors that they went through together (a lot more people died in this version of the war). There's also a Voldemort Horcrux/Bismarck ship, which is... weird.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  Calvin's eleven years old - well, technically, but his shorts still reach his ankles - and not much has changed. Until the letter from Hogwarts, that is. *dramatic music* *sense of foreboding* *bloodcurdling screams echoing in the distance*

** A bit late to the party, I know. But if you're looking for long crossovers, the one I've been writing has 138,000 words so far.

It a Percy Jackson/Harry Potter crossover.
