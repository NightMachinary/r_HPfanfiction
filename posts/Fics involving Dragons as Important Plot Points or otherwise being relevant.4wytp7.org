Can have sentient dragons, dragon animagius forms, Harry being crossed over into another seires involving dragons ( such as Dragons of Perth,Temeraire, Eragon, etc. ), pet dragons, the dragons from the fourth task being more relevant in some fashion, dragon parts being critical to a plot-relevant potion, Harry raised by dragons, draco's name somehow being more relevant than just an astrology refernce, etc.

Basically anything to do with dragons being plot relevant or just exploring them and magical creatures in more depth, I'm in for. Any suggestions?


** Island of Fire by esama linkao3(3236603)

It's the first in a four part series. Written in a unique way, that works brilliantly for this type of fic. Dragons feature heavily.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

** I really enjoyed The Dragonmasters by Naia, linkffn(979216) was one of my favorites. A fairly original dragon rider series (as far as I can tell) with bits and pieces I recognized from others (Pern, Eragon, etc.).

Definitely and oldie, but still good.

Another good one is linkffn(The Queen who Fell to Earth by Bobmin365) and it's sequel, which unfortunately will never be finished since Bobmin passed away. But Queen and it's sequel are definitely still worth a read. Based on Pern lore and some background, but not required reading (I haven't read much of the Dragons of Pern myself, but on my list).

EDIT: Bot got it wrong. Updating the link to Dragonmasters.
