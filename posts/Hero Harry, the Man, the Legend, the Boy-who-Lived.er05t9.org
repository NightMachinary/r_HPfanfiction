Essentially, I'm looking for a fic where Harry fits the title of this thread. I want to read stories about a Harry who is a visible head-above the regular person. The Aragorn or Frodo of the Harry Potter world, basically. Even better if he's the subject of some form of legend or story about his actions.

It can be super!Harry or just regular!Harry, but he has to be seen widely as something that we'd regard as story-tellably star-of-the-sage heroic. Think The Archaeologist by Racke (her and her friends being major badasses), The Sea King by Doghead Thirteen (the town where Harry is a local legend), or Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot (Mr Black. 'nuff said.).


** I honestly thought this was about Harry becoming or being Scott Sterling

** Lequin's Harry Potter and the Last Chance should fit the prompt. Time Travel HHr that was quite pleasant to read for most parts. This is coming from a person who hates bashing and most time travel fics. Give it a try.

In this he is called things like 'KNIGHT OF THE LIGHT' and 'BOGGART OF DARK WIZARDS' and few other titles that will give the plot away.

Here's the link-

*** LeQuin is pretty good for taking dull tropes and making them quite pleasant to read. I'm a big fan of Picnic Panic for occasional tooth-rotting fluff reading. I haven't read this one though, so thanks for the rec!

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

It's a doorstopper of a series, but also extremely episodic. There is an overarching continuity (of a sort), but it's not terribly important except for the ending arc of #3. Good for a mindless read when you need to kill some time or want some basic Super!Harry fixing all the things, but it can be a bit heavy-handed when it comes to imparting a desired message and doesn't really obey the "show, don't tell" rule of storytelling.

Crosses over with a number of different universes here and there, including (but not limited to) Babylon 5, Star Trek (various), Buffy, The West Wing, and The Elenium.

As an aside, I've been having a bit of a rough day and was looking for some mindless reading to take my mind off things, so I think I'll follow this rec too.
