IT WAS ME THE WHOLE TIME YOU FOOLS! HAHAHAHAHAHA!

But seriously. Be your own best fan.

And if anyone has fics with fan art please feel free to drop them below so I can ogle your far superior work.


** Not from a fic but I really like this piece

***** Thats actually a super handy reference. I think I'll save it.

Also look at Edgecomb's portrait being all crooked in the corner. Nice detail.

***** This pic is great. It really hits home how young they all were during the war.

I think I might try writing a fic where Hogwarts is a University and the pupils are all at least 18, change up the dynamics a bit. No smut and any romance will be secondary to plot.

***** I like Marietta's sneaky over-the-shoulder pose. I literally said 'Juuuuudaaaas' out loud like Screwface in Marked for Death.

** I can't get Imgur to work for me right now but here is a link to a reddit post I made when I got fan art years ago. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2xxtam/in_december_a_reader_asked_if_she_could_do_some/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf][Fan art]]

Also, you should post a link to yours! I can't draw anything at all, it's pretty pathetic.

** While I do art for my stories, it's usually just covers and related material, such as for my [[https://www.deviantart.com/honorablebaldy/gallery/62977121/last-mage-of-krypton][Harry of El]] series (a literal Super!Harry). I can't do freehand drawing worth darn, so I rely on cut-and-paste or 3D modelling (both of which I have noticeably improved at due to practice).

Sadly, my skillset does not include original artwork... *sigh*
