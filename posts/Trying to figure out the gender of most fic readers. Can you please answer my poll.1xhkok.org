** Since you're collecting data, it might be worthwhile to expand the survey a little:

Gender; reader or writer; how long reading; how long writing; favorite character/least favorite character; 3-5 preferred ships; favorite genre (use the list from ff.net as basis, maybe); age (use brackets like <13, <17, <24, <30, <40, >40); particular twist (Het, Slash, femslash, harem, gen only, 'my God; they're only school-kids!')

The more data points you map, the more interesting it can get.

** I realize that I know nothing about the kind of people that read/write Harry Potter fanfiction. I imagine that it's a fairly diverse group, but I've never met someone in real life who does this sort of thing!

I'm a guy, late 20's, educator by profession. I've been reading HP FanFiction for about 2 years now, and writing for about 6 months.

** The poll won't open for me... But, I am a lady of 21 years, and this year is the ten-year anniversary of when I created my first account on FictionAlley.org. -streamers, balloons, party noises- Also, if there are any other questions on the poll, I'd really like to answer them too!

** Like everyone else, the link to the poll isn't working for me. I'm a 24 year old guy that makes software for a living. I've loved Harry Potter for years but didn't get into fan fiction until about a year ago. I'm a reader for now but considering writing one.

** Poll won't open :(

21-year-old female. Been roleplaying and writing/reading fic for ~10 years. I'm a hardcore R/Hr shipper, but love to read all kinds of crazy ships, and love love love a good gen fic. My only squicks are noncon (even super dubcon is too much for me), Snape/anyone but Lily, and H/Hr. Cannot handle it. Will terminate reading any fic that leans toward H/Hr. H/R/Hr? Sure! But I cannot do H/Hr.

My favorite genres are drama and good ol' angst. Give me a Degrassi plot and the writing of a Breaking Bad episode. Bam! I really love darkfic that explores the Wizarding world rebuilding after the war, or stark character studies, usually involving a marriage. Shrug.

**** At the moment, I am taken by everything in the DAYDverse, but a fic I really enjoy is - oh my gosh, I've recently forgotten the name and can't find a link to it - I will do more sleuthing and figure it out. But it is post-DH, McGonagall-centric, and she unravels this mystery involving Snape. It's quite lighthearted, but every character is written so well, and it's interesting to see what a deep friendship between Snape and McGonagall would have looked like. If I find it, I will post it!

*** As [[/u/ichooseyoupika2]] mentioned, Reddit is highly populated by males. You may find your numbers changing a lot if you advertise this poll elsewhere. (Tumblr, perhaps. It's heavily fandom based and there are far more females.)

Also, the link to your poll won't load for me. :( But I'm female, 24yo, and if there's any further info that's on the poll then feel free to ask me here.

*** Men are more interested in breaking the perceived bias of the ff community (women oriented) and are participating in the study more readily than the women.

I'll take my tinfoil hat off now.
