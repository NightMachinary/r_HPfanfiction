** I found myself going through this trend during college, when I just needed a brain break from studying and wanted to consume mass amounts of material. I was a molecular biology major, and when I finished studying sometimes I just needed something mindless to let my brain recharge.

HP fanfiction did this for me. I'm not at all trying to say that the stories and authors I read were subpar; I always looked for rec sites and only stuck with really well done stories. But since I was always reading fanfic, I already knew the backstory and the characters, and the 'brainpower invested' vs 'payout from reading for fun instead of for school' ratio was great.

Now that I've graduated, I find I have more time and energy to read 'real' books. I also noticed the fanfic only trend in myself... I, like you, missed reading like a fiend! That much was enough to get me to start seeking out new books. Also, I got a Kindle for my birthday, so that really kickstarted my "Read Real Books!" campaign. haha

*** Hahaha, I had been telling myself for some time that Is what I have been doing, taking a break from reading " real" stuff. But I graduated in December of 09', so I really should stop using that excuse. ಠ_ಠ I have an Ipad that I /said/ I was going to use to read real books with, but it just makes reading fan fiction so much more convenient!! Perhaps I should just stop worrying about it and just read something published whenever I feel like it, even if its only now and again. Or maybe, if I get some really good recommendations, that would inspire me, too! Fanfiction, especially the pairing I read ( usually SS/HG....so indulgent) , can just be so good at building up romantic tension, and I get addicted to it. Anywho, if anyone has any amazing recommendations, I would be all for them. I have already read a lot of the fantasy mainstays, like His Dark Materials, Sabriel, and LOTR, so something new would be great!

**** I'm rather new to the HG/SS myself, but I'm interested the ship thus far! I can't say that I've read any standouts yet. ):

Have you read Terry Brooks? His [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Shannara_Trilogy][Shannara Trilogy]] is quick reading.

***** Thanks for the recs. I can offer some good recs for SS/HG. I've been reading them for ages o_o.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/532103/1/FALLING-FURTHER-IN][Falling Further In]]

[[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html][The Fire and the Rose]] ( it has a sequel, read it too!)

[[http://www.witchfics.org/anna/tango/][Last Tango in Paris]] I'm going to give a trigger warning on the very first bit of that one.. There is one scene that makes me uncomfortable, but it is still quite stellar! Also as two sequels!

[[http://www.witchfics.org/riley/ptq/][Pawn to Queen]] I haven't read this one in forever, but there are some bits in that one that make me uncomfortable too.. It's unfinished, and hasn't been touched in like a decade, but it's such a stand out piece in the shipping fandom that it's kind of a must read!

Hmm. I think those three are really obvious choices; ones you might have heard of already. I wish I could think of some good reads that are a little less know, and I know there are some, but those are the main ones that come to mind!

****** Oh, thank you! I mainly started reading SS/HG because I read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family]] - it's a Snape centric story that adheres to canon as much as possible, but I thought it was just so, so well done. It really opened up the character of Severus for me... I never really got into his character reading the original series, but I loved this fanfic.

I've been reading a lot of older works on my Kindle... I've started reading the original Sherlock stories/novels, and just before that I finished reading through Austen. I have a line-up of classics that I'm ready to head through also. Re-reading them was a good jumpstart for me back into real books! haha

******* Ha! That is a good one.. I started reading it a while back, but I haven't finished it yet. I've gotten sidetracked with Sherlock fics lately. I have the originals on my Ipad, as well, that I need to read. I have been trying to get through the Hobbit, but I get distracted by things quite easily. I would also kind of like to reread Wuthering Heights! Part of my problem is that some books strike such a cord with me that I just keep going back to them, rather than picking up anything new!

** Fine. If nobody else will confess, then I will: I vastly prefer fan fiction these days, and hardly ever pick up a new book. I feel guilty about it, too! I think it's laziness; I already know the full back story of the characters, and so can quickly get into short works that have nothing but plot. (Or porn, heh.) But I'm fairly disgusted with myself and plan to make a change ... soon ... ooh a new HGSS on the Exchange ...

*** AIR FIVE!! hahahahahahha. THanks. you made me feel better. I too, ship HGSS. So good :)

I have gotten a little obsessed with another fandom, though. Right now, I /love/ Sherlock fics. John and Sherlock.. just. awesome.

** Not for me. Sure, I find reading fanfic easier than novels. I don't need as much thought, and I can just burn through some interesting story featuring characters I already know and love. But, ultimately, I enjoy novels for different reasons than I enjoy fanfic. Fanfic can't replace novels.

But then, I haven't read much Sherlock.

*** I don't know what's wrong with me!! I used to read like a /fiend!/ Actual books , that is. I should probably put the ipad away and give up video games for a while. I suspect that probably has more to do with it than anything else.
