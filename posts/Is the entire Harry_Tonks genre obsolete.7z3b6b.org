  A relationship when the age gap is like 7 years is not possible when one of the participant in question is still a 16 year old teenager.

Emmanuel Macron would like to have a word with you.

** So I'm going to hyperfocus on this one particular thing, but I don't think "obsolete" is the correct word to use in reference to relationships.

** Yes, but no?

Yes, for the canonish stories. Eventually, you get to the point of unbelievablily. I'm thinking /harem warnings/ linkffn(For Love of Magic) or linkffn(Whispers in the night)[aside: I appreciate Runes as a magical dead language. I haven't seen them done well for plot devices]

I'm not going to address time travel, as that's another topic that is difficult to get right.

For pure smut, heh. There are no rules for the genre, so it's not going anywhere anytime soon

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** Time travel Tonks/Harry is one of my favourite pairings, a la the currently updating linkffn(Disorder of the Phoenix) which I'm really enjoying.

Clearly OTP material :p

#+begin_quote
  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in Order of the Phoenix. No paradox.
