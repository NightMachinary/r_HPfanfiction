Didn't get any recommendations when I made this as a request, despite being upvoted quite a bit. So now a prompt, in case anyone wants to write about Tom's flaw in picking a ginger to steal a soul from.


** ​

Here you go:

​

Harry pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls of the chamber of secrets. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the first sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, his imagination told him that one of them had moved, yet they did not. Then, as he drew even with the last pair of pillars, a statue as tall as the Chamber was high came into view, standing against the back wall.

Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair.

"Ginny!" Harry shouted, sprinting forward and dropping to his knees beside the unmoving girl. "Ginny... don't be dead, please don't be dead!" He dropped his wand and gently grasped the girl's shoulders gently turning her over. Her face was slack, flushed and warm to the touch, yet her eyes were closed, mouth opened snoring quietly. So, she wasn't petrified... probably. But if she wasn't, what was going on?

"Ginny, please wake up, if you die, Ron will give me so much grief," Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny's head lolled and she started to drool.

"She won't wake," said a soft voice.

Harry jumped, clasped at his heart with both hands before spinning around on his knees. A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, Ginny and Harry like some kind of perv. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him.

"Tom Riddle?"

Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face.

"What d'you mean, she won't wake?" Harry said desperately.

"She's still alive," said Riddle. "But only just."

Harry just stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen.

"Are you a ghost?" Harry said uncertainly.

"A memory," said Riddle quietly. "Preserved in a diary for fifty years." He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there, but there were more pressing matters to deal with. No matter what happened, he was going to get blamed for this.

"You've got to help me out, Tom," Harry said, raising Ginny's head again. "You can explain your weird afterlife later. We've got to get Ginny out of here. There might be a basilisk... I don't know where it is, but it could be along any moment... Come on Mate, do me a solid, help me."

Riddle didn't move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor and bent to pick up his wand again. But his wand had gone.

"Did you see where...?" He looked up. Riddle was still watching him, twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers.

"Thanks," said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.

A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.

"Listen," said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead weight. "She weighs a ton, We've got to go! If the basilisk comes..."

"It won't come until it is called," Riddle said calmly.

Harry lowered Ron's little sister back onto the stone floor, unable to hold her up any longer. "What d'you mean?" he said. "Look, give me my wand, I might need it."

Riddle's smile broadened. "You won't be needing it," he said.

Harry stared at him. "What d'you mean, I won't be needing it. Look, you wanker, give me my wand before I beat your arse."

"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter," said Riddle. "For the chance to see you. To speak to you."

"Look," said Harry, losing patience, "I don't think you get it. We're in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later."

"We're going to talk now," said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand.

Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here... "How did Ginny get like this?" he asked slowly.

"Well, that's an interesting question," said Riddle pleasantly. "And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger."

"What are you talking about?" said Harry.

"The diary," said Riddle. "My diary. Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes, how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how," Riddle's eyes glinted "how she didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her..."

All the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. There was an almost hungry look in them. "It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl," he went on. "But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's ever understood me like you, Tom... I'm so glad I've got this diary to confide in... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket..." Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck.

"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful then little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her..."

"You what?" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.

"Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?" said Riddle softly. "Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat."

"Except for the basilisk, she does all those things all the time," Harry said, shaking his head. "You actually fed your soul to her?"

"Of course," Riddle laughed.

"You fed your soul to a ginger. Voluntarily?" Harry demanded.

"A ginger?" Riddle said looking down at the girl as if for the first time. "She's a ginger!" he echoed in a strangled voice. "Everything was sepia while I was in the diary. I thought she was a brunette."

"Yeah, sucks to be you," Harry agreed as Ginny started to stir at his feet and let loose with a belch that caused the walls of the Chamber to shake.

"No," Riddle screamed as he faded from existence, leaving Harry's wand to clatter to the stone floor.

Harry retrieved his wand as Ginny sat up.

"Ugh," she said, rubbing her bloated stomach. "So, full," she let go with another belch. "Oh, hey Harry. Where are we?"

"Chamber of Secrets," Harry explained. "Can you walk? We've got to dig our way out of here to get to Ron."

"Digging?" she whined.

"Or, you could stay here," Harry suggested. Ron would be annoyed, but at least Hagrid's chickens would be left alone and the occurrence of graffiti in the castle would fall by at least 70 percent.

"I'm coming, I'm coming..."
