I'm looking for this series I read on ao3 a while ago. Each story was a oneshot and each of them involved a different version of Harry being the boy-who-lived. For example, there was a Slytherin Harry, a transgender Harry, and loads of others that I can't remember. If anyone can help me find the series that would be great. Thanks.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.
