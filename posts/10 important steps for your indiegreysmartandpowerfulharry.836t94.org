1. After 10 minutes thinking over his life Harry realizes that everyone is not really on his side and he is just getting used (except Hermione because Harmonie rules)

   1. Harry goes to Gringotts and is the first human being that was ever polite to the goblins. He gets the information that he is the Lord of 24 old families and with a old blood ritual he looks more aristocratic and sexy (hey buys that cool trunk from moody too, because its awesome)
   2. On the train he realizes that Ron was always a dick and never was a real friend, because the stuff in the books didnt matter only the movie Ron is important.
   3. He befriends Malfoy with some "Lord Malfoy its me Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Peverell sorry for not shaking your Hand 4 years ago wanna be buddys", because Tom Felton is sooooo hot oh my gosh
   4. Ginny is a stupid bitch who is obsessed with the fame of the boy who lived so she isnt in the way of Harmonie
   5. Dumbledore the old wise powerful man is too stupid to outsmart the 15 year old Harry Potter who is in a rebellious phase
   6. All teachers need to adress Haryy with Lord Potter because its so edgy and cool
   7. Snape becomes Harrys mentor, it doesnt matter that he tormented students for 13 years because his love for Lily is sooo saaad
   8. If you want a gay fic and no H/Hr it only works if Harry is the "mate" of someone and every realitionship is dom sub. Mpreg is possible of course
   9. Harry gets some cool magical power, like 3 Animagus forms or his Patronus can kill Dementors etc Bonus: Harry likes all the stuff the Author does, for example music films or fantasy books

Sorry for my bad english, i learned the language from reading indie!Harry fanfictions

** You also need an entry for where it turns out that that harpy Hermione had been spying on him for Dumbledore all this time (because he told her to, and she can't disobey authority), and so he finds a different, better woman. Maybe it's Daphnie "Ice Queen" Greengrass, a scion of a "neutral" pureblood family, because no commoner woman is good enough; or maybe he needs one who is magically unique (Tonks) or magically beautiful (Fleur).

***** Ice phoenix? Hah! I will settle for nothing less than a storm phoenix. Not only can they talk telepathically to Harry regardless of the distance, they can turn invisible, call down lightning, do his taxes and create plot related anti-magic fields in addition to the base phoenix package of $59.99.

** 11. Harry's brand new custom wand has a core combination that the wand maker (usually some shady guy in Knockturn alley) has never seen before and those cores help with transfiguration and charms and defence and enhance the flavors of the meals in the great hall but none of these bonuses will ever be mentioned again. Besides, Harry's so good at everything that he could have used dragon-poop for a core and still gotten the same results.

I have a plot bunny in my mind where Harry is attuned to each and every core/wood that the wandmaker has and his custom wand ends up being the size of an actual tree. Too powerful to use and too big to wield.

*** That one reminds me of a spoof I've seen in some fic where Harry's magic got so strong that no wand could actually channel his magic, so he got a repurposed and remodelled pencil from Ollivander. His wand was thus some random wood, with a core of graphite.

On the other hand, the whole thing was a parody so ... yeah.
