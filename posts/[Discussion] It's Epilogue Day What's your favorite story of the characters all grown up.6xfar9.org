** Aside from Northumbrian's work, which has already been mentioned, I'll add little0bird's series. What she does well is make us really care about these characters but as normal everyday people, not as soldiers in a war. I also think her earlier stuff (that is, the stories that took place closest to the end of the war) did a good job of creating organic drama based on character development over your typical good vs evil story. For example, I think she is the only writer I've come across that made Ginny's strong desire for independence (which is a very canon-Ginny characteristic) into a dramatic story about her relationship with Harry and herself.

** I'd like to add the "It's Tea Time" series by frombluetored. Has some of the funniest and wittiest humor I've seen in a while, and I love the depiction of Harry and Ginny's relationship.

Though not canon compliant, YelloWitchGrl's "The Space Between," which is also excellent. The plot includes some really dark subject matter however.

** Ten years ago, just after /Deathly Hallows/ came out, I wrote this fanfic, /[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/latis_mesler/2017_.html][2017]]/, in which the Harry from book one travels forward in time to the epilogue era. I remember at the time I was thinking that Harry-time-travels-to-the-next-generation stories would soon become commonplace and I was counting myself very cutting edge to be one of the first, maybe /the/ first, to write a fic in that genre.

I've just reread the thing for the first time in years and I think it stands up reasonably well from a writing perspective. It was canon-compliant at the time (with Harry receiving a Memory Charm at the end so he doesn't remember traveling to the future), but that's since been shot to hell by /The Cursed Child/. Most notably, the plot doesn't work unless Albus Potter is in Gryffindor. Also, I made some predictions, most of which have turned out to be amusingly inaccurate, about what the Muggle world would be like by 2017. Enjoy!
