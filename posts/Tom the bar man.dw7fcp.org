An evil Dumbledore fic where he is a metamorphogus and creates darklords as an outlet for his evil tendances. In this story Voldemort was a student he picked at random to mold into a dark lord persona for himself. Tom is actually just a muggleborn orphan that owns a meat little pub called the leaky cauldron. Dumbledore used his brother to make grindlewald and a random student to make Voldemort. Tom sees Harry as Dumbledore's next target to screw over and with the help of his old friend Aberforth they help Harry to stop Dumbledore and prevent him from ruining a third persons life.

Weasley's can be simply caught in Dumbledore's minipulations and not anything sinister or maybe Molly wanted her daughters childhood dream to come true and does anything to make Ginny happy.

Don't really care what you do with Hermione, perhaps a muggleborn seeking power to reform the magical world. Perhaps a naive little girl caught in an old mans lies.

Pairings - I have always liked a HPxFD or HPxDG fic, never multiple marriages but you can do what ever you like.
