** [[http://shackinup-sesa.livejournal.com/19584.html][The Shortest Distance Between Two People.]] It's pretty heavy on the Remus/Sirius, but it does chronicle Sirius' time at Hogwarts quite well. However, if by "like Against the Moon", you meant a really loooooong fic then I can't think of any in Sirius' POV.
