Really feeling a need for at least moderately positive content and love "child-again" fics where someone else ends up raising Harry (to his betterment, not detriment). Any recommendations? I'm down for pretty much anything. Also, honestly, even if it's not happy, I'll probably read it if it's decent, so any kind of change in circumstances for Harry as a child. Thanks!


** I got a few good ones

Blind Fury - linkffn(10824203) - A decent story a little dark in the beginning.

No Competition - linkffn(11126195) - One of my favorite 'raising child Harry'

Harry Potter, Squatter - linkffn(13274956) - A Percy Jackson crossover that is also another of my favorites and an amazing story.

Itachi, Is That A Baby? - linkffn(11634921) - A Naruto Crossover, a fun story that is full of crazy shenanigans.

Protecting Her World's Balance - linkffn(11074893) - A Leauge of Legend Crossover and a decent short story. The author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4113329/Gamer95][Gamer95]] has quite a few stories where Harry is taken away as a child.

Quoth the Raven, Nevermore - linkffn(6652537) - Here is a wonderful story of Harry leaving as a young child and finding a family that helps him.

The Founders' Intervention - linkffn(6471121) - One of the first stories that got me into fanfiction.

Hope at least one of these is to your liking, enjoy!

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** Some of these are crossovers.

*Raising A Wizard* - xMCU - Natasha is Lily's sister, and during the SHIELD info dump after Winter Soldier she learns about her pre red room family. Timeline was adjusted accordingly. linkao3(11249700)

*Child of Azkaban* - Well, who exactly raises him is up to interpretation here. Excellent fic. linkao3(15068012)

*The Daring Win* - Umbridge. Yes, her. Read it, it's good. linkffn(12005755)

*Muggle Management* - Part one of the Child Protection Movement series. Part one is short, the rest is... not. Raised with Hermione, starting the summer after year one. linkao3(13695783)

*Accidental Animagus* - Another raised by the Grangers thing, but this time earlier. linkao3(14078862)

*A Chance Encounter* - I don't remember much about this one, just that he's taken in by the Greengrasses. linkffn(7038840)

*Blood Doesn't Make Family* - xSupernatural. Controversal ending, but interesting fic. Raised by Crowley and, erm, 'Loki'. linkffn(8416349)

*A Second Chance* - Sirius gets out of jail much sooner. This fic is a monster, and seems to get regular updates even if I haven't read it all yet. I get distracted, okay? linkao3(16237082)

*Peril's Of Innocence* - Orphanage/Kinda. Good fic that, while it was updated recently, is probably abandoned. linkffn(8429437)

*In Alio Mundo* - Another Sirius gets out sooner fic. Also wolfstar slash. No idea what it's like, it's on my reading list lol linkao3(9848267)

*Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider* - This is a very.... not canon Petunia, so it counts. Right? linkao3(15861804)

  When S.H.I.E.L.D. dumps everyone's secrets post CA:WS, Natasha discovers who her biological family was and that she wasn't born Natalia Romanova, but Mallory Evans. When she goes looking for her family, what she finds is a 6 year old Harry Potter and for the first time in her life she has someone who is all her own. Together, with the family she chose, they decide to raise him as their own. This is the story of how the avengers raise a young wizard, and how they teach him and each other how they all deserve the love and comfort having a family can offer.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Petunia Evans might not have been a witch, but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. As a squib, Dr Evans found her niche: Discovering and exploring tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew as a single aunt.

  On his own one night, Crowley discovers a house where he hears a child being abused by his family. He takes the kid in and adopts him as his own son. The child: Harry Potter before he gets his Hogwarts letter. This is a story of him growing up with Crowley as his father and all the obstacles that come with becoming half demon; along with also being a wizard. (Not a romance story.)

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** Two WBWL where Sirius rescues Harry from the Dursleys:

- linkffn(The Forgotten Son) Dursleys are psychos. Older than canon Harry has first and best friends Tonks and Fleur. The three are now dating each other after a sweet confession scene.
- linkffn(The Green and the Grey) Much more Black family centric.

Three raised by others:

- Linkao3(Elfish Welfare) He gets raised by the Potter Elves and portraits.

- Linkao3(Parsel) Harry turns into a snake on the Dursley's doorstep. Finds a nest to live with later.

- Linkffn(The Bard of Hogwarts) He's raised by and apprenticed to THE BARD! after being placed on the Dursley's porch. Also presumed dead, so his arrival at Hogwarts causes a bit of a kerfuffle.
