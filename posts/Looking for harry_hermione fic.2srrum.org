There is a harry hermione fic i remember reading the beginning of, where harry for some reason is suddenly able to read ron's mind in the entrance hall of hogwards during/after the last battle and knows his friendship was a lie. He then goes back in time and has an opportunity to get revenge. I can't remember if hermione goes back too, but they end up together. I may be getting a couple of fics confused.
