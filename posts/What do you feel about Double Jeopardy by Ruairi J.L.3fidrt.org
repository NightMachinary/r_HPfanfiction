  Voldemort may have won even after his death... one hidden Portkey... one impulsion charm... and Harry finds himself in AlagaÃ«sia, where he appears trapped for all eternity. But there is now a quest before him - fight alongside Eragon, first Shur'tugal of the new era, to destroy the evil Galbatorix. With help from Brom and Murtagh they must succeed... or the world shall burn.
