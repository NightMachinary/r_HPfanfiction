I've been on this subreddit for awhile now and I still don't have a flair because every time I click “change user flair” all the flairs pop up as little white bubbles with no words in them. I don't know if this is a personal problem but it doesn't happen with other subreddits. Even if I click one of the options it doesn't allow me to click the “apply” button. Any advice on how to deal with this?


** In the top right corner, there is an edit option. You can change your flair to whatever you want.

****** That's why. If a sub doesn't have pre-set flairs and only has the option for you to make your own, you have to do it on a computer. Idk why that is, but I'm on mobile 95% of the time and it can get annoying
