Just got done with linkffn (Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) and I'm in need of a palate cleanser.

Any fics out there where Dumbledore isn't stupidly manipulative and unnecessarily secretive but still does all/most of the stuff he does in canon (for good reason)?


** I really liked the Dumbledore in linkffn(Divided and Entwined) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief). In both he supports Harry and Hermione, including her less than legal activities, to competently fight Voldemort.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** I dunno. I think there are several things which can only be justified logically via either Dumbledore being dangerously manipulative or secretive or by him being dramatically less intelligent than he is suggested to be by JK and all the other characters.

Such as the whole Philosopher's Stone thing. Keeping it in Hogwarts, basically openly telling everyone where it is at the Welcome Feast, and keeping it behind traps that are both so weak they can't stop anyone and suspiciously fitting for a particular 11 year old and his friends, ignoring the danger posed by Quirrel despite Snape's suspicions and the Trio's worry about the stone and then flying to the Ministry instead of flooing, apparating, portkeying or phoenix travelling, only to turn up after Voldemort's already escaped and Harry hospitalised, and then hint to Harry that the traps were deliberately set up as a test for him. That to me requires a bit of fiddling to make justifiable. At best, it's a series of ridiculous and obvious over sights and at worst it's Machiavellian.

Or telling nobody but Harry about the Horcruxes, and waiting till Voldemort's back and he had a year to live max, despite knowing he had Horcruxes since 2nd Year and having several trustworthy people around - Moody, Sirius, Remus, Kingsley, even Snape until Voldemort was actually back - who could have been assisting him in the hunt for a solid 2 years prior to Voldemort doing anything more dangerous than sitting in Albania twiddling his ghostly thumbs. Again, at best a bizarre lapse in judgement by an addled old man who keeps secrets and does nothing with them for incomprehensible reasons, and at worst an actively malicious series of maneuvers towards Harry's self sacrifice.

Or, simply, leaving Harry with the Dursleys. He made the choice to do so pre-Sirius' imprisonment, and he did so for ostensibly 2 reasons. 1. Blood protection 2. Keep Harry from his fame and fortune so he doesn't grow up weird

Yet there are dozens of options that could work as well or better, and not involve leaving a baby on the doorstep of a family with a young baby of their own, a family comprising a bigoted Muggle and the bitter, estranged sister of Harry's mum, neither of whom want or expect any contact with Harry, Lily or the Magical world, with nothing but a letter and a shrug, not to mention the promise that in 11 years you'll come and whisk him away just like you did to Petunia's sister, disincentivising her from forming an attachment with him for fear of their relationship repeating the past. Even in the best case scenario, that was a bad idea. To not even check on him once, only having a Squib who neglects to tell you anything of substance about Harry's obvious mistreatment, is bizarre. I could understand leaving him there in spite of his treatment, but only if it's demonstrable that for all 11 years the threat posed to him by the non-imprisoned, disloyal, selfish Death Eaters with no desire to reopen the 1st War's wounds was so great that even putting him with two trusted wizards under a Fidelius or at least some powerful as hell protective spells and glamours to stay hidden would have been insufficient to keep him safe, but that the threat was not so great as to exist for even a second once he turned 11, meaning that Hagrid can leave him in Madam Malkins and go for a pint, no problem.

It's entirely /possible/ to write decisions like this in a way that makes them understandable, but I don't think JK did it.

**** Again this just shows Dumbledore is human. He left Harry with family, but to also protect him from Death Eaters, he also knew Voldemort was going to be back, and that Harry needed great protection. He knew Hogwarts wouldn't cut it(as the books themselves prove), nor could he be expected to be able to protect Harry 24/7. While he did have a horrible time at the Dursleys, he was at least healthy for the most part. The Dursleys never treated Harry as badly as Death Eaters would have. The Philosophers Stone was purposely kept behind weak traps to lull Voldemort into a false sense of security, and if it wasn't for Harry, ot never would have left the mirror. Also you have to remember that a child growing up in England in the 90's, Harrys trapeatment wasn't actually all that uncommon, nor was it really illegal sadly.

You've also got to remember that while I agree that Dumbledore was manipulative, he was human, and therefore prone to mistakes. Every human is manipulative to a degree, and considering that in the end Dumbledores plan lead to the destruction of Voldemort, it worked. So while we could argue black, and blue all day about whether Dumbledore was good, or bad, would you have rather that Voldemort wins. Dumbledore is human, and is not privy to all the information that we the reader are, so you cannot expect from him to make the choices that are obvious, sonce to him they are not.

Also you forget that while he could have gone under Fidelius with two powerful wozards for protection. He never would have reaped the benefit of the blood protection, the same protection that both saved the wizarding world, and until GOF burned Voldemort at a touch. So again Dumbledore obviously knew what he was doing.

In the end I believe Dumbledore was manipulative, but for the right reasons, and that considering that it all worked out in the end, he was right. so instead of looking at it from a readers perspective, look at it from a desperate mans perspective who is trying to do their best with the world on their shoulders.

Not to mention, not ever checking up on the boy? Sending a woman to keep an eye on him who's so dumb she makes sure he doesn't enjoy himself cause she knows it'll upset the Dursleys, and doesn't think "hmm maybe that's a bad thing and I should try to help or tell Dumbledore"? Leaving them only a letter, no money or contact information or even the courtesy of a face-to-face interaction, just "here's a magical baby we expect you to pay for and raise, we know you hate your sister and magic but too bad. Also even if you love him as your own, in 11 years we're taking him back. Cheers."?

That's not within the bounds of normal human mistakes. That's the mistakes of a man who's got a sub-100 IQ, or no basic sense of human empathy.

Further, the only reason Dumbledore has the world on his shoulders is because he utterly refuses to let anyone else in on anything. Endless examples in the books, from

1. Not telling anyone about the Horcruxes for 3+ years even when he had plenty of people who he could trust and a very big incentive to stop Voldemort while he was still a ghost

2. Deciding where Harry would live and placing him there, with a woman who didn't even know he existed and had no reason to take care of him, even while his Godfather was (at the time) alive and free, in direct opposition to James and Lily's wishes. Even ignoring McGonagall's warnings about the Dursleys, and then forbidding anyone to even remotely interact with Harry, and leaving a useless watcher who doesn't even tell him anything.

3. Telling nobody about the Prophecy when again, there were plenty of trustworthy people.

4. Going for the ring horcrux alone with no backup and telling nobody, instead of at least saying "hey Moody, come with me for a minute"

5. Ignoring Harry and the school for his entire 5th Year, rather than just saying "hey Harry, until you learn Occlumency it's too dangerous for us to be close, Volde might Legilimens me through you, sorry"

6. Letting absolutely nobody in on his plan with Snape, not even leaving a message to be found afterwards by Harry or something

7. Leaving Harry to figure out he's a Horcrux on his own, and just hoping he'll self sacrifice

One or two of these things, fine. He's 100+ and running a School, a Judiciary/Parliament and an international organisation plus a resistance movement. But that's all the more reason to delegate and discuss things instead of telling nobody what you know or what you're doing and moving them around like chess pieces. You'll either be super effective but totally amoral, or useless because you're overwhelmed.

****** That's completely your choice to think that in such a way. Just know that he is not amoral, nor is he evil. He is simply human. He never told anyone about such thing out of kindness. Imagine the fear that people would have to know Voldemort is literally unkillable. I'll argue your points, but it's obviois you've made up your mind one way, or the other. So no point. I believe your wrong, and looking at this from an entirely wrong point of view, and not putting yourself into his shoes. That's fine.

Just know that every single point in your list can be resolved with Dumbledore either not wanting to burden others for what he perceives to be his mistakes, fear of either Voldemort getting his secrets, knowing that Dumbledore knows about his Horcruxes, or getting to Harry, or just because he is human, and therefore is prone to mistakes. He's not perfect, and the more you realise that, the more you understand that he didn't do anything out of hatred, or pain, but kindness, and fear.

******* There's a BIG difference between being human and being stupid.

And spending 3+ years twiddling your thumbs doing nothing to deal with an immortal Dark Lord even after you get proof he's got horcruxes and you know he's about is stupid.

It's not kind, or nice, or clever, or even mildly respectful, to treat everyone around you including war veterans and supposed friends like children and hoard information that leads to people's deaths.

Not to mention, if the traps in 1st year were to give Voldemort a false sense of security, then what's your logic for why Dumbledore chose the slowest and least contactable method of travel to leave for the Ministry, rather than say, apparating and being able to return the moment Voldemort went for the stone? I mean, we know he could have done that. Or flooed, or portkeyed, or phoenix travelled. But he flew. That's either because he was stupid or he was trying to give Voldemort enough time to come face to face with Harry. Neither option can be discarded as "woops, nearly got several 11 year olds murdered cause I couldn't use a locking spell that a 1st year can't beat! Well, everybody makes mistakes lol! I'm trying to /protect/ people!"

I also never suggested he did anything out of pain or hate. I said it was either stupidity or a complete inability to understand other people's feelings. Hence him thinking that keeping the Prophecy secret was a good idea, and not grasping that Harry would have been a million times happier knowing about it than being kept "safe".

Why would you leave a baby on the doorstep of an Aunt who never met him and probably won't love him, with no money or contact information, and just a letter that basically says "look after this kid till he's 11 for me. Then I'll take him back but you'll still have to look after him in the summers.

I thought it was a fairly simple, fair question to ask "What possible danger warranted leaving Harry totally out of contact for 11 years, even when all the loyal death eaters were in azkaban and the rest were over the war, but didn't warrant sending a witch or wizard who'd actually finished their OWLs to take him shopping, or at least telling Hagrid "don't go drinking and leave him alone in a shop (and maybe not having Hagrid grab Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (which you know Voldemort is after) at the same time since that's pretty dangerous)?"

I mean hell, I can think of a decent counter, and I don't even believe it. Surely you can?

Nothing I've said is a theory. It's all fact, it's all canon, and I'm asking how you can justify those canon facts as being anything other than, at best, woefully negligent and stupid decision making. If your answer is "I can't, I just like Dumbledore and don't want to admit that knowing the Dark Lord has made multiple horcruxes and having some idea of where they might be, plus knowing that Voldemort is out there gathering strength, but spending 3+ years keeping that to yourself and doing literally nothing until he's resurrected himself and killed a student, before going alone to find a cursed artefact and only then, when you physically can't keep it to yourself anymore cause you're going to die, telling 3 children and nobody else, not even the multiple war veterans and law enforcement officers who you know and trust, is a bad idea" then that's fine.

But don't do this pathetic thing of getting halfway through an argument and pretending you're suddenly above it. We're both grown adults arguing over the logic of a children's book series about magic, embrace it.

******************** And will continue dodging, and antagonising you until you understand that I no longer wish to be party to this conversation. Look back at my post history if your that dedicated. I think I was against Dumbledore for a while there, and for as well. Now i'm neutral, because I have honestly been exhausted by this topic, and understand both his character, and what the world was like back in the 80's-90's. So please continue, but i'm going to keep answering the same.

********************* Do you often do this? Get into arguments you can't win and act patronising when you lose? Weird hobby.

********************** No. Just when in arguments where the other person has already clearly made up their mind. It's especially annoying when they seem to have such a large ego that me bowing out means their right, instead of maybe that it's pointless to debate.

*********************** Do you understand how debate works? Two people with two different opinions put forth arguments and counter arguments. How would that work if one of us hadn't made up our mind? How would we know what to argue for?

If you want to explain why I should change my mind, that would be nice. Otherwise just fuck off because this above it all pretence is annoying.

************************ The probkem though is that there is debating, and then there is whatever we'd be doing, because your mind has obviously already been made. Also I can't "fuck off" since you keep bloody replying to me. That is what i've been trying to do for the last several hours. I'm glad you now understand what I wanted. Took you long enough, but we got there in the end.

************************* Again: how would someone who hadn't made up their mind debate? What would they argue for if they don't have an opinion?

************************** No. You've made up your mind. You especially showed that when you said you can think of a reason for why Harry was left alone, surely I could think of one. That means you've spent a lot of time thinking about this, and have thought both for, and against Dumbledore, and have chosen what you have. Therefore any arguments I bring are most likely ones you've heard while being on this sub for as long as I believe you have. This is why it is useless to debate with you about this, you've already made your mind up about this.

***************************** Why did you even begin a conversation if you had no intention of reconsidering your stance and think it's impossible to change mine? Why reply to my comment in the first place? Had you not yet made up your mind? Or did you think that despite saying what I believed and arguing for it, I hadn't made up my mind?

What was your goal?
