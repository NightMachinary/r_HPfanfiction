** I have two issues, with the story, neither which has stopped me.

First: mapping Hogwarts. I understand why people think they can't make mundane map. Everything changes too much. However, in the magical world, I'd assume that the default is: how can I solve my this problem with magic? Is it really such a unique idea to create a magical map that automatically updates as the castle moves itself around? Considering the amount of effort in the story surrounding the map, this seems odd to me.

[maybe spoiler ahead, to the end of the post:] Second: so far, the math seems to have been focused on physical aspects. The trap at the end of first year was defeated by a physical man-in-the-middle attack. The protection against the basilisk was based on manipulating the physical world. (And that's all fine and good, despite that I don't quite buy polarizing sunglasses as being able to stop the killing gaze). The problem I have is: how do you model the non-tangible aspects of magic? Potion ingredients have factors like "picked under the full moon". How can that get modeled in arithmancy? How do you model age for something like the age-line? I can only imagine that there would be numerous different competing and only sometimes compatible models that people have made.

** I love math, and as a result couldn't get into it. It perpetuated the false idea that being good at math is being able to calculate large numbers and perform rote algorithms quickly. That's not the case at all. Its more about problem solving, abstracting ability, and creativity than being able to race a pocket calculator.

I doubt this will bug anyone else, as it's kind of a niche gripe, but it got the way for me so much I couldn't enjoy the fic in other ways. It seems good otherwise from what others say.

I think you're reading something odd into the context it that simply isn't true. Her teacher can't do lightning calculations, and she is a nationally recognised expert in the field. So clearly that isn't why Hermione is good enough to take her class.

Everything logically follows. If you can do that sort of mental math, you'd find learning and practicing math a lot easier than other people. And maybe you'd focus and work at being amazing at math because of it. Hermione in this story is shown working very, /very/ hard at everything she does.

She finds that a lot of the classwork doesn't involve calculations but instead new concepts she needs to learn, both about magic and how to apply the knowledge she already has. Her classmates come to her to check their math, but also because she knows advanced topics from her very advanced muggle education. And she has to ask /them/ questions sometimes, because she doesn't understand the magic behind some things.

Ultimately, in this story she deserves the praise she gets because of her work ethic and drive to learn, not because of some trivial natural ability.

**** What bugs me is more narrow and trivial than you think. Its the idea that a math prodigy is someone who can do mental arithmetic (not mathematics) quickly. Her big test involves multiplying a 9x9 matrix, a pointlessly tedious task (729 multiplications!) that reveals nothing of true understanding mathematically. It reminds me of a story where a guy mentions to a friend that he's a math major, and the friend responds "Are you in Calc 20? You must deal with /really/ curvy lines." That's the attitude I see in this fic: The author wants Hermione to be good at math, so she can do simple "math" very quickly. Its not that Hermione doesn't work hard, its just that shes not really doing math. Thats my super petty gripe with fic. The perception of math is something I are deeply about.

On a side note I recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yexc19j3TjE][this]] video for a more eloquent explanation of what I mean.

***** It really seems like you just want to hate on that character attribute. That wasn't the climax of that plot arc at all, her lightning calculations didn't get her into her advanced class, and she doesn't use it to show off how good at math she is. In fact, she brushes it off as just a trick. Which, for the most part, it is in this story.

She is shown doing math to solve personal problems and work on projects, but you seem to dismiss that, or maybe you want Quidditch game level details, which would lose most people. I understand what you mean, but it doesn't seem to relate at all to the story I actually read. You seem to be unfairly misrepresenting the tone and content of this fic for some sort of misapplied anti-trope crusade.

*** I both agree and disagree. I disagree because, timeline wise, she has only completed one and a half years of magical schooling. Also, in the last chapter, she did "invent a new colour modifier in five minutes" in her head. So it is obviously working towards that. However, looking at the story, the story is already 200k long, and its only half way through the second year. I hadn't realized how long the story already was. There may well be a pacing issue.

*** I agree. While I haven't finished reading through, I did skip to yesterday's chapter and see where the story was at. It doesn't say an exact date, but the first paragraphs at least are before the climax of second year. Over 100k words for each of the first two years tells me that the story if it were to actually be completed, an unfortunate rarity these days (and more so when the author is writing a second huge story as well), will probably crest 750k, and maybe even 1m. There's a lot of room for the amazing powers of arithmancy. Besides that though, I did truly enjoy all of the characters, so it's worth catching up with and following in my opinion.

** Tentatively appreciating it. I do really hate the thing about seven being the most magical number. It's like saying that two is the most physical number. Sure, a lot of things operate under inverse square laws in physics, but so what? Some things use inverse cube laws instead. Some are linear.

I enjoy the Hogwarts layout issues. Insects turning giant in the upper reaches...well, that normally introduces significant issues with physics and biology, but this is more of warping dimensions, I think, and the effect not extending to people who are just passing through.

*** Unlike in HPMoR, it's been thoroughly established that the magic that causes Hogwarts to change shape and size simply doesn't make sense. It's run off math, sure, but at a much higher level beyond any physics a ~150 year old alchemist whose lived there the majority of his life can understand, let alone a 12 year old math +wiz+ witch.

The thing with 7 makes sense to me, because in my opinion it is simply another Universal constant, like the speed of light or elementary charge. Just because it is a small whole number doesn't change that fact.

in my opinion anyway.

I haven't read far enough to determine that. I've read far enough for several people to be freaked out by it to the point of probably not exploring again.

Sure, but we say "The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 300,000 km/s" rather than "300,000 is the most physical number." Similarly, I might say of magic, "The largest stable configuration for split souls is a septpartite arrangement." Or: "Arithmancy involves a variety of linear equations, many of which have a multiple of seven independent variables." Or even more generally: "The number seven crops up in a surprising number of places in arithmancy." (So does the constant e in much of mathematics, and we don't call it "the most mathematical number".)

Unless numbers have their own existence in arithmancy and can somehow accrue magic or something strange like that, I can't find any way in which it makes sense to say that one number is more or less magical than another. Maybe that will make more sense

***** Someone posted about this story today, and I came looking for this thread, and apparently I missed your message here. Better late than never, eh?

I think of "the most magical number" as more of a name or title, kind of like "the golden ratio", which is often called "the most beautiful number". Can a number be visually appealing or gain beauty? No, but the places where it is found are often the most beautiful, so could the same be said of seven and magic?

To me, it is like you suggested, that the number itself does not gather magic, and instead it might be that seven appears the most out of any other number. So it could be that, similar to how there are four fundamental forces and six quarks, there are seven "parts" of magic, and for the arithmancy to be balanced into an application, the number seven is used to form various ratios.

I think you're just splitting hairs over terminology for no reason. It doesn't really matter whether they call it "the most magical number" or if they call it "John T. Portsmouth", it's just a name. The point that was being made in presenting it that way is that 7 is the most important number in magical theory. Did you at least understand that? If so, then why care about what it's called?
