It's a SI into Ted Tonk's little sister during Marauder Era. Three chapters in and she's already got two horcruxes and bought a house elf to get a third. Not everything goes perfectly though! There has to be some conflict and angst or it wouldn't be a good story.

Also, it's probably gonna be Sirius/OC but romance isn't the point so it might not be there at all.

I plan on making her into a badass explosions expert that the other people call “The Mudblood” because she isn't a brilliant duelist.

“Hey Death Eater Bob.” “Sup?” “You hear about Death Eater Jimmy? I heard he got blown into sludge.” “Yeah dude. I think it was the Mudblood again.”

Also already wrote a scene where she faces Moldy Shorts and he sees the broken horcrux ring on her finger and he's like OH SHIT SON. And she's like LOL BITCH.

#+begin_quote
  A college student is reborn as Ted Tonks's little sister. She is determined to learn all that she can in order to vanquish Voldemort before Halloween of 1981. At any cost, by any means. That intense ambition and utter ruthlessness has the Hat sort her, a known muggleborn, into Slytherin. _____________________I got tired of reading OCs and SIs and AUs that did nothing to change to the plot so here we are.
