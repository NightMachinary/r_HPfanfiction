Each house has a number of stereotypes attributed to the students sorted into them:

Slytherin students are cold and precocious. Hufflepuff students are social and inclusive. Gryffindors are passionate and rambunctious. Ravenclaws are uppity and selective.

That said, Pettigrew was a good example of a Non-Stereotypical Gryffindor. He may have had gall, but he was also incredibly weak and timid throughout his entire life.

I intend to write of an OC Hufflepuff who is not very sociable or friendly. Once someone has earned his loyalty, they have it for good. His loyalty, once given, runs deep. But the number of members in his inner circle of people whom he embraces as true friends worth associating himself with will never exceed a total of three people; and those three will not necessarily be people from his own house.

Edit: another Hufflepuff stereotype is 'fair'. Yeah; my character's not going to be much of that, either. Loyal and Hard-working says nothing to what or whom a student will be loyal to, or what precisely they will work toward.

What are other Non-Stereotypical character ideas you could come up with?


** The stereotype I understand the least is the Ravenclaw one, where I always see Ravenclaw portrayed as booksmart, hardworking, really good students. I don't see how this stereotype stick around when in canon there is mostly example of the contrary with Luna and Cho who aren't especially great students, and Hermione who's all the above but not in Ravenclaw.

Sometimes I want to write a really lazy Ravenclaw, that is really smart but uses it to always do the least amount of work necessary to get passing grades. Someone who's capable of studying a lot, but only on specific subject they're interested in, that has nothing to do with school. But I feel like it's just pushing way too far into another stereotype.

I remember reading [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/ew.com/books/2017/06/28/hogwarts-houses-four-ew-writers-defend-the-misconceptions/amp/][this article]] about the house stereotype which said that no matter how smart you are, it's not really an identity-defining quality.

*** Ravenclaw as the house of overachieving bookworms is so bland. Valuing intelligence doesn't mean hard-working---there would probably be more “smart but lazy”/“smart but crazy”/“smart but only at one thing”/“average but likes learning and pushing boundaries” types than Hermione-esque study-crazed nerds.

**** Yes! The creative aspect of it is forgotten most of the times when it's one the most interesting to explore. Bit of a side note, but I would love to see details on magic painting and music in a fic.

**** I think that Ron Weasley would have made a good Ravenclaw.

Hufflepuff is where all the real dark lords go; why would an actually competent aspiring dark lord go into the house that's known for producing dark lords? It'd be completely counterproductive.

In other words, all the dark lords produced by Slytherin are poseurs, while the real dark lords who rule the world behind the scene all come out of Hufflepuff.

** I'd like to see a character where they are put into Hufflepuff because of the "/Good Hufflepuff, she took the rest, and taught them all she knew./ " quote.

Something like, they don't fit into any one house and/or shows traits from all of the houses in a way that doesn't showcase any one house.

** Just write them as if there are no Houses at all. Like it is a public school. :)

** The Sorting system isn't the end all be all of a person's personality, even in canon. We've seen cowardly Gryffindors and dumb, unambitious Slytherins and backstabbing Hufflepuffs. The Hat makes a judgment on an 11-year-old child who can grow and change with time, and even then, the Hat will put the child in a particular house if they request it, meaning family legacies in certain houses become a thing regardless of an individual child's temperament.

Focus on writing your character as a character first. The house is incidental.

** The best way to write a character that doesn't fall into the stereotypes is to remember that the reader doesn't need to know why a person goes to a specific house. When writing a character and fleshing them out you can brainstorm their motivations, their hangups, their desires, their values, and some backstory scenes that gave them those. If you create a character with fundamental basic drives that will result in them becoming the person you want to write about, house sorting becomes less important.

Sometimes after setting up the character you want, a house might be obvvious and there you go, as long as you started by trying to come up with a Character first and not a Caricature, you'll end up with someone interesting to read about.

Other times especially if you've kept the defining house traits out of your character development process, there might not be a clear house. This is good too. Think about what the character values most in themselves and in others, who they are and who they want to be. Imagine the sorting conversation that they might have with the hat, and make a decision based on that.

Most importantly "show not tell" why a character is in a house through actions that have a purpose other than showing why they are in that house, remember, the reader doesn't need to know that.

** This is exactly the reason, why I like “[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter by writerer]]” (it has a sequel). And yes, reading Wattpad stories without [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][downloading them as an EPub]] is almost impossible.
