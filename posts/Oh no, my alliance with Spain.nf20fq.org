Voldemort is reborn as king henry the eight

i think it would prob be a crack fic but the magical would still exists i wonder what he would do?


** He'd have fewer wives - a lot fewer - and likely no alliance with Catholic Spain, since that would involve accepting the authority of the Pope over England and Voldemort is hardly likely to sign up to that... likely more conquering than muggle Henry managed. Also, maybe less music, feasting, jousting and poetry at the royal court. Not much fun for anyone, in other words!
