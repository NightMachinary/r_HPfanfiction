I just wanted to bring up a point about nitpicking when critizing fanfic, I think it takes away from the actual discussion and ruins the validity of the criticism. I'm plenty guilty of it to sometimes but when I go out of my way to make an unbiased critique I try avoid it.

I hate when people nitpick when criticizing fanfic, no fanfic is without flaw, I could easily nitpick someone's favorite fanfic to oblivion and make it seem a lot worse than it actually is. Judge the fic as a whole, and areas that really bring down the quality of the fic or really lift it up, not trivial details or preferences for where you believe the story should of gone. That being said there are exceptions to this, e.g. Harry drinking a potion to age up temporarily to them immediately sleep with an adult. That is really messed up on a whole different lane.

This was originally going to be comment under a post that was relevant but thought it was worthy a post.

Edit: additionally a lot of the areas people nitpick are case by case really. Some people really like the fact that Harry has an OC personality, others don't. Me personally I prefer OC Harry which in all honesty is a lot of fanfic, some people just choose to go a lot further which I don't mind and actually prefer.


** On one hand, yes nitpicking details can deduct from an otherwise valid point, but on the other hand, as any pet-peeve thread shows, there are a lot of minor things which can be deal breakers for someone, so maybe that small detail is what made them ALT+F4 on that story.

*** You know I think I agree with you, with movies, tv shows, and books, hard disagree, but fanfiction is a much different medium of entertainment than any of those, including books. Most of the time people don't look for a tv show with anything in mind, at least when I look for a fanfic, I look for something specific for however I'm feeling, so I can see how the little details would matter in the case of fanfic.

When I'm looking for a movie to watch I don't go out of my way to find something very specific I just browse till I find something interesting. So maybe I was a bit too hasty calling out nitpicking.

**** I wouldn't say you went too far since that threshold is different for everyone. I had a reviewer who dropped my story on chapter 1 because due to changes I made, there was no "time travel Harry goes 1v100 against the dementors" scene at the end of PoA. Yet thousands of other readers didn't care one bit about that.

** There are few things I nitpick about, but grammar is something that just has to be decent, at least.

Wrong use of their, they're, there... Laying, lying, etc, drive me crazy. I know it's often typos, but even so!

Also, when the author switches between the tenses like watching windshield wipers, I drop the story like a hot potato. Watch your s's and d's...

*** I dont consider complaining about grammar nitpicking, It's an essential requirement to have decent grammar. Not saying mines the best all the time but come on guys, try not to make it so bad that it stands out.

I got to say I'm guilty of the second one, I have a super hard time stopping myself from switching tenses.

**** I find it particularly annoying when authors do one paragraph in past tense, then switch over to present tense, for some inexplicable reason.

For some, it's probably some kind of stylistic choice, but it's almost never a good idea, and extremely difficult to do well. Pick a tense, and stick with it!
