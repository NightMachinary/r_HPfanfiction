I'd like to see them do stuff like referencing memes / recreating funny videos (vine/ tik tok) / roleplaying / doing crazy muggle stuff that not one gets but them. (for reference in Youtube, Anthpo has that energy I'm looking for)

Basically, Hogwarts students/teachers reacting to modern muggleborns at school XD

Doesn't matter if it's complete or not, I just want to read as many fics that are like this


** List of Things Hogwarts Students are no Longer Allowed to Do:

1. Replace spell incantations with "Pew-pew".
2. Create moving pictures or portraits of Professor McGonagall speaking broken English.

   1. Not Mrs Norris, either. -- Argus Filch
   2. Not Crookshanks, either. -- Hermione Granger

3. Perform the Coffin Dance or the accompanying melody on any deathday or Halloween festivities.
4. Order the House-Elves to dance Gangnam Style.

   1. Not the Coffin Dance, either.

Furthermore, please be reminded that:

1. An arrow to the knee is not an acceptable excuse for missed classes or late assignments.
2. Dogs are not permitted as pets at Hogwarts at this time. This includes the Shiba Inu breed.

** ".... who in Merlin's name spellotaped a slice of toast to the Whomping Willow?"

"Look, James got a howler!" "WE ARE NO STRANGERS TO LOVE..." "Not again!"

"One does not simply.. Go to the Headmaster's office."

And here's the fanon trope one: "May I interest you in this bag of holding, unlimited space, for just 200 galleons?" "Shut up and take my money!"
