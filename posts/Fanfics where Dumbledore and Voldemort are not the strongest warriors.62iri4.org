I want to see some fics where there are people who eclipse Dumbledore and Voldemort in terms of strength/skill/magical repertoire.\\
eg. Kaleidoscope (Nicky Flamel)\\
eg. Denarian Series (Maeve and the other fae)\\
and I don't want this to be in a " haha Dumblefart and Moldypork ain't shit hurrdurr the USA has so many stronger wizzurds" way.

I want to see AD as good as he is in canon, or better. THEN show him up with someone even better.\\
Anything?

** Potential canon candidates:

- Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel - linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518), perhaps

- the Founders of Hogwarts

- Merlin

- Herpo the Foul - tragically underused, he's a brief threat in linkffn(A Butterfly Effect by SlyGoddess) but the story stopped updating before we really got a full taste of it

and special honorable mention for Muirgen as seen in linkffn(A Long Journey Home)

Also you might consider Harry the hybrid Norse demi-god from Vanir's [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][HP and the Midnight Sun]]

** Linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold) fits the bill.

It's part of an unfinished trilogy that at this point I've given up hope on it ever being completed, however it is worth mentioning that the Voldemort arc is finished and an enjoyable story in of itself.

(Quick note that the quality starts off high at the beginning of the Ch1 and then drops sharply until Harry arrives at school at which point it returns to the level of beginning. It's a bit of a slog through but I personally found it worth it.)

** Lords of Magic by Taure is an unfinished story which did not go into the tiers of power among the Lords, but the author intended to make Rowena Ravenclaw slightly better than both Dumbledore and Voldemort. Merlin was supposed to be on a whole other level than the rest.

Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian has Mab, who is much, much stronger than Dumbledore.

Other than that, the Phoenix and the Serpent has Dahlia. Dumbledore and Voldemort are just as powerful as they were in canon, but Dahlia would have ripped them a new one in any fair fight.

**** been looking around but its extremly hard finding non self insert oc like that outside of the famous and recommended fics everyone know already.

the only thing i can think of is crossovers with famous strong magicians like Clow reed (card captor sakura,tsubasa chronicles), zelretch,aoko aozaki(Nasuverse),Yuuko Ichihara (xxxholic), lina inverse (slayers),stephan strange(marvel)

***** Yeah, Kaleidoscope has Zelretch and Aozaki (but AD is slightly better). I was reading a fic where there was a mage council which had ranks: mage, sorcerer, grand sorceror, sorceror supreme, etc. AD was a grand sorcerer and Perenelle Flamel was a part vampire, part Veela hybrid who was the Sorcerer Supreme and stronger than them all.\\
