** I haven't stopped reading a story, but I've stopped submitting reviews to one or two people.

I used to submit a few corrections along with my thoughts on the chapter. Most authors would be quite grateful, but one replied essentially telling me to eff off and talk to his beta. Another took everything I wrote as a criticism no matter how nice I tried to be. Solution? No more reviews for you two.

*** I've stopped reviewing things all together *(EDIT: I mean on FFN)* since I started writing because I've discovered I'm a terrible reviewer (By the horrifying way of having it done to me and realizing I was guilty of the same things). All I ever have to say is either a variation of "I liked this! More Please!" or "I think there's supposed to be a comma between X and Y in sentence Z."

Which makes me wonder how one would go about becoming a better reviewer, since I imagine it would involve feedback, and I don't know how you'd arrange for someone to review your reviews.

***** ...Probably. As [[/u/vardso]] 's linked "test" references, I think a lot of authors immediately go "BUT WHY DID YOU LIKE IT!?" So I try to restrain myself from reviewing if ALL I have to say is "i liked it" (since, really, thats what fav/following a story already tells them) and instead reserve reviewing for when I can say "I really liked the part where... Because..."

I also think its a side effect of the way FFN is setup, (And I probably ought to have specified that I was referring specifically to FFN) where the reviews are somewhat non-interactive (at least in my experience, it's VERY possible i'm missing something.)

I originally started writing over on Spacebattles and having a forum setup where a 'review' is another post that I can reply to and other 'reviewers/readers' can comment on (or not, and just click the button that goes directly to the next story post) is somewhat different than the way that FFN's system of having reviews just sort of be there. I've struck up PM conversations with reviewers before and it's fun, but... there's no way (that I can find) to make that conversation include anyone else that would happen to be interested in what that reviewer said.

Think of: "wow! 2000 words? I spoil you guys LOL!"

"penisman6969: cool story bro.

***** Honestly, it was a pretty engaging story, all pretentiousness aside. It had an exciting plot, and it was the first story to introduce me to the concept of "rationalfics" which I have to admit, are leagues better than the vast majority of fanfics I've read which are basically just shallow excuses for writers to pair up their favorite couples. It's actually spoiled a lot of otherwise decent fics for me personally, because now I can't read a fic without automatically pointing out all the blatantly stupid things a character does.

What I didn't like about MoR was how the author changed big parts of canon for his own benefit. A proper rational fic should be able to work around canon and use it to tell a good story, not distort it.

***** Haha, can't argue with you on that one. He really needs to learn how to tone it down. Then again, I think he wrote that fic with a very specific purpose- and audience- in mind rather than just trying to appeal to the widest amount of people, so that's probably why his writing style sounds so pedantic. It's because a lot of people do really stupid things all the time, for no good reason. Like how Mcgonagall punishes students for breaking the rules regardless of why they were doing it in the first place (remember the dragon egg in PS?), and his only purpose with that story is to point out shit like that. So if you have a MC that literally exists to point out the stupid shit people do and show them a more rational way...yeah, he's gonna be pretty pedantic. I get if that's not your cup of tea though, I didn't particularly love it either. But there is a good reason for it, just like there is for everything in that author's fics.

******* Considering the point of his story was to show how stupid all the main characters are, that would, at best, be extremely difficult, and most likely impossible. Especially since he also used the story as a way to showcase his actual methods of rationality from his blog (hence the name of the story) in a "real life" situation to show how they apply to actual complex characters. With his motivations, coming off as haughty to the general HP fanfic fan is inevitable, but he's not trying to appeal to the general fan, which is why he doesn't bother toning it down. He probably thinks (and rightly so IMO) that anyone who's going to stop reading his fic because they don't like their favorite characters being bashed/ wanted some non-canon pairing that didn't happen/ hate the fact that Dumbledore isn't portrayed as a manipulative evil bastard/ or Harry acting pompous because he's smart, has already missed the entire point of the fic, and it's not worth diluting or changing the core elements of the story to bring them back.

Seriously, if you get past the haughtiness, it's a really cool story with a lot of depth, and you learn a lot about other people and yourself too. I know I sound like a fanboy, but as someone who constantly searches for the truth in my life, I found this to be a completely mind-opening fic, once I understood why the haughtiness was there.

Edit: If you really want to know why people like this story so much, I suggest you head over to [[/r/hpmor]] and ask them. Despite their almost obsessive following of the series, they'd be happy, and more importantly much more able than me, to give that question the answer it deserves.

I think you should visit the sub and give it another chance IMO. Maybe nothing will come of it, but maybe it's possible you'll find it a completely different read from before. I hope you do! I really love this fic :)

P.S. Funny little fact: all the people who dislike HPMOR because they think the MC is too arrogant are actually, very ironically, falling prey to the exact same bias that the MC and author is trying to warn them against. They take any attack on their favorite characters and fanfic tropes as an attack on themselves and what they like, because they don't realize there's actually a difference. This is why so many people dislike HPMOR, because in their heads, by calling their favorite characters stupid, the author is indirectly calling them stupid (even though that's not what's happening at all!) and they vent their anger on the fic. It's one of the things the author talks about in the story as it goes on. Just one example of something interesting you can learn ;)

I've never /written/ an A/N like that myself, but whenever I go back to older writing I always feel like it's crap - sometimes it just takes a few days to set it. In that case, I can see some people putting up a 'I think this is bad compared to the best fanfics, the sort of thing I'd like to write like instead' as a way to signal to other readers from the same community, for lack of a better word, that the author can also see the flaws.

I suppose some of it might also be an attempt to distinguish themselves from writers who post notes like 'This is a great story with no flaws' or 'Please don't tell me this story isn't perfect, that's flaming'.

A lot of it is probably ego stroking, though. I just don't think that's true in all cases (maybe between half and three-quarters, at a guess?)

** Yeah, all the time, both fanfiction and original fiction. If you read an author, you want to believe he or she has something valuable to say. If the author comes off as someone with whom you wouldn't wish to have a conversation, it's hard to imagine the prose being much different. There's so much to read, why waste your time?

The author you mention is among the worst for this; having crossed paths with him and his merry band of sycophants on a popular forum, I have zero desire to ever read anything he writes.

Another story [[/spoiler][MoR]] was like that for me as well, where the author, his attitude, and his antics convinced me he had little to say that I wished to hear.

In original fiction writing, Bret Easton Ellis is unreadable, partly because what he writes is vile (if literary), partly because he goes to such trouble to make his persona that of an unrepentant shithead.

It's heresy, I know, but George R. R. Martin is another I no longer read, largely because of an unpleasant interaction with the guy in real life some years back. (He lives a few miles from me and wasn't always super-ultra-mega-famous.)

****** Other than the comment itself being said as fact, what annoyed me was that so many fans just took it as gospel. Of course you'd think you could trust the authors word, but some reasoning should surely come in. Anyway it took me /maybe/ a couple hours (while reading comments/doing other stuff) to come up with several quotes which are decent proof otherwise. This of course is in addition to the obvious collective knowledge, as you mentioned.

******* The main problem I had with the whole situation is that the word "racist" was thrown around on both sides like the other was suddenly lynching each other on the basis of a single opinion. You're racist for ever thinking she was white, you're racist for thinking she could be black or should be black, you're racist for thinking one description or portrayal is the only true way. All over some stupid bullshit.

For me this is very different from just having a Patreon. There's a big difference between "I make this shit because I enjoy it and if y'all wanna kick a few bucks my way that's cool" and "You plebs aren't getting shit unless you cough up the cash."

I don't know how it would actually stand up from a legal perspective, but for me it's no different than, say, someone who does cover songs on Youtube having a Patreon/getting a cut of ad revenue.

** There are a few things that an author can do that might make me give up on a story.

I cannot stand review whores ("I won't update until I get x number of reviews") - no. Don't do that. It's pathetic and immature. I lose respect for you as an author when you do that. Asking politely for constructive reviews is fine, holding the fic hostage is not.

Mid-story author notes - if you need to further explain something, write it into the story. Tacking on an author note to say "BTW, in this story, So-and-so didn't die" is lazy.

Snobby, preachy, unnecessarily-detailed or oversharing author notes. I remember one note on a smut-fic where the author wrote something along the lines of "everything sexual written in this is fic is either something I've done or watched in real life". Like, what? Too much information.

Also aggressive "dont like, dont read' notes. Warning me that a story includes Mpreg is great; implying that I'm wrong, unimaginative or a homophobe for not wanting to read is a dick move. Even if the warning is for something I'm happy to read, I'm not going to support someone who insults people for their preferences. Even just snotty remarks like "turn around and walk away if you don't like it" gets my hackles up.

There are hundreds of thousands of HP fics to choose from (millions including other fandoms), so unless that story is good enough that I can ignore the bullshit, I'm happy to move on to the next story.

This comment got long - apparently I needed to vent!

** Oh gosh yes. I engage in a lot of review trading or review tags where I'll read something of theirs and give concrit and they'll read something of mine and give concrit. There's been a couple cases where I find the author is just doing it to bump up their review count and barely reads other people's work in response. Or the author is expecting nothing but praise and gets confrontational when you do make suggestions or point out things they can improve. There's been one author who went nuts and started sending messages me in all caps saying I was nothing but a flamer. Needless to say they were blocked and I haven't bothered to look at their work since. I feel the need to point out that I don't leave unsolicited concrit, only people who engage in these types of trades or request it. So for people to get upset or super defensive rubs me the wrong way in these situations and I'll stop engaging with them.

But, I think there's a lot more to that story IIRC since the author he's referring to in the A/N had some sort of fustercluck rant on their profile that started the whole thing. It's also a story that the original author abandoned and I've read a bunch different people's attempts to finished and seen a even more that I just... couldn't care about anymore. Grain of salt, that's all me trying to piece things together from the various references in the rewrites as it all predates my time with fanfiction.

As [[/u/Krististrasza]] said, Joe at least had the ability to make the story actually go /somewhere./ I agree with him about the premise not being a terribly productive one, but I enjoyed his version of the story the most out of all the attempts I've read.

To clear some of the foul air floating around the recent chapters of his fic, I am one of people - if not THE person - who tore apart a half-dozen major holes in Lightning among the Stars by Leonineus. He was then dumb enough to post screenshots of our private conversations to a fiction group we were both a member of, at which point I degraded him further for being a whiny bitch about it and then others tossed in their two cents. He threw up his hands and told me to do better if I could before taking his lengthy sulk. So I am." That's the A/N of his lighting among the stars rewrite and no matter how badly the other author reacted, reading this made him come across as just a douche, and it's like that for all of his rewrites. I've got nothing against his writing but I wouldn't want anything to do with a guy like that in real life.

Also maybe it's because of so many experiences with people who let their personal opinion of a character effect what treatment that character gets, I have a hard time reading a fic if I know the author really hates a character I like. Because then I'm never sure if, when they do something bad or something happens to them I'm never sure if it was for the story or the author expressing hatred of them.

Like it's one thing to not like them or like them as much. But if someone's all like "I resent this character's very existence" , I won't touch it. Even if it is very well recced.

Even typing that out made me irrationally angry.

Someone says they'll post every Friday, then doesn't post for 6 months? Fine. I'll read the update, maybe review, and wait for the next chapter. Someone says they'll post every 12th of the month, and is two days late, with a paragraph about how they had big exams, car broke down, cat pissed on their computer and broke it? I'm unfollowing it.

It might seem a slightly weird line to draw, but I read fanfiction to learn about someone's fictional universe which contains interesting, exciting or otherwise fun/pleasant/stimulating to read, not to hear about the sort of crap facebook is ideal for.
