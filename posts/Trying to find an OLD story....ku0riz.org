:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Alright, so... I'm trying to find a fanfic from maybe 2003? It could have been just before or just after OOTP, I don't remember. So was not written after the 7th book, but after book 4 or 5.

It was novel length, might have been on diagonalley or [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] or mugglenet... honestly I was so active on all of those.

Some details I remember were that Hermione and Harry hooked up for a bit, but later Harry and Ginny hooked up. A lot of details were really similar to the books. There were extensive sections set near Privet Drive.

Honestly, I've never done this before. It was a VERY famous fiction back then, novel length. Had very "harry potter" title, like "Harry Potter and the" appropriate to the story name.

Can you guys help tease out more details to help find this? Not really sure how to go about this, but have been wanting to find this fic for years.


** That's such a wide net to cast when the main features of the story are that it pretty much follows canon though has Harry hookup with Hermione and then later with Ginny.

Are there any scenes/situations or a piece of dialogue that stands out to you and is a little "unique"?

*** Actually, never mind. It was on fictionalley, and it was on schnoogle. I have found links to that, but it looks like they are all down. Any chance those old stories are archived?

**** Unless AO3 picked them up or it's on the Wayback machine it's doubtful. If it's not there then it's doubtful anyone else archived the site. The only other chance is someone downloaded the story but without more to go on it will be tough to find.

Looks like AO3 may have downloaded fictionalley

******** Good to see you found it, clicked on the thread to point you towards the barb trilogy. Definitely one of the original greats, same as the Draco trilogy. Loved them back then, but same as you, not sure how they hold up now. Was a teenager back then after all, and teenager me liked some weird stuff.

********* The Draco Trilogy rings a bell, what was it? And yeah, teenager me liked some stuff that likely won't hold up. I am just getting back into the HP world after a long time away - are there really good novel length HP fics? Maybe even multiple novel lengths? I prefer less crazy stuff, more realistic.

********** Yea, tons. But probably would be better if you make a seperate thread for that request, where you can include a bit more detail about what exactly you are looking for in a fic.

As for the Draco trilogy: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Draco_Trilogy]]

*** I know it is, I'm hoping I can get some help. I don't really remember much, just the basics and that it was really high quality, a really popular series of novel length stuff back then. Any tips on how to find something like this? Was Diagon Alley ever archived? I'll try to think of some features, but it was so long ago...
