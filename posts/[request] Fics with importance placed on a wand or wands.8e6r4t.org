I'm looking for fics in which a wand is a plot device or has unique qualities. A fic in which all wands have unique qualities would be perfect.


** Harry potter and the elemental's power has that, it's complete and a good length, as well as staying entertaining the whole way through.

** I dunno if other writers do this, but any time a create a character and/or a wand, the wand is meticulously researched and very specifically tailored to that witch or wizard. I also take into account whether the wand is a secondary wand used for a specific task (i.e. potion-making or duelling - defensive or offensive) and I tailor it to suit the wizard and the task. I see wands as vital parts of wizarding life. Wandless Magic may exist, but it requires skill and, I would expect, more energy than using a wand.

  The wand chooses the wizard. And some wands fancy themselves insult comics.
