I thought it would be cool if after she became a ghost if the Hogwarts ghosts taught her how to be a ghost. Or if like the ghosts taught classes to anyone who became a ghost, after all most were teachers or associated with the school if I remember correctly. What if it was the only reason Binns stayed? Like he taught the kids boring stuff because he was focused on his night classes, because obviously, there's a lot of history to cover for ghosts.

I know it's vague and a mess but I dont think I've ever seen a fic like that. Any takers?
