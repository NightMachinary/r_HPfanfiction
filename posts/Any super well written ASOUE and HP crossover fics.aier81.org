** I intend to write one someday. In the meantime, there's always /[[http://asoue.proboards.com/thread/29564/arcane-academy][The Arcane Academy]]/, but be warned that it's more written for /ASoUE/ fans than /Harry Potter/ ones, and as a result is a great /ASoUE/ story but not quite so thrilling a /HP/ one.

*** What is your idea? I have one as well but am not sure it'll be widely received

**** It's more of a stray collection of plot-points, like VFD being a society of Muggles who have seen through the Statute, Hagrid getting a pet Bombinating Beast, Uncle Monty discombobulating everyone as a Muggle Parselmouth until they realize he's not magical at all and learned to understand snakes through old-fashioned research, Inky vs Nagini, the Sinister Duo hiring a wizard who knows /Fiendfyre/ to do their dirty work...

The starting point would be that due to a Prophecy that appears to refer to them, Dumbledore arranges to get guardianship of the Baudelaires, and they end up at Hogwarts. (Cue Count Olaf as Defence Professor, because obviously.) Though the Baudelaires are by then much older (this would be an alternate post-/TPP/), this would be in Harrry & Co.'s Second Year, except with a First Year showdown that had gone down differently. The Stone is still in the Corridor, and while Quirrell died over the summer, Voldemort hasn't given up on getting it. This is so that he and Olaf can run into each other running parallel plots to get whatever mysterious thing lies in the Corridor (Olaf obviously thinks it's the Sugar Bowl).

I've flip-flopped on whether this would be book- or series-verse for /ASoUE/, and am leaning towards series, with the caveat that I reserve the right to borrow any detail I like from whichever of the two I /didn't/ pick; whatever I choose, after all, any changes can be explained as Lemony getting some bit of research wrong, or deliberately lying to us to hide something important about VFD.

** Can you let us know what ASoUE means. I'm sure you're thinking "if you were a fan you would know." But I'm saying to myself "maybe this is something I might like? If I knew what it damned well meant."

** The biggest problem I see with mixing the two universes, is non of the Harry Potter characters are quite so incompetent as those of the ASOUE universe. Harry or any competent adult would do away with Count Olaf and his troupe etc. I don't see how you can make any real conflict.

*** You say that, but the Ministry and Umbridge's attitude towards Voldemort in Book 4 reminds me of the /ASoUE/ parents' attitude to Count Olaf so very very much...

Alternatively, there's always the possibly of crossing over not with the /books/' universe, but with the Netflix series (which is what I intend to do). The series has more reasonable numbers of competent adults.
