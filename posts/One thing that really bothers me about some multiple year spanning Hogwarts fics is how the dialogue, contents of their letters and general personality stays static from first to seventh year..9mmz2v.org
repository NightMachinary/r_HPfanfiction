** Sometimes people don't want to read a plausible 11 year old. Eleven year olds are nasty. They're annoying, immature clueless idiots (at least most of them are). So when you're reading a fic with an annoying eleven year old main character, you want to knock that little shit over the head. Hard. Some people can put this aside and read for a beautifully well written plot, but a lot of people just read for the fun of it. And reading about an annoying little shit isn't very fun. Therefore, eleven year olds are often written to be more mature than they actually are

**** Let's forget the good fanfiction and think about the trashy, cringey Mary Sues, the self-inserts, the thinly veiled self-inserts, etc. of fanfic. When people write these, they give this character the sort of life they wished they had: sex monstaa, edgy, emo, kinky vampire shit and whatnot. And people read these to escape their boring life with a boring office job and boring traffic jams every morning and live vicariously through the life of these OP fictional characters.

​

The main difference between the characters I talked about and the ones you did is that although both types of people are annoying little shits, no one wants to be an annoying eleven year old little shit, but people do want to be a comically angsty/horny little shit. Cause that makes life /interesting./ And that's what draws people to read these fanfics.

***** I like your point and for a moment, I thought I was one of those authors. Then I remembered, even though I've been working too much over the last few months to go out or do anything, I am actually gay and my character is not, and I am active in the kink scene, as is my character. Although I did recently notice that my female protagonist pretty much has my kinks and one of my males (poly relationship, mfm) is like my first Dom (he was only my Dom when we were at kink events) and the other male is like my first Dom's friend, who could do everything he didn't but which I needed. Together they would meet my needs. The only difference is, the relationship between my characters has intercourse, whereas my Dom has a policy of not sleeping with part-time subs and I didn't want to sleep with him anyway. Probably TMI, but meh.

I've since asked them not to mention their age if they are going to read because I don't want any legal trouble when I really can't control whether they're there or not. One was, ‘I'm 5'7 and I'm 14,' trying to dispute something about someone being short and unable to reach a shelf. I told them, ‘Well for starters, you shouldn't be reading this. And secondly, I have friends who are 20 and 4'8.' It'll be a while before it's completed. There's a lot planned.

**** That's the reason I avoid angst and the typical romance stories. It's not suspense when everyone knows how it will end and "the road" just contains arbitrary shit that gets more and more unbelievable. But there are plenty of people who crave that (just look at all the slash being written), whereas there is little demand for 11 year old protagonists (or for 7 year epics since those end up abandoned very often).

** A lot of the times....people tend to forget how they were at 10-11 years old. We weren't nearly as mentally capable of carrying on an intelligent conversation and were very much prone to being insensitive twats.

Its why I always. Always. Always. Roll my eyes at every fanfiction that points out Ron was being a prat at 11 when he meets Harry on the train going to Hogwarts and then precedes to bash him for being insensitive. He's 11. He doesn't even know what that WORD MEANS.

You really really really dont wanna be around 10 year olds (Says the guy who often looked after his 10 year old cousins). Just old enough to really get underneath your skin with thier idiocy but just young enough you cant hit them over the head for being an idiot (And cuz thier family. But still. Idiots).

Its why I don't mind Snape's complete unwillingness to be around pre teens (in general) especially the delicate work that potions requires and the general nature for how pre teens tends to act. In a group. Around things that may or may not go boom.

Funnily enough, the only time I've seen writers gets the basic attributes of an actual 10-11 year old down is when they're writing Draco Malfoy or Ron Weasley.

** As someone who has just finished writing first year and is now on second year, this is something I am trying to pay attention to -- not just with dialogue, but tone overall. I don't want to end up in the situation like canon where sticking to a kids tone means that by 5th year a kiss is about as titillating as the narrative can manage.

So first year kept the canon tone -- very few oblique allusions to sex, and swear words were only ever referenced in "tell mode" by saying e.g. "Tracey swore". But now I'm in second year I'm making sure to "advance" the tone slightly, to keep pace with the age of the characters: they are now "permitted" to utter mild swear words like "crap" and some issues of puberty will be directly referenced.

** actually I feel that JKR's language improves as the books go on. The themes become much more mature, and the plot becomes more dramatic. Harry's observations of situations are less primitive and less along the lines of 'ooohhh look at this awesome feast' and more 'ooh, look at that manipulative ministry person sitting next to Dumbledore at the feast'. He becomes more interested with the big picture as the story evolves...

** One thing (of many things) that I loved about the Alexandra Quick series was how you could see Alex and her friends mature. Alex in a particular goes through quite a lot over the course of the series and it shows in the way her character is written. She becomes more empathetic, more trusting in her friends, less manipulative.

Some things don't change; Alex is defined by her character flaws after all, and those flaws don't magically go away as she grows older. But her character growth is quite stark when you compare Book 1 and Book 4.

Just one example (minor out-of-context spoilers I guess):

From near the start of Book 1:

#+begin_quote
  She leaned closer, until her face was almost touching the screen, and gave Brian her most earnest look. "I really need your help. It could be anywhere between here and the pond, and I... I don't want to lose something that might have come from my father. Pleeeeease?"
#+end_quote

From near the end of Book 3:

#+begin_quote
  "You're going to have nightmares," Alexandra said. Innocence looked down. Alexandra continued: "And maybe you'll blame yourself. Maybe sometimes you'll be afraid."

  Innocence turned away, and set Misery back in her terrarium. "I'll be fine, Alex. Mrs. Murphy said ---"

  "Your sisters love you." Alexandra stood behind Innocence. "You are so lucky, to have them around. And you have friends. Like me."

It is so freaking difficult, trust me, because you kind of need to keep them the same, because those are stories and most people don't make a 180° just by growing up, but just kind of shifting into a broader understanding of things and how to judge and behave, how you express the characteristics of those characters and how maybe the same trait is the cause of two very different reactions.

** To be as fair as one can be to most "precocious character" AUs, when authors start out writing the most intelligent, educated characters they can and their only psychoemotional flaw is naivete or being prone to childish grudges, there's not really anywhere the character can develop mentally until the authors themselves develop enough to write that.

I think that with three of the five major eleven-year-olds in the Harry Potter series being heavily abused, an undersocialized bookworm, and a poorly-groomed feudal heir, one of the other two being represented as an oblivious prat whose within-acceptable-standards-for-eleven emotional development was basically arrested until he was almost seventeen, and the last one being shown only when mooning over her personal Jonas Brother until after she was manipulated and eventually kidnapped by Adolf "Teen Ted Bundy" Hitler, readers get a skewed view of what children in Rowling's world are like. If we got a side story about Ernie MacMillan and Tracy Davis taking doubles Charms together, that might be a better representation.
