** I dislike most canonical and popular fanon pairings, and am all about gen fic with rare exceptions.

Canonical Harry/Ginny feels too much like Harry just wants to be close to Ron/Hermione. And Ginny's flaws aren't acknowledged enough in canon. (How does Harry, who was so appalled by teen Sirius and James, feel about Ginny bat-bogey hexing everyone who says something she doesn't like? Not saying it should stop their romance, but it would feel a little more real if it was an issue.)

I found Ron/Hermione's nasty bickering grating from the minute she pointed out the smudge on his nose. I might have been convinced that they made a good pairing if they reconnected in their mid-20s to mid-30s after processing the war and coming into their own a bit, but canonically they got together as teens and had their babies young without ever having much in common but Harry. So no.

I'm a little softer on Harry/Hermione, but it so often includes Weasley bashing that I'm turned off. If you have to destroy the canonical love interest, the pairing isn't so great. (I also have this issue with Ron/Hermione fic where the author's notes go on about how wrong people are to like Harry/Hermione. I came for a story, not a fan base war.)

I don't believe ANY of the Trio, or Ginny, would ever be involved with ANY Death Eater. Yes, that includes Draco.

I don't want to read teacher/student stuff. At all.

I'm not here for original characters. Not even if you name them Daphne or Marlene.

Canonical James is under-characterized, and canonical Lily is even worse. It would be a rare fic author who was able to flesh them both out believably. I'm sure there's a James/Lily fic out there I'd love, but I'd never find it amidst all the weak characterization.

Anything Snape has a tendency to assassinate the characters of some combination of James/Sirius/Remus. Not here to read about how he was an innocent with no flaws and they were bullies with no redeeming virtues who totally drugged and raped Lily.

I don't care for teen Sirius/Remus. Sirius was too devoted to James above all else, and then there's the werewolf prank and the accusations of spying... it's more toxic than I'd want for either. I do like them together as adults.

Tonks/Remus was wildly underdeveloped in the books since Harry only saw their lowest points. It would take a strong fanfic writer to fill in the holes, and I've never seen it done.

That said, the five most memorable romantic subplots I've ever read were a Harry/Ginny fic, a Harry-centric with Harry/Hermione, a canvas-wide fic with Snape/Lupin, a Sirius/Remus postwar fic, and an Andromeda-centric covering her relationship with Ted. So I'm not completely against romance... just mostly.

Keep in mind, the only people Ginny jinxes with the Bat-Bogey Hex are George, Malfoy, and Zacharias Smith. Or at least, those are the ones we hear about. Harry doesn't actually see any of these incidents happen, but from what we can gather Ginny was provoked each time: Malfoy was "assisting" Umbridge in forcing Harry and Hermione to show her Dumbledore's secret weapon; Zacharais Smith was going on about what happened at the Ministry, asking questions that were none of his business; George...well, we don't know what George did, but he probably tested a WWW product on her, and she got even.

James and Sirius, in "Snape's Worst Memory" at least, clearly started the fight.

**** This is a good point. People act like Ginny was unprovoked in these situations and that's what makes her flawed, that she is a bully. When in fact her flaw is her temper gets the best of her and she can be a bit immature. The only unprovoked bullying occurs with Ron during HBP.

I support the ships based on whether or not they work as relationships, not my personal feelings on the characters or how the relationship was written. Harry/Ginny was written with a lot of room for improvement (I strongly disagree that there was no development, however) but the pair make a lot of sense together and are shown in canon to be a good couple. I like Ron/Hermione as a couple in the short-term, despite not loving Hermione, but feel their dynamic would be unhealthy long-term. Bill/Fleur makes incredible sense despite the relative lack of development of that relationship, and I really don't like Remus/Tonks.

Love/Hate relationship with Harry/Daphne (Some really good ffs... others not so much). Side note, I could like (and I guess hate too) a couple just on the basis of how the relationship is written. My main issues are with people who write couples without giving reasons as to why the characters are actually attracted to each other.

#+end_quote

Tonks is perhaps the most interesting pairing you can write for Harry or Hermione. It offers some "we really should not be doing this" factor, but is far less pronounced than let's say any Death Eater or someone old enough to be their parent. It has an imbalance of power and experience but is still far from abusive.

And if you stick to the OotP characterisation, Tonks is a fun, positive character with a serious edge, not the usual angst party most teenage romances in fiction seem to involve.

*** Personally I think that the only thing really stopping Harry/Tonks from working well in canon is their age difference, and thus them not really ending up knowing each other very well. If they would have been closer in age, I think they match rather well. It's a fun pairing to read (allthough I dislike the "omg he doesn't care about just my abilities, he's amazing!" clich√©).

Some of the most popular pairings I think are based on misinterpretations of canon characters too - Hermione is too principled to date even a reformed Voldemort apologist, if Sirius was gay for anyone it was James, Snape will always be bitter.

That said, I do like Deamus, and I pair off unknown background characters a lot.

How exactly would you go about this?

OotP has perhaps the best characterisation of Ginny, but shoehorning it into a romance takes away from that. The "Harry is depressed over the summer and seeks comfort from a girl" thing has been done to death. Going with "Ginny believes Harry about Malfoy when Hermione does not" seems like a cheap set-up for a lot of Hermione bashing. Same goes for "Hermione does not believe Harry about the tournament, but the love interest does".

Taking Ginny with them on the hunt won't work due to the underage restriction. Ageing everyone up (eg Hogwarts starts at 13) is utterly boring and overdone.

I can see it happen after the war when the whole Weasley family is grieving, so Harry is the one who goes with Hermione to Australia. Meanwhile Ginny is going mad because her mother is not coping well and runs off to Harry as soon as they return from Down Under (although that concept might as well be the set-up for a Harry/Hermione/Ginny triad).

Favorite pairing is Sev/Lily. I do believe that if they had simply sat down and /talked/ about their problems before the falling out, things might have worked out very differently.

Dumbledore was of no help whatsoever and only made everything worse, and his only real friend refused to listen to his version of the events (granted, Severus didn't exactly do a good job trying to explain things).

And Remus? Did he even care about the fact that Sirius tried to /use him/ to make what is basically his worst fear true?

Now, I don't think Sirius actually intended any harm to come to Severus, but that he merely didn't think his actions through. But he deserved more retribution than he got.

Sirius got a slap on the wrist for attempted murder when he should have gone to wizarding juvie (dementors are inhumane though so no dementors).

***** u/Hellstrike:
#+begin_quote
  Draco and Severus
#+end_quote

They did not see the inside of a prison cell for even one day despite carrying out fundamental roles in an assault on a school full of children. They attacked civilians and helped to conduct attacks on them as well. They hid in a school full of children and did not wear insignia designating them as combatants. All of those are war crimes and even the Allies would have simply summarily executed them during the war. A more modern sentencing would be a few lifetimes behind bars, and that is already accounting the circumstances (coercion and underage are no excuses for war crimes or murder, and murder/attempted murder is subject to the adult law in the UK by default).

What Sirius did was endangerment at worst (he would be innocent if he can prove that he did not think that Snape would actually come in contact with Lupin).

Sirius did not make the decision to go there, Snape did. He clearly had some kind of suspicion but still went there, hoping to accomplish, well suicide by werewolf maybe? That's like giving someone a gun and call it murder when the first thing they do is put in in their mouth and pull the trigger.

And spending a decade in Azkaban is not enough punishment. Clearly, he should spend some quality time at Hogwarts, that what actual criminals seem to get.

****** Only if the gun is also your best friend. That he would put his best friend through the guilt of knowing he killed/maimed/turned someone is infuriating.

I don't consider Azkaban the consequence for his attempted murder, he was wrongfully imprisoned and dementors are inhumane.

Also Severus and Draco did face consequences for their actions it just wasn't jail. It was entrapment, grief, trauma, etc.

Now I believe that Severus, Draco, and Sirius can all be redeemed but I don't like when fanfic authors ignore Sirius's deep flaws in favour of 'fun uncle' traits.

I bet that's a lot of comfort for their victims. Katie surely could sleep well at night knowing that the person who cost her half a year of her life + later complications felt bad. Because that's how the legal system works, amirite?

Again, it is not attempted murder, it was endangerment at best, being stupid at worst (if he just hoped that Snape would shit his pants and run away). But you know what attempted murder was? Draco trying to assassinate Dumbledore three times. Draco using the Imperius on Rosemerta/Katie Bell and giving them a cursed necklace to give to Dumbledore (and Unforgivables also come with a life sentence). Snape telling Voldemort about the prophecy also constitutes as conspiracy to commit murder while we are at it.

******** Draco was trapped into trying to murder Dumbledore by Voldemort as punishment for his father failing. Draco realizes failure means torture/death.

Severus did bad, yes, he did a lot of bad, his direct consequence is the only nice person in his life died and it's his fault and now he's stuck working for Dumbledore forever and then he's murdered by Voldemort via snake. Yeah he deserved some (non-dementor) jail time but also major therapy.

I'm not going to continue arguing the Sirius thing, I've said my thoughts, I think it's attempted murder no matter how you try to spin it. But I still think he can be redeemed but I don't think authors try to do that. Wolf, Wolf does do it. Hence why I like Wolf, Wolf. Even points out how warped my fave character Remus is.

I'll wrap up: I like Wolfstar but only when they address the problems the characters have. I like Drarry but only when they address the problems the characters have.

I like redemption arcs.

********* Draco was a pureblood bigot even before his "mission". He might not have been cruel to the point that Death Eaters go, but he wasn't a good person. In addition to this, he didn't really seem to care about the reprecussions of his "attempts". Yes, he was in over his head, but that doesn't excuse his actions.

1978-1981 Severus is not a good person. Whether his spy work redeems him or not is up to opinion, but he remained a generally unpleasant person all around during all that time. Marauder-era Severus is a different story -- we get a biased view on it (A Prince's Tale is from /his/ point of view after all) so we don't really know how good/bad he really was during this time, but canon implies that while he wasn't exactly blameless (his association with Slytherin and his bullying of Muggleborns -- what exactly happened to Mary?), the Marauders come off as being utter pricks during this time, so they aren't exactly any better. The one point I think the Marauders went too far in comparision, no matter how badly you think of Severus, was the whole werewolf prank.

I don't think Sirius really intended to kill Severus at all -- he was clearly a malicious bully, but not worse than that. Yes, his punishment was a joke, but I don't exactly think he deserved prison time or whatnot.

I don't think Sirius need any redeeming -- post-Marauder-era Sirius wasn't really a bad person, just reckless and thoughtless. I think Snape's spy work redeems him, as a replacement for prison time (Being unpleasant to associate with doesn't make you evil, just a jerk). Canon Draco isn't redeemed, but we don't know what happened in the future.

** I dislike wolfstar and Remus Tonks. I don't know why, but whenever Remus and Sirius are portrayed as having some sort of special bond, I want to stop reading the fic. I dislike this paring due to the issues they have. I don't think Sirius's recklessness is an explanation for his choice to use his friend as a weapon. There's something,well, dark in that incident. I don't know what kind of person uses his friend to pull such a prank. I dislike Remus Tonks because in most fics characters seem twisted to make them a couple. Tonks doesn't seem to understand Remus. Fernwithy's portrayal of this relationship was the only one I liked. Shimotsuki11 also did a pretty good jobwith it, since they don't end up in bed after a few chapters like in most fics, though her Tonks annoyed me at certain points. And I'm not very fond of the opposites attract idea. I like Remus Lily, though I've never read a fic that focuses on these two. I also like Harry Ginny.

*** Can you give an example of a Remus/Snape that portrays the pairing realistically? The only way I can see this pairing actually happen in a kind-of plausible way is if the werewolf prank actually infected Severus, and that they end up friends, eventually lovers, bonding over their similar issues (not some werewolf mate silliness) with Remus having a falling out from the Marauders.

Just curious.

**** I can't remember the fics I read the pairing in because I have only read them as a side pairing in Drarry fics. The general theme I have seen is that they do not hate each other as kids and start to fall in love sometime while working together in the Order.

If I were to write it, I would probably start with Remus apologising to Severus for the werewolf incidence, feeling too responsible. Then maybe he catches Severus in a vulnerable moment (but Severus does not notice him) and starts feeling bad everytime his friends tease Sev and keeps apologizing. Potions tutoring could be involved. But they don't move past friendship at the time, even though both of them develop certain feelings (Or maybe they kiss once and that's when Severus pushes him away). However, Remus actively starts pursuing Severus when he teaches at Hogwarts.

** My favorites are Tom Riddle/Harry, Harry/any Slytherin that isn't Daphne or Draco, any non-Snape Marauders era pairing, and Grindelwald/Dumbledore.

The Marauders are super fun and varying the dynamics with explicit relationships rather than Sirius's potential pining for James or get together Wolfstar or any Regulus pairing that isn't Snape just makes that era so much deeper. I also adore all of the characters which helps a lot.

Least favorites are H/Hr and Snarry. H/Hr doesn't work for me and often ignores Ron's importance. I just can't get out GoF from my head where H/Hr didn't seem to actually enjoy each other's company.

I dislike Snarry because it's a teacher/student relationship, Snape's obsession with Lily, and I despise Snape.
