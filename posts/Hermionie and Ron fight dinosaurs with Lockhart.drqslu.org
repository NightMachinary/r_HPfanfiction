Also when Harry's in the graveyard, Lockhart says something like riding the plot to get to Harry. The summary includes something like “now being written by Lockhart”. Lockhart is competent and Hermione is Lockhart's protege or something.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
