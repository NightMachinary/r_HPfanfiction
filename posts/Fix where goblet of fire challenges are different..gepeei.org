:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Any fics where the challenges are different are of interest to me but I'm looking for one specific one where the under water task involves unlocking a treasure chest with boiling water, ice, regular water, and maybe something else? I think this fic divides it into a trial of air, trial of fire, trial of water, trial of earth but I'm not positive that might be a different fic. If it does though the trial of earth involves giant earth golems and maybe sand worms, the trial of air involves a broom race, and I don't remember what fire would have been. This might also be a fic where Harry makes brooms?

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) The four challenges are a lot different. Pretty sure this is also true of linkao3(The Accidental Animagus), but it's been a while since I've read that.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG.
