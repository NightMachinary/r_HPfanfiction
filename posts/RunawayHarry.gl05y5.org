I really enjoy runaway harry. it can be for any reason - Dursley abuse, sick on the wizarding worlds, etc.- but I'm looking for more fics about this, preferably where he ends up on the streets or other survival situation, but other scenarios are welcome. I'm open to *any pairing* and I like *crossovers too*. Preferably *complete*.

** Dark Gold by Toni42

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11412814/1/0]]

Summery:

At the tender age of four, Harry ran away when he realized the Dursley's would never love him like they loved Dudley. Hermione ran away when she began getting bullied, thinking her parents to deserve better. Ron ran away when his mother favored his sister over him. Three children on the run, thinking themselves worthless, stupid, little freaks... but the Trio are meant to be together. They shall travel the world, seeing and learning amazing things, unaware of how the Wizarding World was searching for them. In this world, they are still gold, but not entirely. Just a... darker gold. The Wizarding World is in for a shock... meet the Dark Gold Trio, my friends.

** Check out the author DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan on ao3.

Xe wrote several fics where Harry runs away as a child and does not go to Hogwarts.

Be warned that the fics are full of Gryffindor bashing and usually feature evil manipulative Dumbledore and a Snape who can do no wrong and is Harry's only true friend. Really annoying after the second story.

Because of these issues I have not been able to stomach more than "Fixing Past Mistakes", "Willing" and "A New Place to Stay", so I cannot recommend one story over another. I think you could give "Willing" a try. "Willing" is HP/SS with a teenage Harry so mildly icky on this count. I like it mainly for its creative use of wandless magic in combat and that it is finished. linkao3(996493)

** The premise of linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) is that he runs away at age five (in cat form), but he's only on the streets for a few months before being taken in by the Grangers. From that point onward, he has a home and in fact becomes much better adjusted than canon (but has more challenging villains to face).

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

  Harry James Potter discovered he could change his face, so he did the smart thing, he ran away. He lived on the streets for years, learning to hide in plain sight, always wondering just what these powers are and who he was. One day, finally caught by the Magical society, he's thrust into a new world where the answers he wants await him. Oh & please leave a Review, my ego needs it.

  Little Harry Potter was not the biggest fan of his own life, but what could he possibly do about it? Escaping to play video games in the dark of night helps... but only a little. A Gamer Fic.

** linkffn(Rules of the Game) been a while since I read this so I can't attest for quality. However this seems to deal with the aftermath more than the life on the road itself.

Also! I remember reading a fic where Harry was on the run with a witch called rowan or something (she was, funnily enough, the descendant of rowena ravenclaw) and a squib boy. It was really good but I can't recall the name.

  Things have changed for Stephanie, can she overcome the new things that are happening to her and eventually win the game. Apologies to those who have started this book but for some reason the site keeps picking up the wrong chapter so I ended up deleting and starting again, again!

  AU. Harry, on the night the first letter came, was dumped by the Dursley's in London. Now, three months later, he is found and expected to lead a normal life at Hogwarts. But, where Harry Potter is concerned, can anything be normal? Mild abuse, neglect.
