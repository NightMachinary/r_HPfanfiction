*** Have you heard of BÃ¤rbel de Bard? She wrote the story of the Dank Brothers and their encounter with some real final destination shit. Features the 3 dank brothers and some weird guy acting all grim-reapery when they jus' wanna cross a bridge

well tl;dr they beat up dem hipster keto-death soy boy and stole his cape (and who dafak wears capes?!), some toothpick and his blink blink! Real ghetto.

** The phrases man-who-conquered and man-who-won makes me cringe so damn hard whenever I read them. I mean I get that people are trying to keep with the wizarding worlds strange inability to come up with non-hyphenated nicknames but they're just so damn bad that I feel my arsehole clench when I see them.

*** I always thought that if you absolutely must give him a hyphenated nickname/title, it should be the one-who-won. It's alliterative and fits nicely because the media was already calling him the chosen one.

** omg that's amazing! I laughed so hard!

I'll say, sometimes having harry be a lord or something is good if it's done /right/ but most of the time it's an excuse to give him a harem and make overpowered!Harry a thing.
