** Speaking of that, there's an idea that I encounter in fanon sometimes: "Death Eaters" are what their /enemies/ call Voldemort's followers, while they refer to themselves as "the Knights of Walpurgis".

No idea where it originated, but there's that.

** I'm thinking that they would feast on unicorn flesh. Or the flesh of some rare or highly-esteemed creature.
