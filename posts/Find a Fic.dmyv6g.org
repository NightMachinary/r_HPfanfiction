:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi!

I'm trying to find a fic where Harry and Hermione go back in time to the Marauder Era.\\
They pretend to be a couple and become neighbors to James and Lily.

I don't really remember much else about it.

Thanks!


** Think this one is called the balm of time by ladylaughalot.

  Dumbledore concocts a cunning plan to travel back in time and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. His untimely death prevents him from going so Harry must go in his place, and take the one person whose help he really needs with him.
