Any time travel fics where Harry travels back in time and actually doesn't care about changing things, I like the plot of him being a Lord of some house / teaching a Hogwarts.


** HP and the Wastelands of Time is sort of like this. In it, Harry has went back in time hundreds or thousands of times, has lived for thousands of years. At the start of the story he's essentially crazy, but his goal is still to stop Voldemort. But there are times he wemt back and just tried to live a normal life or do whatever.
