Just curious.


** In order from least to most dark:

Jinx: spells whose effects are irritating but amusing

Hex: generally causes moderate suffering to the victim

Curse: the worst kinds of dark magic

******* Hogwarts teaches Dark spells, just in a defensive context. This is the argument Hermione has with Umbridge in OotP: Hermione argues that casting a jinx in a defensive context is okay, but Umbridge considers them to be dark arts and therefore completely unacceptable, regardless of context:

#+begin_quote
  Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly.

  “Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counter-jinxes in Chapter Fifteen.”

  “He says that counter-jinxes are improperly named,” said Hermione promptly. “He says 'counter-jinx' is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.”

  Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows and Harry knew she was impressed, against her will. “But I disagree,” Hermione continued.

  Professor Umbridge's eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder.

  “You disagree?” she repeated.

  “Yes, I do,” said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class. “Mr. Slinkhard doesn't like jinxes, does he? But, I think they can be very useful when they're used defensively.”

******* They learned these curses by themselves, not in class.

When Hermione uses the Petrificus Totalus Spell in PoS, Harry doesn't know of it yet.

And the Reductor Curse is one of the spells Harry learned outside of class in preparation for the Triwizard Tournament.

There's also this quote from GoF:

>‘Don't worry about it,' Hermione said shortly, when Harry pointed this out to them, and said he didn't mind practising on his own for a while. ‘At least we'll get top marks in Defence Against the Dark Arts, we'd *never have found out about all these hexes in class.*'

** *Curse*: Spells that are designed to cause damage, whether long-term or not is debatable. Most definitely reserved for the more ‘darker' shades of magic.

*Jinx*: More playful type of spell. The effect is more irritating than harmful.

*Hex*: I, personally, consider these a minor type of the Dark Arts. While not as innocent as a Jinx, they are irritating yet cause some degree of pain/damage. The intent to harm is there, it's just not as intense as a Curse.

*Charm*: I honestly see Charms as, like, everyday spells that have a purpose to just change things. I'll keep the remark I saw on the internet for them. /Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect./

*Spell*: I see spells as just a generic title.

Edit: Changed it around a bit instead of copy and pasting. Fundamentally, I don't think each branch of magic is set in stone. I feel like some mingle with other branches, such as Transfiguration.

I did write a massive essay on this for one of my works. I can hunt it down if needed.

** It's all vernacular; like old classifications of animals, it mostly makes sense instinctively, because there are a few inconsistent bits. /Generally/:

- *Spell* is a general term for a standardized bit of magic (e.g. the Killing Curse is a spell, but making a glass window disappear through accidental magic is not). There are many spells which don't have a more thorough classification and are thus classified as just Spells; this includes most Transfiguration.

- *Charm* theoretically refers to a spell that produces a temporary, sustained magical effect. If you temporarily make a broom sweep the floor on its own power, that's a charm; it's also a charm if you create an abstract magical effect that you have to hold (the Patronus Charm, for example).

- *Enchantments* are akin to Charms (they are a sustained magical effect, as opposed to a fundamental alteration to the object that would remain after the magic fades), but they are permanent. That cup of tea that will fly for this evening is Charmed, but Mr Weasley's car is Enchanted.

- *Dark Magic* is magic designed to cause harm. It's not necessarily "evil", any more than a sword or a pistol is inherently evil, but it /must/ have harming stuff as its primary purpose; the Cutting Spell (/Diffindo/) can definitely kill you, but it can just as easily (and is /meant/ to) cut carrots or fabric, so it's not Dark Magic.

- *Jinxes* usually mean small spells of impish intent. They're technically Dark Magic (as their sole intent is to cause harm), but they'll never kill or maim you, just inconvenience you for a while. Naturally, a Jinx can simultaneously be what you'd normally consider a Charm, were it not for what you're using it for; making bogey into bats, if you look at it abstractly, is just charming matter to move.

- Here we see the "it's all an informal oral tradition" thing come up because you also have a completely different type of *Jinx* that instead refers to an area-wide, Dark Enchantment. What we usually call the Curse on the Defence Professorship of Hogwarts is canonically called a "Jinx", and when a mad Dark Wizard animated an entire forest into man-eating monsters to murder his opposing Quidditch team, that was a Tree-Animating Hinx.

- *Hexes* are akin to Jinxes, but may cause less "slapsticky" harm. Again the key to the distinction with curses is informal; a lot of Hexes you could imagine to be Curses, but they're considered Hexes because they're "harmless" --- they may hurt you but under normal circumstances won't kill you, nor prevent you from seeking out a healing potion or spell of some sort to reverse it.

- *Curses* are offensive magic, usually used in Duelling; its purpose is to injure the opponent in a truly harmfull fashion. It is actually redundant to say *Dark Curses*, as by definition a curse is Dark Magic, but the phrase can be used for emphasis in the case of curses that aren't just utilitarian (akin to Charms in all but use), but are designed in a deliberately /evil/ fashion --- e.g. /Sectumsempra/, which not only maims you, but is specifically designed to prevent the reversion of the damage in time to save the victim.

Enchantments seem to more of a different method of casting than different spells altogether.

  If we're staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,' she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: it was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing.

I would say that the definition is wider than that. See "Anti-Disapparition Jinx" or "My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts". Those aren't things related to directly causing harm.

**** - I don't see how "Anti-Disapparition Jinx" really breaks my definitions. I /have/ said that, being all vernacular as opposed to hard scientific theory, there /are/ a couple of bumps where it /sort/-of fits but not quite; Anti-Disapparition is simply one where it's classified as a "jinx" because it doesn't sound that bad but still inconveniences people, despite having uses not related to pranking.

- Well, different spells are cast different ways, aren't they? But that's /area/ enchantments you refer to, anyway. We never see any other charms or curses that affect /areas/ being cast, so it's hard to say whether what we're seeing is unique to enchantments, or unique to area spells (of any radius and durability). I mean, you certainly would not charm a /car/ by walking around... /through/ the car, would you? I see no reason you wouldn't just cast the spells /at/ the car like you would for Charms.

- "Dark Wizard" and "Dark Magic" are two different concepts, again because it's more of a tradition than a strict system. Dark Magic as such is magic that deliberately causes harm, but a Dark Wizard isn't someone who /only/ uses Dark Magic, it's someone who /deliberately harms others/ (or achieves some other foul deed) using magic, Dark /and/ otherwise. Besides, Dark Magic /would/ be useful in getting through Gringotts. When I say it causes harm, it doesn't /necessarily/ have to harm to /living beings/; /Fiendfyre/ used on an enchanted wall is still Dark Magic.

I think you misenderstood me. I didn't mean that enchantements have a special method for casting. I meant enchanting is a special method of casting spells and not a separate category of spells. Notice that among those protective enchantements we have Muffilato and a Protego variation.

The rest is getting too heavy into semantics even for discussion about semantics (because it goes into what can be described as primarily created to cause harm), so I think I will pass here.

** Aren't all forms of damaging magics considered the dark arts per Pottermore? I mean, that was my biggest hang ups with "dark Harry" stories. Any NEWT student is already very well versed in the dark arts. Canon Harry Potter is very knowledgeable about the dark arts.

My headcanon has jinxes as dark magic easy to reverse with general magic, hexes more difficult, and curses requiring a specialized, specific counter curse. E.G jinxes being neatly resolved by a finite incantatem or the jinx's counter jinx, hexes requiring more mastery of the counter spell, and curses requiring specialized counter curses - if such a counter spell has been created. See the withering type curse placed on the resurrection stone - which was unable to be cured despite being studied by masters of the dark arts such as Snape or Dumbledore, or the curse Tom Riddle placed on his other horcruxes to prevent them from destruction unless completely exposed to un-reparable magic like fiendfyre or basilisk venom.

For dark magic in flight proper mastery of the shield charm defends you, or you counter the spell with its counter curse before it gets there, see the famous Dumbledore-Voldemort duel and Snape-McGonagall duels where spells are being countered then returned in turn

**** It's a bit of both, actually. Just stuffing your soul-shard into an object won't make it invulnerable (see Harry), any more than it makes your /body/ invulnerable. However, it's implied that the basic spells to grant the Horcruxes their durability are additional parts of the ritual that creates them; parts which are not essential to the process but are nonetheless integral to the ritual as it can be found in /Secrets of the Darkest Art/.

That being said, the /curses/ on the Horcruxes beyond their invulnerability were a mix of additional protections placed by Voldemort (the Withering Curse on the ring was clearly an original addition, since the others didn't have that effect upon contact) and the soulshard acting up on its own volition, using its share of Voldemort's magic (the Locket's mind-frickery).
