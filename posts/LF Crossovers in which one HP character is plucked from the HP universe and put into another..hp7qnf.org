I'm not a big fan of fusing the worlds together. But it can be interesting. Examples: MoD Harry has seen many worlds simply because he can't die; in the Percy Jackson universe wizards have a relation to Hecate (Godess of Magic).

But I'm primarily looking for what I'm requesting in the title. I'd prefer if it's one character. Definitely not more than necessary. (So a small group at most.) No bashing. Slash is fine.


** linkffn(2857962)

This is one of my favourite fics, it's a Harry Potter/Firefly crossover, it's brilliantly written, funny and very interesting.

Harry wakes up in the firefly universe alone, and tries to discover what the hell happened. However, in this fic the worlds are fused together but in a really brilliant and original way: the firefly universe is the future of the Harry Potter universe. Harry is the only HP character present, the author manages to integrate some characteristics of the two worlds in such a way that they make perfect sense.

The first time I read it I had never seen Firefly (in fact this fic is what made me watch it) but it was amazing, and I had no problem understanding what was going on; rereading it after having watched the show made it ten times better :)

I hope you like it, even if it isn't exactly what you've asked for, it's a really brilliant fic.

Hermitage - Vampire Hunder D. I haven't the foggiest idea what this anime is about but I was fine reading it. Like the Firefly one somebody else linked, this is actually a fusion but.... kind of not. linkao3(11704539)

A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world.

** Okay... Hear me out. I found this author because they wrote a perfectly normal, fem!Harry time travels to voldemort time, Harrymort fic, in the style of Harry met Sally.

I liked their writing style, so I checked out their other works. That's when I found her series Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus

Basically it's a series of (huge long) fics centered around the concept of fem! Harry being invincible and overpowered and a little bit sociopathic, from an alternative universe of Canon Harry. My understanding is that because Canon Harry is master of death, that in turn causes the Harry in these universes to have those powers and be magically "enlightened" so to speak, since birth.

The main story, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] features Canon Harry as master of death in Lily/Harry's dreams/death. Fem Harry accidentally dies when she's around 5 or 6, and meets Canon Harry in the death scape, and comes back to life because technically she is master of death as well. Doesn't realise she's dying and coming back to life but loves chatting with canon Harry so she keeps killing herself.

An alternate story is fem! Harry randomly transporting herself to naruto universe. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15685944/chapters/36445827][Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds]]

These stories just based on their summaries sound like Mary sue, cheap tropes etc, but I think they're surprisingly well written with some interesting twists and introspection from diff characters. I actually like the whole overpowered Harry thing in these stories, but only because it's balanced out by a lack of moral compass and human empathy from fem Harry which in turn causes a different source of strife and conflict. Being magically strong enough isn't the goal in this universe, its being emotionally aware and understanding humanity.

I'd give these a read. Actually very enjoyable and excellent, thorough universe building for Naruto?!?!? Wonderful fleshed out characterization for the sannin, before orochimaru defected?!?! Adorable baby kakashi???!!!!)???!?

Just. I am very confused by these stories because in theory they sound horrible and contrived and Mary sue to me, but in reality they were very engrossing and intriguing and for once I actually enjoyed OC and development of other characters?!

** I know exactly what you mean. Fused worlds are hard to justify especially if there's alternate magic/power systems. HP is actually better than most since the fact that the magical world is 'hidden' is built in but even then there's only so much I can plausibly ignore, like how the magic world keeps away from Muggles when the Muggle world has superheroes, or Quirks, etc. Or how to feel like the non-HP world is being set up as the know-nothing Muggles, and the heroes of that series are massively overpowered by wizards. It's a pet peeve of mine.

There's one I was reading just today, a crossover with Star Wars where Harry - only Harry - is transported. To be honest I like the early chapters way more than the later ones but it's worth a read!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8259020/1/The-Potter-of-the-Ages]]

This one is one of my favorite Harry Potter crossovers, one where he's the only one taken to the Sherlock universe.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255]]

(There's a slash pairing but it's not super prevalent)

Very well-written HP/GoT crossover.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1565077]]

Naruto/HP crossover where Harry's the only character crossing over until the end.

** I can't believe no one has rec'ed "I See the Moon" (linkffn 8212843) by hctiB-notsoB.

It's Harry in the Avengers universe. Two warnings - it's abandoned, and Harry is, um, not right in the head. But it is absolutely amazing; it's one of the few incomplete fics so good I go back to re-read it at least once a year.

  Elia Martell expected to die in King's Landing, but through some force found herself in the home of a war-weary Harry Potter. She just wants to return to Westeros; wants to see her family, wants the sandy dunes of Dorne and the peace of the Water Gardens. Aegon and Rhaenys are all she has, and for their sake she might have to reclaim a throne that nearly cost them everything.Harry Potter had died in his war and returned to a Wizarding World hell-bent on remaining in the throes of war-time politics. He was tired of Magical Britain, tired of fighting a useless war, but he has a son to care for and no force on earth would stop him from doing so.Raising three kids is hard, raising two of them to eventually rule a kingdom even harder, especially when you're trying to find a way to Westeros.

** Crossovers with one character plucked out of canon and placed into another world.

- /Harry Potter: Geth/ by mjimeyg - Technically it doesn't meet your criteria, but for the most part it doesn't really fuse the worlds together. Harry is plucked from the final battle in Deathly Hallows and thrown into the future, landing on Rannoch(with a sickening splut). It's ultimately revealed that the wizarding world no longer exists, thanks to the hubris of purebloods

- /Through the Wormhole/ by Dunuelos - A crossover between /Harry Potter/ and /Star Trek/. Harry volunteers for an expedition through the Veil of Death when it's discovered that it's not actually an instant death sentence. It turns out to lead to the Bajoran Wormhole, where the Phrophets reside, and through that, Harry immigrates to Deep Space Nine. It is later established that the /Star Trek/ continuity and the /Harry Potter/ continuity do, in fact, take place in separate universes.

- /The Magic of the Force/ by vimesenthusiast - A crossover between /Harry Potter and Star Wars/. Through an exceptionally powerful bout of accidental magic, Harry winds up on Ryloth I'm not sure if this meets your criteria, as while the two worlds aren't exactly merged(the only characters from /Harry Potter/ after the opening chapters are Harry and Lily), they do eventually start teaching the Jedi magic.

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew.
