This story was last updated in 2008, so I think it's safe to say it's abandoned. Normally I wouldn't be recommending it, but some aspects of this fic are really amazing. It also seems to be very underrated with only 365 reviews.

Here are the parts I really liked (minor spoilers):

- Dumbledore is competent, intelligent, proud, and powerful. Similar to the books, except he actually explains things to Harry and is a lot more involved in the events. Really this is one of the most likeable versions of Dumbledore in any fic I've ever read.

- The author's take on magic. So many interesting ideas on spell creation, how conjuration works etc. My favorite part is how magic is being researched and improved, just like science. A thousand years ago a wizard had to perform an hour-long ritual to achieve the same thing a modern wizard can do with his wand in a second. The author explains that by waving the wand and speaking the incantation the wizard is actually performing the very same ritual (e.g. transfiguration of material), only thousands of times faster. Wands aren't just wooden sticks with magic feathers stuck in them: they're actually the magic equivalent of a microprocessor. Which makes sense if you consider how rare and revered wandmakers are.

- Magic world is superior to Muggle world in this fic. I like that because it makes sense considering they have all this amazing magic at their fingertips. Most of fics I read usually claim Wizarding world is backwards, so it was interesting to see a different perspective.

  Some of the things I didn't find that great: the romance, or how Harry randomly decides to be adopted by people he just met. But if you don't mind an unfinished story, this is well worth a read.


** Without actually reading the fic to know if it's good or not, I can tell you that the the sappy letter in the beginning of the prologue is going to turn people away. It doesn't sound like anything Harry would think, say, or write... nor is it captivating enough to make me want to stick around to find out why his 'voice' has changed.
