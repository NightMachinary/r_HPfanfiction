Stories that "could have" potentially happened, that were missing, because we weren't following that character/or after scene.

Anyone can be the main character/can be on any site/any length/old or new

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

** I like “The Missing Moments by Ash-and-Vine” linkffn(12377803). Some of the chapters are bit lame (just rewriting in longer text what's in the books in one sentence), but some chapters (especially towards the end) are really good.
