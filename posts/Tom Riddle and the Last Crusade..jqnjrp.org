Tom Riddle ,obsessed with immortality, discovers an obscure book in the Hogwarts library confirming the existence of the Holy Grail. Rather than pursue horcruxes he decides to search for the Grail even going so far as to keep a diary of every path he followed, ever clue he found. How does this change things? (Obviously I've been watching Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade)
