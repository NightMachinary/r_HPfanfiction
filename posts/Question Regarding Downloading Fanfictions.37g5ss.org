I never really thought about downloading fanfictions until one of my favourites (The Incident with the Thingy or Arthur's Adventures in Spying - BBC Merlin fic) was taken down.

Now I'm worried.

I don't want to lose any other fanfics. I understand that AO3 has a function for it but some of my favourites aren't on there, such as my most favourite: [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=6256][Secrets by Vorabiza]]. Any tips? Apps? Helpful advice?

Thank you.


** [[http://fanficfare.appspot.com][FanFicFare]] has some nifty features. I use it in calibre with [[http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=259221][this plugin]]. Plugin has more features and calibre is a pretty awesome library management system. I have about 6000 fics (800+ million words) in various fandoms saved this way.

Edit: words are hard.

** I use [[http://ficsave.com][ficsave.com]] to download fics from FFN. Additionally [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net][fanfictiondownloader.net]] hosts a program you can download which will download fics from a variety of archives.

*** seconding fanfictiondownloader. It's not the fastest, but it gets the job done consistently for all the archives it supports.

***** How do you give it more than one url at a time? Also, how the hell do you even get it to work? I've downloaded the downloader and I've plugged in the url, but it keeps stopping at "converting".

** For the fanfiction you linked there's a printable link up the top

[[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?action=printable&sid=6256&psid=6256]]

Click it then save it somewhere.

** Secrets was a great fic! I also use FanFictionDownLoader. It supports a ton of sites.

It appears though, that the site has changed its name and url. Looks like it's now called [[http://fanficfare.appspot.com/][FanFicFare]].
