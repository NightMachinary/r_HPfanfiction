I messaged them over a year ago, but it looks like they aren't checking their inbox anymore :(

Also looking for a copy of the HP/Hunger Games crossover ‘The Hungry Beast: Uprising' if anyone has one. I know they're rewriting it, but I really liked it before the rewrite and used to re-read it every few months.
