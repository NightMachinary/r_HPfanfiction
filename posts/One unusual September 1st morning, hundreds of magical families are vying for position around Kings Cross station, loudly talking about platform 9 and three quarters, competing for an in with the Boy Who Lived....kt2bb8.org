**** Na shorter still

As Hagrid flies Harry to the location Dumbledore told him the bike suddenly malfunctions making the bike flip. Hagrid fights for his life and finally gets the bike to work again. He looks down to the side car to make a comment to baby harry only to release that he has fallen out of the car hundreds of feet it the air to the cold hard ground.

***** Strong starting point, impressive ending, it's the part in the middle that leaves me wanting. Might need a couple chapters of Hagrid fumbling around with the buttons, and another of him reminiscing about his youth while flying to tie all that up neatly.

Sorry, I've just read a fic that I was hoping was going to be good because of how long it was, plus lots of comments and likes, and instead it was mostly sudden introspection that leads nowhere and entire chapters where nothing happened. Am still a bit bitter lmao

****** I know what you mean one fanfic I read basically used the same plot point three times in a row after one another, it did not help that it was a slash fic with a couple that I think should never ever be used and the plot that loped was about how much they enjoyed each other's company and how perfect they were for one another in three different settings

****** Is that better or worse than the slice of life fics that have to give a day-by-day account of the character's life?

******* There are some slice of life fics that are pretty good. I couldn't name any because I haven't read one in awhile but I'd say for every 20 bad or repetitive fics, you'll find 1 or 2 that are actually worth reading. But you have to spend so much time looking that most people get demoralized by fic 15 or 16. Or earlier.

***** Have you read that fic about Harry being raised by forest elves? Same premise, Harry falls out the motorcycle and Hagrid doesn't realise and these two elves see this baby falling from the sky and are like “the humans clearly don't want him, this creature is mine now.”

** The third time young Draco Malfoy walked past that oblivious Harry Potter, he'd had enough (especially once the Weasleys joined in). That dense half-blood hadn't heard Draco screaming about the platform yet, and Draco was determined to tell his father all about it...
