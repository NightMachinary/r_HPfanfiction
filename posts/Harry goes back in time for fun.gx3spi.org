I'd love to see Harry time travel but.. just have fun with it! No angsts mission or anything of the sort, just one guy messing around with the timeline.

** I'd like to see this. I recall one where Harry was an unspeakable before the jump, and ended up working at the Three Broomsticks during the first war. Another where he was an auditor beforehand and decides to team up with Alucard. Hellsing Alucard, to be exact.

  Hermione leads a very isolated life due to her two tormentors, Potter and Weasley. She takes on extra studies with the help of an ancient Time turner and when Harry sends them back in time accidentally, life takes on a whole new meaning for her and Harry.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry Potter goes back in time and has to start everything again. Do you think he will be careful not to screw the timeline up? No, he doesn't even think about it! A story featuring a loony Harry and a Magical World that seems willing to adapt to him.

** I've seen one once where like 40 year old Harry goes back to GoF time and he's just like “huh neat” and becomes the DADA teacher and I remember there's a scene where he's acting like a mad scientist brewing a potion to destroy all Voldemort's horcruxes at once.
