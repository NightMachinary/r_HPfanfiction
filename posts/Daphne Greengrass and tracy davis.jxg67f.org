I know that daphne was mentioned once in ootp amdnhas since become the poster girl for good slytherin in the fandom but where did Tracey Davis come from? It's been awhile but I dont remember that name being mentioned but now any time daphne is a main character in a fic tracy is with her. Where did she come from


** She was mentioned in Rowling's list of students in Harry's year, which is also where we learned that Daphne was a Slytherin. As the only Slytherins in that year who are not mentioned several times in the books, it is generally assumed that they were probably hanging out together a lot.
