Something where the protagonist gets bitten by a magical creature is changed fundamentally either by the experience itself or as a result of the magical McGuffin.

I'm not against a "Harry gets bitten by a spider then uses spider powers to make Dumbledore, Ron and Voldemort look like idiots" fic. How ever it would be nice if the actual plot of the series was oriented around discovering, coming to terms with and finally accepting the changes.

Thanks in advance for your time.


** I know that whitetigerwolf has a challenge called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/83467/48607037/1/Half-Breed-Challenge-Harry-Potter][The Half-Breed Challenge]], I'm not sure if it is quite what you're looking for but the basic gist of is that Harry Potter meets a part-human creature (like a centaur or a naga for example) and they become friends (possibly more). There are a few other requirements too.

Have a look around to see if there are any entries.

**** I'm not 100% sure but people sometimes post links to it on the forum or they PM whitetigerwolf so maybe you could send a PM to tiger and ask if there are any.

**** I've decided to make an entry for this challenge, it's called /Birds of a Feather/. Now, this fic is actually a collection of one-shots and drabbles rather than a full-out story but I think you'll like it. (It fits with what you're asking here)

** I've read a snamione fic that did that (with a werewolf bite), but I really, really didn't like it. I admit, the concept sounds appealing, I just had a lot of issues with this particular story.

linkffn(love bites by takumaangel), in case you're interested anyway.

edit: Here botty botty botty, here bot!

edit2: just in case the bot decides to show up sometime, here's one I found just now, haven't read it yet, but seems relevant to your request: linkffn(on crimson wings)

  Hermione is bitten by a werewolf. Only Snape knows how to help. But when she bites him in wolf form, he transforms as well and animal instinct drives him to dominate her. Will they remember what is done when they revert back to normal? Full summary inside

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.

** Linkffn(mark of the acromantula). I don't remember bashing, but Harry literally becomes spider-man, or, as he puts it 'acromantula-wizard'. Has sequels.

** Yay! Another chance to recommend one of my favorite fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by the Mad Mad Reviewer has Harry growing more powerful, but with the side effect of him becoming part demon. Highly recommend this fic. It's not the primary point of the fic, but it does change him in interesting ways and is, I feel, very well written.
