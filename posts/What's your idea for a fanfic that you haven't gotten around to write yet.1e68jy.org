I have a few ideas of fanfics that I haven't had the time to write. Two of them are:

A Harry and Draco buddy fanfic. Humor fic, where Harry and Draco get into all sorts of adventures together including trying to get laid, hooking up Hermione and Goyle together, and recreating the magic school bus!

A what if fanfic, asking the question what if Wormtail had been even more evil and cleaver. Featuring a very abused Ginny.

So what are your ideas?

***** I think you can get around that script-wise, have the scar-riddle appear later on in his teenage years, and the affect of it on Harry means he becomes more mature earlier, so around 14 but thinks more like a 30yr old because of the influence of the older mind upon him. Like a whispering mentor, teaching him spells, experience, ect. Begin the story a few years in (start around his 4th or 5th yr for example) 'properly', and spend the first 2-3 chapters doing a quick recap of Harry's life up to that point, giving you the chance to condense his first 13-14 years down into a few thousand words. That way an omniscient narrator also allows the details of the other Voldermorts floating around to be interspersed without seeming to detract from the regular narrative

** One idea: "Horcruxes or Hallows?"

From DH:

#+begin_quote
  Finally, Bill said, “All right. Who do you want to talk to first?”

  Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows?
#+end_quote

Basically, what if Harry made the other choice? What if he had raced Voldermort for the Elder wand?

Some thoughts for how it would start:

- Harry talks to Ollivander, briefly, but (someone?) deduces that the Elder Wand belongs to Snape. Hence Harry needs to defeat Snape to win the Elder Wand... and he knows that Voldermort will eventually kill Snape if he gets the Elder Wand for himself.
- Hermione wouldn't go to Hogwarts due to her injuries from Malfoy Manor
- Harry and Ron would attempt to get in through the Shrieking Shack, as this would give them the quickest access to the grounds. We see at the end of DH that the passageway is still quite accessible, being barely blocked off at all.
- They get to the wand first and Harry has it. Voldermort arrives, but seeing Harry with the Elder Wand is afraid to fight him directly. Instead he uses the Carrows to hold Hogwarts students hostage; leaving Harry no choice but to surrender his life. He does so, but first gives the wand to Ron who escapes.
- Thus Harry dies. The question, then: what happens next? Voldermort is the master of the Elder Wand, but does not actually have his hands on it. The horcrux hunt is still a secret, but the complication of Harry being the seventh horcrux is gone. Harry will have told Ron that there is one in the Lestrange vault.

A few different possible approaches from here.

Shortest: attempt to parallel the ending of DH, i.e. have the Gringotts raid and then a Battle of Hogwarts at the end of the school year. Problem with this is the lack of new ground it would cover; the fear would be that it would become "in spite of a nail."

Option two: a tactical retreat. The remains of the Order evacuates the country and has to operate from overseas. It would likely come down to some sort of international war.

Option three: an apparent surrender: the Order surrenders, but a few central members go deeper underground to continue the fight. Possibility for a major time-skip on this one, perhaps even an OC protagonist.

Any thoughts on this?

One other idea: is there an example of something well-done with a competent Trelawney as a central character / mentor figure?

** I'm never going to write this, but I had an idea for an "Enders Shadow" style version of the original books.

In the "Ender's Shadow" style, I love the idea of rewriting the series from the point of Draco. Converting Draco to a tragic hero is disturbingly easy. Just make his father an abusive sociopath (which he basically is) and then have Dumbledore refuse to remove Draco from his abusive home. To Dumbledore, it's a necessary evil; He is sacrificing Draco because Draco is secretly reporting all of his information to Snape/Dumbledore.

Finally, a lot of Draco's hate for harry can be rewritten as him trying to loudly warn harry. In the first 2 books, he's constantly screaming "My dad is trying to kill you" which could be rewritten as desperate warnings done the only way Draco could find instead of actual threats.

As the series wears on, you can slowly make draco start to actully resent Harry, not just pretend do. After all, it's Draco thats making sacrifices. It's Draco who is wlllingly getting abused so he can spy on his father. What makes Harry worthy of praise when Draco is doing the real work...

**** I agree that would probably be the hardest thing to sell. I honestly wasn't thinking of having him be reporting information at the beginning of the story. It would have to open with him going to his teacher to "confess" that he was from an abusive home. There would be a long drawn out process into making him actively subverting his dad. You would probably need to include Narcissa as a passive participant, giving her son tacit approval for his deeds.

** I've got a whole doc full :P I have too many existing stories to start any new ones. The one I've harbored longest and want to exist the most is a Professor Teddy spinoff of one of my other stories, also an action-comedy. Hogwarts becomes a hotspot for dangerous magical creatures (think Hellmouth of Buffy lore, if you're familiar with that), and an unenthusiastic still-nontenured Teddy is assigned the task of fending off the creatures until they're able to implement the permanent solution. It's got magic crossbows, students-as-bait, ragtag teams of blackmailed prefects, relatives, and his intimidating sort-of-girlfriend Victoire -- all fun stuff. The action genre is really draining on me though, so I can't see myself actually finishing this if I start; plus, I'll be writing an original story next, which'll have similar crazy.

** How about a post-Hogwarts trio and Ginny epic that ignores the epilogue?

In visiting the harrypotter subreddit, the question keeps coming up 'if JKR won't do a prequel, what could she write instead?

Most come up with the obvious answers - Hogwarts, a History; the next generation; wizarding world in America

My idea?

Part 1: Hermione Granger and the Goblin Conspiracy -

As Ministry foreign ambassador, Hermione discovers plans for a new goblin war. She and Ginny travel the world, tracking down the truth; the war is being provoked by the purebloods, in hopes of forcing the dissolution of the Statute of Secrecy, so that wizarding superiority can be recognised and rewarded. Hermione is captured but Ginny escapes, though wounded.

Part 2: Ron Weasley and the Subterranean World -

Despite their estrangement, Ron realises that Hermione's lack of communication has a more sinister cause. He pursues her, fighting and sneaking his way into the world beneath, reuniting with his sister and rescuing Hermione only to find out that she wants to side with the goblins. Ginny reunites the trio, pooling their different assets in order to disrupt the upcoming firestorm of war, chaos, death and magical supremacy.

Part 3: Harry Potter and the End of Silence -

The war begins, and they struggle to both fight it and reveal its causes. In the end, they have to accept the end of the Statute as they discover the purpose of magic; it exists to repair the damage when human inventiveness exceeds humanity's ability to control it. Muggle and Magical unite to battle the inhuman horde created/released by the goblin-alchemists.

Too ambitious?

** I have a whole list of ideas I keep on Google Docs. One I've gotten the farthest on is a Dramione. It's a take on the Head Boy-Head Girl trope. They fall in love (er, lust) with each other when they are forced to live in the same dormatory during their "eighth year." Gradually, it occurs to them most Head Boys and Girls marry each other after graduation. Why? Soon they uncover a plot to throw together smart teenage couples and hope they produce superior magical children to the enhancement of the wizarding world. It's less barbaric than any Marriage Law, yet Draco and Hermione are appalled at being manipulated thusly.

I've laid off of the story because I really can't decide whether they'd end up rebelling (and splitting up) or letting nature take its course. Anybody have an opinion?

** This is a bit of a long shot and I doubt I'd ever get around to writing it, so I guess it's up for grabs if it tickles anyone's fancy.

I'm on a Persona (3 and 4) kick lately and it occurred to me that just like how the games are largely structured around a month of social interaction with your friends and classmates to power up your Personas in preparation for a plotline battle at the end of the month, rinse and repeat, Harry's Hogwarts years are similarly built: A year of interactions, sideplots, foreshadowing, and getting stronger, followed by a climax. Rinse and repeat. Also like Persona 3/4, there's a metric asston of background characters that he interacts with.

Thus, the idea of Harry Potter's Social Links. Harry/Ron/Hermione as a group to represent the Fool, Ron as the Magician, Hermione as the Priestess, etc. The tricky part is matching the symbolism behind each arcana to the subplot of some reasonably important character (or group) that interacts with Harry regularly.

** Harry Potter Life is finally going well, even though he is still living with his adoptive family, the Dursleys. At the age of 17 he is about to finish his education in Stonewall High, Thanks to his Two jobs he almost never sees them and has saved enough money to move as soon as he turns 18. he even has a girlfriend! his childhood sweetheart, and girl next door Emily Frost, who he plans to marry as soon as they can elope.

But as harry has learned over the years good things don't last, at least not for Harry Potter. One fateful day he is approached bye a group around his age that claim to know him, one boy and one girl claim to be his best friends and the other claims to be his wife... from the future... yeah right.

The idea is that harry never got his letter to Hogwarts. Ron, Hermione and Ginny gen transported back to their younger self because someone has been tampering with the timeline. They find a very different Hogwarts where they don't accept muggleborns and apparently Dumbledore became evil-crazy and power hungry.

They find out that Voldemort returned earlier and Dumbledore had a duel with him where apparently Voldemort was defeated definitely. they of course know about the horcrux and deduce that somehow Voldemort supplanted Dumbledore and is controlling all of wizarding Britain from the shadows.

Harry now has to chose between his (now) relatively happy life or this new scary world these strangers are telling him about.

--------------

Another one is a Kind of crossover between The world god only knows and Harry potter. It's more romance comedy than anything

The Dursleys die from dysentery a few weeks after harry had arrived to their home. Aun Marge not wanting to care for the kid gives him up on adoption and he ends up adopted by a japanese family. Harry grows with an interest in Galges and other type of Otaku Paraphernalia thanks to his Aniki's (who may or may be not Kasuragi Keima) Interests. When he recieves his letter to hogwarts, and discovering that his PFP wont work on school grounds he decides to takes his Galges into the real world and start capturing girls (3D!) so he doesn't get bored.

So each chapter we see how Harry Tries to 'Capture' a diferent girl a la Keima from TWGOK.

Also Voldemort along with any of is followers die of a dysentery plague so Harry doesn't have to worry about them.

** A time travel one that maybe in the future I'd get around to writing: AU with no horcruxes, but the fight against Voldemort continues well beyond 1998 and isn't going so well for the Light Side. When things look bad, HP takes a potion/does a spell to go back in time, intending to try and defeat Voldemort earlier, only it doesn't go quite right and he ends up transporting his conscious to the body of 19/20yo James Potter... right as he's about to have sex with Lily. Harry, understandably, freaks at suddenly finding himself about to have sex with his mother and runs, goes to Sirius, has to convince him of what happened. Lily, meanwhile, is feeling understandably slighted and pissed off and goes to Snape, things happen, they have sex, and baby Harry is created.

That's all I've got in the scribbled notes I made quite some time ago, but I recall that Harry would remain in James' body until Baby Harry was born and then would get zapped back to the future, where the knowledge that he was Snape's son would somehow be important to the defeat of Voldemort, though I can't quite remember how.

Another one I've got short notes on: focused on an OC (or, given that I came up with this pre-DH, could be focused on the Next Gen kids) wherein there's such a thing as the National Stunt Flying Association (NSFA). The story would be about the character taking part in a Young Persons NSFA Championship. Given that this fic would be very much focused on sports and the competition--rather than angst, violence, and despair, which I normally write--I'm not likely to ever write it. If anyone has the inclination to take up the idea and make a story out of it, by all means feel free.

** I've had this idea for a while of a do-over fic staring a more sane Voldemort. I've never really considered actually writing it because I'm pretty horrible at writing anything more than a thousand words (and I'm lucky to get that), but I have considered a few things about what I think would work:

- He comes back at the point where he possesses Quirrell. I don't know quite how that might affect the initial possession, but either way Voldemort spends his time learning what he's missed since his almost death and moving his Horcruxes to other places. The diary he keeps with him, it being nothing more than an old book now.

- He figures out that both the reason the diary is a mundane object and the reason he's more sane now is that he's reabsorbed that soul bit. He thinks that for such a thing to have happened he'd have to have felt some sort of remorse for having done it, which he can't really imagine even now that he's got a good chunk of his soul back (I, like many other fanfic authors, figure that each time he made a horcrux he about halved his soul). He does sort of regret having done it now that he thinks about it, especially considering the additional scrutiny that put on him and any possible bad behavior at Hogwarts.

- I imagine he spends some of his time between his horcrux shuffling and his learning about the world observing Harry. He's reasonably interested in knowing more about someone he's linked to, both by prophecy and by way of a soul piece (though I'm not sure if he knows that part even now). During Harry's first year he doesn't make any moves to harm him, instead spending that time learning more about him, probably using what he knows about Harry's life before Hogwarts to his advantage.

- There are two points I'm not sure about here, and that's Quirrell and the stone. When it comes to Quirrell, I don't know if he's still all in there, if Voldemort has completely taken over, or if things are somewhere in between. With Voldemort having that soul piece, along with being more sane I imagine he's also more powerful, so maybe he could completely take over. I'm also not sure if he gets the stone or not, or even if he prioritizes it as something to do. If he's managed to completely take over Quirrell's body, maybe it would be more efficient to keep it and change it to however he wants to look (if he even cares to do that). Maybe the possession itself killed all that was there of Quirrell and there wouldn't even be the bother of clearing out the old inhabitant.

There are more than a few ways this story can branch off from there. There's still a great many questions about how he's going to handle Harry, and where he wants to go from here. He's no doubt incredibly ambitious, and I can't see his want of ruling as having gone away.

If this idea appeals to anyone else enough to want to write it yourself, feel free. I know I'd love to read a story like this.

** I'm in the middle of planning what I'm calling my American Potterverse - basically, what I see America's wizarding population doing circa 2012, complete with giant war on the horizon. Inverarity did something like it with Alexandra Quick, but I'm going in a rather different direction. Especially since all my main characters are well out of school by the point of the story. And it's not nearly as black-and-white as Death Eaters v. OOTP.

I've been worldbuilding for about a year now, I'm just legendarily bad at actually starting anything. Especially since I have a degree in history, and the worldbuilding involves creating American magical history and culture.

*** I'd be very interested in seeing this even if it doesn't make it to a story form. I love seeing the different interpretations of the American wizarding world. I have my own little story going on in there, but it has no structure or plots or anything... it's really just me having teeny adventures as a witch in my head :P

** Oh, all kinds...

Stories with chapters

- I'm "working" on forums to write the different points of view of the people during the Marauders era...not sure that's ever going anywhere.

- I'd like to write what happens between the battle at Hogwarts and the epilogue...and maybe change the epilogue some.

- A time travel story would be fun (Harry going backwards)

One-shots

- "The Wild Snitch of Bodmin Moor" Harry tells his daughter Lily a story of the...wild Snitch of Bodmin Moor. (Inspired by Quidditch Through the Ages)

- "Dementor Thoughts" (Title pending...) just a short one about what's going through a Dementor's head at Azkaban

Then some more adult fics...

** I've been working on one fic, with two ideas in the background. I am an avid reader but have yet to finish something/post anything so I'm actually really nervous about it. *I am a Severus x Hermione shipper.

I have a full outline and timeline for the fic I've started. In short: Starts summer after 5th year, Dumbledore!lives, Draco defects, animagus!Hermione, no horcruxes, Snape!lives. Pairings: Severus x Hermione, Harry x Luna, Draco x Ginny, Ron x (Lav?haven't decided). I have some ideas regarding nargles and the ability to see creatures/things (such as Thestrals) that I want to explore. I'm struggling with how I want to kill Voldemort; I initially planned to do something along the lines of an amplified and concentrated "love spell" but it just seems so... uh.. bad? overused?

Another idea is post-war/"8th year" Hermione returns to Hogwarts and feels that her soul has been damaged via the horcruxes and or dark magic in general. She begins to do more research on soul magic and ends up stuck in a book. At first she is corporeal even in the 2D world of the book. She finds she can communicate by thinking or speaking and the words are written. Severus and others try to find a way to return her to the real world. Over time her corporeal senses start to fade and she realizes that she's being absorbed into the book. Again, stuck on the resolution aspect, but probably something along the lines of needing to anchor her soul to something/one.

And the third idea that I have just came to me yesterday. Very AU and very influenced by my studies of Latin and Greek. The idea sounds terribly corny or that it could just be bad, but I'm actually really excited about it and I hope I can write it the way I'm imagining it. Hermione finds out on her 17th birthday that she's the daughter of Aphrodite/Venus and Hephaestus/Vulcan. Minerva is actually Minerva/Athena. There's some stuff about the gods being banned from meddling in human affairs for a long time, the ban was reconsidered after WWII - allowed to help now because they fear Voldemort could be the wizarding equivalent to Hitler. Politics, history, mythology, and relationships! (An important aspect is that Hermione doesn't become some beautiful goddess all of a sudden. Her physical changes are very slight).

Okay I need to go try not to have an anxiety attack for sharing this. =_=

** I actually have quite a few, but I'll mention my major two:

1) Unsure of title. Basically, a darker version of the war with Voldemort, where Voldemort gains power much quicker and manages to exert far more control than in the books. The Order are hiding at Grimmauld place, and have been for over a year, trying to find a way to defeat Voldemort. All the while, a la WWII, Voldemort has Muggle/Muggle-Born concentration camps that Harry and his group periodically break into and free the prisoners. During the war, the Order realizes that the second informant (aside from Snape) hiding among the Death Eaters is Draco, who basically couldn't take the darker side anymore, having witnessed too many atrocities. So, while dealing with the lack of trust for Draco, they keep fighting against Voldemort, trying to protect themselves and save the Wizarding World. Of course, it would be much darker, more deaths, heavier feeling, and I have plans for one of the Order to get taken prisoner in one of the concentration camps and tortured for days on end. And, because I'm a romantic female, there will be undercurrents of a romance between Draco and Hermione.

2) Probably called Room 409, or The Best Mistake. Just came up with this the other day. Draco, as part of his rehabilitation program post-war (that all Dark Lord following Purebloods had to do), he has to help out at the St. Mungo's Hospital. There, he meets Hermione, who's a permanent patient. He eventually discovers that she's there due to a fatal curse placed on her from Bellatrix. I'm still figuring it out, but basically the knife Bellatrix used on Hermione was cursed and would eventually cause Hermione's blood, or something, to slowly deteriorate and destroy her organs and body. Obviously, they can't stand each other at first, but they eventually grow fond of each other. But of course: "Just don't do the cliche thing," Hermione spoke softly. "And that would be?" Draco answered, looking up from his book. "Promise me you won't fall in love with me. It's horribly cliche to fall in love with a dying woman." He continued to silently stare at her for a moment, struggling to keep his face calm and unaffected. After a moment, he managed to twist his lips into a smirk and respond, "Well, Malfoys aren't one for cliches."

I definitely want a line like that in there. Of course, in this one, Hermione was lying to her friends about her reason for being hospitalized, which turns into a major problem later on when Draco is confronted by Ron and Harry after they find out he's been spending a lot of time with her.

Those are basically the shorter version of my two main ideas. I have plenty others, such as a Dramione Marriage Fic with a twist and a Veela fic, both of which are very cliche and overdone, but I've given them additions that I haven't seen anywhere thus far.

Sorry for the lengthy response, could've gone longer but both fics require a nice little bit of info to get the idea across.

TL;DR: 1) Dark war fic with WWII-like Concentration Camps. 2) Romantic/tragedy Dramione, Draco works at hospital and eventually befriends fatally ill Hermione.

** This morning as I lay in bed I came up with a new idea for a Scorrose story. One of the main reasons incest is bad and the reason it has developed to be frowned upon is because of the potential for birth defects. Wizards have perfect prophylactics against pregnancy so there is no need for there to be a stigma against incest. In this story, Rose and Albus are in a relationship that is completely accepted by everyone and not stigmatized at all. Rose and Scorpius dislike each other, just conflicting personalities. Albus and Scorpius are friends, mostly centered around Quidditch. Eventually Rose and Scorpius have their normal trend from enemies to friends to relationship, with the help of Albus. Since he is friends with both of them, he understands it more and is able to get rid of any jealousy and so they have a poly relationship with Rose being with both Albus and Scorpius. They have a few moments of threesomeness at the urging of Rose, even though neither Albus or Scorpius is truly bi. They just aren't opposed to it enough to shut it down. Rose has a need to match people up and eventually more people are added to their group, at which point Scorpius and Albus, as well as some other people, become uncomfortable with the gay and communal aspects, talk to Rose about it, who is understanding, and the relationships become more private. They are still in a poly clique at school who everyone views as a little weird, but not as much as it would be in a school in the normal world. The relationships between individuals are still just as loving and emotional and everything as they would be in a monogamous relationship, there are just multiple. The people have managed to control their jealousy and possessiveness, if necessary with the help of magic. The end. Or they could go fight a war as a squad and have some of them die, but that's depressing.

** I've been wanting to write a Dramione fic. I've got the first chapter written, but don't know which direction to take it in. It's about Hermione cheating on Ron with Draco. She has been for years. The only reason Hermione even married Ron is because she was pregnant and didn't know who the father was. She married the wrong father. They end up divorcing after Hermione finds out she is pregnant again and knows who the father is. Hermione gets support from the most unexpected of people.

I also have an idea for a George/OC fic that starts in the trio's fourth year. The TriWizard Tournament still happens like in the book, just it focuses on George's relationship with the OC. She is a witch from America who has a very unusual power. Still don't know what house she will be in and don't know if I will keep the deaths of all of the book seven characters.

Those are the stories I want to write. Now that I've said this, let me get my fingers to tapping on the keyboard.
