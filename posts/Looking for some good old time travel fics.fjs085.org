- I don't care where Harry (or the MC) ends up (Marauders era, Voldemort's school time, or his own time when he is younger, Founders era, or maybe somewhere else entirely)

- Can be accidental time travel can be willingly

- I kinda like it when Harry (or MC) has knowledge of the future and uses it to his advantage (Not a must)

- Preferably slash and no fem!Harry

- Also preferably complete or fics that are being updated

- *TIME LOOP FICS ARE SUPER COOL* and those are welcome as well

- I also like it when people time travel and have no means of going back (thus creating an alternate timeline)

- That being said if it's a good fic and none of these things apply feel free to link it either way


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/chapters/22996143][Turning of the Times]] by noaacat

After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.

Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.

​

It's a very good fic that's well written and features a Ravenclaw!Harry (it totally makes sense with the story). It's 35 chapters so far (it was updated today so don't worry) and is probably one of the best HP fics I have ever read.

** Stepping Back linkffn(12317784)

A well written story, nice characterization of supporting characters(James, Lily, Sirius, Arcturus, and Charlus) Even if Harry is a bit OOC(kind of understandable with the plot), it has an interesting premise(no matter if they win the Second War, the First already did so much damage that Wizarding Society would end by a few generations, so they send him back to reduce the damage of the first), that also explain Hogwarts arguably too few students for the only magical school in Britain.

It's Harry/Bella, though much better dealt with because he meets her at 16 and has a hard time going over his impression of her future self, instead of just forgetting about it.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** plutoplex's /Crossing Lines/ ( linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines]] ) ).

Fred and George have a mishap with the age line in GoF, sending them back to the Marauders Era. They do have knowledge of the future, but it is woefully incomplete (at times straight up wrong---eg they don't know that Sirius is innocent!), and that causes /drama/. (Which is a nice change of pace---most time travel fics, especially the ever-abundant peggy sues, don't ever bother to make use of dramatic tension despite how conducive time travel is to that kind of thing.) There's no slash iirc, but there's not much romance in general. No fem!Harry. Complete.

If you want to link something with the bot btw you just need to type "link" and then the short version of the site ("ffn" for Fanfiction.net and "ao3" for AO3) and then put the copied link behind it in"()"

So it would look like this

linkao3([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10972919]]) or alternatively you can only link the number linkao3(10972919) linkffn(...)

  After an accident, Harry wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but Tom Riddle has a habit of making himself Harry's problem.
