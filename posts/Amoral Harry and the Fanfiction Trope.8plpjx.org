Wizards shouldn't suffer from quite a few of the Tropes in fanfiction, and it's only Morals stopping them.

For example: Blackmail. "I have x on you so you better do what i say or else" "Imperio" "Retrieve every single piece of Blackmail you have on me" when they do "Obliviate" they no longer have anything on you.

There are likely several more. How many can you find that can be solved by flipping the "Morals off" Switch


** The Imperius Curse is /hard/. Memory Charms are /hard/. You are grossly overestimating the ability of the average Hogwarts student.

*** Gilderoy Lockhart could Memory Charm, and the man couldn't even stop Pixies. Crabbe (or Goyle, i can't remember which) the idiots could use Fiendfyre, which is harder. Morals off, you just have to WANT to dominate the mind of a person, I'm overestimating the mindset, but that's why i said Morals off. The hard part about Memory Charms would be removing a specific bit, and not wiping their memory as a whole

**** It's explicitly stated that Lockhart wasn't an idiot, he was /lazy/. He perfected his skill at Memory Charms and never bothered to learn anything else. As for Crabbe, he could /not/ use Fiendfyre. He could begin the spell, but was unable to control the fire, which is the most important part of it; and he was burnt alive for his trouble.

And the intent is not all you need for the Imperius; like the Killing Curse is stated to be, it's presumably a complex spell besides.

Intent and power are the main components of a spell. If you want to Control them Hard enough, and try and cast Imperio, with practice (on Pets/Spiders/etc) you'd get it down fairly quickly.

Don't know where you're getting "intent and power" from. It's definitely not canon. For one thing, power isn't an inherent capacity of a wizard in canon; a wizard's spells' power is a function of how well they cast it.

Eh, Crouch Jr. and Dumbledore referred to it as such. Power obviously isn't all there is to spellcasting, but it's there. Heck, wands have power too. Even ignoring the Elder Wamd, James's wand was said to have "a bit more power".

******** As I said, there is such a thing as the power with which a spell is cast, and, by extension, the power of a given witch or wizard (which is the general standard of power their spells hold to); but it's not an inborn capacity of a wizard or witch, irrelevant to the rest of their skill. Your spell's power is a /function/ of your casting and strength of intent. You can't have someone who's rubbish at intent and casting but still has Dumbledore-levels of power.

********* It may not be entirely inborn, but if wands have power as we are told, then there's another source of the overall strength of spells otherwise specific wands couldn't make one's magic stronger than others (ignoring wand ownership). I'm not discounting the other stuff. It's clear those with high intelligence and knowledge of magic are a step or ten above the rest in terms of their ability to cast magic. But there does seem to be a kind of power which is inherent to the wizard.

  This is not to say that Lockhart had no talent. Indeed, his teachers felt that he was of above-average intelligence and ability, and that, with hard work, he might make something of himself, even if he fell short of the ambitions he shared freely with classmates (Lockhart told anyone who would listen that he would succeed in making a Philosopher's Stone before leaving school and that he intended to captain England's Quidditch team to World Cup glory, before knuckling down to becoming Britain's youngest Minister for Magic).

*** Do we know how hard it is? We aren't ever truly given a difficulty level for these spells. Furthermore it shouldn't be too far fetched for Harry to use these. He has proven his mastery of difficult/upper level spells (Patronus in 3rd year, *Sectumsempra*). Is it so far fetched he would be able to use the Imperius? After all the stuff Harry goes through/has gone through if any student would be able to use the "Unforgivables" it would be him.

When it comes to the memory charm I feel like that has to be rather easy. Obliviation is something that occurs on a daily basis to enforce the Statute, it is far from some obscure arcane magic.

**** Crouch Jr. (who ought to know) says that the Killing Curse is a complex enough, powerful enough spell that even with the intent, the Fourth-Years wouldn't stand a /chance/ at successfully casting it. It's not much of a stretch to assume this is true of the two other Unforgivables.

As for Memory-Charms, they're easy to cast as such, but easy to /botch/. No one cares if the Muggle forgets a whole day rather than just the five minutes where he spotted a broom, because bleh, it's a Muggle and I wanna go home; but inconspicuously Obliviating a wizard of Harry Potter's standing would be much trickier work.

I'm pretty sure he just said "You could all point your wands at me and say the words and I wouldn't so much as get a nosebleed."

Kids just don't have the emotional depth and maturity for the kind of hatred that cold-blooded murder requires. The Unforgivables are such because you have to mean them with all of your heart and mind. There are no half-measures with those three spells. If you use the Imperius on someone, no one can say that you had any other intention than to control that person utterly. That's why they are Unforgivable offenses.

Other than that they are literally point-and-speak spells, not complicated at all.

EDIT: Reading the passage, it says "Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - You could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it."

You /could/ argue that there's more to the spell knowledgewise when he says "I'm not here to teach you how to do it." but I think he just means teaching how to get the proper intent. There's still the ambiguity of what "needing a powerful bit of magic" means, too. In my opinion that's a combination of a person's force of will and certainty of mind. Just my take on it.

That's really where the matter lies, yes, and there's no clear-cut canon answer. In my opinion, spellcasting is a bit more complex than that, which would explain quite what they /do/ in the classes. The basics are, of course, /intent + incantation/wand movement + control of one's magical energy/, but I like to think that more complex spells are, well, more complex. That is to say, for instance, that their casting may be split up in parts; you'd need to be pushing your magic in subtly different ways, and thinking slightly different thoughts, on each syllable and for each twirl of your wand, to cast something such as /Avada Kedavra/.

Ideally, you want to be in a position where you threaten the other person without giving them the chance to draw on you. Simply send a letter or press your wand to their neck. At least that's how I'd blackmail someone.

** Firstly:

Not everybody can cast those spells! You need more than average magical power and willpower to pull off the imperius (and even then some people will resist the imperius! Harry is just the one most people think off, but I bet it wouldn't work on say Moody, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape (he is good at the mental arts and I bet that helps) etc.) and Obliviating people is hard (do too much and you get Lockhart and a "nice" stint in Azkaban with a "great view" and do too little and people will remember (or at least know that something is off and might seek help!))

Also: It's not just a matter of morals! If you get caught with an unforgiveable? Yeah, Azkaban time (this time without ever being released!) again!

Secondly: You can't control multiple people easily (chances are that a blackmailer will share some of what he/she is doing with friends - partially as a backup against being obliviated!) and you might not even know who also knows of the blackmail material (or information, it might not be something writen down after all!)

** That's one of the things that's annoying in the HP world--magic basically has no limits. So many things can be circumvented by magic--illness, lack of money, and to a certain extent lack of food.

You're right--there's nothing stopping a witch or wizard from controlling someone. Think of David Tennant's character in the first season of Jessica Jones and how horrifying that was. That's basically what any witch or wizard can do as a baseline ability.

It doesn't matter how hard any of these are--all it takes is some practice and you can have a complete psychopath on the way to ruining lives. Muggles do it all the time with simple social engineering. An amoral wizard would be a frightening thing to behold.

Think about the recently-caught Golden State Killer. He's as amoral and psychopathic as they come--can you imagine if he were a wizard? Raping, Obliviating, commanding people to kill each other for sport. Authorities show up, Obliviate, command them to shoot each other with their guns. And there's no limit to it. Yes, you have to /want/ to control someone, but that's easy enough for most people. Sure, the spell might be difficult to work, but you start small with commanding dogs to run out into the street in front of a car and then before you know it, you're commanding people to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge because you had a bad day.

It's just that thin veneer of social, polite behavior that keeps us in check. Remove a limit or two and watch that disintegrate.
