I'm really interested in finding fanfics to read that incorporate a lot of folklore. Be it the fae, druids, Arthurian legends, all of the above, etc. Preferably with a focus on Harry, but after so many years of reading (holy cow, I think I started with Inuyasha fanfics back when I was like 12, and I'm 26 now) I'm open to just about anything.

I did do a search on the subreddit for fae and found a few good reads. I did some filtering on ao3, and I'll probably try on fanfiction.net once I feel like braving their terrible search engine.

Some clarifications:

I don't care if it's slash or not. In this case, I don't even care if there's romance.

The only two things I really care about is a solid foundation in the lore the writer is basing their story on, and good writing that doesn't make me want to die inside.

The longer the fanfic the better.

And mildly off-topic: if anyone could tell me if there are fanfic subreddits for other big fandoms such as Naruto and whatnot, I risky plan on asking similar questions on those subreddits too.

Edit: I should also mention that fics just expanding on the general HP world would be great too. Prince of the Dark Kingdom is a good example of meshing together a lot of what I'm asking.


** linkao3(7155281) is probably too short and too mild for your taste, isn't it?

And if what you are after is in fact the historical HP fanfiction (surprisingly very very rare thing) then my ultra-favourite is linkao3(7460772). Or perhaps [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]].

  The year is CE 476. Cenau Redhair is a very long way from home, and she's in prison. While she doesn't want to die in front of the crowds at the Flavian Amphitheatre, escape seems impossible. Does her friend Rhea the falcon have a plan? This is a story of the early days of magic, long before the founders.

  Long before the Statute of Secrecy, when Kings still sought counsel from wizards and scholars debated magic at the great centres of learning, England seethed as her nobles struggled to check the power of the King -- and one young friar found his new path taking an unexpected turn.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10313612/][The Traveler]] (second fic in "[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/683603][The Wandering Devil]]" trilogy by The Wayland Smith) borrows heavily from some of the more well-known myths about the sidhe/fairies in European folklore.

  Sequel to 'To Play the Devil'. Harry and Tom left our world behind and found themselves in a world filled with the night-time fears of mankind. The washerwomen guard the fords; reapers walk the noon-day fields, and the Gentry are riding. Worst of all, Death himself has taken an interest in them, and he has a plan. Enter a land of fairies, enchantment and fear.

** It's a bit of a stretch but what I liked in linkffn(the imposter complex) was that there was a lot of focus on foreign magical cultures. It's not harry-centric ; you get to follow horcrux-tom riddle around in his adventures. It's all pretty modern though.

About other fandoms, the [[/r/narutofanfiction][r/narutofanfiction]] subreddit is pretty active, although I've found the people there to have quite specific test. Since slash doesn't bother you, you could also try the hp slash subreddit, because the two communities have had their disagreements and I get the feeling that a lot of people have chosen to stay in one sub only. They won't mind if you say you're not looking for slash or romance in particular.
