  /"Hello, will you go to the Yule Ball with me?" He asked once he'd gotten her attention, ignoring the tensing of the girl next to her./

  /The girl stared at him for a moment, her eye flickering over to the rather angry witch she was standing next to, before a small amused smile made her way to her lips. "Sure."/

  /Thus, Harry Potter asked out a girl, right next to a veela, without even once glancing at the supernatural beauty. Much to Fleur's indignant fury./

Just any fic that has Harry thinking that Fleur isn't such a big deal. It's just hilarious when she gets left speechless/pissed over that. Whether or not Harry ends up with Fleur, as long as the fic is well-written, we good.

  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.
