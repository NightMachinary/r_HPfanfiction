For guys seeing Harry score a bunch of hot chicks is practically an ego stroke. What do females get from this? Don't tell me it's the story. Harem stories are almost always bad.

For smut purposes, won't seeing Harry do it with someone other than their self-insert feel weird? Maybe its the potential bi-stuff.

Thoughts?


** Transgression is titillating. Powerful men, which can be shown to be so by attracting lots of women (or are harems not consenting?), are attractive to (some, many,?) women. It's probably some combination of those.

We have done a lot of things. While personal experiences effect a persons writing style, I've found that gender doesn't always (often?) define how a person is going to handle romantic/sexual relationships in a story. Also, I think some people just write it for the amusement value.

**** No, but the question was specifically about the kind of women who write Harem stories. Of course there's also Inverarities and LadyAltairs, but those weren't the topic of the discussion.

** Another reason that hasn't been brought up yet is that it satisfies my desire for the MC to get everyone I'm shipping him with. I'm not a big fan of love triangles, because I might absolutely hate who the MC ends up with, Harry in this case, so when everyone wins, its the happy ending I enjoy in my romances. Rarely do I like multi stories -- they're hard to do well, but the search for them is compulsive. To do it right, most authors will need to go very in depth behind characterizations and motivations, and I like reading on interactions and balancing relationships. The world and how they go about their relationship is interesting to me too -- are polyamorous relationships commonly accepted? Is it a cultural expectation? A dirty secret? A rare fragile thing?

** Simple answer : Because confident, "player" Harry is hot.

Also, some women have no problem with polyamory.

** They rarely do. Most of this stuff is written and read by teenage boys who have no idea how sex or relationships work. All of the authors who write harem fics identify themselves as male in their profiles, as far as I know. The female equivalents get off on SexGod!Draco instead, among other things.

*** I would say MPREG probably is the female flip. Starts with porn with lots of angst (the act of getting preg for a male), family (forming one with the 'father'), lots of attention on the preg character, an excuse for heavy emotion (hormones), comfort and babies (always, always, happy endings). This is why I think most people who hate MPREG /just don't get it/, they are not the target audience.

** I'm fairly certain self-inserting into a character is more a thing that boys do than women, so that's probably part of it.

They probably enjoy the smut, and harem fics are often female-centric, in that they're full of female characters.

Given that I've yet to be faced with a good one, I don't quite understand why ANYONE likes them.

** Just wanted to say that as a guy, I enjoy Harem stories often NOT because of the idea of the Harem itself, but because it gets more interesting characters deeply involved in the story. Point in case... I HATE 99% of smut or close to smut Harem stories, and prefer the darker more intriguing ones that actually have solid plot behind them, and are not necessarily traditional. I would think if it was about ego, one would lean towards smut oriented stuff. Also, I hate using the term Harem, and prefer Multi, because at the end of the day Harem implies Harry having some sort of overall control, and I like it when its more balanced between the characters.

So, having said that, as someone else said, if something seems "wrong" or "taboo" it can be intriguing to anyone, regardless of gender or even age.
