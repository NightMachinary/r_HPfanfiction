Looking for some stories where Severus is looking after Harry but here's some conditions that I need to work.

I never understand why when Snape ends up raising Harry he ends up being nice to him/looses his snarky attitude towards him and I don't like that.

I mean he can be a little nicer, but not as nice as he is in some fanfics. I mean he hated James, he had a grudge on James for years. He wouldn't just be nice to Harry because he was taking care of Harry or because the Dursley's were horrible towards Harry.

I want Snape to still be his usual snarky self, towards Harry and the others. I mean Snape has a grudge on James and hates Harry because of it, I want him to be his usual self in canon for as long as possible before slowly realizing that Harry isn't James. Now of course Snape can eventually be nicer to Harry, but I'd still like him to be rather snarky though.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash. Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.
