** Too early to judge, it's just one movie that's out yet, you can't just say that it's a bad idea on just one movie.

Although I'm not sure how there's content for 5 movies. First one was Newt capturing Grindelwald, second one (from the name) will show the crimes of Grindelwald and /why/ he should be captured (Jude Law said that Dumbledore will ask Newt to capture him again since he has broken out of prison but I'm guessing Newt will most likely fail otherwise why did Dumbledore duel him in the end anyway, he could've just asked Newt to defeat him again), third one could be about his ‘Fanatics' and maybe Dumbledore and Newt battling them and putting them in prison and fourth one would most likely be the epic duel.

I'm not sure how Rowling will stretch the story about Grindelwald to 5 movies, a flashback seems to be the obvious answer but I'm not sure if a movie entirely dedicated to flashbacks will be okay, I would much rather have snippets of their past between each movies than all at once.

**** No: he was using /Grave/'s wand, not the Elder Wand. Like many competent wizard he can get by with just about any wand that doesn't hate him, and that's not even accounting for the fact that Grave's wand may have been one of those fickle Dragon Hearstring wands anyway. Also, if you rewatch the movie in hindsight, apparently "Grave" uses suspicious amounts of wandless magic... possibly /because/ the wand he's carrying around doesn't quite obey him.

******* [[/u/XeshTrill][u/XeshTrill]] has the right of it. The Elder Wand is the ultimately disloyal wand. All it took was disarming Dumbledore for Draco to win it, and then when Harry defeated Draco he won the wand, /even though Draco had never even held it/.

You don't need to be wielding the Elder Wand to lose its loyalty. Gregorovitch (I'm sure I misspelled that) didn't lose it in a duel. Grindelwald picked it up and did a runner, and that was enough to win its loyalty. I'm absolutely certain Newt disarming Grindelwald was meant to transfer the wand's loyalty--which also makes Newt still relevant to the story. We can pretty much predict we'll see Newt defeated by Grindelwald in some way.

**** Heard did everything a victim of abuse is told they should do - she had photos, a video, witnesses, a restraining order, she gave the money she won to charity, and she negotiated an only slightly veiled public confession from Depp as part of the settlement.

But Depp, his lawyers, and his media buddies still undertook a successful campaign to smear her character and paint her a lying, attention seeking gold-digger.

Yates's comments very strongly implied that Heard was making her claims up, because Depp was full of “Decency and kindness”. His comments, along with Depp's public comments, were harmful to all victims of violence seeking to be taken seriously. I think they are dirtbags.

For the record, Depp has recently been accused of physically and verbally assaulting a male crew member as well. There is a pattern. The victim's statement suggested that before the assault he was concerned for his safety around Depp (he tried to get a police escort to give Depp bad news). It seems that he is known for violent aggressive behaviour on-set.

JKR made a personal statement on her website saying that she was genuinely happy to have Depp, and cherry picked Heard and Depp's joint statement to support her point. She framed her stance as bravely standing up against the majority to do the right thing. She made no comment when further evidence of Depp's violence reached the public. I think she's a hypocrite.

It's a controversial issue. Both sides had points. JKR's statement of not allowing the court of public opinion to govern her decisions wasn't wrong, as well as Yates's statement of being "just one person". But on the flip side, Heard had physical evidence of when Depp threw a cell phone at her and the accepted line of thought with abusers is, "if they did it once, they've done it before."

** As a long time fan of Harry Potter and the fanfictions produced, this is what I'd like you to know. My love for the movie is complicated.

I love it more than the Cursed Child play. But I don't love it as much as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (My holy grail in the entire movie series).

Regarding J.K. Rowling's social media public stunts. I lost the respect I held for her, after 2016. All that election thing and Pewdiepie controversy. But She is a proven story teller and I'd like to see it more.

Harry Potter books always have this deus ex machina that suddenly help save the day. I loved it as a child. But now, I respect the Fantastic beast movie, because it showed a character who saved the day, because of his sheer talent. Harry was a naive child, so I can forgive the first few books, but not for the last ones.

Not excited for Johnny Depp but really like what I see with Jude Law.

Stretching the story to 5 movies seems like a cash grab move. Like the epic Lord of the ring series was a Trilogy of movies. I'd like to see a similar approach. Short and concise always does the trick. Warner Bros are already having their fingers in too many pies with DC movies. So, I'm too skeptical and will only go see the movie based on what you guys the fans think about each movie and not base it on some review sites.

This raises an interesting point. At the end of the day, Rowling did a specific thing brilliantly; she wrote and developed Harry Potter. This is true of many rich, famous and/or influential people. Mark Zuckerberg did a specific thing very well; same with Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk. But because they became rich and famous doing that thing, we (which can refer to fans, the media, or society in general) anoint them as some sort of saviors whose every opinion needs to be listened to. And then they use that platform which we bestow on them and speak out on many things to which they have as much insight into as the schoolteacher or plumber, some good and some bad. And when they say things we like, we lift them up even higher. Major publications post lazy articles about how they totally owned some other person for a generic tweet. We want them to run for president, we call them Queen.. And again, for what? Because they wrote a great book, put on a great concert, hosted a decent reality show, made a billion dollars for creating an app? And then they say things we don't like and we tear them down. We say they shouldn't speak on things and should stick to what they are good at.

I don't care about what Rowling tweets, the vast majority of which I happen to agree with. As a human being, she should have every right to say what she wants in whatever medium she chooses, so long as it isn't blatant lies that could harm others since she has such a large following.

I do care about everyone, especially the media, assuming that we need to listen to her opinions more than the average person solely because she did a specific thing great. We elevate these people too highly in our society and it's starting to have seriously awful consequences.

But then suddenly Grindlewald shows up and I realized immediately what Jo was doing. She wanted to use this story to tell THAT story.

** I thoroughly enjoyed it in the moment, am more skeptical now. I personally like the way the story is going (Grindelwald) but I think it makes no sense to shove it under the FB label.

I enjoyed some elements from the film, like the unspoken confirmation that wizards have affinities for things that aren't about strictly casting spells. Newt as a sort of beastmaster is a nice touch. I really liked Colin Farrell. I liked how Grindelwald was like "fuck ya'll" and didn't even blink before diving in to solo 20 aurors, it was a cool way to show that he's in a class of his own.

The CoG trailer has me excited for the second movie, though I'm not giving into the hype as much. I think Jude Law will be a great Dumbledore. I also keep hoping they'll kick milquetoast Yates to the curb and give at least one of the movies to someone with a little flair. Don't get me wrong, I think Yates did an alright job, but his HP movies don't capture the magic. I keep hoping they'll bring in Guillermo del Toro, but I realize that it's wishing upon a star.

After DH, I always viewed him as slightly insane and extraordinarily charismatic. I loved his speech 'Us or them' and I thought they really did a good job of portraying his magical superiority. He was batting away Newt, Tina and trained Aurors, like flies.

I enjoyed the expansion on the law too, the obscurus is a good addition.

My only complaint would be as a movie the shift between the beast parts-very lighthearted-and the darker Grindelwald/Obscurus plot doesn't quite work. But I'm sure they'll work on it in later movies.

****** My headcanon for Grindelwald:

Halfblood with some connection to the disposed Baltic nobility (Lithuania, Couronia, take your pick) after the Russian Empire conquered those lands. He wants to restore his "birthright", therefore needs support. He goes to Britain to build a power base, falls in love with a girl, the girl's brother is a magical powerhouse who shares his ideology to some degree. They bond but Albus wants more than a friendship, there is a fight, Arianna is dead, Grindelwald flees and is trying to achieve his goals in another way while swearing vengeance.

WWI breaks out and Grindelwald sees an opportunity. He approaches the German Empire and makes a deal, magical stuff in exchange for support and official recognition. When the Russian's sign the peace of Brest-Litowsk, Grindelwald is recognised as ruler, but since the Versailles treaty annuls Brest-L, he get's jack shit but becomes the magical leader of the Baltics, where his first action is to win the war against the Soviets. Due to the threat of Western and Soviet Intervention, he is stuck in shadows until the Soviet Union annexes these lands and he approaches the Third Reich. Again there is an exchange of magic for power, but this time he also gets his hands on advanced Muggle Weapons and modifies them (magic homing V1/2 for example) and uses those to terrorise the British as a revenge since they sided against him and with Voldemort (at least that's how he perceives the situation).

Two things go wrong. The Germans lose the Eastern Front and his attacks on magical Civilians unite the magical Governments of Europe to a coalition to bring him down.

  We know that Dumbledore had a thing for him, but is it canon that Grindelwald returned those feelings?

IIRC JKR said that Grindelwald knew about Dumbledore's feelings and used them.

**** Yet the event which led him down a dark path supposedly happened in 1896, so him doing random bullshittery in New York only ~5 years before the Nazis were the "rising star" of the Weimar Republic seems off.

Also, why go to New York? At that time London was the centre of the World/British Empire and the US were not yet a superpower (with the Swiss outnumbering the US army until 1941)

***** In the opening scene of /Fantastic Beasts/, Grindelwald killed a bunch of Aurors somewhere in Europe, reported on 28 November 1926, presumably only days before he impersonating Graves in New York. This was a special trip for him. (Indeed, the ICW was still looking for him in Europe.) Word of JKR is that Grindelwald really had Seer powers, although he was lying about his visions in the movie. And he was on the trail of an Obscurial, an extremely rare and powerful magical entity, one of which he had (probably) tried and failed to acquire before (Ariana). It looks like this whole plan was simply part of his larger effort to amass power.

** I think the first one was a good addition to the story/lore, and Crimes of Grindelwald seems to take things with a more mystery-type thriller which is exciting. With that being said, however, I really have conflicting opinions of the first film. I liked the first half of it, but hated the other half. It seemed like two divergent storylines JK Rowling forced together instead of it having them weave around one another naturally. It just didn't sit well with me when it unfolded. Also, /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/! Apparently, they can be found in New York! Because, it's New York! I thought the location was silly (and this is coming from someone who loves the Big Apple). Like [[/u/Hellstrike]], I expected Newt to go to faraway magical places to find these creatures and study them, get involved in some sort of poacher conflict and have the story evolve from there. But JK Rowling felt the need to shoehorn in Dumbledore/Grindelwald which I, myself, find a rather boring backstory. I didn't care reading about them at all in Deathly Hallows.

And on one more note, the first Crimes of Grindelwald trailer had Dumbledore asking Newt (apparently) to help him track down/fight Grindelwald and his followers. Why in the hell would he pick Newt of all people?! Anyway, Warner Bros. will most likely release a Crimes of Grindelwald comic-con trailer this Saturday (much like they did with Fantastic Beasts two years ago), so I'm pretty stoked we might be getting some new content. Because while the first one was successful ($234 domestic + $580 international = $814 worldwide), I have a feeling this one won't equate that number (unless it surges in China where the first one made $80 million there). And Warner Bros. has been complete shit at advertising one of their "blockbuster tentpole" films.

** The best parts of the first film were the smallest parts. Dinner at the apartment. The conversation in the bank. The worst parts were the big action scenes. My guess is that in future films we get more of the latter and less of the former.

I'm also pretty sure that the films will fall into the same trap that Star Wars and the Hobbit did of trying too hard to shoehorn in connections to characters that we already know.

I remember way back when, maybe only 4 or 5 books had come out at that point, and JKR always insisted that there would be seven books and no more. I thought she could end up being a modern-day Bill Watterson. She decided not to go down that path, but to be fair, that's the same decision that 99% of creators make, so it's hard to blame her too much.

I like Grindelwald portrayed by Depp. His display/acting is exactly how I imagined Grindelwald to be.

I dislike that Newt Scarmander is getting so overblown. Him capturing Grindelwald? The mastermind behind World War 2? No. I cant see that happening. Which is why I am going to ignore it, if it happens in the movie again. In my fanfictions only Dumbledore was and will be able to step up against his former best friend.

That is fanon. He obviously had some ties to the Third Reich, but I really don't think that Rowling would go as far as to blame the whole second World War and the Holocaust on a fictional figure due to the implications (the Nazis were innocent and manipulated by a wizard). He'd fit better in a "mad scientist" (magic-homing V1-2) or "magical, collaborating despot" role where he made deals with the Nazis and committed atrocities on his own, but was not the driving force.

**** That's your interpretation of what little we actually know. I like my interpretation better.

Fantastic Bullshit and where to find it is not canon. It is the attempt to make some more money from the brand HP.

Grindelwald and Dumbledore's fight would have deserved its own movie without having some annoying and (sorry, I hate how the actor looks) ugly Newt Scamander getting blown out of proportion from being a fly guy who wrote books about animals to oh-shit-he-captured-Grindelwald! A guy who is considered to be the second in a ranking of who is the worst dark wizard to ever grace the face of the world.

So yeah. Canon (HP Book 1 - 7) Grindelwald is clearly the reason WW2 finally broke out. He is after all of the opinion that muggle are to be ruled by Magicals.

Anyway.

People go batshit crazy over how the actor of New Scarmander looks, which is why they ignore any arguments over the retarded story itself.

I am out.

*** Yeah, the obscurus is horribly world-breaking for the original HP books.

If /anyone/ were to become an obscurial, it would be Harry. Having an existing example of a repressed magical child who doesn't become this boogeyman is just poor writing. They could have added some extra conditions to it so it only happens to magical children trying to be normal and also living on magical ley lines (or something. Could only happen to muggleborns? Certain genetic predisposition? )

**** As far as I understand it, the reason that Harry did not become an Obscurial is because he never actively tried to suppress his magic, for the simple reason that he didn't know there even was such a thing. In fact he actually had reason to believe in it's explicit nonexistence, because his parental figures - abusive as they were - forcibly insisted on it.

The same can probably be said for the muggleborn situation, at least so far as they didn't know they had magic that they could have tried to suppress.

The whole obscurial thing is interesting, but again, doesn't make sense, as by definition Harry should've been one. But since I walked into the movie not expecting /Harry Potter/, I actually rather liked it. It's too early to know about the other movies, though.
