**** Plus, I always wondering about the Kwik Spells thing - can Squibs actually cheat and do minor magic? What exactly is a Squib? Is it basically a Wizard-born Muggle, or do they still have some kind of magic in their DNA? I.E., could they still use broomsticks? Can they see anti-Muggle bespelled places and things? What if a home was spelled with a notice-me-not, would the kid growing up inside the the house slowly go insane?

So what I'm saying is...is a Squib a muggle, or are they sort of like the equivalent of a learning disabled, or someone missing a chromosome in that they are magically, they are just unable to use it?

****** Interesting, I'd forgotten that. I did some googling, and options are split. JK has said that Muggleborns are descended from Squibs who married into the Muggle world, so that indicates that they cannot be completely devoid of magic. She says the Kwikspell course doesn't work for Filch, but whether it's because it's a scam, or Filch just can't use magic, isn't clarified

****** But on the other hand, she breeds magical hybrids - and I assume can probably use magical communications like owls and floo, or how else would she contact Dumbledore? Plus Mrs Norris seems to have a familial bond with Filch, despite being a normal cat. A kneazle mix would be understandable, but a normal cat does not behave like Mrs Norris

******* She breeds magical hybrids? I don't remember that.

Muggles can use owls (Harry receives his birthday "presents" from the Dursleys). I don't think we see muggles using the floo. And Mrs Norris may have been a kneazle mix, and may have had an affinity towards Filch. But I don't know that she (or a kneazle mix) wouldn't have an affinity for a muggle. That might be the cat part.

******** Yeah, she breeds kneazle hybrids, because you need a license to own a full blood one. So there's a market for the crossbreeds, because they aren't as aggressive to untrustworthy people. Given Crookshanks tried to eat Pettigrew, I do wonder what full breeds are like!

And Mrs Norris is not a kneazle - she's all cat, which I was very surprised by. Lily and Severus theorized that wizards have a department in the postal system to handle muggle sent mail, after Petunia managed to send Dumbledore a letter....and I don't see them using an owl. I can't find a source, but I had thought they couldn't use owls...
