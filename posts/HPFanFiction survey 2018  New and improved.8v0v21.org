*Commentary*

It's that time of year again! I think this year's survey is going to be particularly interesting. I've included a lot more questions about HPFF preferences, and the sub has grown significantly since 2017 so it'll be interesting to see if the new population has brought different views with them.

Changes from last year include:

- Streamlined demographic information to stick to the most interesting and relevant data as well as improve data presentation (e.g. the old nationality pie chart was almost impossible to read, so I've got rid of that and replaced it with region).

- Removed all questions on values/real life stuff.

- Introduced a large number of new questions about HPFF tropes.

- Removed the disaster that was last year's pairing table. This was an attempt to capture non-Harry pairing preferences but it failed miserably. I've yet to come up with a way to ask about non-Harry pairings in a way that is concise and will result in decent presentation of the data, so that question has been removed this year. If someone can think of a way, I encourage you to do your own survey on pairings to supplement this one. The real problem is that it involves two independent variables, not just one.


** The even split between Better and Worse for the did Dumbledore's decisions make Harry better or worse off question is fascinating, especially when compared to the amount of people that hate Dumbledore bashing and the fact that about 75% of people thought that he made the wizarding world a better place.

**** You could argue that one both ways as well though, since his enabling of him might have lead to that war in the first place. I also think his threatening a trust-starved potentially misunderstood orphan at a pivotal moment in his life is largely responsible for the way Tom grew up at hogwarts. If he's shown even a shred of understanding to Tom when he came for him at the orphanage he would have almost certainly grown up far different.

*** It was a very tough question to answer honestly. you can argue that harry is only alive because of Dumbledore, but we'll also never know if somebody else might have done a better job because Dumbledore hoarded all of the pertinent information. I personally think it's very likely that Harry could have had a far better life and still have survived if it weren't for Dumbledore's decision. On the other hand, Dumbledore essentially hoarding all the relevant information when it came to the second wizarding war did ensure that afterwards the whole ordeal was actually finished and done with, and a new and better future for the wizarding world became possible. At least, that seems to be the case as written in canon.

Hell, I liked Ginny in OOTP before her character took a giant leap backwards in book 6.

My biggest issue with the movies was the age of the Potters and Narcissa Malfoy when they made appearances and that they tried too hard to redeem Malfoy and Snape (although the epilogue did the same shit).

***** All of them are boring, with the exception of OOTP Ginny. Bill is a glorified grave robber, Charlie may as well be "name only", Percy is a boring bureaucrat, the twins are way too overrated in fanfic and I just became tired of them (and also rather irresponsible if you look at their product testing) and I don't give a single fuck about Ron. I find him totally unrelatable (seriously, I can better relate to 11-year-old Hermione and I am a 21-year-old guy) and consider it bad writing that Harry just puts up with his shit past book 3, but I have no particular desire to see him bashed, turned into the villain or similar stupid shit. I just don't care about him or any potential arc of him.

Arthur is the definition of incompetent (or stupid, since he seems to have forgotten about this thing called "books") and Molly's false promises about Harry's home life are simply unforgivable.

At least Ginny had the potential for some interesting development and arcs, at least until Rowling reduced her to mindless love interest without further action and poor build-up.

** Now that we have a little over 250 responses I'm going to take a look at what surprises me. Please don't read this unless you took the survey; I don't want to skew the results!

I'm not going to comment on the demographics, just the preferences part of it.

It seems that a good part of [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] at least reads no-HP fanfiction at least one a month (currently sitting at 54.6%). I'm very glad of this. While most other fandoms don't have as well-developed fanfiction community as Harry Potter does, there is still a lot of good fanfics out there that aren't HP!

Slash fic readers are a minority (37.7%), but 53.1% reads femslash fics. Lots of things could explain that discrepancy, so I won't hazard a guess as to why there's a 15.4% difference in those numbers.

Harry/Ginny seems to be the most popular pairing, which Harry/Hermione trailing by 7%. What surprised me was Daphne having 13.8% of the vote, over Luna (who had 12.1%). Fleur at 10.4% didn't surprise me, neither did Tonks with 5.4%. Personally I'm hoping for more Harry/Katie fics because I love that pairing.

I think for slash pairings, the reason Other has 34.4% of the vote is probably mostly people who don't like slash fics that wanted to answer the question.

For 'Favorite Harry Potter character', I am not surprised by the responses, except that both Dumbledore and Sirius were above Snape, and that Draco only has 1.2% of the votes! Also, Ron only has 3.1% of the votes so far. Poor Ron.

Not surprising that Umbridge is the most hated HP character by a /wide/ margin. She has 51.2% of the vote! Snape, Pettigrew, Draco Malfoy, and Fudge round out the top five. Ron has 3.8% of the vote. I like Ron, so I don't like those people that voted for him here.

For canon, it looks like we all pretty much agree the original 7 books are canon, but no other option has more than 50% of the vote. Pottermore has 41.2%, Fantastic Beasts movies have 40%, and the side books have 36.6%. Only 8.5% of voters view Cursed Child as canon.

53.5% of voters say that the majority of the fics they read are guilty pleasures. I can see that, though I try to avoid 'guilty pleasure' fics. Only 28.1% of voters actively avoid incomplete stories, and 65% of voters believe there is no such thing as an inherently bad story idea.

Now for the ratings section! Again, only doing the surprising ones.

Funnily enough, 81.1% of voters rated 'the existence of a politically powerful magical nobility' as a 3 or higher, while only 58.8% rated 'Harry inheriting significant political power' as 3 or higher. It looks like fanfic readers like the magical nobility, but don't necessarily want Harry to be a part of it by right of birth. They also didn't want Harry to be ultra rich, with only 22.7% giving it a 4 or higher and 45% giving it a 2 or lower.

Voters tend to dislike soul bonds and marriage contracts (42.1% and 45% rated them 3 or higher, respectively), which surprises me given the plethora of fics that have one or both of those tropes.

Most people love a magically talented Harry, which is to be expected, but I was surprised that 75.8% of people gave a 3 or higher to magical genius Harry! Personally, I gave that a 1 because OP!MagicalHarry is boring as fuck to read outside of crack stories in my opinion. Apparently I'm in the minority, though!

Redemption of Draco Malfoy skewed very slightly towards the positive, but not as much as I expected. Only 41.2% gave it a 4 or higher while 27.3% gave it a 2 or lower. What was more surprising is that Severus Snape as a mentor was so disliked, with 48.5% of people giving it a 2 or lower.

It seems most people prefer in-canon characterizations and a canonical magic system. I find this a bit surprising, mainly because Harry and Hermione (and sometimes Snape and Draco) are very frequently made more powerful/morally right/perfect in fanfiction while Ron and Dumbledore (and sometimes Sirius) find themselves made more foolish/hated/morally inferior in fanfiction. People did claim they disliked Dumbledore bashing (41.5% gave it a 3 or higher) and Ron bashing (41.9% gave it a 3 or higher), though that's not consistent with a lot of highly-recommended fics on this sub. Predictably, full 50% of voters gave Hermione bashing a rating of 1, and only 28% gave it a 3 or higher.

Speaking of Hermione, 58.5% of voters gave a 3 or higher to the idea of Hermione being a magical genius. Remember, Harry got 75.8% to the same question. Ugh. However, the splits trend slightly towards the negative for Hermione-centric fics, with only 33.1% giving it a 4 or higher while 38% gave it a 2 or lower). People like OP!Hermione but not necessarily as the main character.

Fem!Harry is slightly unpopular (47.7% gave it a 2 or lower), but Dark!Harry is very popular, with only 21.9% giving it a 2 or lower and 50% giving it a 4 or higher. Surprisingly, Evil!Harry is unpopular, with 55% of voters giving it a 2 or lower!

People tend to prefer explicit sex scenes in their fiction, with 80.5% giving it a 3 or higher. Personally, I prefer sexual elements to explicit sex scenes, but I gave it a 3 because it's fine. It is hard to write a good sex scene, I will admit freely.

Almost no one wanted America to be a magical utopia, with 77.3% of voters giving it a 2 or lower. I agree, voters.

I have two fem!Harry stories on my Favorite list right now, and I really like both, but I don't think it would make much of a narrative difference if Harry were just male.

In my (limited) experience, a lot of fem!Harry are simply the result of female authors who don't think they can pull off writing a male main protagonist, and so preemptively make Harry female so they won't have cause to slip up.

*** My take on all of this? The preferences are generally a /response/ to the majority of fics in the fandom, either what is currently popular or in the overwhelming majority.

Some examples: marriage contracts and soul bonds are in a sizeable portion of fics in the fandom. This is partly because its an easy way to make a relationship happen and partly because without it the writer would need to have a better understanding of actual relationships work (read teenagers). And people who write fics /because/ they want a pairing to occur, and are not really interested in the quality of the writing so much as wish fulfillment. Ditto for fem!Harry, most are written without any consideration of the implications and thus the story is...well...mediocre.

*** I think OP!MagicalHarry can definitely be boring in many cases because the author allows Harry to slide through all the problems/confrontations of cannon without any problem and it functions as wish fulfillment more than anything else.

But I still prefer a powerful Harry as long as there is /struggle/. There has to be some balancing of the scales. Maybe Harry, Dumbledore, Bela and Voldemort are all magically powerful. Or maybe it's a crossover fic and Harry is being balanced against protagonists from other stories. (Dropping a PowerfulHarry into another story's world is actually one of my favorite tropes). The best PowerfulHarry stories I've read are typically heavy AU.

Not making Harry into some kind of super-wizard is one of the more clever things JKR did in her books.

******** I don't think it's so b&w. I imagine the question is kind of about your hierarchy of canon sources.

For me, obviously the OG books are the highest canon. Then side books and FB movies (because the movies are stories written by Rowling as the chronicle of the Grindelwald era--instead of books, not as adaptations). CC I take as canonical in the general story points. Albus had a difficult relationship with dad, went time-travelling, stuff happened. Not in the specific details, like Head Auror HP being worse at dueling than as a teenager or being scared of pigeons.

Not that surprising, since reddit is normally male dominated on average. Pottermore doesn't have a direct forum, so a lot of people go there or tumblr.

#+begin_quote
  14.3% want Harry/Daphne, higher than Harry/Luna
#+end_quote

I am actually a bit shocked that Harry/Luna even cracked 10%. Personally I prefer that over Harry/Daphne (its certainly more believable), but there are far fewer fics with H/L in them (I can name maybe twenty if pressed that are good or better). I suppose its not that hard to understand though: Luna is a pretty well established character in canon (personality, appearance, speech style, etc.) while Daphne/Tracey/Lisa/Su are open for the authors to portray them however they need/want for their storyline.

Reminds me of that Napolean quote actually: 'Quantity has a quality all on its own.'

#+begin_quote
  40.6% consider Pottermore as canon, only 30.6% consider Movies canon
#+end_quote

One comes more or less from Rowling, the other was given far more liberty to write how they want. Personally, I would have less of a problem with the movies if it weren't for all the wand-locking tug-of-war BS in the last couple movies (but thats just me).

#+begin_quote
  More like politically powerful nobility, but more dislike Harry inheriting political power
#+end_quote

I suspect this is a reaction. Many stories create magical nobility with the specific purpose of making Harry a part of it. Goes along with Rich!Harry too; its a wish-fulfillment thing as far as I can tell. But a lot of people like Harry as the underdog/orphan (hence why all the super abusive Dursleys), and making him suddenly part of the elite cheapens this.

To speculate though, I think the opinions to many of the tropes are also /responses/ to their prevalence among fanfics (look no further than the soul-bond trope numbers for this). As a general rule, people tend to like newer ideas, even if they are not always or necessarily better.

#+begin_quote
  55% like magic-genius Harry, and only 29.2% like magic-genius Hermione
#+end_quote

Partly a result of the numbers mentioned earlier (Male-dominated). Plus, Harry is a rather unique character in fiction in that he is written so generally by Rowling that changing him is not particularly difficult to do. Whereas Hermione has a quite well-established personality and talents. Not to mention this goes to what I said above, people like what is less common too, and Hermione is often depicted as a magical genius of sorts, when compared to Harry.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

People don't like feeling like they're wish-fulfillment character is evil. Really, this is an important factor.

A LOT of people like stories where Harry sticks it to the bad guys or flirts with the taboo (see also Slytherin!Harry, Harry/Daphne, and Voldemort-mentored Harry), but don't want to see that maybe those kinds of actions are in fact the exact sort would lead to someone becoming what most would consider "evil."

Honestly thought, where is the line between crazy and evil though? In most fics they are pretty synonymous, but that is not really how real life is.

#+end_quote

This sub has a general dislike of bashing, so thats not terribly shocking. Personally, I hate bashing in general because it feels more like 1) lazy writing to give some sort of emotional catharsis and 2) is often preferred/written by people with some sort of axe to grind (whether with HP or not).

I think the key is that the question specified "genius" as Dumbledore/Voldemort level.

While it's true that intelligence and study are key to being a powerful wizard within the HP universe, the top tier wizards like Dumbledore all have a "secret ingredient" element which elevates them to that level. It's hard to define but nonetheless I think most readers know it when they see it - a kind of combination of instinct, character, force of will... the ability to turn everything up to 11 when the situation calls for it.

What prevents Harry from being a great wizard is the study/academic elements, but he seems to have that "secret ingredient" which can't be taught. He makes intuitive leaps with regards to fundamental magic (such as wandlore) and has immense force of will.

Hermione, on the other hand, has the study/intelligence side of things, but lacks that element of true "magicalness" about her. It's a similar situation to Percy Weasley: academically high performing, but lacking something vital which means they understand magic in a dry, mechanical manner rather than living and breathing magic.

For me it's easier to imagine Harry being more studious than it is to imagine Hermione as fundamentally more magical in her ways of thinking and viewing the world. The fact that Hermione is logical and thinks objectively is a key part of her character; the fact that Harry doesn't read enthusiastically about magic isn't a core part of his.

***** Yeah I agree that the prevalence of Genius!Harry over Genius!Hermione is mostly to do with the in-canon characterizations as well as Harry being the de facto main character. It's more fun to write someone as being a genius if they are also the main protagonist in your story. Plus we have famous examples in fiction of snarky young genii that get by more on their somewhat otherworldly competence than any sort of studying and research, such as Sherlock Holmes, Artemis Fowl, Ender Wiggin, Tony Stark, etc. It's also not very interesting to write about someone studying, which is an intrinsic part of Hermione's character.

While I am sure there is some bias due to the gender of the respondents, I think its effect on the data is relatively small in this case compared to the reasons [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] and I stated.

***** Hi there. Okay thats gonna get way broad, so I sill try to give you the best of the best. But do not take my opinions as sacrosanct:

- linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup): a short but sweet post-war fic, the backstory is told in snippets about Harry and Luna got together. An epilogue was actually published six months ago. My favorite fic by TheEndless7.
- linkffn(Protection from Nargles; Harry and Luna Against The High Inquisitor): the first is a fic so fluffy and sweet I thought I got cavities just reading it. But its possibly the best one out there, even if its sequel remains incomplete.
- linkao3(Tomorrowland): a post-war fic where Harry and Luna get together.
- linkffn(The Firebirds Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy) is part of the Firebird Trilogy, but Harry doesn't get together with Luna until the second book. Luna is the most important girl for Harry in here.
- linkffn(Unspeakable Beauty): Harry is an auror, Luna is an unspeakable, commence romance (also incomplete)
- linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has Harry (spoiler) end up with Luna, who is a more important character here than in canon (they meet her during 1st year).
- linkffn(Conlaodh's Song) is the sequel to By the Divining Light, and is an AU with a talented Harry.
- linkffn(RuneMaster) is a fic that I will /tentatively/ recommend, mainly because its actually complete H/L fic.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ice Cream Delights) is another tentative recommendation
- linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild) is a decent H/L fic, but its mostly crack too so thats not a focus.

I hope that will help you for now. I recommend Protection from Nargles and The Quidditch World Cup first, since they are generally speaking better than most fics out there (romance wise at least).

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

Are they concerned about the psychological and social impact that emancipation will have on house-elves (e.g. Winky) or do they just not have a moral problem with sentient beings that are historically (and possibly magically/biologically?) bound to servitude.

But with the question as it stands, using the word "unilaterally" asks us to agree with active resistance and that's why the question is leading (especially after you've already specified "clear and unambiguous").

I wish the slash/fem slash question answers were more detailed though rather than just yes/no. I don't really like slash, but I will read it if I find the plot/storyline interesting enough. I never know if I should put yes or no for that question though since even though I don't care for it I guess I still do read it occasionally.

For favorite pairing question, could you just list the most popular pairings and then have an other answer with a fill in option? There are a lot of characters, but there is not that many popular pairings (I think). Or you could even break down the other options like Harry/other, Hermione/Other, etc.

*** I think the best way to do pairing would be as follows:

- You have a list of all HP characters.

- The question is set to check-boxes (i.e. respondents can tick more than one box).

- You instruct respondents to tick the two characters of their favourite pairing.

This would not result in a useful graph in the Google auto-generated results, which would merge all the answers together in aggregate. But the link between the two characters selected would be preserved in the raw data. Someone would then have to analyse the raw data to count the instances of each pairing and graph them.

** Alright, time to weigh in on my take here. Warning, opinionated and satirical commentary ahead:

- Most readers were in their pre-teens when Harry Potter came out. Makes sense, similar to the Star Trek and Star Wars fandoms in a lot of ways following their first iterations.
- 7 out of 10 are males. Ironically, writers according to [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] are far more skewed towards female. Read into that as much as you like.
- Seriously, more than 1 in 20 people post other, and its the next highest behind Christian. Now I kinda want to know how many Nordic worshipers, devil worshipers, and Jedi there are here (its a religion, seriously).
- 7 out of 10 are single. The irony of this is thats almost the exact number currently (70.8 vs 69.9%) of heterosexual individuals currently in the poll. Doesn't necessarily mean anything, but boy does that look damning.
- Nearly half are students. Shocking I know.
- Nearly half of responders read hp fanfiction everyday or once a week. Well, that seems appropriate since they took enough time to do this survey when they should probably be doing something useful (look at me, the pot calling the kettle Sirius).
- The number of people who read only HP fanfiction is almost exactly equal to the number of people who read Harry-centric fics only. I sense a pattern here.
- Harry/female pairing: Ginny makes a comeback. Probably sucking up all the people who are oversaturated with Hermione fics (saw that about 5-6 years ago the other direction). Daphne and Luna definitely higher up, which is kind of amazing all things considered. Also, I just realized that I have never seen a fic with a legitimately good romance with Cho Chang, which is sort of shocking actually. There are more Harry/Pansy, Harry/Lily, and Harry/Andromeda fics than what was Harry's first crush in canon.
- Harry/male pairing: somehow people like Voldemort and Draco paired up with Harry more than anyone else. Let me rephrase that; people prefer Harry with a known terrorist who murdered his parents and a racist bigot with the worst example of a redemption arc I can remember. I kinda want to know what people include as "other" in this category now too.
- Wow, Luna Lovegood is 3rd beating out Albus Dumbledore and Sirius Black. Did someone start a campaign or something recently with the slogan "MAKE LUNA GREAT AGAIN," and I just missed the memo? Either way, sounds good to me.
- Peter Pettigrew is roughly as hated as Severus Snape. Sort of get that, they both had a role in killing Harry's parents. Its just weird that one had a major redemptive arc in the story (whether you believe it "redeemed" him or not), while the other appears to have been this character that Rowling invented to bring back Voldemort and then couldn't think of anything to do with afterward except kill him off in DH.
- People dislike the last book and the first two books more. This is the HP equivalent of the 2nd movie is always the best in the trilogy from where I stand. Think of it like the original Star Wars trilogy and suddenly you see the series in a whole new light.
- The God-parallel character (Dumbledore) is ironically the most divisive character in the series (more than the devil-parallel character!).
- House-elves are complicated as hell.
- How many people here actually played the video games? Not a joke, seriously I am sort of curious.
- 1 in 4 readers care more about an ending to a fic than the story itself. Honestly, the majority of fics I can think of actually have average to terrible endings, so that seems somewhat...limiting.
- Most of the responses to tropes are a reflection to what is common in the fandom. You get tired of some trope the more you read it, regardless of commonality. Totally understand that.
- People really want more unique magical culture stories and occult/esoteric world-building.
- People want redeemed Draco but not redeemed Snape (or mentor Snape, but one sort of rolls into another I think). Personally I blame the movies for this.
- People hate Muggle-wank stories.
- People like in canon characterizations best. My take is thats because /most/ fics do not depict in canon characterizations.
- People hate Hermione bashing more than Ron or Dumbledore bashing. Apparently there is selective bashing preferences, and a /very/ open interpretation of canonical characterizations.
- Summer training montage = not a lot of fans of Rocky here.
- When comes to magical power, I think people are starting to get to the core of the issue.

-Was Voldemort right?

-Would you read a slash fic with HP in the slash pairing?

-Would you read a fem!slash fic with fem!Harry in the fem!slash pairing?

-Do you prefer HP as Het, Bi, Gay or Ace?

-A question on romantic orientation (similar to the sexual orientation one).

.

But I am nitpicking, and despite appearances, I quite like this survey, especially the tropes section, thank you for making it!

** I highly question the survey's definition of "Slash". In a fanfiction context, I define slash as a story /about/ a male protagonist being gay, and particularly if they weren't in the canon. As written, "a story where the protagonist is male and gay", then a story whose main character is Dumbledore would count as "slash" even if it's about him as an old man with zero romance.

If the fic does include story elements relating to Dumbledore's sexuality, such that the reader knows that he is gay, then even if there's no sex/romance then yes, I'd say it's a slash fic.

Wherefrom? All I've seen is that /FB2/ apparently doesn't /refer/ to his being gay, but, I mean, neither did the original novels. That doesn't "make him straight". Is there anything more definite looming by?

I consider pairings and orientation rather different things. One's sexual orientation is a core element of their character in /general/; who they might fall in love with is a happenstance in their life. The same straight character could imaginably get together with an infinite number of other straight or bi characters of the opposite sex, depending on circumstances; but no amount of circumstances would make that same person, with their original characterization truly intact, get with a person of the same gender as them.

Re: pairing vs orientation, I think the more fundamental point here is that you are coming from the position that canon-compliance is default.

But you kinda /have/ to assume that a fic's world is like canon, except where the authors explicitly tells you it isn't. When a fanfiction story mentions "Hogwarts" without expounding on what Hogwarts is, I'm always going to go out on a limb and assume it's meant to be a magical castle serving as Britian's school of magic. Unless you've stated otherwise earlier, I'm not going to picture a random story's Draco Malfoy as black-haired, brown-skinned, and with a big round nose, nor suppose that "Hagrid, the groundskeeper" is a highly literate old witch with pink hair. Etc.

And any self-respecting author should /know/ that that's what the reader is going to think at first. If they want to make changes, they need to state so, either by calling it all an AU from the start (as /HPMOR/ did, for instance), or by pointing out every change they made in the narration through exposition of some sort.

**** As long as you do realize that that definition goes against what's commonly referred to as slash.

Even a very minor scene where sexuality is addressed for any reason whatsoever in a non romance story can establish that the protagonist is gay, straight, whatever. (For example, say it's a story with Harry as the protagonist, he discovers old letters from Dumbledore and Grindelwald that establish a prior relationship, and he thinks to himself that knowing Dumbledore was gay when Harry was a teenager really would have helped him figure things out sooner.) Main character being gay doesn't automatically make the story slash.

In certain circles, perhaps. In any case, I see no merit in debating the "correct definition of slash", of which there are many and no standard of correctness. It's like those "British vs American English" debates.

The precise purpose in stipulating a definition in the survey was to avoid all ambiguity derived from the fact that everyone understands the term differently. That particular definition was chosen because, from past threads on the topic in this sub, it seems that the main objection to slash fics by people who do not read them is that they do not identify with a gay protagonist (rather than not wishing to read a fic in which gay people feature as secondary characters).

**** Can I ask why? If it's not something that affects the story why would it matter?

I mean there are a lot of aspects to a character that could not affect the story but which taints your opinion of the MC and make it difficult to read, like, say, a soldier who is implied to have killed an innocent bystander due to neglect. Sure, it has no impact on the story you're actually reading, but your respect for the character you're trying to relate to diminishes.

I just don't personally see how being gay would get that kind of response, so long as it's not something that occurs in the story. Obviously if you're reading a gay POV and they start going off about how sexy that bear is, well, that'd definitely affect a straight reader in a negative way.

*** Ah, i remember a few of them (and please feel free to disregard - i really love learning about people and doing surveys so i tend to have a lot of ideas).

Firstly, an option to select "no heterosexual pairing" for Harry, and similar for the slash pairings. My personal headcanon is of a bisexual Harry but Drarry is my OTP, so i prefer not Harry pairing if they're not together at all. It takes me a lot to accept any other pairing. Plus there are those who prefer gen fics, and it seems like their experience isn't really accounted for at the moment.

It'd be interesting to see where people read their fic - I mainly inhabit the Captain America/Stucky fandom, so i mostly read on AO3 (honestly, i find FFN impossible to use these days). I'd be interested to see whether that's a common experience.

I'd also looooove to see how the LGBTI+ community is represented in the sub. This is of course super niche, but some questions that delve into the aromantic and asexual spectrum as well as the non-binary and trans community would really interest me personally. (As i said, this is super niche, so i don't expect it, haha. I just enjoy knowing all the finicky little details.)

Oh, actually, on gender options again. I am not personally intersex, but my friend who is tells me that they prefer the option to identify their gender as such, though they're generally cool with choosing the non-binary option. According to them, not all of the intersex community does that, but a fair portion does. So that's another suggestion for you.

Once again, this is all my own desires and not at all demands! Well, the gender stuff would make the NB and intersex community feel much more welcome, so i really strongly encourage you to consider those changes, but everything else is me wanting to tease as much info as possible for my own interests. I really appreciate your doing this, regardless, and I'm looking forward to reading the analyses people do. ^_^
