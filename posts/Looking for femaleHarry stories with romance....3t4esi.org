I'd like to read fermale!Harry fanfictions with romance that is at least decently written. Don't mind a nice, slow-burn plot either.

Will read most pairings with fem!Harry, but I would especially like fem!Harry with Snape.

I DO NOT WANT any Malfoy/fem!Harry, but fem!Harry x a female is TOTALLY fine.

/Black Princess Ascendant/ (Part 2, Finished)

#+begin_quote
  Second in the Black Queen series. Last year, Jen had to contend with a deadly Tournament, a revived Dark Lord, a meddlesome Headmaster, and worst of all, reconciliation attempts by her parents. Surely her OWL year can't be anywhere near as complicated. Can it? fem!bisexual!Harry/Luna (it's happening this time, I promise!), powerful!dark!Jen, NOT for children!

/Coronation of the Black Queen/ (Part 3, WIP with regular updates)

#+begin_quote
  Third in the Black Queen series. Jen chose to embrace the darker aspects of the world long ago, and she has never once regretted it. However, serving Baron Samedi creates its own problems. A new enemy is on the prowl, and now she needs to eliminate him... before he can do the same to her. Jen/Luna; as always, not for children

Rumor Has It has a fem!HarryxVoldemort. Though I believe it was abandoned after chapter twenty (which is the most infuriating thing because it was just getting good and ended on a cliff-hanger)

Looking Beyond and Serpent Tongue (both by the same author but are not of the same series) have fem!HarryxGeorge though it comes in later in the story and I'm not sure you would classify them as romance-oriented stories.

The Observer Effect is an Avengers crossover with fem!Harry paired with Tony Stark.

Also, many of Tsume Yuki's stories might be to your liking.

  After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards. A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding only made sense that she would fall for a prankster, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. Somehow, she was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. FemHarry.
