Hello! I think it's possible I have read almost all the fics out there, and for the life of me I can't seem to find anything that I'm vibing with at the moment. Maybe it's because I'm waiting for like 5stories to be updated and I'm going insane lmao ðŸ˜†. I haven't read anything on fanfiction for a very long time, ao3 has become more my thing, so maybe there is a whole bunch of fics out there that I am missing? Thank you for any recommendations!!


** My top 5 favorite fics all feature this kind of Harrys:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Hocrux]], linkffn(10677106): He even thinks he's Voldemort here. He also acts like Voldemort and has the power of Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): He started out as a vigilante revolutionary against the corrupt establishment, but readers can see him (and Ron and Hermione) getting increasingly cruel and ruthless. His preferred spell is Fiendfyre.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): His favorite spell is again Fiendfyre, he really likes manipulating people, and he doesn't mind killing his enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Initially he had some reservations joining Grindelwald, but couldn't resist his friends's enthusiasm. Besides, he really enjoys looting and war profiteering.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This story happens in a non magical sci-fi universe with superpowers. Its Harry still grows up in an abusive household, and that shows in his propensity to solve problems with violence. The Trio may have killed up to hundreds in this fic.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

Honestly-I have no idea! I probably upset someone by requesting something that is posted about a lot. For some reason people on this sub get annoyed if there are to many similar requests-like someone is making them answer or something ðŸ™„. Normally I'd just look for a another similar post-but I scrolled for a few minutes and couldn't find one with fics that I hadn't already read. Clearly it's just one person watching the post -because otherwise the downvotes would be in the negatives. Oh well lmao ðŸ˜†
