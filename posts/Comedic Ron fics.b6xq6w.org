Length and completeness doesn't matter. AU, one-shots, and crackfic are welcome.

Looking for gen, but pairings are okay as long as the fics are actually funny and they're not romance-focused.


** Ron (accidentally) becomes a Dark Lord in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Roschach's Blot]]'s fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood]], complete with a large collection of adoring (female) followers. Molly gets very happy at the thought of all the potential grandchildren that she will get to spoil in the future.

Oh, Harry and Hermione also become thieves, continuing Harry's family legacy. And Luna keeps trying to set things up so that she can be /stolen/ by them.

And it turns out that in the ranks of the Aurors, there's a tentacle monster named Tim.

Yep, it's crack, but glorious crack.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
