:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi everyone, I'm looking for a fic I read a while back, I dont remember the title.

It involved Harry having knowledge of the future, either through time travel or seer like abilities I dont remember. It happens during 4th year.

What I remember clearly is Harry conditionning Cedric throughout the year to duck and hide if he ever happens to find himself in a graveyard, when at times leave Cedric confused. By the end of the year Harry just says "Graveyard" and Cedric automatically responds "Duck and Hide" or something like that.

At the end of the third task, when they land in the graveyard, Cedric flip the shit out, but duck and hide, and subsquently survive.

If it rings any bells let me know, I really want to find this fic. Thank you :)

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
