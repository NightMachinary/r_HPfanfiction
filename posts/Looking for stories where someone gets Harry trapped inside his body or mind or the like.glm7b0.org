It doesn't have to be exactly like that, it can be something different, but just something where people can't really reach him, and he can't say stuff to them, or if he can it's twisted in some way.

Rather Voldemort did it, Malfoy, or someone else. And someone, or multiple people have to find a way to free Harry from the trap inside himself.

Bonus if he has to address certain issues within himself: How the Dursley's treated him, how the Wizarding World treats him, et cetra, but that's not mandatory.

It can be a minor or a major part of the story, either way is fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual et cetra. (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any sites, can have any warnings.

If Harry is a "Lord" I don't want him to be Draco Malfoy 2.0, I want him to still help people. No Harem Harry. No OP Harry. Harry can be smarter or more powerful then in canon, but I'd like for it to be believable.

No character bashing, if at all possible. If there is, then minor, or makes enough sense in character.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Stolen body while the mind is aware and imprisoned.

Harry/Luna. Can't remember if there was any bashing. This is time travel.

BEFORE ANYONE SAYS ANYTHING! Yes, it looks like Dumbledore bashing at the start. Harry just came back from after walking to his death in Book7. Most people would be a little... angry/depressed/etc about the whole thing. It's pretty reasonable with this IMO.

*** When it comes to bashing, there's a difference between: Oh evil manipulative Dumbledore! To character acting in a way that makes sense to the current situation.

And thank you, will try it out.

**** I know that, but usually in this subreddit you have to explicitly state it, since quite a few people describe bashing as saying anything bad about characters they like.

***** Ah okay, I can understand that.

So thanks for being clear.

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel.
