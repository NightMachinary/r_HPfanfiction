Preferably stories that don't focus on romance, I'm a bit tired of seeing the Tom/Hermione (or Harry|Fem!Harry) Tag where these stories basically have no plot and objectives except pairing him with a female(male) character.

It can be AU or Time-travel, preferably "in the past kind of time-travel", I don't like reading fic where a young Voldemort is transported in the canon timeline.

A good example I could give is the fiction that explains how he had to find the Ravenclaw's diadem. Without going into the details of the fiction, the Diadem was indeed once upon a time in Albania but not anymore when he found the right place in the Albanian forest.


** Carpe Noctem is a Good one, still ongoing

*** Yeah Carpe Noctem is really good, I'm not so sure about what the author intends to do with his plot but I quite like it.
