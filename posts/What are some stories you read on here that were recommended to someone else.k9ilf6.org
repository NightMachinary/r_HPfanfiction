** So, so many.

Ones that I wouldn't have have read without seeing /multiple/ recommendations and that turned out to be excellent, include:

- *Browncoat, Green Eyes* - A firefly crossover. I had never watched Firefly and I disliked A Black Comedy (which is by the same author) but I've read this fic a half dozen times now.

- *Of Wizards and Heroes* - It's slash. I didn't want to read slash, and then I read this and holy crap.

- *I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For* - A Star Wars crossover. My knowledge of Star Wars is exclusively from osmosis via being alive - I've never actually watched the movies. Fantastic fic, but sadly abandoned.

- *Grey Space* - Who wants to read a fic that has nothing to do with Hogwarts? Apparently me, because holy shit. This story is absolutely amazing, and I'd do unspeakable things for a sequel.

- *Of A Linear Circle* - Not only is this slash, which I find I can tolerate if not truly enjoy or seek out, but it involves Snape, a character that I loathe with a fiery burning passion regardless (or especially) if he's twisted into not being a douchebag. The story however has some great worldbuilding and so much other /stuff/ in it to detract from the pairing that it's easily in my top ten. Who'd've thunk it?

Plus a slew of oneshots that I generally avoid: I want /big, long, complete fics./ Not short little oneshots that will end way too soon! Can link some of those as well if requested, but here's the other ones:

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
