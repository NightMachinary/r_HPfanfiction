It's considered very cliche but it never seemed that implausible to me that Potter Manor would exist, given the extent of Dumbledore's involvement in L/J's estate and James' parents wealth. James had to grow up somewhere, and the books make it sound as though the Godric's Hallow house belonged to Lily and James and was more of a starter house than a large manor house fit for a well-off pureblood family. I can't abide by the whole "Harry inherits 20 bedroom estate, ancient title, and 5 house elves, but the idea of Harry being told after the war that he is legally the heir to a 6-bedroom house in the country is not terribly unreasonable. Is it possible to do it well? Is it an automatic turn off or a strike against the fic?


** For me, it's a red flag, because I don't think I've ever seen a fic with "Potter Manor" where the house was an actual plot point (i.e. necessary for the evolution of the story) and not just a degree of wish fulfillment.

*** I know what you mean. I think Ive seen it done well a few times. With Chem Prof and Muggledad. Chem Prof has Harry use his vast estate and fortune to train the DA.

While Muggledad focuses more on it being a stable place for Harry to develop a family and a firm foundation.

Some however just are like, you have the oldest vault known to wizard kind. Your family founded the wizengamot, hogwarts, and gringotts, here is merlins own staff. Oh and a portrait of your parents that you'll speak to once before its forgotten as a minor plot point

**** I personally find training in modern fanfiction a waste of time.

If you're going to train Harry, make it a timeskip between him not being trained, and him just finishing training up. Otherwise, it's boring to learn about Harry learning to cast a multitude of spells /we wish he would just use against somebody already/.

Alternatively, make it very fast rather than involving chapters upon chapters of pointlessness. Or rather than one big timeskip, make a few medium-timeskips so you can put it all into one chapter. Otherwise, just start the fic with Harry's training finishing up.

Or do it in a unique yet realistic way - eg. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane][/Harry travels the world/]].

***** I don't like timeskip training in many fics because then they feel like Harry has no adversity and is magically (haha) ahead of his peers. Of course you don't want to describe the whole thing but without spacing it out properly with other events it feels too instantaneous and as if there wasn't any work put into it.

****** One fic that I think does training well - without making it seem repetitive - is /Magicks of the Arcane/.

 

The "Harry training in Grimmauld Place / Room of Requirement / Potter Manor" has been so, incredibly overdone, it can get really annoying. However, if the author introduces other locations, other methods - maybe Harry goes with Dumbledore to Rome to explore an ancient crypt - things like that - it makes the "training" make more sense and feel more immersive.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane][*Magicks of the Arcane*]] - /Sometimes, all it takes for a man to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Harry isn't satisfied with his life, and the Goblet of Fire gives him the perfect excuse to change it./

 

On the other hand, the "Harry doing training through experience" is done well in /By the Divining Light/ and it's sequel, /Conlaodh's Song/.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][*By The Divining Light*]] - /Book 1. Follow Harry and Dumbledore as they descend into the depths of Old Magic seeking power and redemption in equal measure. En route they encounter ancient enchantments, a heliopath and an evil that could burn the world./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][*Conlaodh's Song*]] - /Book 2. As the Second War begins, Voldemort becomes obsessed with harnessing the realm of Old Magic to his own ends. Meanwhile, Harry has to contend with the Ministry, ancient foes and the machinations of a world he barely understands./

** It is possible, but mostly this is done as part of a "rich boy" kink fulfillment in fanfic. No support for this at all in canon and often a strike in my book, especially for poorly written or cliche-riddled stories.

Me, I'd write Potter Manor like the one in Skyfall (the latest James Bond movie). Sprawling lands, wimpy but formerly (last century) high-class mansion gone to seed, nothing of any use or value really, but some oddities that help out situationally in the plot. This fits with the Black family state of things, too.

*** This makes so much more sense to me, thanks for pointing it out! As someone with no experience with manors except from films like Gosford Park and Skyfall, and books like The Secret Garden, Gormenghast, and Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell I have really no good sense of what a manor is except what is basically a palace. Knowing that place in Skyfall is a manor as well helps bring it down to scale in contrast to Grimmauld.

** I think if its done well it can be good I like the idea of Harry having a family home where he can feel /something/ of his heritage.

Though sometimes if Harry is going to inherit a boatload of things, I like it when he inherits a minor fortune from his parents and rather inherits property from Sirius

** I always feel a little uncomforatable with rich/important potters. Reading through the books i always felt that harry's parents where comforatable but not wealthy. And in my mind, a mannor does not go with that image. But that being said, wealthy potters dosen't immediately turn me off a fic, it's just not my headcannon.

** Not really, unless you contend that the potter family was vastly wealthy.

Also it was stated in the books, (at least I'm pretty sure it was at least implied?) that there /was/ a potter manor of sorts, but it was destroyed during the attack on the Harry's grandparents on his Father's side.

One way to go about it, then, is to save the house through some kind of magic, a modified fidelous, or even magic just to make it seem like a ruin, seems a decent option, the grandparents set it up too late to save their lives, but did get it up and it was assumed destroyed, the sole remaining secret keeper then keeps the secret for Harry perhaps.

I've seen some fanfics where Harry, one way or another, reclaims the Potter house where his parent's died, which seems a bit more realistic. The plaque and such seems to imply that the Ministry turned it into a memorial of sorts, so it's not like it was moved into. There's a gaping hole in the nursery, but that's fairly limited damage, and whose to say the ministry didn't put some anti rain spells of some sort over it to keep the damage minimal?

Edit: I vaguely remembered from another fic, though which one I'm not sure, something else that may make it possible for Harry to /build/ a potter manor, or to inherit another manor and make it a Potter manor.

He was seen as a hero, the boy who lived. And a lot of people died in the first war, leaving at least some people without heirs.

Is it too unreasonable to say a few people might have written that poor orphan boy who saved their whole society into their wills?

Though if that happened, and the fact that Harry almost never got unsolicited mail, means that there has to be a mail ward involved if you're trying to keep most of the story close to canon.

Hell, even in canon I'm convinced there's got to be some mailward of some sort, it's just unreasonable that the kid that vanquished a dark lord never got fan mail at all.

*** I think you mixed up fanfiction and canon. Both sets of Harry's grandparents apparently died of natural causes. They weren't murdered or died in battle, at least according to JKR. The rest of your theory is great though and entirely plausible. :)

** In The Life and Times by Jewels5, the author did a pretty decent job in describing a Potter Manor which isn't Godric's Hollow.

Then again, everything she does is amazing, so maybe it's not a good point of comparison.

** Just thinking it through...

James and Lily lived in their own house in Godric's Hollow, one that was separate enough from their neighbors that they could lose their top floor to an explosion without having the property reconstructed. That James' parents were still alive and not living there would indicate that they lived elsewhere in town. Seeing as the Potters had extensive graves in the local cemetery (going back to Ignotus Peverell) would make them a long-standing family, so I doubt they'd live elsewhere if James settled there.

It doesn't make them the local lords, however.

Sirius went to stay with James and his parents after being disowned by his mother when he was 16, so wherever it was had to have at least three bedrooms.

Minimal end result is two single-family houses in Godric's Hollow, one of which was memorialized rather than being sold and redeveloped after it was blown up. The other house might not have been larger as the elder Potters weren't exactly a big family- they had one child late in life despite the significant inheritance of the Peverell Cloak to consider. Knowing that Harry would be inheriting a decent sum, his grandparents might have had the other house sold as part of their estate with the money ending up in Harry's vault for later purchase of his own place.

On the more grandiose side, the grandparents weren't exactly good at planning, so they may have had a decent bit of land and a house too large for their needs, but not large enough to have a servant's cottage away from the main house... unless that was where James and Lily had lived and later died.

So yeah, it could work, but then you have to ask 'why did (canon) Dumbledore continue to use Grimmauld Place after Sirius' death if Potter Manor was potentially available?'

**** Of course, keeping something like that secret is hard, you can't stop kids from talking, and even though harry doesn't have THAT many friends... someone would have said something about it, simply in passing conversation.

So if he wants it secret, he has to fidelius it. And then there's no way harry can find it until dumbles dies. Hmm actually, that would be an interesting way to do a manip!dumbles story.

Dumbledore wasn't planning to die, that was a miscalculation. When he does die, a whole bunch of fidelius charms he cast fail, revealing a bunch of stuff that he was hiding. Including how manipulative he had been, keeping many things hidden from everyone.

** Oh, I absolutely think that its plausible that James' family owned a small manor. I definitely picture them as having the wealth of the gentry. However, I don't picture James and Lilly owning it at the time of their death.

What if James sold the Manor after his parents death to give the money to the Order (and because liquidity in war-time is important). Perhaps some new-money or Ministry type bought it and it could be bought back.Maybe the Order met at Longbottom Manor during the first war instead of Grimmauld.

Harry could also sell Grimmauld and mortgage a small manor in the countryside, which might be cheap because its in poor repair in an economically depressed area. Then he and Ginny could fill it with kids.

Harry could have inherited it from a very distant relative, like a great-great Aunt, once removed. Or the trope could be subverted and he could inherit it from the Evans side (somehow).

Harry Potter and the Firebird's Son by Darth Marrs had the Potters have a manor house. It was nice, but not luxurious (and needed for the plot) so it didn't grate on me as a reader.
