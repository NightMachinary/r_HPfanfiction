** The scene in Dumbledore's office after Sirius's death. It came out when I was 13/14 and I've always suffered from depression, so the whole book really hit home for me and Harry's breakdown was the climax of it.

Especially when Harry's screaming “I don't care and I've had enough” and Dumbledore says something like “you do care. you care so much you feel as though you'll bleed to death from the pain of it.” I've just always thought that part was so well-written.

Also, Harry torturing the Carrow twin for McGonnagal has really stuck with me over the years. Rowling spent the last few books building up the Unforgivables and how horrible people like Bellatrix and Voldemort use them, so when Harry used it I was /floored/. I legit cried. It just added another layer of complexity and darkness to the story and Harry's character. Sometimes we really would do unforgivable things for the people we loved and I think Rowling was one of the first YA authors to write about it.

*** Yeah, I also like those scenes. I cried during them. The scene with the Carrow twin - it felt like Harry was standing up for his mother figure. He tried to protect her like she had protected him when he was younger.
