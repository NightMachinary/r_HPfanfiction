Any fics which start out with Harry having the standard amount as read in the books, and then actually investing, and increasing his total net worth. Apart from that as long as it is either completed, is past 4th year or equivalent if it doesn't focus so much on the Hogwarts side of things.

Thanks, Warryn.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

***** That's how I was taught in my business class, and with the comma there shouldn't be any confusion. For example, Thanks Warryn or Thanks, Warryn. With the comma it seperates it. Sorry if it confuses you, but it is sufficient enough for anyone else.

Thanks, Warryn.

****** A comma is actually used for address, Warryn.

"Thanks Warryn" would be absolutely meaningless. "Thanks, Warryn," could indeed, however, mean you were thanking somebody else named Warryn, the old adage being that one does not say, "Let's eat Grandma!" but "Let's eat, Grandma."

******* Yes. True, but commas can be used differently. The way I use it is different, and the example you used is seperate to how I use it. I use it at the end to say goodbye, while the example you have is a form of addressing someone, not saying farewell.

When you end letters, the way I use it is a very well known, and used way of ending written documents, but I have seen what you're talking about, and the way you describe is one used quite often in America, but where I live, the way I end it is the more commonly used one. What I think we have here is just a difference in culture maybe.

Thanks, Warryn.

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.

** linkffn(Oh God, Not Again) Harry starts milking his fame for all the money it's worth, to the point where people don't think he's the Heir of Slytherin because he would be selling petrification as a service if he were.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
