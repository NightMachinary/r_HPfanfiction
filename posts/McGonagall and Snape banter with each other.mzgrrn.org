Doesn't have to be the main thing, but can be.

If anyone wants to use this as a prompt go ahead instead of as a request go ahead.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or new


** So- I just read a fic that had my FAVE Snape/McGonagall banter (and also they liked to sneak around and drink whiskey and smoke late at night when the kids were in bed)- the premise is that Harry gets temporarily moved to Slytherin after an outburst (and it's great for Snape-centric, behind the scenes of Slytherin and it's really wholesome).

A Learning Experience by Margot11 ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12906599/1/A-Learning-Experience]]) - it's a great fanfic with two sequels. And so much great Snape-McGonagall banter.

  How would things have been if Harry had got to know Snape and his Snakes better? A 'Harry in Slytherin' story. Don't groan; it's not that bad! Warnings: mention of sex later on (very mild); typical teenage swearing (mild) and corporal punishment (not graphic or extreme). (Note: the beginning is heavily inspired by Asterix Tutnix.)
