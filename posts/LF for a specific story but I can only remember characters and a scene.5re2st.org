There's a story I'm looking for that I believe is Harry/Fleur (may also have Gabby and Hermione thrown in) and there's a scene where Fleur is explaining how House Elves used to be gremlins. People used to hunt them to keep them from destroying everything and how Uric the Oddball discovered that they fed off magic. Anyone know this story?

  Harry helps Fleur in the second task of GOF and pays the price. HP/Fleur/Gabrielle/Hermione. A Veela bonding fic based on love. T Rated and it will stay that way. Thirteen year old Almost fourteen Gabrielle to start the story. Good Dumbledore.
