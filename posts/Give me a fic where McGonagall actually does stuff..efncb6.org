#+begin_quote
  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** Ooh, another opportunity to personify my flair!

Meaning of One by Sovran: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

It's a Hinny Soul-Bond fic, the best Harry Potter fic in my opinion and the best McGonagall I've seen.

She sort of takes a surrogate mother role and is heavily involved in the lives of Harry and Ginny. Seriously, she's the best.

There's 600k words so far, but it's only recently finished CoS, with no continuation in sight.

** Harry McGonagall series. McGonagall gets a squib relative to adopt harry and move to america. She's all over the plot. Harry has a younger adopted sister. It goes into how MACUSA handles things. Ravenclaw Harry.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

**** Yes, I am not a big fan of Harmony myself, and especially in this story Harry/Hermione relationship is probably the worst part of the story (they are so perfect, I want to vomit), but still more peripheral characters (like McGonagall and Snape, or Percy Weasley!) are very well written. There is no soul bond, and the marriage law is just to get Harry & Grangers out of the country, otherwise it doesn't play large role in the story.
