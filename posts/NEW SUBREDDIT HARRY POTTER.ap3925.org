** You're the only one posting there, half the thread titles are in allcaps, this thread has an allcaps title as well, Voldemorts dumb face covers up the D so it looks like "the boy who livel" in the banner, and you need to learn to apply stuff like period marks in your sentences. Sorry, but this is all just a bit shit.

**** I don't know what has happened/is going on to make you such an angry young man, but this sort of thing isn't going to make you any happier. Instead of trying to create your own community, why don't you get involved and be friendly in existing ones?

*** I don't think you're giving this sub a fair hearing, Flo. It's easy to see how it distinguishes itself from [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]:

- More exclamation marks!

- MORE ALL CAPS.

- Potentially operated by a spam bot.
