LF one of the good guys has enough with Dumbledore's anti-killing propaganda and the ministry getting in the way and decides to start assassinating people. Doesn't matter who is getting killed (ministry people/death eaters) as long as they are the bad guys. I'm looking for a little more cloak and dagger assassination behind the scenes kinda story but if you have a story of someone openly killing people and somehow getting away with it I'll read that too.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

Dumbeldore doesn't have a anti-killing agenda, the order of phoenix is even okay with causing civilian casualties if they have to.

linkffn(6245561) but that should fit your request. it seems like a chliche romance at first but it becomes quite dark a couple chapters in.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Time and time again the Bad Guys do bad things and get away with it. Time and time again the Good Guys take the low blow and just soldier on with their upper lips stiff. What might happen if someone couldn't hold it together? How would Magical Britain react? More to the point; who would they blame? A little One-Shot in documentary style.

** In For Love of Magic, Harry lives in an adoptive household that uses him as kind of a status symbol. He figures out their line of thinking and decides to make the most of himself.

Stuff goes wrong. I actually like this story, but I would just read until he goes to America. Then the story jumps the shark completely and slows way down.

Smut and gore warning.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  This story, as a few are in the world of Harry Potter fanfiction, stems from one of those many ideas of Rorschachs Blot, entitled "Nothing to Lose." One of the areas this story will explore is the possible impact on Harry Potter and friends of the isolation that our dear old friend, Albus Dumbledore, always fed to him: this isolation will make up its own reality.
