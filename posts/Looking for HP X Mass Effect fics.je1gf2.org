Heya all, looking for recommendations for any Harry Potter and Mass Effect crossover fanfics out there. I did some searching through the sub and far as I can tell literally the only one ever recommended in this sub has been Harry Potter: Geth (which I just finished today and in fairness was generally solid), but the last thread was almost 2 years ago so maybe somethings popped up in the interim.
