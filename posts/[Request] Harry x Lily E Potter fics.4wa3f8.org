I've always found the thought of this pairing hilarious, and when it's not just a smut story with no plot, I find it can be somewhat humorous. Are there any good stories involving this?


** I haven't read it yet but Whiskey Time Travel ffnlink(11233445) has that among other attributes.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
