I mean fics where jumping around in a duel makes your spell work sloppy so you shouldn't do it.

Where it turns out guns are ineffective.

Please no death eater whitewashing.

Also, this is a request thread. No arguing the prompt isn't canon.

Edit: Meant to say whitewashing. Your replies are hilarious though... I'm glad I didn't mess up mugglewank.


** C'mon, guys. OP even reminded y'all to not discuss the request.

*** I actually didn't mind them making fun of the typo.

That was pretty funny, and it seriously entertained me.

I just dislike when someone comes on a request thread to spout their opinion on the topic just to argue.

** I like how linkffn(what's her name in hufflepuff) addresses the martial arts trope.

#+begin_quote
  Funny thing is I actually already know martial arts.

  I've been practicing in and out of various dojos since I was 14. I had six years of karate, four years of aikdo, and a year of jujitsu. And as the years went by, and I accumulated more and more knowledge; I finally realized one undeniable truth.

  I kind of suck at it.

Lemme see if I understand you correctly. You can't fit a fic of this size into any of your current memory (time? attention?) slots, because a 150k wordcount is larger than any you currently have available.

I think you should uh... Defragment some of your memory?

I think I've lost the metaphor

No, no. You got through to me in the end.

I do, however, find it very interesting to meet someone with the /exact opposite/ approach to reading pace. I can pick up and put down stories left and right, sometimes juggling three books at once. I barely even /touch/ anything below 100k words.

**** Check it out. I normally stay far away from self inserts and first person POV but this fic is great. It's a good balance of humour and seriousness and has a lot of trope subversions. The worldbuilding reminds me of the original Harry Potters books and it manages to be original enough to avoid all the usual canon rehash scenes.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
