Just finished reading "I'll Play Your Game" by jaysehasnograce [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23795692]] linkao3(23795692). Pretty good Drarry slow burn romance story. Nothing special in terms of plot or characters, but well written so I enjoyed it and finished it. One thing I liked is that the story has a good heart and a positive vibe. Recommended.

  After quitting the Auror department at the ripe old age of twenty two, Harry Potter finds a nice, uneventful job in an apothecary. At least, it's uneventful until his old rival Draco Malfoy comes into the shop. They strike up an unlikely friendship, which evolves into an increasingly convoluted scheme, which then snowballs spectacularly out of control into a tangle of lies and blurred lines. They'd agreed to a fake relationship --- in Harry's case, to get the wizarding world to take him off his 'perfect saviour' pedestal, and in Draco's case, just to be given a chance in wizarding society at all --- but neither of them expected just how difficult that might really turn out to be. Especially when the stakes grow ever higher, and they both start falling for each other. Just a little bit.
