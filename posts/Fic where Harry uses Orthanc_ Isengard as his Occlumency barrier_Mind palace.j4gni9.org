Read this one a while ago, can't remember enough to find it again. I /think/ it was Harry (though it may have been Hermione) being taught Occlumency by Bellatrix, but that is the only detail I am certain on. This wasn't a crossover, just a book as inspiration for their shields. Hopefully that is enough for you all to work your magic with. Thank you ahead of time.
