The fic I'm looking for is called Safe Keeping. I don't know who was the author. But all I have is the old link.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7192167/1/Safe-Keeping]]

And I managed to find the summary through a pasteben. Which is the below.

"Hermione Granger has been harboring an obsession over the Lady of the Manor for quite some time. A new threat to the Malfoys has brought Hermione to the Manor and things will never be the same for anyone involved."

I wanted to know if a copy of it was floating somewhere in the vast space of the internet?


** Well, archive.org certainly remembers it:
