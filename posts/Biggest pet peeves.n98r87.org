Everyone has a pet peeve that makes them go into a frenzy before giving up on the fic burning your house down destroying whatever device you're reading. My ABSOLUTE fav is anything Slytherin politic related since it the most ludicrous thing like who expects a child to do half of the stuff they say like let the kids relax for goodness sake.


** Bashing.\\
If there is bashing, I am out without a second thought. I am not wasting my time on a fic with such low-quality writing.

Hint to any author out there: If you are writing a 'bash-character' then just don't write the character in the first place. It is literally just a drain on the story and is clearly just there for the author to get off on.

** 1. The trio suddenly hating each other or “breaking up” for no good reason. They went through a crucible ffs.

2. Grammar/netspeak.

3. Intolerance. Homophobia, prejudice, discrimination that isn't addressed as BAD.

4. Harry being perfectly mentally stable after everything he endured.

*** I was reading a !Slytherin Harry fic inspired me to write this post cuz it was so bad like If you're into that stuff fine but they actually made up points to make Voldemort and Slytherins less bad like they changed it from we want rid of all muggle-borns and anyone with muggle connection to muggle-borns disrespect our culture even though it would be impossible for them not to and we don't like them cuz their insensitive never mind the fact the authors new logic made less sense. NOt only was it preaching this exclusive open narrow mindedness nonsense that sounded like EDL members who complain about Muslims coming to 'their country' stealing jobs and not integrating with everyone else. I was going to leave a comment but I don't think I could contain how much I wanted to say. The worst part was the actual customs were so dumb and archaic yet they had Hermoine probably the last witch on earth who would ever conform to dumb stuff like that plus it had the super powerful Harry which was the biggest turnoff ever like he's 12 stop making him study and read ahead and get all O's being a perfect student like how is that fun

**** Okay so two things with that. First of please break up your sentences more and work on punctuation because the run on sentences physically hurt to read. Secondly, I think the trope of blood supremacy and the dislike of muggleborns being due to them not following customs and culture has some merit. People look at the Wizarding world and immediately think that it is backwards and compare it to other periods in muggle history but at the end of the day the Wizarding world is a completely separate entity.

Harry's lack of knowledge of the Wizarding world gives us a view of it that doesn't include any positives or big differences, whether that is a writing error for Rowling or intentional because of who he hangs around with is up for debate. Imagine if people immigrated to your country and then immediately began firing off about how backwards it is and attempted to change things about the culture that you and the whole population enjoy. Can't you see that causing a rift between the natives and the immigrants? This is the same thing that is happening here. I really enjoy if an author goes out of their way to change Wizarding society and give it more substance because that gives another reason for the Purebloods to have a valid excuse for disliking the muggleborns who hate the society. Now I'm not condoning the Blood Purist agenda or arguing the Death Eaters are in the right to torture, kill, and rape because they obviously aren't but it gives Voldemort a better way of recruiting and helps reinforce why he rose up so easily in the first place.

That along with the way Christianity and other monotheistic religions led to so much negatively and animosity towards and magic users or magical society in general gives great insight to why muggles and muggleborns are hated. Can you honestly say that if you were a wizard or witch you wouldn't feel anger reading and studying up on the way that people would be dragged through the streets drowned, stoned, or burnt at the stake just because they have magic. Yeah flame freezing charms are a thing but what about the children who experienced accidental magic or the people who were caught away from their wands. Or give thought to the fact that flame freezing charms were probably made for the purpose of trying to save those who were being burnt at the stake, along with other magics.

***** Diffrence is that muggleborns were coming in and no one helped them adjust and when they did it was in a cringe Syltherin way like you musn't be human and show emotion no you must be rich and have nice clothes. Wizards discrimating agaisnt people who have no control over who they are is dumb as shit. Like the fic in question made me lose repsect for so many charcters like Hermoine as she was arguing a valid point like enslaving elves is wrong jus cuz you like doing something doesn't mean you don't deserve rights and payment. But the author was like lol no they like doing it so it's fine to enslave an entire race ha. People have no qualms with goblin being indepdent so why not elves. Another thing was making it so impressive that a pureblood talked to a muggleborn and it's alwasy Hermoine and there excuse is always 'she's smart so in the future she'll be a good ally' so you're saying someone needs to have something in order for them to be useful and eligible to be your freind. If that isn't the most shallow thing I've ever heard. In the canon (I know it's a fic so I take it with a grain of salt when comparing) all the muggleborns we encouter are jsut normal nice people who don't bother anyone yet all the purebloods who still care about blood literally are the villains.

​

For your last point honestly no I wouldn't as in our society I understand the hatred i've felt towards white people for killing and enslaving people like me only to realise that almost everyone I encouter isn't like that at all. It would work vice versa also with muggles hating wizards for a plethra of things and yeah muggles probably started it first but now they no nothing of magic and yet people still hate them and muggleborns liek how ignorant must you be to realise how dumb that is.

** Okay, I like slash and femslash. I love queer fics because that's what I am.

But I'm tired of finding fics where gay couples (specifically gay men) are portrayed as one being overly aggressive and dominating, and they other overly submissive and effeminate. It is really awkward and sometimes comes across as rapey.

**** That's what I'm trying for my Harry/Ron fic. It'll have a lot of canon characters that are queer. Early on it focuses on Harry and Ron's developing relationship, with rocky bits and confusion because Harry doesn't understand that he's bisexual. Ron doesn't want to push him because he doesn't know if Harry reciprocates those feelings. It takes a burst of accidental magic for him to realize the feeling he has about Ron is romantic in nature.

** It is usually announced at the start of the fic, which means that it's less about losing interest and more about never having any, but I can't stand Harem.

From the start, I have never been a fan of Harem. The stories that use Harem (such as all the Xianxia or Wuxia) tend to be full of tropes that I dislike, such as the Female Character that lose all personality and development the moment she joins the harem, or the MC being more focused on his next target (sorry "love") than on the actual plot.

But I hate it even more in HP because the universe is clearly not made for Harem. If Harem is truly that common in the Magical World (like the "he needs one girl by Noble House" that is often used in Lordship! stories), then why the hell is Harry the only one with a Harem. And if Harem is not a cultural thing, then why the hell is nobody reacting to Harry having a harem? I know it's a bit stupid to talk about "realism" in a fantasy story, but is there anything less believable than two 14 years old girls saying "/We decided to share you/"? And that's only with 2 girls, most of the Harem story seem to have between 4 and every named girls as part of Harry's harem (which would clearly not create a demographic problem in the next generation when most children would be sibling).

​

Outside of that, I also dislike any fic that advertise an "improved Harry", because most of them just make Harry an unlikable ass while giving him a Harem.

*** Even fantasy stories need realism, it's just that the realism needs to fit the rules of that particular fantasy world.

The /Malazan Book of the Fallen/ and /TheLord of the Rings/ are both fantasy but it would be unrealistic for Gandalf to start chucking Moranth munitions of the walls of Helm Hammerhand just like it would be unrealistic to have the Bridgeburners teaming up with dwarves to eliminate invading goblins.

*** Most of the other stories using that as a justification for a harem /will/ feature other group marriages. Neville and some combo of Susan Bones/Hannah Abbot/Luna Lovegood being one of the more common. Daft Morons has Susan and Hannah deciding they're a package deal at a young age, and eventually selecting Neville as their guy. I just read a Haphne story where NL/SB/LL is a triad marriage, and Harry is monogamous.

While I do like Xianxia, I have to agree with you that a lot of the harems really don't do a good job of keeping the members interesting or relevant after they join.

**** I would say that Neville (who is usually raised to Harry best friend/ follower in this kind of stories) does not really count since Neville is so close to Harry. It's less "Harem is a normal thing in the Magical World", and more "He is with me so he gets his own Harem".\\
It's comparable to the problem I have with a lot of "Lordship" fics: Harry is not the only person in the magical world with a brain. If a 12 years old can find a loophole in the law that let him have several lordship and a total control over the Wizengamot avec reading 2 law books, then several other people should also have figured it.

I may dislike "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" for a variety of reasons, but at least the story does a good job at introducing Harem. By showing that "Random Lord N°45" does have his own Harem despite being mostly irrevelant to the story, it demonstrates that Harems are an integrate part of the Wizarding Culture, though one that is rather frown upon.

** I'm pretty sure no one puts that much heart in fics that they burn their house down. However my biggest pet peeve is people arguing that fanfics can be anything if the author decides so and no one has the right to say anything about it. Sure... I'm not going to stop you from writing your fantasy about Voldemort secretly being a unicorn who likes to be humped by Harry's and Fluffy's child. But if you're going to make it public, expect criticism. At the very least appreciate the fact that I found your story good enough to brave through the crappier parts. So don't give me that bullshit "It's fanfiction so I write what I want." If you want to write whatever you want without criticism just don't post it anywhere.

*** I agree with most of what you said. However...

I think most people expect, and have no problem with accepting constructive criticism. Thing is, 90% of 'critisism' on ffn, at least, isn't criticism, but just people being assholes.

"Your Harry is an idiot."

"Your Harry should just go and kill himself."

"Your Harry is a pathetic piece of shit."

"This is crap."

"This story is crap, and the author is a retard."

When some stories get a bunch of these, then I can fully understand why authors react like the way you just described.

And to those who leave comments like these on other people's work: you're the one's who are sad and pathetic, and seem to find some kind of fulfillment in making other people feel miserable. Just shut your shithole, if you can't say something constructive.

***** I've gotten quite a few reviews on my story, which 'lamented' the fact that my Harry doesn't become a stone cold killer fast enough. And they usually leave those reviews after reading three chapters. And there's 14 chapters of story to read!

My Harry is a very kind person who has been through a lot in his life and everything he's trying to do, is about making the world a better place.

I wanted him to struggle with deliberately taking a life, regardless of whose life it is. I wanted that struggle to be a part of his development.

Now, I understand why some people don't like it, and some of the critique is perfectly justified. However the way people express their views, does not lend itself to them being heard. Be polite, and show respect, even if you don't like what others write.

** 1. Dan and Emma Granger. The moment those names pop up, my interest in the story evaporates very quickly. Only one of the stories with those names that I have encountered (The Accidental Animagus) was almost bearable, but it turned out to be so boring that I gave up at chapter 10 or so.

2. "There has to be a Potter Family Vault, not just the Trust Vault you've been using." Seriously, what is the need to make Harry richer than he is in canon? Especially since we don't know for sure how rich he is. You can make him a multi-millionaire without going against canon, and I can't even imagine any plot reasons he would need to be richer than that.

3. Rituals and other excuses to make characters more powerful. I'm currently reading New Blood, and one unique thing in its worldbuilding is that witchcraft is a different branch of magic from wizardry, and it's based on rituals that make its practitioners much more powerful. For some unexplained reason witchcraft is rare and frowned upon, and for some other unexplained reason most magical people don't even know about it. Then Hermione starts practicing it, and wow, amazing super-powers are unlocked! At the moment I'm considering stopping reading the story, but also because it has become increasingly boring.

4. Mary Sues and author self-inserts/mouthpieces are bad. Another major annoyance in New Blood.

5. Too much focus on romance. All story elements need drama and tension to be interesting. Many fanfiction writers seem to like their characters on a lovely honeymoon (probably a personal fantasy), but it's something I have grown absolutely tired with. As a side plot romance can be interesting, but such stories are so rare that I try to avoid stories with romance altogether.

6. Filler. I get it that when a fanfiction writer gets constant good feedback on their chapters, they are tempted to write more, even if the result is chapters that are unnecessary to the plot and character development. A Cadmean Victory is a story with probably two thirds of the text just filler, and it earned its place as my least favourite story I have finished reading.

As for mouthpieces, I actually don't mind them, if the author takes time to build it up, and gives proper context. If it comes in completely from left field, it's definitely annoying.

It is not explicitly stated that Harry couldn't have afforded to buy the Firebolt. This is the paragraph from PoA:

#+begin_quote
  Price on request ... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life --- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn't ask for the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.

- Half hearted, lacking confidence even well into the fic Mc's, especially when it goes against the premise of the fic

- Over the top humor/sarcasm(these fics usually contain bashing) where it is not needed or out if character to do.

- This is a slight annoyance, but when authors overestimate something like responding after 5 minutes of staring during a flowing conversation, instead of like 5 seconds.
