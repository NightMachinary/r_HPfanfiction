I wanted to do a crossover between Harry Potter and Samurai Warriors.

For those who do not know, Samurai Warriors is about warriors in feudal Japan who are based on historical figure.

But I put like a crossover, will it be more difficult to find? On the other hand, I'm not really putting the main cast of Harry Potter with the Japanese warriors.

I want to make a story in ancient Japan involving elements of the Harry Potter world, such as mahoutokoro.

So should I just put it like a normal Harry Potter story? It would be almost like having a lot of ocs, except that with historical figures (more or less, but closer to the game).

Thanks for atention.


** Sounds more like a Samura Warrior story with some HP elements. If it's not a crossover, it should be a normal samurai warrior story.

*** But what if I put things like that Japanese magic school that was mentioned in pottemore?

In fact I'm epsanndo on something like the movie "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" (which basically only has two characters indirectly related to the original story). So I think I could just use a character mentioned in the pottemore who lived in the 16th century.

But like I said, there's going to be a lot of people reading it being a crossover and how the characters are based on historical figures, so I'm going to pose as a normal harry potter story. Thanks for listening.

** If it's crossing over with actual historical events, then I think you can just post it as a regular fic and say that it's a "Samurai AU" in the story description.
