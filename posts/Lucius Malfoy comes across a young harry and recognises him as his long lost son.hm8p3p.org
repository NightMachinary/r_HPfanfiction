:END:
Hi looking for a fic that i came across not long ago where lucius meets a young harry and immediately recognises him as his and narcissa's missing son.

Harry acts younger or may actually be quite younger than draco a bit unclear on that. I remember him being very childlike.

I think voldemort/ Tom is involved as well as a close family friend and godfather / uncle to harry and draco.

This is where it gets hazy but the real harry potter is found to be alive and living somewhere in europe with his dad james who survived too. The real harry and james become friends with the malfoys.

Aaand thats all i can remember.


** Don't know the fic but would love to read it once you find it
