** I agree, one of the best. It's very well made and really a story that hasn't been told before. I'd really love to see more of this era in canon. I'm glad there are so many filmmakers taking the initiative bring it to screen.

** Yeah, it was truly good. Like it was good. I was never really certain how to view the long bottoms in my mind but these actors have taken over my mind for those characters.
