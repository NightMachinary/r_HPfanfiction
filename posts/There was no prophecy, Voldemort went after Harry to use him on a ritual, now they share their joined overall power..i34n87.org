Voldemort went after Harry because the date of his birth (the last day of the seventh month)/ his linage/whatever could be used in a ritual to boost his powers enough to let him defeat Dumbledore. However Lily's ritual messed it and made it so they share their total magical power instead of it being all Voldemort's, so now he have to kill Harry to go back to his full-power.

Harry originally had all his growing power (admittedly not that much as he used mostly Voldemort's instead of exercising his own) plus Voldemort's until Voldy comes back and pulls his half back into himself plus some more. As Harry always relied mostly on Voldemort's power he now has to actually build his own reserves to the point of being able to fight Voldemort while playing what amounts to a constant game of tug-of-war with his enemy (who is much more skilled in such things) over their shared might.

Voldemort on the other hand has to deal with having an unstable grip on his magic (as Harry can pull a bit more to himself at any moment) which prevents him from doing things he previously would think nothing about -such as fighting singlehanded a large number of skilled opponents or dueling Dumbledore one-on-one- until he can kill Harry to get back to being almost invincible.

Other things could also play a part in their rivalry, such as the blood protections rendering Voldemort unable of taking an unlimited amount of magic from Harry or truly killing or gravely injury him directly and through his DE until he reaches seventeen years of age. Or the Elder wand being Voldemort's way of gaining an edge in their fight and the destruction of his Horcruxies giving him back a little more power at the cost of making him mentally unstable. Or the DE's and students are aware of the situation and are trying to either make sure their side will win no matter what or curbing favor with both sides as in the ends the one to kill the other will become extremely powerful. Or Harry had gotten used to using Voldemort's power before the resurrection to do great feats of magic and having to deal with suddenly having a much smaller usable power pool...
