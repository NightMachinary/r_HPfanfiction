:END:
Please Help.


** The only time I have ever come across a fic that included The Rabbit of Caerbannog was in a collection of shorts called Bolts from the Blue by sprinter1988.

The story Harry Potter: Unexpected Animagus by DWDUCK has Luna's animagus form be a Vabbit also know as a VCR a Very Carnivorous Rabbit which is a nod to The Rabbit of Caerbannog.

The fic He's Not Dead Yet by Redbayly has Luna with a rabbit as her patronus but I don't recall any tie or mention of the Rabbit of Caerbannog.

  When Harry offered himself up to Voldemort, he discovered the people in the Ministry of Death are not happy with him at all. To make up for his years of blunders, Harry is sent back in time to correct everything that went wrong and to get some revenge. Harry/6 girls, Bashing of Dumbledore, Snape, and certain Weasleys. Written for humor only. Lots of cliches. Reviews welcome.

*** Thank you for your help. I completely forgot about He's Not Dead Yet, that probably is the one I'm looking for. Thanks!
