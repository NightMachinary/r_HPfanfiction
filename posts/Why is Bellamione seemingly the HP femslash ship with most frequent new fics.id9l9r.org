While I'm only basing this on AO3 and it could be different elsewhere I've just noticed that it seems to be 75% Bellatrix/Hermione fics when I'm looking for new femslash week to week. I get why there's appeal to the ship Bellatrix being darkly alluring and attractive in sort of demented kind of way, Hermione being a muggle-born and forbidden romance angle and what not drawing people to it.

Only, it Just...it seems like one of the more problematic ships you could possibly do? Why don't more people write Hermione with Ginny or other less insane characters like the old days? I'm just very curious how/why this ship seems to rule the roost in HP Femslash lol Is it just like Darry being the most popular male slash ship, people just really dig enemies to lovers or something?? haha


** If it was enemies to lovers then it would be an influx of Pansymione fics, but yeah, Bellamione is one of the less thought about opposite backgrounds pairings.

I personally think it's kinda to do with the weird romanticising of kidnapper/prisoner falling in love relationships, recently popularised by, God forbid it, tiktok. It also works because it falls under the sudden boom in the popularity of Bdsm and dom/sub relationships, though whether or not the relationship portrayed in the fic is actually bdsm or just abuse is up for debate.

I had a chat with a few people who ship it and they thrive on the issues of the relationship, especially after the torture scene. I suggested a few plot lines which would make the pairing significantly less problematic (divergence before and without Bellatrix killing Sirius and torturing Hermione), and they weren't interested because it ruins the dynamic.

**** There are two ways to make a Bellatrix ship work (short of total AUs where she was never a death eater).

Either do it like Passageways and connect her (from the 60s/70s) and Harry/Hermione before they even learns that she is a death eater and have her be pretty appalled by what she became (and take steps to avoid that fate).

Or have her defect before the DoM battle, fight the entire war along Harry and Hermione as a redemption arc and have them catch feelings along the way. She served her time in Azkaban (unlike Snape or Malfoy), she did a lot of good by killing death eaters and by that time, the age difference isn't as questionable anymore since Harry or Hermione ought to be adults by now.

Ugh, don't even get me started me on BDSM. Curse the woman who wrote 50 Shades. 90% of authors can't spend half an hour on the internet to read about normal dom/ sub relationships. Words like safe, sane and consensual are entirely foreign to them. Most fics tagged BDSM are just abuse and even rape.

*** I kinda see it as the female Snarry actually. Dark, older, passionate, high-tempered and talented person with one of the Trio. In the few fics I'd looked at, Bella renounces Voldemort and ends up being grey as opposed to fully evil, which is remarkably like Snape (his fall away from the Death Eaters was Lily, whereas Bella centered fics show her time in Azkaban and/or the ruin of the House of Black being her impetus to switch sides).

There also aren't many older female characters to work with for femmeslash that aren't /much/ older, shown outside of a “mothering” light, or just fleshed out very much. Bellatrix is complicated, childless, broken but still proud, and has a rich background being a Black (and we know a lot about that family because of Sirius).

I don't like the pairing either, it does fill a particular void if you want femmeslash in the universe without creating a whole new character.

**** I've seen many fics where Hermione is her slave or her prisoner, at least as the initial premise. Whether that changes as the story goes I didn't care to find out, because nothing in the tags or first chapter convinced me otherwise. My personal experience with Bellamione is that it's messed up, in the same vein as Tomarry. Both feature abusive relationships or story elements to justify the MC turning to the dark side. I'm sure there are a fair number of fics like you described, but so far my experience with these new Bellamione fics has been negative.

********** It was a shock for me when I read it. Maybe people can't even recognise how much they are used to the many tropes of storytelling that is overused everywhere these days.

If you watch a AAA movie and there's a little hint of a possible conflict, you know that there will be a conflict. This story went with the boring path without a huge fight and it was really unexpected.

For me, this was the point where I realized how much different fanfictions can be comparing to monetized media, where they mostly don't dare to go with a peaceful and less interesting way, even if the whole story would benefit from it.

*********** Well, yeah. That's how storytelling works. Tropes aren't the nightmarish things that this fandom seems to think they are, they're the building blocks of every story ever written. Like chemicals being the building blocks of basically everything we deal with IRL. Everything is tropes until it gets overused, then it becomes cliche (ie. an overused trope that people dislike), and we move onto different tropes. It's how it's always been, and it's a good thing. Without tropes, we'd have no idea what was happening in a story and have no way to relate to it. But tropes don't mean stuff has to be done in the same way, it's all about how they're used.

Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings all use the same introductory trope 'Boy leaves Farm' where a relatively inexperienced person is taken out into the wider world to experience some new adventures while not really having a clue about anything. It's the same trope, used in three drastically different ways, all to create interesting stories.

Even that 'romance ending nicely with no conflict so they can go be with someone else' thing is a pre-existing trope - it's pretty common in certain subsets of romance stories where the couple breaks up, one admitting their love for someone else, before the first person leaves so the other can go run madly after the new person they're in love with.

Sorry if that comes off as patronising. It's been a long day and I struggle with tact when I'm tired. I didn't mean it patronisingly, if it did come off that way, just in an explanative fashion. :)

** I binge them when I'm in the mood. Can't really explain the appeal well. Like you say, it's darkly alluring.

The fact that I tend to project myself onto Hermione a lot makes me think I might have some unresolved issues... but then again, I already knew that.

** I can't really comment on why people like the ship, but I'm pretty sure the recent influx is from two sources:

One, the Bellamione discord server has been pretty active the past few months, or at least the writers there have been

Two, a lot of older and fairly popular Bellamione fics are being moved from fanfiction.net to Ao3.

** I imagine that people who want to write more vanilla femmeslash are doing it in different fandoms these days. If you're writing HP fanfic in 2020, it's because of something about the setting or characters that you can't find elsewhere. I expect that that stuff to do with Voldemort and death eaters hits that.

I clicked on this thread because I've just started writing by first fanfic in about eight years - and it's Bellatrix/diary-Tom and diary-Tom/Percy. The "vibe" of the Bellatrix/Tom is pretty close to a lot of the Bellatrix/Hermione that I've read.

Kinky /fantasies/ are often not SSC, because the story is the scene. The characters don't have a safeword, but the the author can stop writing, or the reader can stop reading, whenever they like, and those are the real people whose comfort and consent matters. A person who is part of a scene might be pretending to have been kidnapped and to be non-consenting, but /they/ know that they are pretending, just as when we're reading a story we know that the characters aren't real.

As for whether school age romance is immoral, I know that I wrote some of it when I was a teenager, and obviously wanted romance with people my own age. When I got to seventeen or so, school age romances started squicking me more, so I stopped writing them.

** This post is old but I kind of stumbled on it now so... If by any chances someone is interested yet, I believe the “Those Gilded Chains We Wear” story is a pretty decent reason to get into belamione. I wasn't until it. Such an amazing redemption arch, touching on mental disease as well as Hermione respecting herself and not accepting Bellatrix shit. One of my favorite fanfics at all. It is an old story but is all I can think of referring to bellamione.

  I get why there's appeal to the ship
#+end_quote

On the other hand, I don't. It's like paring a member of KKK with a POC. Bellatrix isn't attractive. She spent over a decade in prison. The actress Helena Bonham Carter is attractive. There is a difference. I genuinely don't understand what's so attractive about crazy sadists like Bellatrix. Lots of people just seem to get off on reading about abusive relationships like Bellatrix/ Hermione and Harry/ Snape. But that's just not my thing. There are plenty of other women an author can pair Hermione with like Fleur, Tonks, Daphne, Angelina, Alicia, Katie, Padma, Susan, etc.

*** This fandom is just awful for a lot of popular ships. It's just so much Death Eater pairings. I swear if Umbitch was played by a younger, hot actress, we'd have like 20 times the fics about her that we currently have and half of them would be not-really-BDSM with Harry or Hermione.
