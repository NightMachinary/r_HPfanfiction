Atticus had lifted his wand and flung it into his pocket as we shuffled out the front door. "All set?" he asked, nervously tapping his foot against the rocky pavement below him, "Yes." I smirked, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek as I grabbed his keys. "So," Atticus sighed, "Are they nice?" "Of course, dear." I laughed. We were on our way to meet my parents. Of course, it's to be expected that anyone would be nervous meeting their significant other's family for the first time.

Atticus brushed off his boots and ducked into the very much so No-Maj car he drove to and from work. "Do they like-" Atticus spat as he started the car. I hesitated before answering, "I'm sure." i coughed. As we backed out of the driveway, panic started to wash over me. My parents were both magic. I am purely magical, or at least that's what my boyfriend says I am. He isn't a No-Maj if you're wondering. He's half and half as I like to call him. His late mother was a No-Maj, and his father is a wizard.

The car was clacking and sputtering like it usually did, his car was very old, a station wagon, the only thing left of his mother's. It had no heating, everything inside of it was busted. I offered Floo Powder, but it makes Atticus nervous since he can never really grasp the pronunciation step. "Make a- left here." I said as we turned up to an intersection. As we turned onto another street, my parents' house started to peak over the farthest end of the small subdivision they lived in.

When we pulled into the driveway, I patted Atticus' shoulder, "They'll love you." I smiled as I closed the car door behind me. If you're wondering why my parents live in a No-Maj city, it's because their version of retirement is living in the middle-of-nowhere Illinois. Apparently wizarding life can be too much after age 58. They wanted something simple I guess.
