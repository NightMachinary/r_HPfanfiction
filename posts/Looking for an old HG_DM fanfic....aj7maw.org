** The only Dramione fic I know of that mentions a jungle is Parade of the Sun by everythursday which was on H&V which is now gone, could that be it?

But I think it's a strictly post Hogwarts fic so how the head dorm portrait fits in I have no idea

Edited to add: Crosspost to [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]] for more help :)

*** That does sound familiar. Thank you!

I think I actually found it, “God of the Lost” by Gravidy.
