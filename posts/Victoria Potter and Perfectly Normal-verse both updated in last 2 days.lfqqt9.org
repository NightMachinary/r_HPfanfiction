*** Of course! She's wonderful: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/6872861/BrilliantLady]] - it's a series that's just gotten to the start of the 4th year.

As well as the Perfectly Normal series, she also wrote a fantastic “Hermione Granger, Demonologist” ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist]])

*** Fem! Harry in slytherin.

That sounds very generic but 10/10 would recommend.

Great world building that doesn't bash you in the face with how smart the writer is. No long boring exposition dumps.

Isn't just a Canon rehash.

Genius main character but not too OP so far.

Pretty realistic preteens.

Explores magical theory (not the bullshit magical core kind)

**** Well, not to bash on Taure, but last I checked the only things Victoria isn't/wasn't a genius in were Flying, the Locomotor Charm, and the made-up and contrived new duelling system because apparently you don't have the right to use the Shield Charm when duelling.

***** Victoria is the smartest person in her Hogwarts year but she

1. gets tricked by two children in first year.
2. gets tricked by snape in first year.
3. couldn't handle a troll
4. gets her ass almost murdered at malfoy manor. her attacker backed off.
5. outsmarted by granger with the umbrella vs imperturbable charm
6. absolutely no match for lockhart.
7. struggles with the boggart troll

The problem with a lot of smart protagonist fics is that they can't contextualize smart children. Often times, they are the third strongest/smartest character, after voldemort and dumbledore, and easily ahead of order members/aurors/death eaters etc.

I think Victoria at the end of second year is probably the level of a pretty smart fifth year and nowhere close to actual competent adult wizards. I am pretty sure when Victoria grows older, she'll be just below that Voldemort/Dumbledore level but she's still so far away.

We probably just have different ideas of what OP is.

****** I didn't mean to say she was perfect, it's just that, like, 95% of things go her way. She's a metamorphmagus, gets well treated by the Dursleys (with no explanation) and even gets money from them, she's a natural at arithmancy and pretty much all magic, her potion that they test at Hogsmeade is the best by 1000 miles (had it only been a potion they gave to Snape for grading and not for showing would have been less in your face), her potion crystal and it being 'deep magic', her being able to master the goshawk totem, she invents a literal portal in second-year, she got tricked by Pansy, has a rivalry with Hermione (but Vicky's so much better than Hermione because she just /gets/ magic and Hermione only has her small one-up moments) and Zacharias gets on her nerve because he's got better reflexes than her, but otherwise, pretty much everyone likes her. It's just too much greatness for not enough... mediocre-ness.

The story is great, it's just Victoria is infuriating to me because instead of relating to her (which, considering Taure is the author, I assume is the goal), I only see old classmates who were just /better/ at school and stuff as well as having a great social life. All of that, apparently, because she was born with two X chromosomes instead of only one.

Also, I wouldn't really say being tricked by Snape (who was able to trick Voldemort) at eleven, being nearly killed by a terrorist, or not being a match for an adult wizard at age twelve goes against being intelligent. Especially the Death Eater thing. That's like saying kid Einstein is at gunpoint and is about to be killed by a SS (forget the anachronism) before the SS notices some jewellery kid Einstein wears and so backs off. If anything, her genius in potions saved her life, here.

This may sound overly critical, and I'm sorry if it is, but even Dumbledore and Riddle had to face prejudice and bad baggage from their childhood in their early years at Hogwarts, which, again, Victoria doesn't seem to face iirc.

******* I partially agree with you: I don't particularly care for Victoria (certainly don't see why she has to be pretty and a genius /and/ fairly sociable).

That said, I pretty much never read stories that have an OP/Smart Harry as they always seem to feel like low-brow wish fulfilment and power fantasy. The main character typically suffers too much from protagonist syndrome, and Victoria does seem to share that flaw. And yet I have still been following Victoria Potter as it's just too well written to ignore and, even having decried her character, I still find Victoria charming at times. Kudos to the author I suppose.

***** The premise and ultimate purpose of the fic is to explore the development of a magical prodigy in the order of Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort. So it should be no surprise that she shows a high level of talent in all areas of magic, because the nature of magical prodigies in Harry Potter is that they are generalists. This is because the same deep and instinctual understanding of magic acts as the foundation for all forms of magic use.
