  People often become who others expect them to be. When Harry was sorted into Slytherin, he realized he was alone, friendless, and apparently meant to be evil.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** Just read linkffn(deal with a devil by silently watches) and it finishes in 2nd year but Harry has 0 friends in Slytherin throughout that time. It's a deliberate choice because he didn't want to play the politics game.

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

** I like the idea of Harry trying to do all the things he does to be "the good slytherin" and just being trounced for it. Can you imagine 17 and 18 year olds listening to a scrawny 11 year old on how to act? If Harry kept his personality I can see slytherin being a rough time.
