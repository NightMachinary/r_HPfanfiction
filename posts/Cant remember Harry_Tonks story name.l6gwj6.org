:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi guys, I hope this is the right place. Read a Harry/Tonks fic a long time ago where she goes back to school with harry and the rest of them as someone their age with a new name and by the end of the story decides to stay that way using a potion or spell i think. I think she ends up with harry but might just be a friendship one.

Cant for life of me remember the name and I've lost most of my bookmarks recently. Does anyone recognise it? Can't remember which website it was on as I've used quite a few over the years.


** linkffn(12188150) Could be this one, Tonks accidentally goes back in time one year during the Department of Mysteries fight, pretends to be a 5th year under an assumed name.

**** Think that might be it actually yeh. Thank you. No wonder I couldn't remember name, what I had in my head wasn't remotely close to it.

*** I love that story. Really wish the author would get back to it, I like their writing but am not fond of the fandom they write for right now. :)
