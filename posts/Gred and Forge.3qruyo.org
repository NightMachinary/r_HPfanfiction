This bothers me ALOT more than it probably should, but what's the deal with the overuse of Gred and Forge in fanfiction? They say it once in the books, as a joke, it's not really a thing. Sort of like the golden trio. /cringe/

I think it's a perfect example of bad writing, you want something 'funny' but you can't come up with something yourself, so you pick something arbitrary from the books and then use it thinking people will think it's awesome. It's the same with the random flashbacks that have no use in the story, and didn't even in the books. It's like it's neccessary to show that it's actually about Harry Potter because the writing is so bad it could be literally anything.

Sorry for my late night rant.

To be fair, I've read this quite good plot point once where Harry discovered a spell to make one's robes billow (and realized that Snape used it for show). This leads to him discovering how childishly Snape actually behaves, and helps him grow out of his stubborn hatred of him and learns to pity him.

****** I might be wearing rose-tinted glasses, and this is actually from a crack fic or something :(. I just have this memory floating around, I can't remember for the life of me.

Might be from the same story: Harry reads in the same book of wizard parlor tricks how to make his eyes twinkle like Dumbledore, and drives him mad with it.

******* That's amazing, crack fic or not--I wish I was that creative XD

Honestly, I feel like a serious fic could benefit from a little humor like that every once in a while.

** I could go on about all the twin tropes... :/

The one that bothers me the most is that they're always called either "the twins" or "the pranksters" when being referred to as a group. Why not just "the two of them" or "Fred and George"? Also, the whole

"we-"

"finish each-"

"others'-"

"sentences!" thing drives me CRAZY! Literally /no one/ does that. Unless the two of them have a telepathic connection that's been previously explained, I just can't see how it would be necessary. It's not /clever/, it's just kind of annoying.

*** The sentence finishing is infuriating. I can handle the occasional back-and-forth as long as they switch speaker at the end of a sentence (or at a point where there's a natural pause in the sentence), but things like your example are just... no.

"The twins" thing though--that's just a matter of time. It has the least amount of letters type. (Anyone using "the pranksters" I'm going to assume also uses "the black haired boy" and other descriptive phrases, which is a whole different problem altogether.)

**** Ah yes, that's the problem I was mostly referring to--the whole "loaded description" rather than just using their names. In passing, "the twins" is fine, but when an author can't come up with anything better (or finds remarkably obnoxious other names like your example) then it just grinds my gears.

*** We called my brother and sister "the twins" when they were young. We don't really do it anymore because they're more individualized now. I can see students who don't know them calling them that, or their parents while reminiscing, but it wouldn't be used regularly by anyone who knows them well.

**** That's understandable--I just meant the author describing them as that and only that (never "the two boys" or "both of them" or "Fred and George"). It just gets a little unoriginal after a while :P

** My big question is, in 90% of the Weasley-bashing fics I've read, Gred & Forge (ha!) are usually two of the only ones who are "good" and not trying to manipulate Harry. Sometimes Charlie and Bill get thrown in since they're far away, but even then occasionally they're scheming in the background (Bill MUST be a schemer, he works for the goblins!)

As much as I like the Weasley twins, I think they are the most likely to turn evil out of all the Weasleys.
