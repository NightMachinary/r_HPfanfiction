I can't remember seeing anyone ask for this so I figured I'd give it a shot..

Hit me with some stories where someone else, like Ron, Ginny, Luna or somebody else ends up being the powerhouse that changes the course of the war..


** I created a community on ffn.net, filled with my favourite stories where Ron is the main character.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/Fanfiction-Starring-Ron/130651/]]

Notably missing is The red Knight ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight]]) The only OP Ron story that wasn't a complete steaming pile of crap.

Another OP Ron is Dragons Garrison ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10960462/1/Dragon-s-Garrison]]), which is so bad that in retrospect I think it may have been a parody of the Indy!Harry trope.

Edit - alright, Dragons Garrison doesn't actually start off that bad, it's kinda fun to begin with, but I still can't tell if it's parody or not. I'm leaning towards it not being a parody.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/][The Granger Principle]], linkffn(13312738), is narrated from an AU Ron's POV. His home dimension is non magical, and he gets the assignment of investigating a mysterious Dr Hermione Granger, who accidentally ended up here from an almost canon universe.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
