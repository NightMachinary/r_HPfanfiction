"My father will hear about this" is just a cry for help, because Draco wants his father to pay attention to him.

For the love of god please don't do the whole "Draco is just misunderstood" thing. He's a bigoted piece of shit. Have him learn not to be a piece of shit. That's redemption. Authors always make Draco misunderstood, but he's really just so kind and dreamy it's vomit-inducing. If he doesn't realize he was a piece of shit bigot then there's no redemption.

Make his parents both bigots. They can be bigots and still love their kid. That's like the one good thing about the Malfoys in canon: they seem to genuinely care about each other. That introduces another line of conflict: Draco loves his parents and they love him, but he's starting not to agree with their world view and eventually that creates a rift between them. Don't scapegoat his parents. That's just lazy.

Try staying away from the crappy cliche of "Boy meets girl and she fixes him." It's a really awful cliche that oftentimes removes internal conflict by having some girl come in to fix a person in a chapter. While we're on that subject try to stay away from Draco realizes he's in love with.... Harry/Hermione/whoever crap and suddenly switches sides. This, again, is an awful cliche that removes all internal conflict by replacing a redemption arc with a love story where Draco is really a Slytherin original character who's described as looking like Tom Felton.

A lot of authors also tend to make Draco super nice and pleasant suddenly. Even if he switches sides and "redeems" himself he's probably still going to be arrogant and pompous. Look at how he speaks even to his friends in book 6 on the train or in book 2 in the Slytherin common room or in other books to his parents.

***** I don't think he's misunderstood at all, so no I wouldn't go with that. He was raised and conditioned to believe a certain point of view like most children.

There will be a very large and maybe quiet literal slap on the face for Draco as he realizes that he is bigoted and he tries to suppress it for a long time forward

the OC will not be her fixing him, she lays out the facts for him and walks away, its up to him to change after that and I think that's fine

I mentioned this in another comment but he will still hold on to some of his qualities I just haven't shaped out what yet

** Leave him some of his character flaws. I hate reading Draco redemption stories where at the end he's a meek, humble goody-two-shoes. Nope, uh-uh. Sort out in your mind what makes Draco Draco, and then what that would be like if he chose another path.

Also, if this is a redemption arc, his redemption should come from his own thoughts. You said in a comment that you were starting the arc with another character "seeing Draco in a new light". Is it a story about him /being/ redeemed or him /working/ to redeem himself? Nothing wrong with "save the victim" stories, but they're not redemption arcs (granted, you could have two story arcs, one "save the victim" and then the redemption arc).

I don't plan to take him from what he is and flip him 180, there will defiantly be some codependencies he leans on as he veers away from his parents and the 'dark side', his ambition and competitiveness will always be apart of him for instance, I'm not exactly sure as it all hasn't taken shape

** Full ownership of their bad actions and beliefs. If you want to have redemption then you cannot have it without having something to have redemption from. Most Draco-redemption stories I have read start too early (and I haven't read many of them; it is mostly just small story on the side of the bigger one, e.g., I am following “Chamber Girl by LegendDairy” linkffn(13561400)) or they completely trivialize the wrongdoing (“Where Home is by naarna” linkao3(8841631)). Snape is usually even worse, I feel that the biggest sin he admits doing in “Becoming Harriet by Teao” linkao3(4876630) was calling Lily “Mudblood” once, becoming and being the Death Eater is completely pushed aside (“I regretted it the moment I joined, and besides I was just making potions, not torturing anybody.” ... moral analysis of this statement is left as an exercise for the reader).

** IMO there are three main things that every good redemption arc needs.

1. The audience needs to be shown key parts of the character's backstory, defining character moments that made the character the person they are, ideally their backstory will make their actions easier to understand and more sympathetic.

2. The audience need to see hints that the character being redeemed isn't totally bad or at least can be good.

3. The character being redeemed needs to in someway confront the source of their bad actions, such as a toxic relationship, a specific person, or their own psychological issues, etc.

Avatar the Last Airbender and She-Ra and the princesses of power have two excellent examples of well done redemption arcs.

** Honestly, the latest Draco redemption I could buy would be before he did his best to have Buckbeak executed. His enjoyment of Hagrid's misery is just so fucked up and frankly unforgivable. If you want him on decent terms with Harry and/or Hermione, diverge before he first used the word mudblood. Otherwise, there is too much water under the bridge (especially after his public call for genocide when he sees the message next to Mrs Norris)

And that is not even mentioning the long list of fucked up shit he did in HBP (at which point he is utterly irredeemable IMO). Like, we don't see Bellatrix commit as many crimes as he does during that year.

OK, then you are not talking about redemption. According to [[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/redemption][the dictionary]] a redemption is “an act of redeeming or atoning for a fault or mistake, or the state of being redeemed.” and redeeming is “to make up for; make amends for; offset (some fault, shortcoming, etc.): /His bravery redeemed his youthful idleness./” If you have nothing to make amends for, you have no redemption. Of course, you really don't want the redemption story, you want just feel-good story how bad guys are actually good ones, and everything is nice (and perhaps even you are not such a bastard, as you have sometime suspicion you are). Fanfiction is all about escapism, so I can understand that, but please don't call it a redemption story.

And something “unforgivable”? Yes, that's exactly what's the redemption about. I would [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/on-unity-cyprian-lapsed-penance-persecution-and-chesterton.html][recommend]] the short-story “[[http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/Complete_Father_Brown/chapter41.html][The Chief Mourner of Marne]]” by G. K. Chesterton, but nobody reads real literature these days, so there is probably not much hope.

**** The only redemption for war crimes is death because they are irredeemably evil. And Draco committed a long list of them out of his own mind (Voldemort only tasked him the illegal assassination of Dumbledore, everything else was Draco's idea).

If Draco was caught selling weed or tried to rob someone, he could have a working redemption arc. But for hundred counts of perfidy, the employment of illegal weapons (poison, causes unnecessary suffering) against civilians (Slughorn, Katie since the intent follows the bullet), pressing enemy civilians into military service (again Katie), attacking civilians in the first place... The list goes on for quite a while.

Also, there cannot be redemption without punishment in my opinion, and since Malfoy never served time for his long list of crimes, he cannot be redeemed before that. Which brings us back to the problem that Malfoy earned several life sentences and therefore should only leave Azkaban in a box. Like, we don't even see Bellatrix do as much fucked up shit as Malfoy does in year 6 alone.

And if you diverge in years 4-5, you may redeem Malfoy for his teenage misdeeds, but certainly not in the eyes of anyone who can call themselves Hagrid's friend.

****** I am German and therefore quite aware in the failings of Nürnberg and the overall shortcomings of denazification. However, more important to the fate of Malfoy is, in my opinion, the outcome of the commandos captured from [[https://allthatsinteresting.com/operation-greif][Unternehmen Greif]] since that's exactly what Malfoy did (only with a Hogwarts uniform instead of an American one). Or, if you want to argue that Malfoy does not fall under military law, well then he's a spy and those don't get a better fate. Life in prison if they are lucky (assuming magical Britain also banned the death penalty in 1998), execution if they're not. And given how they wanted to deal with Sirius and how they dealt with Crouch Jr, I somehow doubt that.

And Malfoy's age is irrelevant IMO since, while he was forced into Voldemort's service, he came up with almost everything you can charge him with on his own. Voldemort's orders only included the assassination of Dumbledore. Nor would Malfoy be underage by the time he's sentenced.

And the Imperius penalty does not have an age clause since Crouch did not mention such a thing in class.

******* OK, let me apologise for the stereotyping, even worse that I am making this stupid assumption just over the border from Prague. Sorry.

Otherwise, I am afraid, we will just have to agree to disagree. I think Nürnberg trials decided pretty well considering the circumstances.

I would also disagree with equalling situation of Draco Malfoy to the Operation Grief. First of all, there is no reason to equal any Death Eater (or even Death-Eater-to-be ... do we actually now for sure, Draco had the Mark? Not that it would matter that much) with role of any solider. Voldemort and Death Eaters were nothing more than a criminal terrorist gang. Crimes they should be accused of were treason, murder, torture, etc., not war crimes, because there is no war with them. And yes, (which surprisingly linkffn(11500936) picked up on), there was the death sentence in UK for treason until 1996 (they made an exception when accessing the European Treaty on Human Rights).

Still, Draco was minor when he committed his crimes, so the death sentence could probably never be put on him. Of course, you may not have problems with killing children, but all civilized nations (or even less-civilized ones) have. And judging the age according to the age of sentence is very creative law. Of course, the correct age is the age of committing the crime, and given Draco was just few weeks older than Harry, he was still certainly underage during whole sixth year.

So, yes, it was wrong, that Draco never got substantial sentence in prison (because he had a son of the same age as Potters), but I don't think death penalty makes any sense.

However, I expect you not agree with me, so let us agree to disagree here.
