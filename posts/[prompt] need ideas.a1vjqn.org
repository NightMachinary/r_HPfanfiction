** Pretty insulting to ask for the time of others when you yourself don't even put the barest amount of effort in your writing.

*** I'm a middle schooler who wrote that for a school project seeking advice and exploring a new thing just so you know I'm trying to get advice.

**** Okay. My advice: You need to get a handle on grammar and spelling before doing anything else. Your tenses are all over the place and there's multiple spelling and grammatical errors per sentence. Maybe try to write simpler sentences.

For example this sentence is very hard to understand:

#+begin_quote
  Looking over at Sirius, he saw a green light go under his arm, as his curse hit Bellatrix square in the chest, killing her instantly.
#+end_quote

Who is looking at Sirius, I assume Harry? Who saw the green light? Harry or Sirius? Does it go under Harry's arm or Sirius'? Who's curse? Voldemort's?

***** Ok thank you for the advice I'll private the post and work on it over the weekend when I get back. I threw it all together yesterday night in about an hour and was kinda proud of the results for the time. Thank you for understanding.

Don't allow my criticism to discourage you from writing. This is pretty normal for a first attempt, especially considering your age.

There's some good stuff here too. For example I noticed that you do direct speech correctly (with correct punctuation!). Just try to apply that standard to the rest of your writing. There really shouldn't be a mistake in the second word that people get to read (should be "apparated"). Also pay attention to the difference between "your" and "you're".

******* Thank you I try I didn't edit it because I had to turn it in and didn't really have time because I had to turn it in the minute I finished it.

********* The prompt was rewrite the end of a book you read recently. I've read the series a lot so it seemed obvious to choose a book from the series.

******* I just realized that this is my first time attempting to write fiction on my own, not forced by a teacher. Yes it started out as an school prompt but I worked on it for a bit after I turned it in.
