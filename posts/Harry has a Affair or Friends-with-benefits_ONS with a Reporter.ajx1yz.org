with "Affair" its not meant, that he cheats on Ginny (or another partner), but more that its a delicate thing that The Boy-Who-Lived and Conquerer of Voldemort, Head of the Aurors and what the hell he yet has having a relationship with a Reporter. Hetero preferably.

But i would accept him being Single. Anyway, Hermione being negative about his "Loveship", since she is a reporter and might turn his Personal life into chaos would be a good idea. Or his Partner is at some point torn between her earned trust (and feelings) and her duty as a Reporter.

It doesnt have to include smut scenes, but i wouldnt be rejected either.


** Okay, somebody post a Harry/Diana Allers fic now pls.

There goes Hermione being smart again. Harry better hope his FWB ends well or he's front page news. Again.

*** What's the possible scandal for Harry? Guys are usually considered manly for getting some, and while certainly a double standard, it would make most people envious and not angry.

***** What exactly could she have on Harry? Other than some PTSD, there is not a lot you can slander him with that is based on reality and not just Rita levels of bullshit.

****** Well, it could include but not be limited to:

- intimate physical details;
- conversations that she'd had with him where he vented his frustration with friends and/or colleagues;
- private financial details;
- confidential information that he mentioned to her in passing, thinking that she could/would be discreet.

He could lose his job. He could lose his friends. He could be embarrassed in the papers--for things he actually did. And all because he chatted with his bit of fluff.

There's an episode of The West Wing wherein the Vice President's mistress just got a six figure book deal. He, in his efforts to impress her, divulged classified information and then had to resign--not because he had an affair, but because he wound up committing several felonies during pillow talk. That's what got her six figures: not details about him or his sex life.

******* 1 and 3 are not legal to publish unless you did something in public. At least in Europe. And no one will publish some gossip if they end up being punished for it by the law. Those laws also cover the second thing you brought up.

[[https://www.out-law.com/en/topics/tmt--sourcing/media-law/misuse-of-private-information/]]

As for 4, we know that magic can be used to protect secrets. There is no way that important secrets are not covered by some form of either magical oath which kills you if you try to violate it or charm which prevents (accidental) disclosure.

********* I mean, the classified information should be covered by magic after the experiences made during the wars (Bagman, Rookwood).

And if you want to dismiss muggle laws, there is always the aspect that Harry singlehandedly slew Voldemort, so messing with him would not be a thing many people would do. Especially since his best friend kidnapped the last reporter who tried, held her hostage for a few days and then blackmailed her. And Hermione was 15 back then, full of teenage naivety (looking at Malfoy here). Take Hermione at age 25 and they would never find the reporter again.
