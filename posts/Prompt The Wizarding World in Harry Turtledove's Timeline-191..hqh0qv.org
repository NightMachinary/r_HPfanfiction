The Wizarding World in Timeline-191 would be a very, very different place. In case you aren't aware, in the Southern Victory series, NINE cities get nuked. Including London, Colchestor, and one other British city I can't remember. What kind of impact would the events of Southern Victory, including the nukes, have on the Wizarding World?


** Who knows how drastic this outcome would be, maybe some of the characters we meet in the Harry potter books won't even be born because their ancestors died in the war. I do see a stronger hatred towards muggle in this timeline seeing that the Entente and Central powers just dropped Super Bombs on each other. In the US and CS god who knows if their was a Wizard government in the Confederacy like there was in the north would be interesting would they have sympathies towards Featherston? If there were southern wizard and witches how would they be treated seeing as they may have been involved in actions by the Freedom Party. There would be even more Hatred towards muggles in the US, Jake Featherston Would be seen as the most evil person in History he is responsible for the Nuclear annihilation of multiple US cities and the attempted extermination of African Americans. I think the Wizarding world would see Featherston as an example of Muggles getting to much power.
