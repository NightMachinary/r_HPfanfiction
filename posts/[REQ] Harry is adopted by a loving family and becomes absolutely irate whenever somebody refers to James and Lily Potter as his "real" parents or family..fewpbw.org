** Linkffn(Natasha Romanoff and the Secrets of Death) kinda...

It's a post-Endgame!Marvel/Harry Potter dimension travel crossover where one Death resurrects Natasha to look after the recently orphaned Harry and then another Death resurrects Harry's recently dead parents. Harry is initially angry when the Potters (who've been looking for him for years) try to butt in as parental figures but it's slowly warming up to them. Very sporadic updates and possibly abandoned.

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. But meeting Death himself who gives her a baby who's being hunted by terrorists? That's a new one. Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her. Natasha Mother Figure. T/M rating.
