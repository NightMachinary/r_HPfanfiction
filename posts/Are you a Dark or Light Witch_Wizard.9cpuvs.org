The muggle in me is asking ‘what is this Star Wars?'

** I despise both dark and light lords, too much Star Wars in these fanon cliches.

But if I have to pick one, definitely “dark lord” because “light lord” sounds totally ridiculous.

I may not use any Unforgivables, but that doesn't mean I would not develop aerosolized basilisk venom and saturate bomb Malfoy Manor with this stuff.

**** For me, dark magic (Unforgivables, Fiendfyre) is merely the means to the end. Dark magic might bring some tactical advantages in certain situations, but might cost me politically. Like in Muggle warfare, why resort to nerve gas when FAE (fuel air explosives) does the job even better?

You don't go dark for dark's sake, like Hollywood or some edgy authors want to depict it. You generally employ those ‘dark' means to achieve some political goals.

It's never clear how dark one can go before being ganged up or dogpiled on. Assyrians definitely went too far and was totally and utterly obliterated by their neighbors. Attila the Hun also seemed to have gone too far and lost. But Genghis Khan seemed to have found a delicate balance between complete ruthlessness and substantial mercy, so he was mostly successful. Napoleon was not too dark, but he definitely bit off more than he could chew so he again lost to superior numbers. Then Hitler and most recently ISIS.

The balance between political and military necessities is never clear either. In WW1, Germans blindly trusted their [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan][Schlieffen Plan]], invaded the neutral Belgium, and dragged the British Empire into the war. 2 years later, feeling pressured by the Empire's overwhelming resources and starving under the British fleet's blockade, they again blindly trusted their U-Boats, initiated the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare][Unrestricted Submarine Warfare]], and dragged the US, world's number one industrial power, into war. In hindsight of course, the Central Powers could have easily defeated France and Russia in WW1, and today's world would have been very very different.

On the other hand, politicians ignoring their generals and fucking up wars is even more common. The US is especially guilty in this regard. From LBJ's micromanaging Vietnam War to GWB undermanning the Iraq Invasion against the advice of Chief of Staff, there are full of such sad examples.

Coming back to the HP world, I and many in the fandom don't like this “good guys don't kill” trope at all, and want to see good guys carrying out militarily sufficient responses against the bad guys. I want to see them weighing intelligent decisions on whether to use dark magic or not.

Actually, Assyria still exists as a nation in the wizarding world. From OotP:

  “It's really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don't know if there's one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can't wait to show it to Professor Sprout. My Great Uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I'm going to see if I can breed from it.”

Historically, the answer is 'not very', as the use of terror tactics has a very poor record of effectiveness. Atrocity tends to piss people off /far/ more than it frightens them into submission.

** I think it is probably a good thing that I don't have magic, because there is a part of me that would be using pretty much the entire Hogwarts curriculum in some nefarious scheme or another. It /starts/ with using arithmancy and divination to indulge in insider trading they can't touch me for...

... that said, I'm not terribly impressed with most of the 'dark' magic portrayed in canon. Most of it seems to do things you can achieve in other ways, but with added atrocity, apparently purely for shits and giggles.

** I don't think there is a clear definition of what 'Dark' and 'Light' entail. Is a Dark Wizard simply a user of Dark magic? Or does there need to be a certain ideology they subscribe to?

As to what I am? I'd lean more towards Dark, I am far more likely to follow someone who exudes power than benevolence. I'm not saying I necessarily agree with "There is no good and evil, only power and those too weak to seek it" but I do think it has merit, especially in the Wizarding World.
