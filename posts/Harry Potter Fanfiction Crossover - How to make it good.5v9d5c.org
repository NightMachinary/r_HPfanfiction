I'm currently contemplating writing one of several crossovers set in the Harry Potter Universe. Each of them have their own plots and I have rough ideas of what direction I'd go with them. Here are the different universes that I'm considering (Note, not all at once, these are all separate story ideas).

Frozen: If I go this route, there will be an extra emphasis on plot centered around the different types of communities (muggles, magical creatures, the wizarding world) and the sisterly bond between Elsa and Anna as they navigate a new world. The story would be set post-Frozen and presumably in Sixth Year. Events would quickly diverge from Canon due to the setup I'm imagining (it's a secret, though. Plot stuff, you see).

Avatar the Last Airbender: The premise is simple. Avatar Aang and his companions are tasked with balancing the spirit world, which is being affected by the creation of certain objects. A hunts for Voldemort's precious items, basically. While the plot is important, I'm more interested in the character interaction here.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Edward ends up in the wizarding world. His enemies follow him, needing him as a sacrifice to make the Philosopher's Stone.

I have more concrete ideas with the first two, but I like them all equally. So I want to hear the thoughts of others to help me decide. Or-at least-to avoid writing a poor crossover.

Thanks in advance!


** I'd go with Fullmetal or Avatar. It's not that Frozen and Harry Potter wouldn't be cool, they just don't go together as well.

For one, their content is drastically different. Harry Potter is much darker and somewhat more adult. And most importantly, Frozen has a more limited number of characters and plot to work with.

Avatar and Fullmetal both bring their own nuanced story lines and characters to the table. Elsa and the cast of Frozen are great, there's just less material to work with.

Personally, I think an Avatar/HP crossover is the way to go, but I'm just biased because I love Avatar.

*** Good point on the lack of Frozen material. Most of what I was drawing from it was Elsa, Anna, and Hans (there's a theory that Hans is actually an enchant mirror as in the origin tale it was a mirror that was the antagonist along with Elsa).

I also love Avatar. Since you're an Avatar fan, allow me to ask you this: would it be better to have the whole Gaang, a few of them, or just Aang? I have several plots for these two series crossing, but they change dramatically based off the cast.

**** I think you should have the whole Gaang, but maybe just a few of them for different points. Meaning, you don't have to have them all in every chapter or plot line, but you can trade them out. Of course, it's totally up to you, since both ways of just having Aang or having all of them are good ideas. For me personally though, I need Zuko in my fics haha.

** I think the Avatar one could be cool. Especially since Aang wouldn't know about the Statute. He'd just go through that world, fire blazing and stone throwing. Toph would also have a blast in a world made of concrete and metal.

The only thing I'd be cautious with is

Character is plot is character. Your characters grow throughout the plot, not during its pauses. The easiest way to kill a story is to fill it with chapters of characters just interacting for the sake of interacting while the plot is on pause.

Those two aren't mutually exclusive. Characters drive the story and story drives the characters. These are two elements that cannot be separated. You start out with a situation and characters react. The world reacts to the input of the characters. The characters react to the new situation. And so on and so forth.

Anyway. I wish you the best with your fic.

**** I agree wholeheartedly with [[/u/UndeadBBQ]] and I'll add this: J K Rowling wrote chapters to drive the story. The characters and the magic were written to develop the plot. And while this gave us the world we know and love, it left a lot, and I do mean [[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s400/ALOT.png][A LOT]] of things underdeveloped. It's the primary reason we have so much HP fanfiction.

A character driven story has its own flaws, of course. There will be actions necessary to drive the plot that a characters just... wouldn't do. That no one in their right mind would or wouldn't do, or even consider doing at that moment. If you force them to do it anyway, this is called "Holding the Idiot Ball", and it can really take people out of a story.

So you have to come up with a balance. Find outside forces to act on your characters, and find reasons for those characters to act back. Or, use the characters themselves. Use their flaws and their virtues to put them in difficult situations. And if you can't do that, find someone else who WOULD involve them in these difficult situations.

EDIT: And, in the end, if you can't do any of that, think about finding another path to where you want to go. There's a reason one of the common rules of writing is "Kill Your Darlings".

** I don't know much about the three options but some general tips from someone who reads quite a lot of cross overs.

- Don't try to bring in too many characters. There just isn't room on the page for everyone. Stick to the important people or those you want involved.

- Work out if you want the world fair and balanced. Harry Potter wizards bend the world to their will and regularly to the impossible. A lot of what they can do to each other is stopped by their shields and the like but against regular people they're basically gods. Linkffn(11120132) is well worth a read if you haven't read it. It also points out that what is normal in Harry Potter is completely over powered (he's not entirely normal for a wizard though). If you're bringing people into this world how do they compare? There is nothing wrong with something being stupidly powerful but making something that should be strong weak for the sake of plot might annoy some people.

- Make sure everyone you bring over, or every aspect has a purpose. Some things in different fandoms are cool. Compromising your plot to force in the cool thing can hurt your story. Unnecessary detail or justifications can be a huge turn off for readers.

Good luck and I hope you enjoy writing it, remember at the end of the day its you who matters. If you like it do it.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

**** Write out a mock conversation. Its generally only two people talking with a third maybe interjecting. Having people there for their wit and jokes starts to feel forced. If everyone tries to have their say then it might feel too slow. How often at parties etc does everyone try and chat? People branch off into twos and threes mostly. it might work bringing everyone if they separate and alternated group per chapter. Imagine if Harry went as a guide with some and Ron and Hermione went with the others? Would that work better? It might make the dialogue feel more natural and its generally a trend in poor writing that it doesn't sound like things people would ever say out loud.

** My favorite crossover worlds are LOTR and Star Gate. Fallout and Terminator are also good IMO, but those two fandoms are too small.

I'm not a big fan of HP/GoT crossovers unless I want to read some curb stomps. Those GoT Muggles had no chance going against Imperiuse Curse, Obliviation, Legilimency, Apparation, Bombarda, and Fiendfyre.

** Hmm. Well, that's the big question, really. And the answer is, it varies. A lot.

- The main thing is to make sure that either the two worlds mesh well, or that the abilities of one world are equal to or are at least counterable by the abilities of the other world. For example, take The Havoc Side of the Force: Harry's use of magic disrupts Force users' focus like a screeching violin, but the Force users have precognition, which evens the playing field a lot.

- Another thing is the choice of the setting. In most cases I chose to put HP characters in other worlds, rather than the other way around. This is because I find the other worlds more dynamic and enabling than itty bitty Hogwarts. I wouldn't take Edward to Hogwarts, Harry dies and Truth chucks him into Amestris. Aang doesn't go to Hogwarts, Harry goes through the Veil and ends up in the Spirit world. And so on, and so forth. This is personal preference, so I'm definitely not saying something set at Hogwarts can't be good, just that I find Hogwarts less, ah, motivating than anywhere else. Also, HP tends to facilitate multiverse travel more than other 'verses.

- One more thing is that in order to find a good story, you sometimes have to go outside of the setting you're used to. What that setting is and how far outside you go is up to your judgement.

My own personal plot bunny that you're welcome to use is Harry getting AK'd in the forest and seeing Truth. Truth takes the horcrux as payment for Palm Alchemy knowledge and sends him on through to Amestris where he lands on Izumi Curtis' doorstep. He doesn't speak the local language (similar to German, isn't it?) and he can't do magic anymore, either. Now he has to reconcile scientific Alchemy with reality bending Magic. In addition, being Master of Death gave him 3 "boons", basically Philosopher's stone level of transmutations, in the form of the DH tattoo, to be used at his discretion. (Ohay, Izumi's cured. How about that?) Each time he uses a boon, one part of the tattoo disappears.

Hope this helps!

** I actually prefer crossovers that do the opposite of what you're planning. I like for Harry to be taken out of his world and placed in another. Harry as a character is more flexible, and fits in other scenarios better, in my opinion. Usually if someone brings outside characters into the Hogwarts setting they either stand around being useless lumps (everyone around them can pretty much bend the laws of nature to their whim, so why are these new guys needed?) or it is one of those "Sherlock is secretly a wizard" things and I absolutely loathe those.

One thing to keep in mind is power levels, as other people have mentioned. Even 5th year, super angsty and not even completely trained Harry is pretty much God Mode for almost any other fandom. One thing a lot of writers do is separate Harry from his wand. Either it breaks and he has limited usage or he loses it and he has to make due with very limited abilities that don't require a wand. Another solution would be to have the very environment be hostile towards magic. So whatever makes magic work in Harry's reality is missing from the second reality, thus his abilities are greatly reduced.

Other than that, I agree with the suggestion of limiting the characters crossed over. FMA has a LOT of characters, for example. Decide which ones you'd actually need and leave off any that wouldn't really add to your story's plot. Yes, Nina was cute as hell, but what else does she have to add to your story's progression? If you can't think of anything, leave Nina behind.

** All of these worlds sound like huge territory for Harry and friends to cover. He isn't a 'bender' and he isn't the avatar himself, so he would be pretty useless when it came to actually helping. Unless you go the fanon 'Master of Death, Op Reality Warping' route, which in that case, a fic doesn't matter. I would rather have seamless transition into the world, like, the people are already there, and have been there, and have history that seamlessly goes into the Harry Potter world, such as other stories about Magicians/Wizards/Sorcerers. Other than that, crossovers always felt like a waste of time, you either add too much to the world itself, or take away a whole lot to the point where the fic feels like it takes place in a claustrophobic box.

*** Even standard Harry would be able to offer something in the ATLA world. His broom puts him at or near Aang with his glider, he can disarm any melee wielded or archer, he can cause small explosions, Sectumsempera can cut right through toonforce, he can stun pretty much anyone, and, depending on how much you want to give the Patronus, he might even have a defense against spirits. Even when crossing over with a world with massive power differences, there are still ways for the weaker side to contribute.

**** To add to that, I think if Harry would refrain from just going into all out fights, he could be one hell of a player in the powergames of the Avatar world.

One on one he'd have a hard time against many of the fighting characters in ATLA, but if he chooses the engagement, he has the upper hand.
