***** Real question, don't mean to flame, but what is it about Charlus and Dorea as Harry's g-parents that fascinates people so much? Everyone is so in love with a fact that would make James and SIrius cousins, which kinda makes their best-friendship weaker.

****** In canon Slytherin is pretty much evil-house at Hogwarts, that is canon. Most good fanfiction humanizes Slytherin and dark arts/dark families a bit. Connecting the Blacks to the Potters is another way to do this.

It would be pretty hard to write a Lord Hadrian Potter-Black, heir of the Potter and Black family, fanfic if he wasn't actually related to the Blacks.

  we learned that Brazilian students at Castelobruxo are particularly adept at Herbology and Magizoology
#+end_quote

Because of their rainforests?

#+begin_quote
  Japanese witches and wizards at Mahoutokoro wear enchanted robes that change colour as their magical knowledge improves

Clearly a reference to martial arts belt colors.

  and that the only address ever given for Uagadou in Africa is â€˜Mountains of the Moon.'

Presumably all of the children from Wales and Ireland learn English to attend Hogwarts (At least in the English language versions of the series. Keep in mind that they've been translated into 73 languages).

****** 80% of education in Welsh primary schools is still English medium, which is a shame, but that's not the fault of the Welsh people. The English have tried their best to destroy a language [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treachery_of_the_Blue_Books][they despise]]. And there are millions of people who [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mayan_languages][continue to speak]] the indigenous languages of Central America.
