Does anyone know of any fanfics with really good Ron character development? I'd prefer if it doesn't start out bashing him or anything like that. I'd prefer no slash. Ron doesn't have to be the main character but it'd be great if he was.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a great R/Hr story from Hermione's POV and goes through all 7 years.

*** I second this one. It's a canon rehash, but actually manages to do it in an interesting way. Definitely worth the read!

** To answer my own question, I was looking for something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/%5DForging%20the%20Sword][Forging the Sword]] has excellent Ron character growth after Ginny dies in the Chamber of Secrets.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Ron is not The main character, but he plays a big role in this story and I like to think that it avoids most of the worst tropes in the fandom:

** linkffn(Australia) and linkffn(Seven Simple Years) are probably the two best Ron/Hermione fics I've read, because their depictions of Ron are so good. Both authors are great but these fics in particular are required reading IMO.
