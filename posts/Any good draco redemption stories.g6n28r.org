  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  Starts after Ch. 1 of DH, crossover with Dangerverse AU, short chapters. Draco Malfoy, trapped in a life he never chose, wishes as he falls asleep that he were somewhere he could start over. Maybe he should have listened to his proverbs. Now complete.

** This story takes place in the same time as the 7th book and then a few years later . I really enjoyed it, I felt it was close to canon, totally believable.
