Hey guys I have an idea for a Dresden files crossover. Usually crossovers show the Dresden verse as much move powerful than HP verse. But how about if it's the other way around? Only the senior council and the wardens know that HP wizards even exist and they are viewed on with fear and awe. The aurors are considered boogymen. The faerys also know about the HP wizards but fear them because of their ability to conjure steel and iron. Some kind of ancient history where HP wizards may have enslaved the fae for a while is also a possibility. Any way the story starts with Harry and his troops coming to Chicago to investigate a serious breach of secrecy made by Dresden wizards in his capacity as an ICW auror Commander. Then shit happens and Harry gets sucked into the war between red court and wizards.

PS: Sorry for any spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm am using my phone to type..


** I think that it is a disservice to wank one side in a crossover and isn't too interesting. Both Dresden Files and Harry Potter wizards have their respective strengths and weaknesses or rather aren't as able as the other in some areas. No need to make it a dick waving contest when you can treat both groups with the respect they deserve.

*** I didn't mean to actually "wank one side" as you put it. Just wanted to portray HP wizards as the boogymen of the world who are perfectly content on remaining isolated, unless someone goes and breaks the statue of secrecy. It however doesn't mean that the Dresden wizards are powerless. Just that they are extremely limited. Of course in raw fire power a normal Dresden wizard could probably hold themselves against a normal HP wizard for a while, however when you throw apparition in to the mix the odds get way to stacked for the HP wizards. It's just than when a trained group of Aurors show up the combined fire power is just too much for a team of wardens to deal with. It however just a plot bunny I had .

** I think the average Potterverse wizard would mop the floor with the average Dresdenverse wizard. Most Dresden wizards we see are either Council members or Wardens. Wardens seem to significantly above average powerwise and Council members are nearly god-tier. The average wizard though... Think of the small coven Harry runs into in White Knight. That seems to be average in the Desdenverse. Meanwhile the average Potterverse wizard is a Hogwarts graduate than can throw reductos and stupefies with ease. Don't get me wrong, Dresden wizards can be very powerful, but they're like Batman. They need prep time to do what Potter wizards can do with a wave of a wand.

That's the average wizards. Wardens and council members are another story. Ebeneezer kills a hundred people with a wave of his staff. He brings down a satellite with enough accuracy to target a mansion. The Merlin kills hundreds of vampires with A ward. I think MOST Wardens and Aurors would be somewhat evenly matched with an edge going to Aurors for wand ease of use. Council members are probably fairly even with Dumbledore/Voldemort.

*** The ones you are talking about are members of the Paranet though, described by Harry as minor talents, you should look at the members of the White Council to get an idea of the average Dresden Wizards, people like Molly for example. Or even Warlocks, think about Kravos or Hannah Hascher, the average Potter Wizards woudn't stand a chance.

** The problem is that while both sides have their strengths and unique skills, for example Potter wizards have apparition, trasfiguration and dark magic which are all things Dresden wizards can't or won't use and would put them at a serious disadvantage in a fight, and Potter magic is more versatile, more useful in everyday situations, it is true that in terms of raw power Dresden wizards have the better end of the deal. Ebenezar could have killed Voldemort from his home with little effort by simply colony dropping Malfoy Manor, The Merlin can ward a structure so that it takes a minor god to break through the wards (Dead Beat), Harry himself by the time Turn Coat comes around could have defeated Voldemort (just look at his fight with the Nagloshii, I doubt Voldemort would have survived being garroted with soulfire), so it's normal that they are considered more powerful I mean the biggest show of power we see in HP is the duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end of OotP, Harry Dresden does things like that at the end of every book.

  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.

*** Granted it does have a somewhat vaguely similar idea, I really would like to have the entire if somewhat AU PotterVerse world in the fic. However I did enjoy Awaken Sleeper, pity it's abandoned though.

**** I know its not exactly what your looking for but if you have not read the denarian renegade trilogy you really should. Probably the best Dresden Files crossover I've ever read. Its abandoned but it still has over 500,000 words all together.

***** Have I read read them? Of course my friend! What kind of a question is that? They were one of my very first reads.. even before I actually read cannon Dresden files books. I believe I was abandoned after Harry's coin was destroyed and his fallen angel took up residence in him? Great fic it was, pity is was abandoned though..
