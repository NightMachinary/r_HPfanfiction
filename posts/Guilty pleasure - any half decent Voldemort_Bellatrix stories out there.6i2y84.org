Looking for Voldemort/Bellatrix stories that are of decent length and quality. At least 10,000 words. The few I've found are either short or terribly written.


** Can't help you with a recommendation, but why would it be guilty ? Even not counting that with the cursed child it become canon, I have seen some really bad pairings any LV/BB is not one of them, this like Harry/Basilisk Harry/random snake Harry/ Hedwig Hermione/Talking Hat even Harry/Lilly(mother)/lilly(daughter)ffm those are guilty fic... Be proud of what you like
