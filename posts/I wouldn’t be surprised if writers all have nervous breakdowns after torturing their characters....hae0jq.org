I've been working on a Draco Malfoy fanfiction for months and I'm just getting to the end of the series now. At first I thought writing angst was fun, but the more I wrote it, the more I realized just how much I was torturing my characters.

Let's just say, after many hardships that the OC and Draco go through together, they have a semi-happy ending. But then during the epilogue it's revealed that these two best friends and lovers don't end up together at the end.

I'm really sad about what I've created now because at the very end, the OC is depressed about her past but pretends it doesn't matter to her at all.

I'm really hating myself over what I've done and I'm wondering if anybody else has tortured their characters so much that they end up torturing themselves as well.


** I felt quite bad for destroying Cedric's moral fibre in an AU fic. But it was kinda fun...

*** I think I read this fanfiction. It was super popular. The one where these OCs go back in time and mess up the future where Cedric is evil now? ;)

  In the Darkest of all possible futures a twist of fate meant to save him led Cedric Diggory to choose an entirely different path.Or: The story of how Cedric Diggory became a Death Eater. This fic was born of my catching a throwaway line in the Cursed Child about Cedric Diggory becoming a Death Eater. We see a lot about political radicalisation these days and I wanted to have a good delve into why someone (especially someone like Cedric) could end up wanting to join an organisation like that

** This is a really fascinating topic. Empathy for your characters as a writer can be crucial to achieving well-written stories. Not everyone writes using emotional empathy, and some people use a sort of intellectually constructed thinking that helps them model how characters would behave (without the feelings).

Interestingly, people who project heavily onto their characters use a lot of emotional empathy in my opinion. One writer, Sen Lin Yu - who wrote a very popular Draco/hermione fic that features sexual violence - wrote about how she was tearful when writing some emotional scenes. On the other hand, I've written dark fics (as an exorcism for some of my own experiences) and I've never been that emotionally available for my characters as a reader or a writer. It doesn't make me feel emotional. Rather, it helps me settle repetitively remembering or intellectualising my own experiences.

So the way you treat your characters and the way that they impact you has a lot to do with why you write, how you psychologically treat the process of writing, and your relationship to the characters. That's my opinion anyway.

** It's not easy but artistic integrity has a price! I've given myself a really hard time over such things. It's quite alarming, the type of shit that's just been in my brain, apparently, and it's not like I consciously sat down and went, okay, time to ruin my own day.
