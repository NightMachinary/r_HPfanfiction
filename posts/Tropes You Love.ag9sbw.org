We see a lot of threads asking people to list tropes, cliches, and other literary devices they dislike, so much that it's become a space on the [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] bingo card. So, to change it up a bit, how about we name some of these same mechanics we actually like?

For me, my guilty pleasure was for a long time the shared dormitories of Head Boy and Girl, back when my preferred ship was Rose/Scorpius. Done right, it can lead to interesting conversations and emotional development that some stories disdain in favor of epic (tm) battle scenes.

What're some of yall's favorite cliches an tropes?


** Dumbledore being just plain good is something I enjoy but rarely encounter. We often see Manipulative, evil or misguided Dumbledore. Which is not that weird considering canon, but Dumbledore being just plain good, or at least not responsible for every little thing that goes wrong, is something I enjoy.

I also like the trope where they stop using stunners and start to really fight back a bit more.

**** Definitely linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past), even though it's incomplete. The author does a great job of balancing foreknowledge and skill against unpredictable ripples and problems that can't be brute-forced. And a bunch of characters get a lot more screen time; eg the trio is expanded to six, and they're not just cameos, they get depth.

If you want something complete, then linkffn(Backwards with Purpose by deadwoodpecker) has a comparable premise, but quickly takes it in a different direction. The first book was decent, but it was the sequel that really impressed me (and answered a whole lot of questions about what was going on in book 1).

** My guilty pleasure trope is the Married in Vegas one. It might be my love of the unrealistic and occasionally downright creepy 80s Rom-coms, but I love wacky situations leading to falling in love.

Other than that my favorite trope is Master of Death. So much room to play with the concept. Someone being tormented by their newly bound servant, someone transitioning into immortality, someone trying to throw away that mortality to live a full life, or using it as a jumping off point for a crossover. I just like the ideas so much.

** I like my protagonists slightly MarySue-ish. I like normal people too, but only in the context of well done plot. But that is not very common in fanfics, sadly. So to compensate, I like my protagonist to be objectively superior to all others, smarter, braver, more powerfull. Not too so much there is no conflict though and it needs to be "internal" so to speak, I really dislike "lord and heir" stuff.

** Antagonistic gen parings in which the hatred keeps on simmering. Even though characters are forced into each others vicinity and grudgingly start to understand how the other person works. I love that grey area of having to deal with or negotiate with your enemy.

More often than not though, writers can't resist getting them to Bond Forever In Appreciation Of the Other And Lets Start Again With A Blank Slate, You're Not So Bad As I Thought.

Slash parings can have well-build characters as well, and there are far more antagonistic slash parings than gen ones. But I find that attraction and sex are often just tools writers use as some kind of magical solution to make characters that actually hate each other (like Harry and Voldemort), start to like each other, which means history and deep grievances suddenly or gradually vanish into nonexistence.
