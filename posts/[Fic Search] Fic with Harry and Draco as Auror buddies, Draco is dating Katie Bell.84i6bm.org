Pretty much title, I think Harry and Draco end up together but I don't remember.

**** Just made a list of them for someone else on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/85hgq1/complete_works_of_maya/dvxmzeh/][this post]].

Mind the warnings on a couple of the fics; some of them are extremely dark.

***** I can cope with dark, I just like a properly good story to get my teeth into, I'm a novel length reader, if it's under 80k word length I generally avoid
