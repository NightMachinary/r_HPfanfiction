She was Gryffindore in canon. And I read many fics where she was either in Ravenclaw or Slytherin. But Hufflepuff Hermione fics were almost non-existent. Why? I mean she was extremely hard-working and her loyalty to her friends was unquestionable.


** If she, for lack of a better way of saying it, was socialized better perhaps, but like with pureblood!Hermione, that would be a fundamental shift in who she is, in my opinion.

This scene would have been much different with a Hufflepuff Hermione:

#+begin_quote
  “You're saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar' nice and long.”

  “You do it, then, if you're so clever,” Ron snarled.

  Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!”
#+end_quote

Either a prefect adonishing her or being ostracized because she is abrasive. The HP wiki says this about Hufflepuff:

#+begin_quote
  Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.
#+end_quote

So for Hermione, I think she'd either need to be more patient or admonished for her lack of patience. As far as loyalty goes, I tend to side with the fanon that they're loyal to the group/house as a whole. I see her more loyal to a small group of friends.

*** Well I mean, she could also learn these things. She is a child. Nobody in slytherin has fully reached some form of high ambition, Neville is in red and gold, etc etc. we don't really know much about Ravenclaw really. The traditions of each house help shape the children as they mature.

*** Zacharias Smith or someone? Who was a Hufflepuff, who was really crude.

You don't have to have all the traits in a house. For instance, look at Peter Pettigrew being sorted into Gryffindor, Severus Snape into Slytherin.

Hermione is hard working, going to the library even when it's something minor, she's very dedicated, she's very loyal, her patience is rather thin so is fair play, she gets annoyed when someone one ups her, for instance, but again, a person doesn't have to have all the traits in the house.

** I always argued Hufflepuff was the best match for her, personality-wise. At least early on, she doesn't strike me as particularly academic, or someone who studies out of any ambition. She's been encouraged to study a lot, so that's what she's good at.

But then again, I also think Slytherin suits early Ron's personality and Hufflepuff would be the best match for Goyle. So clearly the sorting doesn't have that much to do with personality. I always liked the headcanon that the hats sorts on ideals and values, not personality.

**** Because he doesn't appear to have any ambition or cunning but we /do/ know he's extremely loyal to Draco, which seems like enough of a Hufflepuff trait that he could sneak in.

I'm more Slytherin myself but I feel like most of the characters could have benefited from a year or two in Hufflepuff.

** People need to remember that students are sorted based on the character traits they /value/, rather than the ones they /embody/.

#+begin_quote
  “Harry --- you're a great wizard, you know.”

  “I'm not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.

  “Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! *There are more important things --- friendship and bravery* and --- oh Harry --- be careful!”

Canon Hermione /belonged in Gryffindor/. Though I agree with you that I'd like to see a Hufflepuff!Hermione fic.

** We know too little about how the Sorting hat ACTUALLY sorts people. There are so many examples in canon of people who made no sense in their sorting for 95% of the books and then have their one moment where we go.. oh. But it seems silly for a hat to sort for that one moment they might show a certain houses colors.

Add to this, we don't even know if the original houses are the same as they once were. The most obvious example of this is Slytherin. Was it ACTUALLY a house for pure blood bigots 99% of the time and intended to be that way? Or was it just the house of the cunning alone. The hat could be sorting on a completely different spectrum compared to what we "think" the houses are based upon what students and teachers know.

Point is, people can argue all they want about what characters should have been in what houses but there are no right or wrong answers.

Speaking to your personal comment. I personally don't really think she fits in Hufflepuff that well if for no other reason than she fits BETTER in Ravenclaw, or to a lesser degree, Gryffindor. While she was hard-working, the hard-work revolved around knowledge. And while she was loyal to her friends, many would argue that was in part, because of her history of having a bit of trouble with "Friendships" and the fact that the friendship started with them literally saving her life. She was also the opposite of some of the Hufflepuff elements we "think" we know about. Such as patience, of which she had very little.

*** On your comment about Slytherin, I sort of headcanon that the Hat gets a 'read' for the political situation each year by evaluating the minds of all the children it has sorted. It tries to avoid you know, putting children into life-threatening situations. I think that, Slytherin's total lack of Muggleborns is a relatively recent (as in the last hundred years) thing, because as the House has become more and more hostile its become more and more dangerous for Muggleborn students to be sorted there. So, only the most Slytherin of Slytherin muggleborns wind up there.

Obviously this is just my headcanon, but I thought it was interesting you were wondering in similar ways. After all, its not like the official sorting quiz asks "Are you a muggleborn?" If blood purity /really/ mattered that much with Slytherin, you'd think it would. It seems much more likely to me that the total dearth of muggleborns in Slytherin is more for their safety than because no muggleborns would do well there.

*** My sense it that the Hat sorts on values and aspirations more than traits. To use your example, Hermione would have fit better into Ravenclaw, sure, but she was more interested Changing the World (whether the world wanted it or not), so to Gryffindor she went.

** Because Hufflepuff is boring. There's no glory and very little drama.

You could, of course, make Ernie and Zacharias centrists in the "muggleborns have a right to be here, but I'll be preserving my purebloodness" way. You could do some unrequited Cedric attraction. Or you could write a 1st dark wandholder from Hufflepuff story because the Hufflepuffs were assholes and Zacharias (it would absolutely be him) wouldn't be running off to save her from a troll.

There is something to build on here.

Ernie's initially very antagonistic towards Harry, but he also gives off the impression that he's devoted to his ideals.

And he eventually becomes one of Harry's more stalwart allies. When the time comes for war, he shouts out "And what if we want to stay and fight?"

Ernie has decided he's willing to die to protect others.

Zacharias Smith on the other hand is an arrogant toe-rag from the moment he's introduced, skeptical of Harry's teaching methods, his family opposes Dumbledore's teaching methods, and when the evacuations begin, he knocks down first-years so he can be the first to flee.

**** She's not really a good fit anywhere if we look at it purely from a social standpoint.

However, characteristically speaking she can fit anywhere. She /is/ hardworking, loyal, brave, intelligent, ambitious, and cunning. She's just so abrasive it would take a peer saving her from a troll for her to make a friend. Unfortunately, not too many would do that. Hermione having friends is just as essential to her development as Harry having a family.

I think the Ravenclaws would put up with that abrasiveness the best though. Blunt as an axe because the only thing that matters is discovering the "truth" of a subject. I think Slytherins would be the next best choice after Ravenclaws for abrasive people. They'll put up with bluntness if it means winning. Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors are the worst choice for blunt people.

Case in point, I'm a Slytherclaw and Hermione's personality has never bothered me. We would get on fine.
