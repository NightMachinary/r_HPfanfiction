I really like the idea, rather it's a parody or made serious it's fine.

Anyone can go back in time, as long as they pretend to be a Seer while doing so.

Would rather it be finished but if not that's fine

Can be Het/Slash/Femslash

The "Seer" in this fic is Harrys scar. It is a comedy fic.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** You know, I've tried reading it numerous of times, but have been turned away from the number of chapters it has, each and every time.

From what I did read, I did like though, I need to fully read it properly, thank you.

** There's one where Lavender Brown is accidentally sent back in time during the Battle of Hogwarts, she works for a seer and meets Tom Riddle. I can't remember the name or if it's finished but if your interested I'll go searching for it.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."
