I really like the cool branches of magic where it's stuff like that, like magical recessive traits you can be born with. I really enjoy reading stories with them, but I can't seem to find many

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1048010/chapters/2096059][Holly at Howarts]] is an entire series focusing on Dudley's daughter Holly, who is an empath, meaning she feels the emotions and pain of everyone around her as if they were her own.

It's presented as a rare gift that only happens once or twice in a generation and Holly spends a lot of time learning to control her gift so she can properly differentiate other people's emotions from her own and block out pain so she doesn't get completely crippled by other people getting injured in her vicinity.

It's a really great series and I can definitely recommend it.

** In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] Legilimency is central to the plot, and there's a part that explores the idea of magical heredity. The fic contains great non-canon world building, but unfortunately it is marred by some blatant Ron and Dumbledore bashing, so your mileage may vary. linkffn(8163784)

** Legilimency/Occlumency aren't character traits, are they? Some people might be more adept at it due to their personalities (for example, Severus being a natural Occlumens due to childhood abuse leading to him using emotional shutdown as a strategy), but it isn't genetic the way Metamorphmagi are.

Anyway, linkffn(The Mind Arts) is a fic that focuses on... well, the mind arts. linkffn(The Philosopher's Stone Retransmuted) focuses on Metamorphmagus abilities.

**** Nah, hereditary magical traits was a fanfiction trope long before the /Fantastic Beasts/ movies came out. For example, the ability to perform Legilimency and Occlumency are seperate hereditary traits in "The Well Groomed Mind", which was published starting in 2012. I've seen the same concept in a few other fics but I can't remember them off the top of my head.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
