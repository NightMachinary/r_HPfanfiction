I'm looking for long Harry/Hermione fics that take place after the series and involve their lives in the Ministry of Magic, having kids, sending them off to Hogwarts, etc. If it's canon compliant and then H/Hr end up together in the end, that's fine, but I would prefer to see the epilogue changed to H/Hr's kids going off to Hogwarts.

I've read the more popular stuff like Vox Corporis, HP and the Fifth Element, Unlike a Sister, Shadow Walks, etc.


** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7460][Love Lost, Love Found]]: Ron and Ginny died in an accident a few years after the Epilogue. Everyone stays in character, no bashing, and the kids are happy when their parents get together.

If i could get one wish for fanfics, I'd ask for people to stop writing these stories. It's so boring. I mean, okay, the place is perfect for Percy, but not for H/Hr...

Some Post-Hogwarts fics I enjoyed:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8693743/1/Senses]])

Short story about Harry and Hermione getting together, including the fallout with the Weasleys.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5141159/1/Breakfast-In-New-York]])

H/Hr meet accidentally in New York

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]])

Harry is Master of Death and decides to fake his death after the battle of Hogwarts. Abandoned.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12265183/1/Picnic-Panic]])

Fun little story.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4532058/1/Without-You-There-is-Nothing]])

Ron bashing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10536445/1/The-Lily-Potter-Foundation]])

Harry tries to figure out what to do with his life. Obviously he doesn't want to become an Auror or work for the Ministry, that would be stupid and out of character (every story that points that out gets bonus points from me).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8625440/1/Do-Unto-Others-Before-They-Do-Unto-You]])

Oh, I haven't recced this one-shot in a long wile. It's... special (and yes, it's H/Hr... sorta). The less said about the better. As long as you're up for something non-serious.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6479080/1/Soul-Thief]])

This is a good one. Harry has to solve a criminal mystery and exonerate Draco.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7509302/1/A-Crack-in-the-Glass-Shatters-the-Past]])

Hermione runs away after the war, but Harry keeps searching.

***** I think the main issue I had with it was just how out-of-character Hermione was within the first chapter, with her cursing and yelling and going to the pub. I know that Ron cheated on her but I just can't see Hermione doing anything like that. Granted, I know it's FanFiction but that was just way too much.

Second, the author overused exclamation points (mainly with Hermione's vernacular) that it became a wasted grammatical error.

Third, I think it was either Chapter 4 or 5 in which Harry was explaining the ideal of "marriage" to Hermione within the actual law, which I found complete BS.

Fourth, it seems like the author didn't even like JK Rowling's wizarding world that she created by having the characters use Muggle technology. I know that some things witches and wizards do within the world isn't efficient, but to me, that's what makes it magical. Using technology and the like doesn't make it feel like a Harry Potter FanFiction story.

But you're right on the fact that there are few DH H/Hr stories. I guess many authors don't like or don't want to write what happens afterwards, which is shame as it holds a ton of potential for being creative.

Hm, I think there's about a 50/50 split in opinion regarding the wizarding world among Potter fans. I personally always enjoy fics that mock wizarding britain, especially when they don't put it on that pedestal above lowly muggles that it sees itself on (for IMHO no good reason). But I can understand if your opinion differs... magic is certainly cool in many ways. It's just their society and culture that seem utter crap to me and I'd probably rather live among the muggles and practice magic in secret if I had to decide.

It felt too much like emotional conflict for the sake of it, rather than something natural for the characters.
