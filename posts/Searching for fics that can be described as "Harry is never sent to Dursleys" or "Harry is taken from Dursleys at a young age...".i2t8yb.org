Dumbledore and his followers evacuated to France, where Harry is raised by Sirius and went to Beauxbaton with the Weasleys. But they would their revenge 18 years later.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Gilderoy Lockhart raised Harry to become a cunning memory charm specialist at a very young age.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214]])

This is called Secret Life of Plants. It's a Remus-raised Harry Potter completed series that spans about 300,000 words and has a favorable view on everyone except Dumbledore sorta. Features Harry who doesn't believe in the rules of magic, Draco who has a rebellious meltdown and leads a charge of students in defiance of the authorities, a feminist Pansy and Hermione who spearhead a feminist revolution, Harry and Ron friendship, Percy Weasley as a good person (though still estranged), and Ron as an unseen but talented person. Mostly focused on Remus, Severus, Draco, and Harry. Hermione is a huge part, Ron makes it into almost every chapter of the main fic even if he's not a real POV character. Check it out! Extremely recommended, and I was hesitant about reading it at first.
