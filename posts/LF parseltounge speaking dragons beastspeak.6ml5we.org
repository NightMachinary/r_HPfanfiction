I have seen a few fics here and there where harry finds out he can speak to/understand dragons. They are usually 4'th year fics or crack fics. So any fics where harry speaks to dragons is most welcome!

Bonus if there is any fic with a dragonhandler harry that speaks parse.. uhh dragontounge? Draconian?

Additionally im looking for fics where harry can communicate with other animals (magical or normal) Bonus for prehogwarts and/or helpful animals (information that he has magic, or training in magic)

No slash please


** The Queen who fell to Earth

Harry can speak to all Dragons on earth. On of my favorite stories together with its sequels.

The crossover aspect is small enough, so it does not matter if you never heard of it (as I did).

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
