Hi!

I've read a couple and I really enjoy when either after the war or before they find themselves in either marauder era or an alt universe with Harry parents and family.

Harry/Draco/hermione especially but anyone as long as they're happy and family/friendship orientated!

That would be awesome Thank you


** You've likely already read this one, but it sounds like /Stages of Hope/ is what you want.

I adore this fic. It's pure gold
