I'm looking for a fanfic or one-shot that has Harry comforting/looking after/having a deep conversation with Hermione, NOT IN A ROMANTIC WAY ust as someone who cares for his best friend and feels grateful that she has stuck beside him for so long. Possibly set after Hermione's torture at Malfoy Manor or after Ron leaves... I ship Ron and Hermione together but I really value the friendship that Harry shares with Hermione. It's really wholesome and pure, like a brother/sister bond.


** I really like this scene from films [[https://youtu.be/ucS3xMZcrHQ]] ... was there any story which would be elaborate on this brother-sister relationship?
