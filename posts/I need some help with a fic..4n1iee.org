** It could be as simple as she didn't do her homework. And then she deliberately continues to get detention because she wants to spend more time with Harry.

** Perhaps another professor gave her the detention, and she is just serving it with Snape. If Snape can request Harry for detention because plot, surely he can request Pansy as well.

Maybe Hagrid gave her detention, and Snape was like, "I'm not letting you drag one of my students into the Forbidden Forest. She can scrub cauldrons for me instead."

** She could be in detention because a gryffindor sabotaged her potion and Snape blamed her.

*** But when does Snape ever punish Slytherins? I know i'm really forcing this but it has to be believable. The only way I see it is if she was paying more attention to her makeup and did a Nevile and then Snape just snapped

**** OK, how about she wss staring at Draco and added an explosive ingredient. It explodes and Snape confronts her in the Hospital wing, she blames the Gryffindors but Snape does a bit of subtle legimency and gets so pissed off at her for both lying to him and paying no attention at all to her cauldron that he actually gives her detention.

Then you could have that Malfoy laughed at her when she was covered in corrosive potion goo whereas she sees HP looked worried bish-bash-bosh set-up for your detention.

Sorry mate but I haven't read enough good HP/PP fics to give you much help.
