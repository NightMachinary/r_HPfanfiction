I came across an account that had reuploaded a couple stories without really putting in the author credit or any details about them at all. One of them had amused me, but it seems like the story is incomplete.

I wanted to check if this random person had actually uploaded everything available, but I can't actually find the story archived anywhere else. So it might have been abandoned and unfinished forever, I have no way of knowing aside from assuming this person definitely did upload everything.

There was a previous thread about it several years ago, but the link to the archive someone posted was dead when I tried it.

The story was called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6454127/1/Dormant-Blood][Dormant Blood]]. The author name was possibly Beetledude.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3gtk3h/does_anyone_have_a_copy_of_the_story_dormant/][The previous thread I came across]]

It's one of those "Male Veela" stories, but for once it's Harry and it's not a slash fic. It was surprisingly decent, though I suppose not /amazing/ but few fan fics are.

I'd like to read some more stories where Harry is more dominant and focused on his own benefit instead of trying to please everyone. You know, without also constantly climbing soapboxes to give edgy speeches and such.


** There are various archive dumps of FF.net from the past. E.g., I found Dormant Blood.txt in one of them. Send me in PM your email, and I will send it to you.

** You can use the chrome extension Wayback Machine. As long as you have the link, there's a chance you can still read it. The only drawback is that someone out there has to save the page before its deleted. I, myself, work from the shadows and save my favourite fanfictions in those archives.

** I have many stories in my archive of fanfiction.net. If you know the URL or the story ID (the number in the URL) then I can look for it.

For example, I have the first 6 chapters of the one you linked to. I've PMed you a download link.
