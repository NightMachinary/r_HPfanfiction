Mine is when two student get together, and like a day later to show someone they are dating now they kiss deeply, Here's an example I just read

As they were walking back towards the school, Harry and Hermione spotted the one person that they had hoped to avoid for a little while longer.

"Wait!" Ron shouted as he ran towards them.

"Finally, I've found you!" the redhead panted when he had caught up with the couple. "You know, there are the weirdest rumours about you two! Everyone says that you two are boyfriend and girlfriend now. Can you believe it?" He guffawed.

"Well," Hermione said and turned towards Harry. She leaned in for a deep kiss that Harry happily reciprocated.

"I guess even the Hogwarts rumour mill has to be right once in a while," the brunette said with a smile once they had separated.

Ron was gaping at the couple with wide eyes, his ears quickly reddening. "Wh- what- when- how did this happen?" he exclaimed.

Harry guessed it would be best to just rip off the band-aid and answered, "I asked Hermione to be my girlfriend yesterday evening after we entered her name, the names of the twins and some other names into the Goblet of Fire."

I don't have a problem with couples kissing but TWO awkward 14 year olds in the mid 90s doing more than hold hands and a peck just seems weird to me.

Ehh who knows maybe I'm just a prude

** Honestly I think it depends on the person. Some times it can be weird though. I hate when they go from barely knowing each other to deeply in love within a couple days but in think my biggest peeve is when harry at age 11 is talking like a 40 year old. Usually in political situations. Like I get that politicians would want photo ops with the boy who lived and all but asking anl kid for his opinion on political matters is just weird. And harry responding with a well thought out response when hes been in the wizarding world all of 5 minutes is just worse

*** I suck at writing kids, I can plainly admit that. Which is why I go to lengths to either elevate the ages by starting the story with them being older, or give the child an upbringing that would allow him or her to have such a vernacular. I'm doing a mix of both in my current fic, and it's working out wonderfully. No one wants 11 year old politicians.

** Honestly one of the ones that get me the most is misspelling "wary" as "weary", I'm always confused when I read that and it's EVERYWHERE. Getting common idioms wrong "For all intensive purposes" (REALLY?!) instead of "For all intents and purposes"...I often wonder if even a third of these authors even read(alright that's rude but still). Another peeve of mine is when there's a pairing between what is canonically two males and the summary says "slash for the idiots", as if the author has never heard of genderbending before(a personal favorite theme of mine), go ahead and write your slash, not my cup of tea, but some times I can enjoy it depending, but no need to insult me just because you might have written a genderbent character instead.

Edit: I actually have a lot of peeves in fanfiction(sifting through sewage for that one diamond in the rough is what I do) but if I listed them all, we'd be here all night/day/whatever

****** Lol, well that's a helpful answer. Why not?\\
A common thing I see with indie or cunning Harry is him saying to someone "Wouldn't the real Slytherin be in a different house where they wouldn't suspect you?" And that kinda annoys me for a few reasons. One, cunning, and ambition do not necessarily mean you need to be a wolf in sheep's clothing, and "hiding" in another house does not necessarily make you cunning. Two, it defeats the whole purpose of the sorting, and while you can make the argument that the sorting hat takes choice into account, that doesn't mean that it'll place you into another house when you're a quintessential Slytherin(love seeing this actually happen in fics sorting hat saying "Ha, you can't trick me to SLYTHERIN you go")

I also get annoyed when the entirety of Slytherin gets painted as evil rapists or political prodigies, or that EVERY SINGLE ONE is a pureblood supremacist(Unless the OTP for the fic is in Slytherin in which case OF COURSE they are the ONLY exception and secretly love muggles, and their parents were probably super business savvy and made tons of connections in the muggle world), a great way of subverting that is either converting said interest to the tolerant side, or even just acknowledge that bad people come from all walks of life, and so do good people, and just because you had certain values or mindsets at 11, does not immediately make you that thing forever.

Another common(trying to keep to the most common things I see) is some character is dissing the pureblood cause for wanting to wipe out muggles and how wizards would get wrecked because of numbers/nukes/guns. And while granted this might actually be the case, it's MAGIC. The Rise of the Wizards actually illustrates what I think would be a pretty workable strategy with canon magic(if you remove the bits that aren't canon like magical crystals replacing wands), and they talk about how things like bombarda can't even compare(hello fiendfyre anyone? That could easily take out a city) But the point is, it doesn't even need to develop into all out warfare. The right people using the right curses at the right time could completely destroy the critical infrastructure that muggle society is built on and no one would even know it happened.

‚Äã

If I dug deep enough there'd be more I never thought I'd get the chance to actually say(I'm the only one of my friend group that reads fanfiction) but I've said more than enough at this point, thank you for your patience *bow*

Thus, he paid one or more guards to slip sterility-inducing potions into Sirius's food. It made sure Sirius couldn't sire an heir, but did so without anything noticeable happening until it was way too late to track down those responsible.

While that's perhaps not the best way to inform your best friend, the fact is that teenagers are /really/ into PDA. (Although it's never stated in canon, I'd bet that's a major no-no at Hogwarts. It is, after all, a boarding school: they really have to watch for innappropriate activity because there's simply too much oppportunity for the kids to misbehave.)

My pet peeve is "your Hogwarts letter arrives on your eleventh birthday" (usually paired with "Hermione memorized all her books because she's had almost a year"). Harry only /happened/ to get his letter on his birthday, after a week of failed attempts. McGonagall is not some sort of Wizarding World Social Secretary, keeping track of all the children's birthdays and sending them a special greeting. Hogwarts, /like every other school/, sends out their letters in the summer. Children with birthdays around that date will /coincidentally/ get the letter near their birthday. It would be more accurate to say they get their letters "the summer in which they are eleven years old." (Good thing Hermione was muggleborn: it would have killed her to have to wait nearly an entire extra year.)

While we can presume that at least Charms, Transfiguration, and Herbology are expertly-taught, we see chronic problems in the teaching of Defense, most of the students treat History class as nap-time, and Snape seems to only half-teach Potions, preferring to berate non-Slytherins after they make an error rather than correcting them beforehand or instructing them properly. Throw in the near-total neglect of student safety not just in Potions but also in flying lessons (Hooch was about as useful as a gelatin hammer when Neville's broom went wild) and the wildly inconsistent discipline and you've got a school that is objectively a hot mess.

**** I had a big reply but it got to rambling so I'll make it short instead.

The wizarding world (and not just The British) are a stagnant culture. They are mired in corruption and backwards tradition. They make by muggle standards strange or horrific choices. It is easy to imagine based on famous Hogwarts alumni that despite the numerous educational problems it has, that on a world wide scale Hogwarts is excellent by wizarding standards.

Wizarding standards that:

Have a game that sends bone breaking cannonballs after children.

Have regular instances of cursed magical items sold to muggles in a society whose sole unifying ideal is hiding magic from muggles. Cursed toliets?

Have convicted criminals as a boarding school headmaster when there are only 11 schools total.

That last point needs reexamining. There are only 11 schools. Muggle education has come a long way, but less than a century ago recitation was a defining part of education. Read memorize repeat. In a backward world culturally barely past victorian ideals, Hogwarts is far past muggle boarding schools far past victorianism. And once again, it has only 11 schools to compete with. Greatest school in the wizarding world is not a feat met with stiff competition.

** When people put characters in the marauders' year, usually as romantic interests/Lily's friends. I'm talking about people who were in the first order, like Marlene Mckinnon or Dorcas Meadowes or the Longbottoms. I get how authurs might want more characters in the marauders' year, but it's not really statistically possible for such a large portion of the order to be in the same year, especially when you take into account the fact that the marauders/Lily were barely out of school in the end of the first wizarding war. Most of the order members were probably older and more experienced, like the Longbottoms, who were said to be well-respected aurors- they must've been out of Hogwarts for a while by the end of the war.

** I hate when authors give the characters nicknames or they spell their names wrong. I read a fic where Viktor was spelled ‚ÄúVictor‚Äù. It's not a huge deal, but if you're writing a story or chapter around him, you should probably use his correct name.

I hate when Hermione has nicknames like ‚ÄòMione or Mia. I immediately nope out of a time travel fic where Hermione changes her name to ‚Äúprotect the timeline‚Äù. That part is fine with me, but I can't stand it when the authors calls her by the fake name when someone isn't directly talking to her. Not sure if that makes sense.
