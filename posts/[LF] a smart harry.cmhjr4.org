Okay so looking for a fic with a smart and magically powerful harry so probably a ravenclaw and also like atleast 200-250k words

So requirements:

-smart harry

-powerful (magically)

-long story like 200k atleast

Maybe even animagus but NOT a requirement

THANKS!!!!


** Give Three Black Birds a try! It's a WBHL fic with a twist - Harry grows up with his parents and brother, but is constantly neglected since his brother has all the fame as the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry is a Ravenclaw, and is consistently in the top of his class, even if he's not quite Dumbledore Jr.

*** I agree, it took me about a day or so to catch up to the current point of the story since it was such a good read.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)
