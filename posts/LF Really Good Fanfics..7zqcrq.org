** Far and away my favorite oneshot, a must read for a newbie would be Cauterize, by Lady Altair. It is a heartbreaking post war fic, almost a character study of roughly a dozen people--both main and secondary or tertiary characters. I'm sure it's on some of the lists posted earlier, but it deserves its own post.

** I would argue that Limpieza De Sangre linkffn(11752324) is the absolute best fic to feature a female Voldemort named Emily that has multiple portions of chapters that take place in the 1940s, includes a katana as a horcrux, and has Harry Potter file his nails with a switchblade.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

*** Wow! An author replying to my first post!

I read letters and didn't realize it was you! It was excellent (minus the 3 additional chapters, I need to start respecting the warnings authors put in the beginning of chapters) but still the best comparison to the emotions I felt after were what I felt after reading Great Expectations with the two endings.

I'm pretty hype to read more of your work but could you confirm which ones have happy endings? I literally lost productivity for a day cause I got so invested in the characters.

** I mean i dunno about consensus but

linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux) is a classic

and then the highly debateable linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is pretty solid if you keep an open mind I guess? Some people hate it, some people love it.

** Can't link cause mobile, but Backwards with a Purpose part 1 is widely considered (and in my opinion) the best pic ever made. Basic premise is that war ended way worse than canon, survivors decide to back in time and do it over. But it's far and away the most realistic take on this. It both doesn't fall into rehashing canon, and diverges from canon in plausible ways. 100% worth a read.

-edit- why on earth is this getting down voted lol. No ones arguing that it's not really good. Kinda confused here.

*** Definitely wouldn't call it the best ever. It stretches credibility a LOT in some parts, especially the entire COS plot...

Yes, by all means, plot to have Ginny be possessed by Voldemort. It's not like he'd be able to read her mind and find out the entire plan or anything! And it's certainly not like it was a bloody miracle that the basilisk didn't kill anyone the first time around; nooo just a little harmless petrification, you can take that for granted! There ARE better ways to get a sword imprented with basilisk venom, just saying.

Still, annoyances aside, I won't say it isn't worth a read-through. In fact, I read it twice. It's for the most part competently written and it actually holds up as a peggy sue fic even after all this time. So yeah, check it out if you have the time.

The sequel is boring as all get-out though.
