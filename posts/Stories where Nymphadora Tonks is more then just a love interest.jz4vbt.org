What I'd love to see, is her Auror training, that'd what I really like to see involving her.

She can be in a romantic relationship, but I want her to be more then that.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes.

Anyone can be the main characters, can be on any site, can be any length. Can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

After the war, Harry joins the aurors. He's ... not a good auror. He's been trained way too much to act on his own and needs to learn how to call backup. Tonks teaches him. Romance happens, but she's a mentor of sorts. Some good stuff in there.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

*** Second this. This fic did an amazing job with world- and character-building, and both Tonks and the Aurors become infinitely cooler.

It's an AU but Tonks is still a Auror and while it's not about her in training it shows how she would do the job. It's a buddy-cop story with Tonks and Harry, and while the's ending is meh the story is still fun.

  After four years working overseas for the shadowy Department M, a world-weary and dispirited Harry Potter returns to the land of his birth. He meets some old friends and makes some new ones, as he learns that much has changed since he left home. AU, a 'Harry never went to Hogwarts' story.
