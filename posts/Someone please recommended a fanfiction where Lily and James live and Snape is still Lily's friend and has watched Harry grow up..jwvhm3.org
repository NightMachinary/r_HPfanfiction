When I read fics where Jily survived, they usually hate Snape and when Snape adopts or befriends Harry, Jily is dead. Could anyone tell me a fic where Snape mentors Harry when Jily live and they are still friends? I want a best friends Snape and Lily and the snarky but fun banter husband James.


** - “Reboot by Kallanit” linkffn(9552519)
- “Severus Snape and the Art of War by CypressWand” linkao3(18697885) ... except it is in the severe need of cutting it down (half-a-million words is just too much).

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
