Draco and Hermione work together in Draco's consulting type business after Hogwarts. (Helping people get bills passed kind of thing)

Draco's having a hard time making headway with the general public as he opens the business so he brings on Hermione as a PR boost promising her that she can work on whatever projects she wants.

Pansy is a designer and routinely gives Hermione makeovers. D&H are routinely put in front of the press and so Pansy is brought in to build up her personal brand better.

Very random but Draco and Hermione also have a thing about her oak desk that comes up in a few chapters. There's lots of secret sex, fancy outfits at galas, and generally happy romcom fluff everywhere.

I originally found it on AO3 but forgot to bookmark. Can anyone help?

  Hermione felt the pounding in her ears again. She would see him for the first time since the Great Hall, gaunt and stricken at the Slytherin table with his mother clutching his arm. She hadn't meant to look for him. Not in the corridors, not beneath the white sheets of the fallen, not on the way to the Chamber of Secrets with Ron, but she was a stupid girl.

** It sounds super similar to one I read recently. It also paired Harry and Theo Nott and involved the Peverell brothers, Flamel, and Herpo the Foul. Could it be the same one?
