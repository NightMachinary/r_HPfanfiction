** You'll most likely never find that story.

How are Muggleborns prosecuting (I think you meant persecuting, though) the Purebloods, if they're in charge of everything? They've got enough money and power to make Muggleborns jealous, but aren't using that to sweep them aside?

It would be kind of hard for Muggleborns to come into a world they're only introduced to at 11, and do literally anything. They don't have any voice, money, title or power. Who is gonna listen to them? The Purebloods they want to persecute? Half-bloods that seem to be doing rather well even under Voldemort?

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
