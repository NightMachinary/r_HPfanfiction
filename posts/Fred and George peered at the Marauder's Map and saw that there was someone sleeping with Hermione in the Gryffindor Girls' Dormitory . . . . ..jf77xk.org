named Lily Potter.


** "Okay, you caught me. 'Hermione Granger' isn't my real name. But when I discovered I shared my name with a martyred war hero, I thought it might be a bit insensitive to use it. Especially with Harry in my year. So I decided to come up with a new name to use, and I was in a major Shakespeare phase at the time, and 'Granger' is my mother's maiden name, so it was an easy choice."

**** I once read a fic like this, but quickly dropped it because it was basically just a weird excuse to ship her with Snape (I don't mind the ship itself per se, I actually like it, but only as a Marauder era ship generally).

**** Lily's letter to Sirius in Book 7 mentioned the Potters having a cat that Harry chased while on his first broom, and the Pottermore family portrait shows James holding an orange cat.

***** Yeah that's the launching point for this, but people have written about it. Maybe on tumblr? It feels like a tumblr post in my memory, I don't think it was a fic. I could be wrong though

** I've seen fics where crooks or buckbeak are Regulus Black. I think this is a great premise

eta: admittedly I can see Regulus being quite hands off/observational/sneaky, but I think Lily would be far more involved in interfering in their lives than canon Crookshanks

*** Well I'm pretty sure that if fics can turn Harry and Voldemort into girls, they sure should have no problem turning Crookshanks into a female cat.
