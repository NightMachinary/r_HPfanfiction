He's dark. He is cruel and cold. He is King or maybe prince. He did a lot of good though, like modernized the Slytherin dorms... I remember he added lights, reorganization of the common room, a basilisk door.

Oh Severus Snape has no sway over his house any more. He dislikes the boy but has enough respect to know he's not needed.

Either Harry was living in an orphanage or Potter elves raised him.

Thank you for anything you find!
