/Summary: The Dark Lord has fallen, but an even more terrible force has arisen to take over the Ministry of Magic -- the Pink Lord. Ruling with an abundance of ruffles and terrifyingly sharp stiletto heels, Umbridge's Think Pink Brigade terrorizes a populace grown weary of decrees designed to enforce sweetness. Unexpectedly, Hermione Granger joins the resistance, the sarcastically snarky Back in Black./
