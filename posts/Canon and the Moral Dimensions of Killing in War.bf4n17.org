Fanfiction seems to regularly uphold that Dumbledore, and often by extension the Order etc., are against killing even in times of war. There's a tendency to cast killing as evidence of someone "going Dark" or similar.

I'm away from home this weekend and can't check the books, but this does not seem to be supported, or at least clearly supported, by canon.

I suspect that this notion comes from a few places, including:

--the conversation between Dumbledore and Voldemort about how death is not the worst thing that can happen to a person

--the fact that we never see Dumbledore kill anyone (Gellert is case in point, though I've not seen the second Fantastic Beasts movie, so there may be more to this)

--the traditionally automatic sentence to Azkaban for casting an Unforgiveable

--Ron's (I think) observation that Mad-Eye Moody is a great Auror and only killed when he had to (which I think goes against the point that killing was really figured in canon as a true negative)

-- Perhaps most importantly, the theory that murder injures the soul (though here I think a distinction needs to be drawn between murder and killing in war).

I also suspect that the idea of killing as evil comes more from JKR's aversion to having good characters kill people than from the story itself (cue Voldemort's final curse rebounding on him). On the other hand, she does seem to take care to have characters refrain from killing for "logical" reasons rather than ethical ones. For example, I believe in /DH/ the trio doesn't kill the Death Eaters that find them after they trip the taboo for practical reasons (even though they weren't great) rather than because it was considered a moral evil. After all, even Molly Weasley kills someone and Harry casts Unforgiveables, yet there is never any talk about either being evil or "going Dark."

So I'm curious if I'm mistaken and if others have thoughts about this. Does canon really represent killing in war as evil or morally problematic in the way that fanfictions often do? Is canon Dumbledore dead set against killing or having any of his people kill (not to mention having Snape kill him), or is this just fanon?

Thanks for your responses.


** I suspect that JKR didn't want his teenage protagonists having to kill in a children/YA series.

On the other hand, she's mightily proud of Molly killing Bellatrix and has made clear this point in multiple interviews.

She wanted to write a fairytale in which innocence and passive sacrifice trump the evil. Fine for me in a children's series, but NOT something I want to read in fanfics for mature audiences.

Well, there /was/ one time Ron killed a Death Eater, though not with an Avada Kevadra. It was in the battle after they picked Harry up in DH:

  “Ron was great,” said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. “Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you're aiming at a moving target from a flying broom ---”

As Harry noted a few pages earlier:

#+begin_quote
  Lupin looked aghast. “Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!”

  “We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd fallen, he'd have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added defiantly.

*** With respect to not killing Dolohov and Rowle in that cafe, the Trio had good reasons to do so. Besides wanting to cover their tracks, Weasleys were basically Voldemort's hostages at this time. Killing these two might prompt Voldemort to kill the Weasleys in retaliation, and that was something they couldn't afford.

But later, Dolohov went on to murder Remus at Battle of Hogwarts, and was the primary culprit in turning Teddy into an orphan. These two Death Eaters should also have tortured and murdered countless Muggleborns and Muggles.

I would really like to see a scene in which Harry felt guilty about his misplaced mercy and resorted to do things differently in the future.

** Killing in a civil war, at least on the non-genocidal side, is perfectly fine by me. You are defending your life and should not endanger yourself to save those who want to kill you. To quote Patton, the objective of a war is not to die for one's county but to make the other guy die for his. And if your agenda is enforcing racial segregation by means of concentration camps and death Squads, then you deserve no mercy.

And the one area where Dumbledore clearly fails to do the right thing is Malfoy. Dumbledore is sprouting some BS about saving Malfoy when he, at that point, had already committed enough war crimes to warrant an execution for it, even by Allied standards. And then he does it again with the second attempt at Dumbledore, and yet there is no action.

Dumbledore's willingness to gamble with everyone's lives for one who had repeatedly violated one of their most sacred laws (ban on unforgivables) and carried out several murder attempts is unforgivable. It's one of two character defining moments for Dumbledore IMO (with the other being "ten dark years").

*** Frankly, I agree he did what was easy, instead of what was right. Malfoy was a cornered animal who showed regret, not remorse. He would have killed that year if it wasn't for Harry. I agree he should have been imprisoned. Dumbledore went with what was right, not what was easy. And the Dursley's were a choice that could have been worked around. Or letting Sirius go to jail without a trial. Or leaving a hateful man in a school of children. Not that fics which work around this do much better. McGonagall was an incompetent deputy in the school. The most flattering interpretation of Dumbledore by his actions is a good man trying to do too much and failing at most of it. The pairings in the epilogue don't bother me. Malfoy being free only bothers me slightly (Provided he paid his debt to society, but his father being free is unexcusable). Ron confunding a driving instructor bothers me quite a bit. But it's the fact Harry names his son after an abuser and an enabler. Snape frankly never was good. His motivations were to a dead woman who he was obsessed with.

**** It's Voldemort. He takes on three of the most powerful people in the Wizarding world (McGonagall, Kingsley, Slughorn) post-Dumbledore's death and still swipes them away like flies.

In the Fantastic Beast films Grindelwald takes on a group of Aurors with similar ease and is only taken down by a beast (and not taken at all in the second film). Voldemort is meant to be even more impressive.

So essentially Voldemort is practically speaking undefeatable-even without the horcruxes, that's why everyone fears him so. They don't even know about the Horcruxes in fact.

This is actually Sirius, which I bring up only to say it's another interesting way canon treats the subject. He is arguably the person aligned with the "light side," other than Moody himself, who seems most okay with killing (if his treatment of Peter, and even Snape, is any indication). But he praises Moody for sparing Death Eater lives. Rowling certainly tries to draw a moral line in the sand with killing and makes sure to fit all of her good characters on one side.

It's hard with fan fiction when you attempt to treat the subject in a more adult way. It doesn't always make sense or fit the characterization consistently.

** One of the problem good guy have in Harry Potter is that they can't really know if the guy they are fighting is truly a bad guy or not.

Of course there are some obvious Death Eater (like Dolohov, Lestrange or Malfoy) but there are also a lot of "innocent" forced into the war either by fear or by the Imperius curse.\\
For example, in DH Lupin is angry that Harry used "Experliarmus" because it's what gave him away, and say to Harry that this is war and he should be ready to hurt, or at the very least stun. But he used this spell on Stan Shunpike, a completely innocent guy that was just there because he tried to seduce a girl by making things up and a politician threw him in jail to look like he was making progress. Then Death Eater took him out but put inside their controle. Would it be just to kill or hurt a guy like this?\\
There are other case like Pius Thickness, a puppet minister under the controle of Malfoy, he fought with the Death Eater during the Battle of Hogwarts.

​

In the end I think that unless if it's the only way for you and your friend to survive, the good guy should not kill if only by fear to kill innocents. The "confirmed" target are limited to the Inner Circle, and even in this case it would be best to not kill because :\\
- Inner Circle member have a lot of informations that could be usefull\\
- All of them are big racists but some of them may just be there because if you don't follow Voldemort like a dog, you end up like Karkaroff (still asshole who joined freely 20 years ago, but hesitation is acceptable in this case)\\
- Some may be spies (like Snape)

Not to mention that the average wizard don't have the same informations than reader about the Inner Circle. We knew who they are because Harry was there for their first meeting after Voldemort resurection, and he did gave an interview but can wizards follow blindly the words of a 15 years old kid? (Not to mention the average Wizard put Sirius Black in the 2nd place of people they need to kill so . . .)

As my county's history proves quite well, the best way to stomp out such an ideology is by having it totally annihilated on the battlefield. A lot of people at that time argued that the First World War wasn't really lost for Germany since little to none territory was occupied in 1918 and we had soundly smashed Russia. Kinda difficult to argue the same when ten million Soviets with tens of thousands of tanks and artillery pieces flooded across your border while your towns have been reduced to ruins and all atrocities of the Nazis have been exposed.

And that kind of resolution is missing from the HP canon, but that is a different debate.

**** This is no question of agreeing and disagreeing with me. What I wrote was not exactly my opinion (which I specifically emphasized), but what I consider the prevalent notion among Europeans. Discussion here is very different from the one in the States (I lived there for five years studying for law-related PhD), because the basic milieu is given by the European Convention as “no” for the capital punishment, which is obviously the opposite of the normal in many US states.

Considering my personal opinion, I have a legal education, so I spent many hours discussion pro- and contra- of the capital punishment. My conclusion of these discussion is that I understand a lot of reasons for it, but in the end I am mildly supportive of ECHR, mainly because of possibility of mistake. From the Harry Potter universe, if the mistake of Sirius Black happened in the world with the capital punishment, there would be probably no way how to rectify the mistake (or whatever it was). However, I am not much fanatical against it, and for example I have no problems with capital punishments for Nazi criminals given in the Nuremberg trials.

I am a Christian (not a Catholic) and I respect a lot of the current pope, but I think his declaration that the capital punishment is eternally against the Gospel, is completely crazy. Not only it makes all great Catholic theologians (including couple of Doctors of the Church) opposing Gospel (which is mildly disturbing even to me), but I cannot imagine myself standing in the courtroom and accusing all those who voted for the capital punishment for Hermann Göring et al., that they are standing against the justice. I am not sure what I would vote for (and I am very glad I don't have to make that decision), but certainly I could very much understand and approve decision of those who thought these monsters deserved to be hanged (in time when in the most countries there was an automatic hanging for one intentional murder).

That's for capital punishment. Concerning the morality of the killing in war, I think it is slightly more problematic than what I understand you suggest. I am not an expert on law of war, but if I recall correctly the legitimate goal of the war effort is to eliminate war-making power of the enemy with preference for preserving life and health of the other side (for example by capturing enemy soldiers and putting them in the POW camps, where they should be treated humanly). Thus, aerial carpet bombing of both England and especially of Germany in the later phases of the Second World War are highly problematic, not mentioning endless number of war crimes committed by both sides on the Eastern Front.

I would highly disagree with your assessment of the First World War.

1. I am highly suspicious of motives of any large power in the war (both French, Russians and to large extent British were very much willing and happy to enter into the war; Belgians et al. might be truly pure victims of the war), and I think the Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (War Guilt Clause) was just a piece of unjust anti-German propaganda hiding own French partial guilt for the war.
2. Concerning the different results between the First and the Second World War. I really don't think the difference was because Germany and Austria-Hungary was not sufficiently smashed. You know certainly your German history better than me, so you should know the state of the Germany after the First World War, and I think it is correct to say that both Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy were completely destroyed (Austria-Hungary literally, the other two were mostly non-functional for years, and especially in Italy there could be evidenced a clear link between the collapse of the government and rise of Fascism).
3. I believe a way more important than the level of smashing was exact opposite: after the First World War destroyed countries were mostly left to their devices (whether the similarly ruined France and Britain were even able to help defeated countries is another question, but certainly there was no will to do so; if I recall correctly, the Keynes' book had a little impact on the treatment of defeated), but immediately after the Second World War there was huge effort, first by UNRRA later by the Marshall Plan, to get all countries of Europe including the defeated ones to the functional state as soon as possible (and the true perpetrators of the war were actually punished, contrary to the First World War). Thus you had the hyperinflation of 1920s in Germany, but the Wirtschaftswunder of 1950s. That I think made the difference.

Now, back to the Harry Potter universe. I think the problem of smashing of the Death Eater ideology is the different situation than after the Second World War. First of all, this was civil war and more than the true war, The Second Blood War was more law enforcement action capturing criminals. Yes, criminals were proportionally almost as powerful as the official government (which was captured by them), but still I think the fit result of the conflict was just punishment of all criminals (including collaborators and propagandist for the essentially racist ideology), not large scale killing of all Death Eaters and their friends. Tom Riddle fled from justice (which is quite ironic: he didn't flee from the death in the end, but he did so from justice) in the same manner Adolf Hitler did, but whether the large scale criminals like Lucius Malfoy, Yaxley, Dolores Umbridge, etc. deserved the Kiss by a dementor (that's probably the magical equivalent of the capital punishment, right?) is an interesting question. Aside from the morality of plea bargains (in case of Lucius Malfoy), which is another very complicated question, we actually don't know what was the result of the Shacklebolt's regime. There is not much (if anything) in the canon describing the post-War resolution. Epilogue is nineteen years later, and the situation may changed then a lot.

I would hope there was some effort of dedeatheaterization or something like The Truth and Reconciliation Commission á la post-apartheid Southern Africa, which are more fitting answers to the post-civil war situation, but again the canon doesn't say anything. There are some lovely fanfiction stories on that theme:

- linkao3(Annals of Arithmancy by White_Squirrel) (again, it is massively AU) works on this post-War situation most, and it has finished with both of these: dedeatheaterization and The Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Yet, still the results are not quite completely satisfactory.
- linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) and especially linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) (both of which are AU) deal with more realpolitik situation where the post-War government has to balance its relatively weak political position with efforts to re-establish the normalcy.
- linkao3(Grave Days by Northumbrian) and his universe (which is probably the most canonical postwar fanon) don't deal with the situation much at all: some people are punished, most important Death Eaters (sans Lucius Malfoy) are killed at Hogwarts, and some went to Azkaban for life, but mostly government is not significantly damaged and works as it should now back under the management of good people.
- there was some other (unfinished) story mainly focused on the international criminal court organized by ICW, but it was unfinished and it was mostly focused on the psychological readjustment and PTSD of the Carrows treatment of students.

However, he was a minor under duress, so the penalty should be somehow lesser, and (if the wizarding world had anything like that) in the juvenile correctional facility.

  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. On the third of May, 1998, Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals, love and loss. Grave Days.
