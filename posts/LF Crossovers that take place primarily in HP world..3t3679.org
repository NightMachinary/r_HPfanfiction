linkffn(The Denarian Renegade)

linkffn(Broken Chains)

linkffn(A Fallen God)

Similar in that way to these.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]] is one of my favorite fics. It starts out in the Hunger Games verse, but it shifts back to the Potterverse near the end of Chapter 2. It's got the best second task I've ever read. Period. It's way cooler than that stupid mermaid stuff. It's also got the best Hermione ever, as well as a great explanation for both pureblood behavior and Hogwarts's mysteriously low body count.

Edit: And the main character is a charismatic violent psychopath obsessed with guns. That's always a plus for me.

Edit 2: Also gonna rec [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340220/1/Crosswinds-of-Fate][Crosswinds of Fate]]: It's one of the only crossovers with Fate/Stay Night that doesn't have one side being overwhelmingly godlike compared to the other. It's a great fic, if it is a little slow plotwise. Only downside in my mind is the lack of [[http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2zfinDPfS1rqffkwo1_500.jpg][Gilgamesh]] or [[http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120812150915/typemoon/fr/images/a/a4/FateZero-Ep-7-img0004.png][Alexander the Great.]] Goddamn I love those fuckers.

Another Edit:

Alrighty! I found some more quality ones!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/546831/kyaru-chan][Crossover with the Addams Family]]

- Harry murders the Dursleys and the Addams adopt him. Ctrl+F for "Harveste" and you'll find the series of short stories.

Dr Who crossover. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][That Which Holds the Image]]

- Quality as fuck. It's got great atmosphere but it does get a tad silly near the end. And remember, Don't. Blink.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9122984/1/The-Aftermath][Aftermath]]

- This one isn't what you're looking for in terms of staying completely in the wizarding world, I'm just throwing it on here because I fucking love the ending.

And I can't believe I forgot this last series. It's a crossover with Warhammer. You have to read it to believe it. It's amazing. (there's a space marine subbing for the defense teacher for some of it and Snape gets PTSD'd into being a good person. It's great.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the God Emperorless Heathens]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8707895/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-Bureaucracy-of-Failure][Inquisitor Carrow and the Bureaucracy of Failure]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10499319/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-Tournament-of-Tribulations][Inquisitor Carrow and the Tournament of Tribulations]]

And anther edit:

Crossover with the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2666277/1/Something-Grim-This-Way-Comes][Something Grim this Way Comes]]

- This one's pretty cracktastic.

  'He followed the noise, and came to what he was looking for. A red door. A bright red door. A crimson door. Apollo knocked three times. The scuffling froze. The door opened surprisingly quickly. The girl standing in the doorway had dark red hair, emerald green eyes, and pale skin. The girl looked to be about seventeen and was very very pregnant.'

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.
