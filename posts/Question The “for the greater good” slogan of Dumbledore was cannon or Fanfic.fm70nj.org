I kind of understand why it's so used, it can be used to justify lot's of Dumbledore's actions and there is the whole story of him and Grindewald, but I'm curious if at any part of the Harry Potter books, or even in Fantastic Beasts, he actually said the phrase. If anyone can remember him saying this phrase in particular or others with the same meaning like “the ends justify the means” please put the quote here.


** He wrote a letter to Grindelwald in his youth. Rita Skeeter mentions it in her Dumbledore biography. Make of that what you will.

** No. It was something he and Gellert believed in - taking control of Muggles for their own good. I don't think it's ever said if he still believes in doing things for the greater good after he stopped believing muggles should be subjugated.

You could argue he does, within reason. For example, Harry had to grow up in the Muggle world - a thoroughly unmagical one at that - which would have been difficult for a wizard who'd been surrounded by magic his first 15 months of life. While Dumbledore didn't have the right to take and assign custody away from his nearest relatives, he could have done it, and raised Harry with a hero's childhood.

You would have ended up with a Draco/Dudley/James Potter/Varuca Salt mashup that would have had 85% of his peers fawning over him. Truly a horrible thought.

** They might not have said in the book but I thought they said in the movies?

*** I don't think so, if for no other reason than because Dumbledore has even less screen-time in the movies than he has in the books.
