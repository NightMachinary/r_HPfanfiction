So, the prompt is Draco and Ron both share a love of chess and after getting tired of constantly being the other people and learning the other plays chess they decide to play a chess game


** This could be good as a crackfic. Machiavellian/political mastermind Draco vs chess prodigy Ron, facing off in the Great Hall with everyone watching. Both engage in verbal sparring and lighthearted taunting, creating a friendship/rivalry reminiscent to that of Magneto and Professor X.

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? How long can a king masquerade as a pawn? [Trope stew: read the authors' notes.]
