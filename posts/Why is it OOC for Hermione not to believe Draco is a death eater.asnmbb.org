I've seen people saying this, so I'm curious. Whenever they suspected someone in the previous two books, it turned out the person was innocent.


** Because Hermione was established in Book 1 as the clever one, more rational and logical than every other wizard due to her Muggle upbringing.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Brilliant,' said Hermione. ‘This isn't magic---it's logic---a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here for ever.'
#+end_quote

When Harry explains the clues to her (Draco and his Mum in Knockturn Alley, Draco showing Borgin his arm, Draco on the train, Draco's weird habits on the Marauder's Map, kids almost getting murdered) it's clearly strange, suspicious, and worthy of investigation.

The funny thing is that Hermione /does/ recognise Draco's behaviour as suspicious, and remembers a clue, but for no real reason, she brushes Harry off. I think that's where people are getting the "she's OOC!" from.

.

#+begin_quote
  'Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!' said Hermione. ‘Back in Knockturn Alley, don't you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he'd be checking up on Borgin's progress!'

  Harry gaped at her. ‘I forgot! But this proves Malfoy's a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?'

  *‘It is pretty suspicious,'* breathed Hermione. ‘Unless ...'

  ‘Oh, come on,' said Harry in exasperation, ‘you can't get round this one!'

  ‘Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty threat.'

  ‘You're unbelievable, you are,' said Harry, shaking his head. ‘We'll see who's right ... you'll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry.'

*** I always felt that line she says in Book 1 was her being as arrogant as ever.

I honestly think that Hermione not fully believing that Draco was a Death Eater was a better thing than flat out believing him. I mean, in Book 2, she believed that Draco was the Heir because he yelled out, "You'll be next, mudbloods!" and because he strutted around without a care in the world when the Chamber was open.

Not believing that he was a Death Eater due to the circumstantial evidence, to me, showed that Hermione was less prone to jumping to conclusions as she was when she was 13. She grew out of that.

Of course, she ought to have been more concerned as someone who'd hated Malfoy's guts when those facts were presented to her, and taken notice of his comings and goings, but instead deciding to be ridiculous with Ron and Cormac - that was OOC to me.

I personally don't enjoy any of the elaborate headcanon handwaves people come up with to explain these moments, starting from /"they were stressed out and under pressure, it's understandable they forgot!"/, and going from there. It puts me in mind of the whole timeline massaging stuff that people did to explain how Professor McGonagall appeared in Crimes of Grindelwald, which meant she was ~120 by Harry's era.

******* basically what [[/u/4ecks][u/4ecks]] and [[/u/Hellstrike][u/Hellstrike]] say combined. Hermione was always a logical thinker. It strikes me as odd that she doesn't even entertain the possibility that something is up with Malfoy despite the (circumstantial) evidence pointing towards the contrary. She doesn't even want to look into it at all.

Another big thing is of course the whole potions book debacle. Her behaviour around that is not that weird at first from a canon perspective. But she holds onto that grudge for far too long. I would find it far more likely for canon Hermione to investigate the spells and potions alterations in the book than that she would be angry about it and not want to discuss it at all.

However, I do think a (momentary) "I don't want to think about that I just want to have a normal day why do we have to deal with this" would fit her character. If anything, she is the one who would want the 'normal student experience' the most.

**** She was going off the evidence that Harry had claimed to have seen, maybe that's why she had doubts. Hermione is logical, but tends to trust her own eyes and judgement over other people's, which is one of the traits that makes her annoying (like that SPEW plot, when she saw evidence of abused house elves and assumed they were all like that). Ron also didn't believe Harry about Draco being a Death Eater, so Hermione wasn't the only one.

#+begin_quote
  ‘He's a Death Eater,' said Harry slowly. ‘He's replaced his father as a Death Eater!'

  There was a silence, then Ron erupted in laughter.

  ‘Malfoy? He's sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?'

  ‘It seems very unlikely, Harry,' said Hermione, in a repressive sort of voice. ‘What makes you think---?'

  ‘In Madam Malkin's. She didn't touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He's been branded with the Dark Mark.'

  Ron and Hermione looked at each other.

*HERMIONE IN BOOK 2:* Someone is attacking Muggle-borns, and Draco's a racist toerag. We have no evidence, but he must be behind it! Let's steal shit from Snape to brew a really difficult potion so we can impersonate his toadies and con him into confessing!

*HERMIONE IN BOOK 6:* Nah, there's no way the arrogant racist toerag son of a convicted Death Eater could be a Death Eater himself. Sure, he threatened to send a werewolf known to associate with Death Eaters in to intimidate the owner of a shop that sells Dark artifacts, but it was probably just an empty threat.

Hermione's refusal to even entertain the possibility that Harry might be correct is what's considered out of character by most people, myself included, given her previous track record.

Hermione being completely OOC (including the book, as a muggle raised that is well read/intelligent there is no way she doesn't grasp the scientific method and believe that potions could be improved for instance, although Harry's blind faith in the book could be questioned), the lack of any attempt to prevent Draco from using the RoR (or even really finding out which version he used), the willingness of Dumblesore to let Death Eaters into the castle (it's one thing to allow Draco to kill him, another to allow all the students to be put at risk), Harry spending the whole year looking at penseive memories that should take a few afternoons at most (and then not forcing the issue of using hios memories to show Draco casting an unforgivable at him), etc.

** 4 Reasons:

- Malfoy's father was a Death Eater and Draco himself was openly supporting pureblood supremacy and racial purges since the 2nd year

- Even if it was questionable that he was a full Death Eater, there is no reason why Malfoy could NOT be working for Voldemort, even if he was just a simple spy

- Given what Hermione reads for fun (the Flamel tome), it is implausible that she would be unaware of organisations like the Hitlerjugend or various communist youth organisations. Even if Malfoy was not a Death Eater, he could very well be part of such a group standing behind Voldemort.

- Given the damage a Death Eater at Hogwarts could cause, it is stupid to outright dismiss the possibility, especially after Katie and the poisoned Mead.

**** Depends on what you mean by "stopping" Draco.

If it came to an all-out duel, Draco would probably wipe the floor with her. When Hermione tangled with Death Eaters at the beginning of DE (before the war had really begun) she used Petrificus Totalus on him, a Year 1 spell. Draco, who is willing to kill fellow students and isn't too bothered by the collateral damage, would have fewer limitations in his duelling.

So no, she wouldn't be able to stop Draco by fighting him. Maybe by outsmarting him, but it depends on how much preparation she has, and how much of a threat she thinks Draco is.

****** Well, first she'd need to know what Draco's task is, and how he was planning on carrying it out.

The most realistic in-character reaction she would have is to ambush and confront Draco while he's red-handed, then ask him surrender quietly, while dumping exposition speak on how she figured him out, and shaming him for abusing his prefect privileges and breaking school rules. If he refuses to go quietly, then they duel. If she was clever and prepared, she'd have backup waiting to help her overpower Draco and take him down.

The whole situation would depend on her having 100% incontrovertible proof of his wrongdoings, though. Hermione cares about justice, and while she is willing to hand it out without going through the system, she only does it when she knows for certain that someone has been wronged (and she is most likely to take action if she or those she is loyal to were personally affected), and who was responsible for it.

****** Fair enough. I was looking at your post from solely a "why is it OOC?" Level without the further question of how it would change things.

I think the story could ultimately be the same but the details would change. Hermione would believe him but Ron wouls be his usual dopey self and refuse or he would join in as the follower he is. They would then spend time formulating plans in trying to prove it and watching each one fall apart. They would try to convince others and that wouldn't work. Ultimately, I think it would give more solidarity to the whole running away from the world to hunt horcruxes and would make the impact od the necklace on Ron and his temporary abandonment that much more jarring since they spent an entire year solidifying their belief in one another. It is less jarring when Ron runs away since they came off a year of Hermione and Ron thinking Harry was petty and nuts gor the Draco thing.

I am not certain the pay off would be as directly felt. And depending on what other changes you were open to (since fixing the poor plotting of HBP would seem to be the motivation), they could either use Hermione as a means to help build up a Harry and Ginny relationship or, imo, use it to build a relationship between Harry and Hermione. With Hermione believing him, it would open the possibility to more positive changes in the writing to fix plot holes or just poorly written plotpoints.

** Hermione was the logical one in the group, it seemed odd that she didn't even seem to entertain the notion that Draco could have been a Death Eater.

From his "you'll be next, Mudblood" Comment, in book 2; when the Chamber was open, and the Basilisk started attacking, to other minor moments, it's clear that Draco hated Muggleborns, and any Muggle loving "fools"

Heck, even Ron seemed to not take Harry seriously, or to help him see what was going on, which was just all around weird.

I understand it was for the sake of the plot, but if you have to write characters in a way that wouldn't make sense, in order for a plot to happen; than the plot shouldn't happen.

When we have Draco, a Pureblood; whose father is a known Death Eater, a Aunt Bellatrix who is a known Death Eater, and other members in his family who are known Death Eaters, even if it's wrong to jump to assumption, you should at the very least be wary of him, and be watchful of the odd little things that he does.

I mean, if Harry hadn't of used the Sectumsempra curse, and instead a stupefy or something in the bathroom scene, Draco would have been in very big trouble, because he was going to use Crucio.

Draco isn't a kid who occasionally says some mean words, he's someone who actively hates Muggleborns, who is always talking about his precious daddy, he wasn't able to kill Dumbledore, but he was still willing and able to injure people like Ron and Katie without caring, heck he was able to Imperio Rosmerta as well.

** Personally, for me it's how she goes from “Malfoy probably isn't a Death Eater” and immediately jumps to “so he's harmless.” Sure, you can argue that she's learned to not jump to conclusions so quickly as she did in at least two circumstances before, but that still doesn't mean that someone who agrees with the Death Eaters, as Malfoy clearly does, isn't dangerous. Look at Umbridge - the immediately previous book shows Hermione throwing her to a poorly behaved giant and a herd of angry centaurs with no remorse.
