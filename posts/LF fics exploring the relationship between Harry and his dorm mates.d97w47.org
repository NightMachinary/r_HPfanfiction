I think it's a shame that Harry barely interacts with other Gryffindors in canon. Neville, Dean and Seamus share a dorm with him for seven years and yet they stay firmly in the background. So I'm interested in basically anything where Harry interacts more with any of the other Gryffindors, especially Neville because he and Harry have quite a bit in common.

I'll also happily take fics not focusing on Harry, just give all those background people some love.


** I mean honestly it's not that uncommon. I had 5 roommates freshman year of college and I only really hung out with 1 of them and the standard interactions like going to get a meal, popping over to ask a hw question, or going to a sports game wouldn't be something that needs to be put in a book.

** There is small set of Hermione/Dean stories, which usually lead to much more involvement of Dean and Seamus. linkao3(17777138) is rather sweet, although WIP (but it seems to be [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI][still alive]]). Unfortunately, one of the worst pars of otherwise lovely story linkffn(9566537) is rather widespread Weasley bashing, so Hermione is paired with Dean instead with similar results.

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

** Linkao3(better be gryffindor by petroltogo)

In case you've never come across it, I've found it to be the most quintessential fic to meet these requirements.

  In which the Sorting is less of a choice between Dark and Light and more of a fashion statement, Gryffindors are more than reckless, bumbling fools, and Slytherins aren't the only ones playing politics.Because you didn't actually believe that life is so straightforward as to be defined solely by the colour of a tie, did you? Hidden in plain sight, in the one house they least expected, Harry Potter becomes what he was always meant to be. Hogwarts beware, the Dark Lord's equal is rising!
