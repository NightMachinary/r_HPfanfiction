Most of the Snape centric stories I've read make him do every good thing he does for Lily's sake. Especially the time travel fics where he just learns to apologize better and does anything to make her happy.

I don't hate Lily but I don't think that she was the greatest friend to Severus, and he would be better off if he wasn't so obsessed with her.

I want fics where Severus Snape works on his own goals instead of jumping through hoops for Lily, Albus, or even Voldemort like Linkffn(11266220) .

Severus just comes off as the ultimate underdog with his abusive childhood and school years and it would be great to see him overcome it. It can even show him improving his mother's life where Snape tries to also save her from the abusive relationship she's in.

  Sixteen-year-old Severus leaves Hogwarts to attend school in the U.S., and possibly pursue a new life. But what of the growing darkness back home that threatens Lily and all he's ever known? (This story is an AU and does not follow HP canon!)

*** IMO it's /less/ believable, because I have a hard time seeing him, after being unable to let go for 2 decades, not immediately grabbing the possibility with both hands rather than having it as more of an afterthought. I do like the twist though, it makes the fic different from countless other SS Peggy Sue fics.

Too bad the fic is incomplete and dead.

That's literally the only story where Snape turns believable into a good person, everything else is disgusting severitis where authors try to sugarcoat all his crimes, as if a bad childhood was an excuse for being a bully, an abuser, a murderer.. Snape was a nasty piece of work, and being 'in love' with someone didn't suddenly make him nice.

**** Ignoring whatever he did during the war with all those /friendly/ spells he had in his /sixth year/ book and who knows how many more, there is the known fact of him not caring about who Draco hurt or didn't hurt, a decent human being would have stopped him the moment a school children almost died, no matter what. His attempt at having an 'innocent' man executed in cold blood isn't any better.

Most authors just try to find excuses for him, using the fact that the books are told by an unreliable narrator. I personally find any kind of Death Eater apologism a show of bad writing. Not a single Death Eater is innocent, you literally can't join such groups with your hands clean.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter.

*** She married the guy that bullied her (former) best friend for years...

I can understand why she breaks off their friendship, since it was a dangerous time for muggle-borns and Snape just yelled out a racist slur at her, has a history with blood supremacists, and studies the Dark arts. She never accepted his apology which is perfectly justified and her right not to.

However it bothered me that she accepted that James changed his ways along with bully group without giving Sererus another chance. It's like she showed a giant middle finger to their friendship and said that James actions were justified since he got the girl in the end.

Of course not, it just makes her not so loyal to Severus. If anyone attacked my close friend knowing I cared about them, for bullshit reasons then I wouldn't engage with them whether or not the friendship lasts.

It made me wonder if Lily actually didn't care about Severus and was just waiting for a chance to drop him. If James showed remorse for his actions and apologized then I could slightly understand Lily's change of heart, but that never happened.
