So I should preface this by saying that I understand that if you have lost a limb due to Dark Magic then you can't fix it or grow it back. Hence why Moody can't regrow his eye and leg, Pettrigrew can't get his hand back, and George can't regrow his ear.

But can you regrow limbs if they weren't lost to Dark Magic? If someone was born with missing limbs could they just easily grow them after birth?

Also, what would happen if you took too long to grow back your limbs, presuming it's possible? Is there a time limit after losing a limb or body part that you need to regrow it in?

This all just might be my longwinded way of asking the age old question of "can Harry get his eyes fixed."


** My usual stance is that wizards can fix any injury, illness, or malady in a trice, so long as it is not magical in nature. From there, degrees of difficulty vary.

Not necessarily just Dark Magic either, but magic in general. Of course, having a spell that is specifically designed to resist attempt to heal it is going to be more pronounced in this effect, but even a simple diffindo would produce an injury that is harder to heal than if the same injury was made with a sword.

In Harry's case, as with Percy and Dumbledore, it may be that genetic issues such as poor vision run into similar problems.

*** This is canon I believe - it's not just dark magic that is more difficult to heal but all magical maladies - dark magic just adds to the difficulty. It's why St. Mungo's exists, really.

** - This is getting into headcanon territory, but I think there's a difference between fixing an injury like a broken bone by returning a person to their baseline state and fixing a congenital disability like myopia, where the nearsigntedness /is/ the person's baseline state. Such a permanent alteration of living tissue might even involve Dark Magic. So, there may be a potion for regrowing a lost limb (We know there's one for bones.), but not one for regrowing a congenitally missing limb.
- There is nothing stopping a wizard from going in and magically transforming the physical shape of an eye; but unless they can do it with the accuracy of an opthalmologist, they can mess up disastrously. Teeth are simpler, however.
- As for non-Dark nonfatal injuries, I think that pretty much all of them can be fixed, unless the fanfic author wants Hermione to be physically crippled by the Troll in their fic, which happens surprisingly often.

** I treat it as reattaching the limb rather than growing your entire leg back like a lizard. The cases where it cannot be reattached are where the cut is cursed and resists healing. If you can't counter the curse then you can't put the limb back. Healing is more advanced and faster than normal and the degrees of healing mean you just need to make your own limits. If you can turn a teacup into a tortoise then why not a log into a leg.

** there are fics where there are ways to fix eyes but it's a very painful potion. but for missing limbs? it's more "reattach" than "grow" so no limb to reattach, no limb....and the dark magic messes with the "reattaching" is why they can't fix it then
