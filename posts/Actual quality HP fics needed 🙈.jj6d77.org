What it says in the title... Searching for good HP stories... Seriosly... Please help.... I can't anymore....the cringey stories make me want to pull out my eyes...

I don't care about the pairings... Ok no that's a lie... I dislike harry/draco and harry/ginny... But other than that I don't care...

Also i prefere ao3 over ff.net....

Help greatly appreciate ....


** Hey, I'm co-writing a longfic right now on ao3. No Drarry or Hinny, mostly plot focused, genre: Gen Angst/Whump. You'd have to be the judge of quality yourself, tho.

If that seems like something you'd want to check out, here's the link: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

  ‚ÄúI was going to kill you,‚Äù Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable.

  "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. ‚ÄúYour resemblance to the Potters.‚Äù At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts to assist in the lord's search for the Hallows --- by spying on the heir to the Cloak of Invisibility, James Potter.

***** There are, but the filter it has built in has serious issues. I can literally tell it to exclude Harry/Voldemort, Harry/Tom riddle, Harry/lord Voldemort etc and /still/ get that pairing in my search.

Both sites however have the ‚Äúdiamond in the shit pile‚Äù problem though - if you're looking for something new, you're gonna have to put up with a lot of crap to find anything good.

****** oh yeah that's true. It definitely isn't perfect, but it does have some great stuff in it. You do have to sift though. A little patience goes a long way in my book.

I also always check people's bookmarks and collections, which can be a good way to find older stuff, as the HP tag updates so quickly it can be tough to dig deep

So here you go a few months later: an HPfanfic with good writing [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6693841]]
