:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry is already in a relationship with both Fleur through the house of Black and Hermione through the house of potter prior to his name coming out of the goblet. He threatens to make Dumbledore a squib for violating the terms of his parents will.


** I've always been amused at the idea of Harry or anyone really threatening Dumbledore.There's a short where an evil!Dumble listens to Harry rant and rave, and then asks "What now? So what if he agreed he manipulated him? what's he going to do about it?", and then memory charms the boy and sends him on his way.

He fights from a place of power the entire time, from either letting people bad-mouth him however they please, fights to capture against another incredibly powerful wizard that is aiming to kill while he's just aiming to capture, etc.

â€‹

This phenomenally powered wizard, who've studied ancient forms of arcana, is threatened by... what? exactly? It is my firm belief in cannon that if he wanted to clear the curse from his hand he could have done so, but felt no need to do as he dictated he had lived a long life and it would fit into his scheme rather nicely.
