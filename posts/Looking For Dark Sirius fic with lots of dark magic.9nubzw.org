Looking for a fic where after spending 12 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit, given no trial, abandoned by his friends, and called a traitor by all of magical Britain Sirius doesn't just up and forgive everyone, and instead decided Britain needs fixing, and he uses dark magic from the black library to get started on it. So I'm looking for a dark Sirius with lots of different kinds of dark magic (think like the black queen series, demon summoning, necromancy etc) and where he goes up against dumbledore, voldemort and the ministry with it.

Ps: Sorry if its not well written, on my phone.


** Can't remember the name of the fic but in it Sirius escaped earlier and in is unbalanced mind he believed he only way to protect harry was to take over wizading Britain as the new dark lord.

All I remember from it was a ritual where Siri's drained crouch of his magic, I believe he roped Remus into it to.

  AU Third Year: He spent twelve years in hell for a crime he did not commit. Sent there without the courtesy of a trial. Betrayed by his friends and allies. Now he has broken out. He will find and catch that rat and then, they will pay!
