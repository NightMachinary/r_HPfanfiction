Fem!Harry paired with other girls


** Well... my story, "Holly Potter and the Witching World" is GOING to have femmeslash somewhere along the line, but it'll take some time because as of chapter six the protagonist is only eight years old and has just discovered that she's a witch. But she does talk a lot about lesbians. Not sure if that counts, though?

If it does, you can read the fic on FFN or AO3. linkffn(12828900) linkao3(12861492)

** There's princess of the blacks (and the following fics. The last one isn't complete but updated regularly).

Which is fem Harry / the potter had twins and neither of them was named Harry, f/f and f/m pairings. (But the pairings aren't the centre of the fic, there's a lot of plot...)

There's also Her Father's Hair and Holly Potter and the Witching world. But I haven't read those, so idk.

Edit: I'm still trying to figure out how to link the fics, sorry...

*** As for the links, it says how to do it in the "Bot Usage" section to the left. Basically you write "linkffn" or "linkao3" based on whether the fic is on FFN or AO3 -- or "linkffa" or "linkfp" for links to the HP Fanfic Archive or Fictionpress, but I've never seen anyone use them here. Then you write ether the title of the fic, the URL or the story ID in a paranthesis.

The story ID is the number in the URL that identifies the story. On FFN, you can find it in the fic details at the top of each chapter. You know, just below the summary, where it says things like:

#+begin_quote
  Rated: Fiction M - English - Fantasy - Harry P., Ron W., Albus D., OC - Chapters: 6 - Words: 28,862 - Reviews: 18 - Favs: 50 - Follows: 111 - Updated: Feb 18 - Published: Feb 8 - id: 12828900
#+end_quote

The "id" part is what we want here, so just copy/paste that number and it's all good.

On AO3, the story ID is in the URL:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12861492]]

  What if Harry Potter was a girl? What if she was named after her mother? Lily Dorea Potter is named after two great witches, but she doesn't know anything about them until her Hogwarts letter comes at age 11. The Girl Who Lived soon learns that certain things were being kept secret from her, but she doesn't know why. Confused, resentful of the headmaster who barely helped her along, and with various forces competing for her attention, what choices will she make? And will they be the right ones?

****** Princess of the blacks?

Kind of. But it's more nuanced than your average Dumbledore "bad", let Potter be abused for the greater good fic.

it's more like... shit is political / religious / magical, Dumbledore means well but is a manipulative bastard but many characters are very flawed. and our main protagonist is likeable but also morally "iffy" (which is acknowledged in the fic and even discussed a few times). Quite a few characters are like that... the fic is M for a reason.

I like it, yes. Certain things could have been a bit... less prominent imo but it's good, makes sense, introduces a nice bit of world buildig and makes "sense" imo (in that universe, with that plot). edit: I'm not trying to spoil it.

******** Ah. I haven't read it (but seen it recently).

I'm not quite sure whether I want to read it yet, tbh.

There seems to be (judging from the tag) a lot of sexual violence, pedophilia, grooming (by a teacher? seeing as there is a student teacher relationship tag etc...) etc.

Sure, there's a rape recovery tag but Idk, it seems like the whole grooming thing etc might be /very/ central to the story line, which may be too dark for me.
