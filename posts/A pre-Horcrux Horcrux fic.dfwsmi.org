Pretty sure it was older than HBP, definitely older than DH.

Ginny (99% certain) needs to find Harry, who had vanished after winning, because Voldemort is back. Turns out there is some bond, so in order to stop Voldemort from returning, Harry needs to die. Harry does sacrifice himself, doesn't come back, but Ginny gives birth later. Triplets, IIRC.
