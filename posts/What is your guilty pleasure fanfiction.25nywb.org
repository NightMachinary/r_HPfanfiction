What genre or specific fic do you follow that you know is bad, but you love it anyways?

Or, alternatively, what are your favorite car wrecks of a story?


** Powerful!Harry. So many of these fics have terrible characterizations or have Weasley bashing or Dumbledore bashing or ratchet up the Dursleys to an 11 on the 0 to Voldemort scale, none of which I particularly like, but I can't resist the imagery of Harry being able to completely blow shit up.

There are several fics by an author named Kimberjingle that are absolute train wrecks of smut and mis-characterization but Harry's powerful in them, so.... yeah, I've read them more than once.

*** I could have written this post myself. I hate most of the tropes that go along with independent!Harry, but the progression from useless (aka canon) Harry to a Harry that actually likes using and improving his magic skills is like crack to me.

Even when it's completely stupid like in Runemaster, I can't help but love it.

Ahhhh. Apparently Kimberjingle [[http://afallenangel.net/kimberjingle/kindex.html][writes slash]]. I googled and found their [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1539737/Kimberjingle][Fanfiction]] page, thinking the stories listed were Kimberjingle's, instead of their "favorite stories". I was loading up my kindle, and wondering who these random authors were...

** My guilty pleasure genre is definitely twin Wrong Boy Who Lived. It's so rare to find good ones, and most are even more cliche-filled than usual, but I just love the dynamic. I just love having James and Lily alive, yet still having Harry growing up out of the spotlight.

I honestly prefer having James and Lily alive over not. A part of me rages against the idea that a child could grow up under Harry's conditions and turn out generally well-rounded and for the most part fine. Also, having Harry ignorant of the Muggle world is fun for me.

The stories that try to show what the author imagines Harry would be like under the Dursley's usually crank the Dursley's up to 11, with rape, beatings, you know the drill.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][This starts off as a typical WBWL fic, but is surprisingly good. I will say Harry goes extremely dark in it, but has a really good motivation.]]

**** Just read the story. Thanks! Best (completed) Dark!Harry I've read. (Although, I must admit I haven't read lots.) I found the motivation was good, not great. Regardless, I was happy how it showed the side-effects of dark-magic. Too many story fail to really show any negative consequences of dark-magic.

I put the "completed" qualifier due to The Santi's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][HP & Boy Who Lived]]. It is, unfortunately, abandoned.

***** Well, considering /most/ Dark!Harry motives, I thought it was great. Most of the others seem to go the route of Dumbledore sucks, and everyone is over-the-top Disney-evil towards him. This was extremely subtle in why it happened, and it just all accumulated into that.

That aside, I did love the gradual sink into madness and pure evil shown in there, although the Mage-Knights were a bit silly.

Oh I remember that fic, yeah it was the first one that convinced it was even possible to have a decent WBWL fic.

** For genres, time travel and dimension travel stories always seem to suck me in, even when I can tell they're train-wrecks-to-be. Also, dark AU stories set in dystopic worlds: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1023780/Kwan-Li][Kwan Li]]'s novel-length stories and Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] are cases in point.

For authors, stories by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1729392/Teufel1987][teufel1987]], which are generally quite horrible despite the author's having decent mechanics. Similarly with those by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]]. Though I know I shouldn't enjoy reading them, somehow I keep clicking every time I see an update.
