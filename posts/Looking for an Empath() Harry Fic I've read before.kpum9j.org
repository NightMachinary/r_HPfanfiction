:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry goes back in time, or is someone else in harry body, I don't quite remember. To cover that up, and explain why he knows things, he pretends to have a power, empathy, or something related to it. At a fancy party, someone asks him to use it on them, and he discovers he actually does have that power, even though he didn't in the past(?)/ true timeline.

** Does the author ever tone down the Pureblood wank? I'm trying to like it but I cringe every time they start going on about special Pureblood magics.

Especially as Half-bloods are canonically the most gifted!
