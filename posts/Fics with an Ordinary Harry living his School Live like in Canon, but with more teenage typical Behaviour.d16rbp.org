Please let me know Fics that have a Harry who is just Ordinary (he is still a Wizard) and lives through his School Years. But there are no dangers to be prepared for, atleast not Canon-like dangers. The Books take a glimpse into the Hormonical teenagers lives in the later books, but in total they are to brave. No objections at all. Im just curious to read about a Harry who might be affected by his hormones and having sex with his Fellow classmates. Whether those scenes are fully describted or hinted doesnt matter.

But i would like if Harry is no posing character, who boasts with who he had sex, but more someone who "shut up and enjoy"...if thats the correct phrase in English. If not, i hope you know what i mean. Well, if there are certain hints, lets say he had the Patil Twins or other 2 females and they make innuendos, he just smiles.

​

And i wouldnt mind, if some Canon typical behaviours are different, like Draco having a thing for Hermione and so is not the insulting Guy. Maybe these 2 have a Relationship or she has something with Ron (i could imagine Ron gaping, if he gets that Harry has got the "Jackpot", while hermione.....i dont know, she might warn him, that all the Girls just find him attractive because he is the Boy who lived and now has grow fancyable).

​

Im even ok, if Harry and Hermione would have a (limited) liaison or he with Ginny.

As i said, there shouldnt be any dangers, atleast not canonical. So Voldemort either never happened or he died when he wanted to kill Harry as a Baby, but in this Version, he died for good.

I dont know, if Harrys Character would be possitive if he had a better childhood, not to mention living Parents. So i leave it to the Fic, if James and Lily are alive.
