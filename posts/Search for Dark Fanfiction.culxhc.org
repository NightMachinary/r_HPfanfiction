:FlairText: Recommendation for something dark
:END:
The main thing i search for is a grim reality. I want character to see the world not as a place for fun and hugs but survival of the fittest. I want them to give their blood and sweat with goal to survive. I accept recomentation as long as it explore the more dark part of the world. Example for Harry Potter will be how Knockturn Alley was never fully explored and explained even if it have its great place to meet with non-human races (Vampires, Demon, Dragons capable of using magic, e.c.t.), Forbited dark magic or maybe live grimoire that may require live sacrifice in exchange for information. One of the more dark fanfictions for HP is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900/chapters/26470377]] its not fully dark and there are a lot of family and comfort in this one but the dark part are the ones that harm my cold heart. It's not even close to finish but it have enough material for you to have fun for a few hours.


** May I recommend my own? I hope its dark enough!! I recognize that the first chapters are a bit of a mess but I think my writing improved. I'm very close to finishing it. Let me know what you think! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18874543/chapters/44800099]]

It's about Snape and having to live a lie among the death eaters :)

  It was all in the name of tolerance. It was all in the name of understanding. It was not supposed to happen this way.

** This fic features a necromancer!Harry and is pretty macabre. It goes into dark magic a fair bit. It's survival of the fittest in that Harry is essentially spirited away from the Dursley's because his mentor was looking for an apprentice who's expendable, since necromancy is dangerous and his other apprentices died in his line of work. No kid gloves here. Anyway, give it a try Linkffn(10629488)

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.
