*** I actually have no idea who that is, but that would probably be something he would say? I don't know how else to reassure you lol.

If that is a compliment I will take it, otherwise.. No!

** I'm not a writer (nor an editor for that matter) so feel free to take my advice with a grain of salt.

It comes across as choppy. You have a lot of very short sentences, and while it does make it sound more ominous in a way (which is what I'm assuming you're going for), some of the short sentences detract from how it flows. You also have several sentences that range from 'borderline run-on' to 'blatantly run-on;' getting rid of excess detail and wordiness in those would help with the flow as well.

You're also missing some commas/other punctuation. Some of the missing punctuation leave your work grammatically incorrect, while others would just help to make it easier understood.

This is the biggest piece of advice I have right now: work on the sentence structure. Rework the piece so it flows better and is easier to follow. I honestly had to read it twice, and I still am not completely sure what's it's about. If readers have to put in a lot of effort to figure out what you're trying to say - especially if it could have been reworded to be easier understood - it'll probably defer them from reading the whole thing.

Content wise: it seems creepy. I like that. It's obviously too early for me to know where you're going with the plot, but it seems like it could be quite interesting.

** tldr: You're trying to write maximum drama. You're trying to express that drama in your writing style, and it interferes with the reader's ability to understand what's going on. You are forgetting that the basis of storytelling is communication.

Beyond that, you have some other style issues and a decent amount of grammar to work on.

#+begin_quote
  "Wait." He said.
#+end_quote

But what did he say?! (You meant to write: "Wait," he said.)

And who is "he"?

How does he possess the power to interrupt the narrator? Wait, this isn't Ambush Bug, is it?

#+begin_quote
  He always had a way of knowing whether or not it was safe for us.
#+end_quote

You are mixing first and third person narration without proper framing. This is awkward, to say the least.

#+begin_quote
  "Continue."
#+end_quote

There's been no sign that anyone else is present. Nobody /does/ anything. Is the person alone? Telling the walls to wait and continue?

#+begin_quote
  The men in this room
#+end_quote

Oh, there /are/ people in the room. Only men, no women, for some reason. What reason is that?

They apparently didn't want to obey the speaker when he bade them continue.

#+begin_quote
  could not have all entered this room otherwise
#+end_quote

There's a mystical force preventing them from entering this specific room unless the end of tyranny is at hand?

#+begin_quote
  The door opened, and as planned they had received key.

  A slight pop was heard, and under no pretense or condition it stopped.

  Confusion erupted
#+end_quote

Everything you're writing is passive. You aren't talking about people. You're talking about things happening to, well, we're not really sure. Confusion and terror are breaking out, but we aren't informed who is confused.

#+begin_quote
  The phrase "Avada Kedavra" and all men fell at once
#+end_quote

From context, I gather that there are leaders who are falling, and I am guessing the dark lord is not falling. But with this phrasing, I have to take a moment to realize that it's just talking about these people and not all adult male humans.

#+begin_quote
  the world does not change so simply for a few good men as it must be repeated until all pieces are met correctly.
#+end_quote

This is incoherent.

#+begin_quote
  The world did not change that night but was moved ahead tenfold for the dark lord's reign of terror to continue.
#+end_quote

"Tenfold"? I do not think it means what you think it means.
