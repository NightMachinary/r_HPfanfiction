Are there any works in which the muggle and wizarding worlds are one and the same and there was never a statute of secrecy? Where Wizards live alongside muggles, everyone knows abut magic and always have. Either that or works that are set before the statute was implemented and muggles know about magic then as well.

(I've read one fic that was somewhat like this and wizards lived on Islands in the sky and wizards lived much longer than in canon and stayed young looking, but I believe it was abandoned.)

** It would be a hell to think out. Can you imagine the amount of worldbuilding needed to make this right?\\
Still, I'd read something like that.

Yup. Keeping in mind, no separation whatsoever, that doesn't just mean no Statute of Secrecy, it means no magicals living in seclusion from muggles before that.

All kinds of things would be affected; that loner with supernatural powers can't be a witch sponsored by the devil, not when she's casually enlarging the crops and healing the sick. Religious traditions might go all over the place, you might have beliefs in certain people being blessed by pagan spirits, or a 'divine right' going on, or who knows what. Tales of miracles would have to reach all new heights; forget multiplying the loaves and fishes, start raising the dead and flooding the world more.

And, there's the fact that a lot of people writing Harry Potter fanfiction seem to forget, and that's that there's a bazillion (well, more like a few dozen) different sapient races of magical being out there, from goblins to dwarfs to centaurs to Veela to house-elves to giants to...

They all have their own different physiology, a fair few of them have magic of their own, they all have their own cultures...

Bleh, I'm too tired to list all the ways more integrated magic could change world history. Let's just say that tons of distinct non-human races makes civil rights movements a lot more common and that tales of miracles and whatnot get really major.

** I really want to write a story set in a distant future of the wizarding world, when Muggles and Wizards have reunited into a single society along with all sapient species.
