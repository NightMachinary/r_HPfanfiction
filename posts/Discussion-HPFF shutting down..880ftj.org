Just saw that the harrypotterfanfiction.com site is closing down in April. This was the first fanfic site I ever used. There's a lot of old fanfics on there that will be lost. So sad, although I found it annoying to use, and to post.


** Just in case, and also for my personal use, I'm going to be archiving the website. I guess if anyone wants a copy they can ask me, but I'm not too sure how large it'll be, and I'm not too keen to upload to a filesharing site.

*** Fanfictionrecommendations.com has now taken over HPFF and is slowly working to rebuild the site but different & better, apparently.

Many of the active HPFF members have moved over to HPFanficTalk.com and it's accompanying archives for stories of all fandoms, as well as original fiction pieces. I'm a member of HPFT and everyone is so lovely, welcoming and kind. The stories are incredible and the reviews many leave are just as personal and detailed. Quite an awesome community to be a part of, if I may say so myself (I can proudly hold the title of first official public story posted to the wonderful HPFT archives).

FanFicFare has HPFF as a supported site.

Drag and drop any stories you'd like to save, keep a folder on your hard drive full of backlogged stories.

Alternatively, you can initiate a SiteRip, but that will take a couple days and a good program like DownThemAll or something. I did it once for the Sugar Quill back in the day, but can't remember what I used.

** Sad day. Many of my favourites are HPFF originals - Let Perpetual Light, Etc Etc and Life Goes On, Clash, Legend, Madam Minster, Für Das Größere Wohl, Whose am I. There's probably more I can't recall. Fortunately, most of these have been crossposted to other sites (except Legend). But I'm sure there will be plenty of good fic lost unless someone archives it.

** I used to be a member of the forums and know a lot of people that were on staff back in the day. Historically, the owner had indicated that he wasn't comfortable with the idea of porting it during original site shut down scares. He might have very well changed his mind, but I wouldn't hold my breath. I spend my days over on HPfanfictalk now. We've got a transfer tool that's going up this week to help new authors transition to our archive if they want. including review transfers. Most of the members are people from HPFF or tumblr. I've been backing up my favorite stories on pdf, but archiving the site sounds solid too.

** I'd say there's a tiny chance -- maybe 1% -- that this is just the most tasteless April Fools prank in the site's history, but 99% likely it's for real. So many longtime authors left the site after the forums shut down a few years back. A lot of those folks migrated to hpfanfictalk.com.
