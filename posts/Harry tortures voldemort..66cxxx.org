Looking for any scene or story with harry brutally torturing voldemort. Just finished where voldemort did stuff 100 times worse than other stories to characters i've become greatly attached to, and he just got killed.

I'm looking for some satisfaction. If you want you could even write your own in the comments.

--------------

In canon, Voldemort was sent to rot in hell forever. That was IMO far more brutal than any earthly torture, and heroes didn't even need to get their hands dirty.

*** If you don't believe in hell (and if you ignore those scenes (imaginary train station and all that), then no, Voldemort was not punished at all, he just got to die!)

ps: I don't like personified concepts (sometimes they are funny, but most of the time the very idea is stupid...death ain't a person!) and I don't like afterlive stuff either (staunch Atheist)

**** Well, Soul is real in HP world.

If there is soul, then there is an afterlife.

Voldemort mutilated his own soul in worst ways possible, so he got to pay the price after he died.

***** While "soul" seems to be real we don't really know what death entails. Sisrius described it as going to sleep didn't he? Doesn't sound like much of an afterlife if you aren't conscious. Also resurrection stone does it bring back actual person or only s shade/memory?

I had an idea once that soul / afterlife in HP world was simply manifestation of fear of death. It's like lot of wizards believe in this so magic (through shared belief) makes it real. Kind of like accidental magic except cast by whole of wixardkind through all of time. So in essence there is no god/heaven/hell - just magic.

Basically telling us something no one cared to know, for attention. There are so many similarities between Atheists, Flat-Earthers, Third-Wave Feminists, and Leftists, that it's funny.
