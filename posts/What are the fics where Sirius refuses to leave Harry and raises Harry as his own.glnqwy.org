** Sirius breaks out of Azkaban when Harry is 8 in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] and rescues him from the Dursleys. I really enjoyed it and the series has other stories that follow Harry through his Hogwarts years! linkffn(9469064)

#+begin_quote
  Born as the oldest, as the child of prophecy, and born with the potential to become great. A child grows from being forgotten to a legend, without the love or warmth of a family, but with courage and power not seen since the time of the Rikud≈ç Sennin, the courage and power of a dragon. (Warning. A Naruto neglect fic, might have incest in the future. M-Rated to be safe.)

#+begin_quote
  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
