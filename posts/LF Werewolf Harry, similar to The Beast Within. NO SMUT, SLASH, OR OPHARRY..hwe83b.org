  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** Well what folks consider to be bashing is pretty subjective and in the eyes of the reader. With that said I think Beauty of a Full Moon by Ares.Granger should meet your request. It does contain an evil!Dumbledore but makes up for it with a Good!Tom Riddle.

linkffn(10057731)

Edit: just reread your request there is minor slash between Tom and Fenrir but it's nothing explicit.

  "I do wonder how the magicals of Britain will react when they discover that the 'Boy-Who-Lived' is now the 'Wolf-That-Loves'." Hermione and Harry become werewolves with some surprising results. So surprising, in fact, that their world turns on its head. Takes place sixth year. Harry/Hermione, AU. I find this story hard to give a summary for...
