I love time travel stories, but most of them tend to be single-use 'person goes to time and it plays out from there' or occasionally 'comes back to the present afterward and things are different'.

I'm looking for some where it isn't just the main character who knows what they shouldn't, or loops, or anything fun and different involving time travel.

For instance, linkffn(far too many time travelers) or linkffn(the many deaths of harry potter by shaynet)


** Backwards with purpose has three travelers. And they are getting sabotaged/helped nu a fourth one.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** There is a ongoing fic which is inspired from "I'm Still Here" by Kathryn518 which has multiple time/AU travellers on both side of the war. It's AU travel but in the past relative to the time they come from so it may fit? I don't know about fun things though and the plot seems overly complicated. linkffn(13035363)

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is the only fic I've read where Harry constantly uses his Time-turner while time loops stay consistent so he can't undo anything. It's a rather controversial fic but I liked it.

Example: When he's trapped he decides that he should later turn himself back and help himself, which causes him to receive help from future-himself.

***** Harry is often an asshole and doesn't act at all like a real eleven-year-old. He's also very preachy and pushes the author's philosophy a lot. Now, it turns out that both of those things have good in-universe explanations, but it's hard to shake the impression built up over the many chapters before the reader learns about the explanation. It also doesn't really respect canon magic rules (e.g. it invents new rules about magic just so Harry can break them to prove how great he is, rather than having him analyze the canon rules of magic). Most importantly, in my mind, the adults play into Harry's delusions a little too much. For instance, McGonagall has basically a total personality rewrite with the way she lets an eleven-year-old walk all over her with his tantrums.

That said, it's a really fun story that I've reread multiple times and has lots of really good ideas. It just has MANY flaws.
