*i.*

It was a few days after Dolores Umbridge had caught Dumbledore's Army in the act and forced the elderly Headmaster from the castle, installing herself in his place.

In the Gryffindor common room, squeezed in on a couch next to Ron and Hermione, Harry's focus on his homework was suddenly interrupted as he heard a pop, followed by a quiet sobbing sound.

When Harry put down his book to look at the source of the noise, he saw a very distressed Dobby.

"Dobby? What happened?" Harry started to growl as a suspicion came to him, "Did Umbridge do something to you?"

The house-elf just quivered, "Dobby isn't allowed to tell...Dobby isn't allowed to tell students..."

-=-

"...So, you came to find a teacher, whom Dobby /was/ allowed to tell. Good thinking, Mr. Potter." Professor McGonagall commented, before she sighed and removed her glasses to clean them.

"Unfortunately, it's as bad as you may have guessed..." McGonagall said when she could see again, "As you know, Dobby was being paid by Professor Dumbledore to work. When Albus fled the castle, Dobby went to the new Headmistress, Umbridge, to ask her to pay his salary..."

The professor sighed, "However, rather than continue to pay Dobby, or let him seek employment elsewhere, Umbridge instead chose to use Coacto Servus, the forced bondage charm."

Hermione, who was present next to Harry, gasped, "But Professor, that's highly illegal! Forcibly enslaving someone with magic was prohibited in Britain in 1839, with the legislation updated in 1976!"

McGonagall smiled slightly, then frowned again, "Correct. I'll go speak to Professor Umbridge. The law is quite clear, hopefully she'll see reason and release Dobby."

"Alternatively, she could claim her position makes her exempt from certain laws, and threaten charges against me if I protested." Professor McGonagall amended.

Harry just blinked, mentally trying to calculate if this was yet another new low for Umbridge, or par for the course.

"She also had Dobby flogged, and his tongue cut out, for 'disloyalty'." the Transfiguration Professor continued, "As well as three other elves who voiced their protests to his punishment."

Harry stared at the transfiguration professor in disbelief, before turning and tearing out the door towards the Hospital Wing.

"No running in the corridors...oh, forget it." McGonagall grumbled as she waved for Ron and Hermione to follow him out.

-=-

Harry burst through the doors to the Hospital Wing, "Dobby, are you alright?!" he shouted.

The mediwitch glared at him from the bed she was working at, "Mr. Potter, please calm down! I still have to re-attach this poor house-elf's tongue!"

Harry blushed and sat down in a nearby chair to wait quietly. A few minutes later, when Ron and Hermione had caught up, Pomphery backed away from the bed and wiped her brow, "Alright, you can talk now."

The trio rushed over to look; lying on top of the bedsheets, Dobby was staring straight up in the air, draped in only a teatowel loincloth, defiantly clutching a wooly hat that was all that remained of his previous clothing to his chest.

"Um...Dobby?" Ron tried tentatively, "Are you alright...sorry, that's kind of a silly question, isn't it?"

Dobby turned his head to look at Ron, then at Harry, before he resumed staring back up at the Hospital Wing's ceiling, "Dobby is not alright. Dobby isn't free."

The elf's eyes flickered briefly at Hermione as well, "Dobby wants revenge on the pink toad. Doing onto her as she's done onto Dobby."

Hermione opened her mouth to say something, then stopped as an idea blossomed in her mind, "That's...I have an idea...it's horribly illegal and we'll be expelled for sure if we get caught, but..."

"Would you share your idea, Miss Hermy Granger?" a squeaky voice came from behind them.

Hermione and the other two turned around, Dobby raising his head to look; there, gathered on a bed behind them, was a trio of three more house-elves, glints of mischief visible in their eyes.

--------------

*iii.*

A few days later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting together at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, watching the staff table, waiting for something to happen.

And happen it did. Almost a minute exactly after Dolores Umbridge had first taken a bite of her steak diane, she began to wobble precariously to one side.

"Dolores, are you alright?" Professor McGonagall asked the witch next to her, loud enough so the entire hall could hear her, "You look tired, you should go back to your quarters and take a rest."

"Yes...yes, I'll do that..." the pink-cardigan-wearing witch mumbled, unsteadily standing up from her seat and slowly stumbling towards the Great Hall's doors.

"The Hypnotic Suggestion Potion looks like it's been successfully delivered." Harry quietly informed Ron and Hermione with a smirk.

Standing up, he gave an exaggerated yawn, "Oh, my. I am also feeling strange. I might go for a walk, to clear my head, who's with me?"

Ron and Hermione shared a grin as they stood up, shortly followed by a handful of other Gryffindors; as they left the Hall en-masse, Harry could swear he saw Professor McGonagall wink at him.

-=-

Shed of excess Gryffindors, the party of Harry, Ron, Hermione and Dobby (plus three more) gathered at the door to Umbridge's office.

"Go." Harry whispered. Dobby nodded and wrapped a blue blanket around himself like a robe before slipping into the office, while the other three listened at the door.

"Miss Umbridge, miss...oh dear." Dobby's voice sounded, as rehearsed.

"Who is it?" Umbridge's groggy voice responded.

"I is being Professor Flitwick, ma'am. I be coming to ask you if you needed any help with anything. Let me take your cardigan for you?"

"That's some potion." Ron whispered in awe to Hermione, who shushed him as Umbridge's voice sounded, "Oh, much appreciated Filius..."

"You're welcome, Dolores, I shan't bother you again tonight..."

A few seconds later, Dobby exited out the door and pumped his fist in victory, clutching the cardigan that served as his ticket to freedom.

-=-

"Your turn, Harry." Hermione whispered, and Harry nodded before putting on a bald wig and slipping into the room with a piece of parchment in his hand.

"Miss Umbridge? Professor?" Harry wheedled in his best nasally voice, "It's old Filch, I hate to bother you now but the twins are acting up, I just need a form..."

"The Approval for Whipping is over there, Argus, already signed," a sleepy Umbridge mumbled from her pillow.

Harry turned and stared, revolted, at the incriminating form on the pink toad's desk, before he turned back to the bed, "Ah, no, this is another one, Approval for...Branding. Could you quickly sign it, just now?"

Umbridge grumbled, but raised her head and slid out of bed, glancing only briefly at Harry with her potion-glazed eyes before taking the parchment in his hand and signing it with a wobbly flick of her quill.

"And, er, this one too, to requisition some new shackles..." Harry noted with distaste how quickly she signed that one, "And one for cages...uh, pokers...cactus..."

-=-

"/Cactus?/" Ron breathed.

"It's the first thing that came to mind!" Harry defended.

Ron shrugged, before he slipped on a formal-looking blazer, "Well, it's my turn, wish me luck."

The rest of the group nodded as Ron used a spell to style his messy hair before stepping into Umbridge's chambers.

"Excuse me, miss Umbridge? Undersecretary? It's me, Percy Weasley...I hate to disturb you now, but there's a few m-I mean, just a couple of forms that need to be signed before the deadline..."

-=-

"Alright, she's definitely asleep now." Ron whispered to the party as he stepped back out the door, "Have we got everything done?"

Hermione flipped through the rolls of parchment she was holding, "Dobby freed, contract signed to not harm anyone at Hogwarts, contract requiring disclosure of anything on demand, sworn servitude to Dobby the elf..."

She quickly glanced at the proud-looking Dobby, "You're evil, by the way," before she continued, "...pending release at Dobby's discretion, waived right to own property, waived right to free speech, waived right to travel..."

Hermione continued down the list, starting to look queasy as she did, before she folded them up, "I can't believe I came up with these, what was I thinking?! But yes, in a nutshell, Umbridge is now Dobby's slave instead of vice-versa and she's not allowed to tell anyone about it."

Harry smiled evilly, before giving the nod to the other three house-elves in the group, who took it as a sign to slip into Dolores Umbridge's office and start removing things.

*iv.*

The day after, in the Gryffindor common room, Hermione shook her head, "I'm a horrible person. We're going to get caught, I know it."

Harry opened his mouth to reassure her, then twisted around as a pop heralded the arrival of Dobby, who (this time) was smiling widely, "Would Harry and friends like to hear about Dobby's first day as owner of Umbridge?"

Everyone in the common room leaned in to listen. Dobby grinned mischievously, "Well, to start, Dobby wanted to give Umbridge work when she woke up, so Dobby let off a few Dungbombs...maaaybe a few dozen in her room."

-=-

"And then, after Miss Umbridge refused to clean up the mess, her face went like this-" Dobby made a scrunched-up, bug-eyed face, "-and she jumped this high into the air!"

Hermione blushed bright red and hid her face in her hands, causing everyone to look at her, "I put a Slapping Jinx in one of her contracts to punish misbehavior," she mumbled, "I put it in a mean place."

-=-

"...And when she went to the Floo and tried to tell Minister Fudgey," (here Ron snorted), "I heard lots and lots of very bad words, and then her bottom went bright red again..."

Everyone looked at Hermione again, some amazed, some worried and disturbed. "I may have added a jinx like the one on the DA contract if she tried to tell anyone without permission," she admitted, "Except, well, this one has the effect of coprolalia..."

"What does coprolalia mean?" Harry stage whispered to one of the twins.

"It means you swear and insult people. A lot." Fred stage whispered back, "We tried to develop a line of Potty-Mouth Pasties once, but they weren't that popular."

-=-

"And then Professor Flitwick walked in, and he asked why Umbridge's room was bare and where Miss Umbridge's clothes were, and she said..."

Here, Dobby blushed a bit, "Dobby shouldn't repeat it, it was very naughty. But Dobby told Professor Flitwick that Umbridge always secretly wanted to be a house-elf, and just didn't like being disturbed, and she put me in charge of doing Hogwarts things."

Harry raised an eyebrow, "Flitwick didn't believe that, did he?"

Dobby's jaw wiggled, "Yes he did!" he said cheerfully, "And, he told me afterwards how to get into Professor Dumblydore's office! So now Dobby is Headmaster!"

Hermione blinked, "But it doesn't work that way, Dobby. In the event the current Headmaster or Headmistress is indisposed, the Deputy Head takes on their position until a new Head is elected by the Board of Governors..."

But Dobby just blinked and shrugged, "But who is going to be telling the Board?"

Quick explanation: A fair while back, a couple of months ago now, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/57iznl/lf_storyoneshot_with_a_houseelf_owning_a_wizard/][I posted a request]] for stories in which a house-elf owns a witch or wizard, using 0800 Rent-A-Hero as a partial example.

Because there didn't seem to be any fics of the type (and now I think of it, I'm going to post a more general request for role-reversal fanfics later), I elected to post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/58s2iv/the_one_where_dobby_acquires_ownership_of_harry/][a prompt with as many 'setup' details as possible]], in the hopes of inspiring someone to write more fanfic with this plot.

Since it's been over a month and I haven't heard of anyone writing such a story (I posted yet another request for the same thing a little while ago with little in the way of results, sorry Ch1pp), I elected to work on one of the ideas I came up with earlier and try and build it up into a workable concept.
