If you were a witch/wizard, what memes can you come up with for your fellow sorcerers to laugh at?

Rules:

1. The meme has to have a concept that is commonly known throughout the Wizarding World. Simply put, no memes about "Voldemort having no nose" or "Draco screaming Pottah!". It has to be something your wizard friends can understand.
2. No googling "Harry Potter memes", it has to be original.
3. Canon compliant. No fanon lore like magical cores or something like that.
4. No memes about Harry Potter's adventures throughout the books UNLESS you were a student/teacher who was unfortunate enough to be there when Hogwarts went to shit during Harry's years there.
5. No memes that reference the Muggle world or any object, invention, and idea that was conceived by Muggles, for Muggles. (For this challenge, memes doesn't count to this rule).

** For rule 5, what if you're a muggleborn and you're referencing stuff purebloods don't know?

** So memes about wizards, for wizards.

That's such a cool world-building exercise! Great challenge OP.

​

I remember this section from OotP, when Hermione is describing how the Prophet is talking about Harry:

“I'm not talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like you're a standing joke....if some far-fetched story appears they say something like ‘a tale worthy of Harry Potter' and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it's ‘let's hope he hasn't got a scar on his forehead or we'll be asked to worship him next ---'”

Not the kindest thing but it seems like the Prophet turned Harry into a meme to mock him.

You know how later, at the end of that book, after the DOM battle, Fudge gives an interview and calls Voldemort "Lord...Thingy"? Over time "thingy" comes to symbolize the cowardice of Fudge's administration. Now, if someone wants to imply that the person they're talking about is a spineless coward, they put thingy in their name. 'Cornelius "thingy" Fudge. ' '

'Coach Rogers, what are your thoughts about the Cannons suffering three straight losses?' 'My thoughts are that our players fly like a bunch of thingies, next question.'

​

Fred and George would probably be the funniest meme curators around. You can't tell me the U-NO-POO rhyme from HBP wasn't being secretly quoted for weeks by the young crowd. I can imagine people randomly whispering "the constipation sensation that's gripping the nation" to each other in the most inappropriate situations.

​

Dumbledore is arguably the most famous, recognizable wizard of his time. He had to have inspired a few memes. Twinkle twinkle Dumble Eyes, Full of mirth and barefaced lies. etc. , etc.

Any long-tenured Hogwarts teacher would eventually become a meme. "Like McGonagall coughing up a hairball" becomes an idiom for some time, for example.
