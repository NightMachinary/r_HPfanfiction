Like in The Marriage Stone, she creates a whole other population of magical people who are not as strong as wizards, but retain a much smaller degree of magic. They function within their own society and interact with the Ministry and others. I know I've read a few other stories where it's revealed that Hogwarts is really a school for the elite and strongest, and that there exist other schools in England for those who can't afford Hogwarts or are not magically strong enough.

I find this idea really quite interesting! Any recs? (preferably not romance-oriented, I like my gen fics!)

*** Well it's tuition free, so the fund goes toward supplies and such. Still stands though, there's no economic reason I can think of why Hogwarts wouldn't be an option. Unless the other schools use notebooks, because actual parchment is animal skins and I don't think that'd actually be cheap.

*** Yeah, I remember that! Some authors turned it into you have to have a certain magical strength to qualify to get the financial aid.

***** I honestly don't...I know I read these fics 3+ years ago, but it's been so long, that's why I'm trying to find them.

If I had to guess though, you'd probably find them among Dark fics, where it's AU with Voldemort ruling, or probably some Super!Harry fics. Gah, I wish I could remember.

** "To Shape and Change" by Blueowl features some AU stuff like this. Harry is a "slumbering Mage," Albus and Nicholas F. are warlock/sorceror I think? Voldemort is described as a "Mage." All of these are meant to show a distinction in power levels of sorts. It does deal with magical core bs, but with what you are looking for it shouldn't be a huge deal. Not everyone's cup of tea, but was one of the first fics I read.

Don't know how to link oops. Hope you find it anyway.
