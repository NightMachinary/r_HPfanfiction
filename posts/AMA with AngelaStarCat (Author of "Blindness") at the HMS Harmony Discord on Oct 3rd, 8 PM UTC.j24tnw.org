** Blindness is one of the first hp fics I read and it's still memorable after all this time. I definitely like the first half more than the second half, but it still has one of the best world building and handling of the Hallows I've ever seen.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
