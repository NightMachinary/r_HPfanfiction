The backstories and characters remain the same. But the twist comes when Harry meets Draco for the first time in The Sorcerer's Stone. Draco offers a handshake and asks Harry to be friends with him nad join the dark side. Harry agrees to do so, and GRRM takes over the rest of the saga.


** No he should not. He should finish his own damn books before doing anything. Then he should leave his dark, gritty and depressing worldview out of my happy magic funtimes

** I've read this fanfiction already. It really wasn't that good.

*** Also, Darco was never a real threat (besides the one time where he nearly killed Harry, Ron and Slughorn by accident). If you want a competent dark Harry, have him raised by Bellatrix Lestrage (I don't see Riddle doing the parenting himself).

** GRRM is notoriously hostile to fanfiction (despite that fanfiction is the only way his own series is going to ever finish). This would be a great way to shut down the fandom and leave us instead with an unfinished, unsatisfying series.

** As already pointed out, George Read and Review Martin should focus on finishing his work before he dies not starting up new and already well established stuff that has a hundred quantillionmegazillion fanfictions on the matter already.

** I'm pretty sure Gurm thinks fanfiction is a waste of time and effort, and I'm also pretty sure he doesn't like Rowling or Harry Potter, due to some kerfuffle that happened at the Hugo Awards years ago. So, it's unlikely.

** He 'should' write this? GRRM has no obligation to write a fanfic based on what you wish would happen, nevermind that he probably won't.
