** Not counting Dumbledore, since he's not a classroom teacher.

Crouch!Moody, McGonagall, Lupin/Slughorn, Snape, Hagrid, Lockhart, Trelawney, Umbridge, Carrows.

Can't really remember what Quirrell was like as a teacher, so I won't count him either.

I put Crouch!Moody first based on his actual teaching ability, his â€˜Moody' personality and the usefulness of his subject, not the fact that he was a traitor.

******* You do realise you're saying it's better to teach nazi propaganda and how to torture people as well as desensitising them from doing it than teaching nothing, don't you? You realise how that's worse?

******** Let me clarify: I am not making a political statment, especially about a fictional world whose politics don't mean anything to me, I honestly wouldn't waste my time doing something as pointless as that.

The question was how do I rate them as teachers. To be a good teacher (in my opinion), one must actually teach something. I am not arguing the morality of their curriculum, but rather their effectiveness at communicating it, which is why they rank where they do.

To be honest, idk why you are making such a big deal out of this. It is just a post about a fictional thing, magic is not real, neither are the Carrows. The propaganda and hatred that they promote is fiction as well.

You clearly have a passion for social justice, perhaps you could channel it towards more productive things than arguing with me on this form. There are many real world issues that are much more pressing than fictional classism (for example real classism,) maybe you should direct your energies in such a direction instead.

******** They are saying good as in effective, not good as in morally righteous. You can be an effective teacher of Nazi ideals, but not a morally righteous teacher of nazi ideals.

** I don't know about others but Dumbledore was a good teacher, obviously he wasn't a good headmaster though. Most of his acts we dislike were his duties as headmaster. As a teacher, he was supposed to be best and students adored him (not sure but the vibe I got from Fantastic beasts and parts of HP series).

Since OP asked for teacher, so I'll put dumbledore at top, Minerva at second and so on.

** This is my ranks in terms of not actively killing or endangering students:

Trelawny: She's solid. She never tried to murder anyone or neglected any students to the point that their health was negatively affected.

Hagrid: Never knowingly endangered students. Has questionable views on what animals are safe for kids to interact with but as far as we know the hippogriff scratch was the worst incident and Draco was warned repeatedly not to be a butthole to the animal. Actually really good at teaching about the creatures themselves.

McGonagall: She is a super cool lady and great teacher. I put her below Hagrid and Trelawney because she made Neville wait outside the Gryffindor common room alone in the hallway when freaking Sirius Black had gotten into the castle twice and sliced Gryffindor stuff up both times. Like, if he was a real serial killer Neville could have really be dead. That was her one not cool moment though.

Snape: Okay it was super hard figuring out where to put him because 1. he's a giant asshole to kids. But 2. he literally saves their lives all the time. Like Harry's alone several times. I hate to think how many students would have been murdered during book 7 if he wasn't there to run interference on the Carrows.

Dumbledore: He's hard to place on the list, so I just stuck him here. He was actively trying to protect the students. Had lots of questionable judgement in staff and actions though. Like, LOTS. But he was never trying to hurt or kill anyone, and he did keep a lot of people alive with his presence deterring evil shenanigans.

Slughorn: Neglected less talented students in favor of grooming others to increase his own wealth/status. Kinda creepy. But, he never tried to hurt anyone. The main reason I put him down here is because he never managed to remember Ron's name and wasn't able to act appropriately to save Ron when Ron was poisoned, despite being a supposed potions master.

Lupin: Kept Sirius' animagus status secret from the ministry and Dumbledore, despite Sirius successfully infiltrating the school twice and slashing up Ron's bed with a knife in what was believed to be an attempt on Harry's life. Also failed to disclose the secret tunnels to the shrieking shack and Hogsmeade. I mean, he's a cool guy and I like him but as far as teachers go that wasn't okay.

Lockhart: Tried to erase students' brains and was going to leave one to die, but didn't actively put them in that situation. Basically was a benevolent narcissist that got nasty when backed into a corner.

Umbridge: Used torture and crap on students. Horrible person. The only reason she's not lower on the list is she did not openly try to murder a student.

Carrows: Used torture on students regularly and taught students to torture each other, with unforgivable curses. Unclear whether they actually killed any students.

Quirrel: Tried to murder students and also tried to resurrect Voldemort. Not cool

Moody/Crouch: Actually DID murder a student and resurrected Voldemort. Super not cool.
