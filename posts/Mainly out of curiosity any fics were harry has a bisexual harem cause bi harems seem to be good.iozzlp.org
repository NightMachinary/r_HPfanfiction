** Vanteeria Domestica by andrea_readwolf on AO3 involves a bisexual harem that, in my opinion, is very artistically done for all of the pairings. You may disagree with me on that, though.

** I think it's more polyamory than harem but there is a lot of bisexual people on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25450864/chapters/61728700][Covet]], linkao3(25450864).

#+begin_quote
  It turns out that, when various people begin asking Harry for legal and magical shelter, he has the power to marry them all as per an ancient Ministry law that says the conqueror of a Dark Lord can have multiple spouses. Harry knows the marriages are in name only, and it's not like they require sex, just a magical oath. He thinks he's doing very well at resisting temptation, not realizing what a temptation he is himself.
