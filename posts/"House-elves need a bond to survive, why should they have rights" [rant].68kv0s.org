It usually goes something like this: "But Hermione, didn't you know? House-elves need a bond to a wizard or they will die!!!" Hermione then breaks out in tears and abandons SPEW forever and vows to never question the world of magic and their sacred and super smart traditions ever again.

I'll probably blow an aneurysm if I have to read one more story with that insane troll-logic.

The idea that the house-elves need such a bond to a wizard or witch in order to survive seems to have become head-canon for a large amount of fanfic authors and I can deal with that (even though I don't see any good reason why any of that would be true). The conclusion that usually follows from that (that there's no need to do anything about their situation) is extremely offensive to me.

*If* it in fact were true, then there's an even bigger need to protect them from being exploited and mistreated. Even if it were true, there's no reason they need to be slaves (a house-elf can serve a wizard if they want anyway without institutionalized slavery) and there's no reason they shouldn't have any legal recourse or opportunities for education or personal freedom or anything that a clearly sentient and feeling person deserves. They should probably get a minimum wage, because it reduces their dependence on a single family and allows them to escape their circumstances or get help if they need it.

Honestly, anyone who thinks that this "bond" is a good reason for Hermione to abandon her cause seems a little fucked in the head to me: "Well if they have no other options I guess it's perfectly fine to exploit their biology and treat them like shite"... yeah, right.

If you don't want to deal with the whole house-elf rights business in your fic fine, I understand, but please try to find a reason why it's not necessary that doesn't make you look like a crazy sociopath. Probably better to just ignore it.

Should I ever get more than a few pages into writing my own story I'll have Hermione be confronted with that viewpoint just to tell them off. Surely she'd be *more* angry, not *less*. Also wouldn't it be interesting if it turns out that it's just pure-blood propaganda in order to perpetuate the enslavement?


** I feel like if there is one thing we know about Hermione, it's that she fucking loves books. If this girl gets a bug in her ear about something, the first thing she wants to do is read every book that there is on the subject.

So if there is in fact a bond that is required for House Elf survival; either there are no books in Hogwarts' library that cover this topic, Hermione just decided she didn't give a shit about House Elf deaths- freeeedom is more important, Hermione didn't bother researching House Elfs, or that there is no bond.

Of those, I think only 1 and 4 are remotely likely. If 1 is the correct option, I think Hermione would have somehow gotten her grubby little paws on a book about House Elfs. And/Or, someone in canon would have made the argument that they need a bond to survive, rather than the much weaker argument that they like being enslaved.

Now let's look at Dobby. He thrived for four years as a free elf. So either he was secretly bonded to Harry without Harry's knowledge, or there is no bond.

If the author bothers to address this it is usually done by saying that Dobby is secretly bonded to Harry and that Winky is slowly dying.

** I think more people need to examine the ethics of presenting the idea of everyone, including the protagonist of a story - who more often than not is supposed to be a sympathetic character for the reader to relate to, or at least understand their perspective - being okay with magically-enforced institutionalised slavery.

If you replaced "House-Elf" with "Black Person" in these fanon ideas and had all the characters behave the same way, readers would be horrified.

It really bothers me that people try to effectively justify slavery, rather than have their characters admit that the whole thing's fucked, and that at the very least House-Elves should have something akin to human rights and protection under the law.

People introduce random fanon concepts all the damn time, but this one is without doubt one of the most irritating, being a choice made - more often than not, I find - for the convenience of heading off the S.P.E.W. subplot and getting a dig in at Hermione (similar to all those times that various indy!Harrys inevitably say "don't believe everything you read in books" to her when they meet on the Express).

Although hopefully authors who deploy this trope aren't racists in real life or believe in the concept of slavery, their willingness to paint it as a good thing in fanfiction and then /defend/ that perspective when they get called out on the implication of their statements is unnerving.

Like, didn't everyone get upset at that one guy who repeatedly tried to justify using rape in his stories? Ethically, how is this different?

*** It'd make more sense if this whole idea of needing a bond cost the wizard something. Like, the reason you don't have a house elf as a weak wizard is you would feel the drain on your magic from it more significantly. Hogwarts gets around this by having the elves live off the ambient magic there.

Then Hermione could still fight for basic rights, but pay would still be anathema to the house elves, as they are already paid in magic. This is my headcannon for what it's worth.

Ethically, it isn't different. I'd prefer the authors that don't want to deal with spew just leave it out. I'd prefer it skipped over than trod into the ground with bad ethical logic.

**** Although you're of course entitled to your own headcanon, the issue for me with this trope isn't the unfairness of the House-Elves' situation compared to their masters, but the very fact that authors make a House-Elf's enslavement necessary for their survival.

Indeed, if one were to apply historical slavery to your position, they could simply replace a 'drain on a wizard's magic' with the 'economic costs of housing and feeding actual slaves', as what many slavery apologists used to defend themselves in the Nineteenth Century, and you'd be right back to square one.

You're allowed to construct whatever headcanon you want, in the end, but attempting to make the issue "fairer" whilst failing to address the key moral and ethical issues at hand does you no favours.

On another note, I agree completely that authors should just avoid it if it's not relevant to the story. Any attempt to elucidate matters without condemning the institution of slavery in the Potterverse just ends up with people digging themselves into holes.

Hermione isn't either, which is the main underlying issue of muggleborns in Harry Potter in general. She'd have to gradually change it to them gaining basic rights, followed by fair compensation. Starting with fair compensation seems silly when it's legal to just behead your house elf and mount it on your wall.

Your ideas about a bond having a detrimental effect on the wizard or the gradual ruling for the fair treatment of House-Elves, I'm trying to say, don't address the actual issue at hand - that authors are finding a way to /justify the enslavement of House-Elves/, rather than actually consider that it is exactly what it says on the tin: slavery.

How do so many people manage to find so many things /extremely offensive/ and to generate so much rightful indignation?

#+begin_quote
  It usually goes something like this: "But Hermione, didn't you know? House-elves need a bond to a wizard or they will die!!!" Hermione then breaks out in tears and abandons SPEW forever and vows to never question the world of magic and their sacred and super smart traditions ever again.
#+end_quote

Also, this is not true. Hermione usually has three problems with the house elf “slavery”. 1) --- that they are being bonded to magicals 2) --- that they are being given no money for their work 3) --- that they are treated poorly by their owners.

The /“House-elves need a bond to a wizard or they will die-multiple-exclamation-points”/ is a counter-argument to Hermione's first issue.

The counter-argument to the second issue usually doesn't have much to do with the phenomenon of bonding. What purebloods argue is that “there's no need to do anything about their situation” because /the elves themselves don't want their situation to be changed./ They enjoy working for wizards --- for free --- and feel extremely uncomfortable when they have to deal with an “anomalous” elf like Dobby.

Now, is Hermione free to try to change the status quo and convince the house elves to stand up for their rights? By all means, she is. What she /can't/ do, however --- if she doesn't want to look like an annoying door-to-door cult representative --- is try to shoehorn people into helping her just because she holds the assumption that her moral judgement on this matter is the only objectively valid one.

Would it have been nice if magicals treated their house elves more decently? It would've, sure. It would also be nice if werewolves had more rights, if so many magical intelligent species weren't labeled as magical beasts, and if the magicals negotiated some sort of simbiotic relationship with no-majs to use each other's capabilities for fixing otherwise unsolvable problems.

Yet Hermione gets a tunnel vision fixation on the house elf issue, for some reason, and starts annoying random people --- who are not obligated to help her in any manner whatsoever --- which just alienates potential allies and makes them want to avoid her in future.

Are you talking about canon right now? What does the "usually" refer to? There's no "bond" in canon, so Hermione isn't against it. And if there were such a bond Hermione would be insane to be against it because Elves require it to be alive. Not sure where you are going with this line of argument.

It would've helped if you've re-read my original comment before responding --- I feel like you haven't paid enough attention to understanding what I was trying to say before proceeding to compose your reply.

I'm not saying that she remains against the bonds no matter what. I'm saying that the necessity for bonds gets mentioned to her as a counter-argument only against her first issue --- when she starts criticizing how wizards are bonding house elves to them. The second and the third issues are a separate matter, and the bond counter-argument is not being used against those issues (other arguments are).

#+begin_quote
  What's your point?
#+end_quote

I am not saying that house elves should be glad with their current situation, or that their issue should be ignored just because there are much worse things happening out there.

My point is that there's a great deal of things that are wrong with the wizarding society of Magical Britain, and as the reaction of Hogwarts students (in canon) indicated, almost nobody would've cared to prioritise the house elf right issue over everything else that needs fixing.

If your story's Hermione thinks house elves should be considered as full-scale citizens of Magical Britain, that's fine. If, however, the rest of the Magical Britain's population doesn't agree with her and wants to prioritize fixing a long list of other problems first that they find to be more important, then Hermione is out of luck --- they are not /obliged/ to help her in fixing something that they find to be relatively unimportant. And they are not /obliged/ to pay Hermione any attention when their lack of reaction “offends” her.

Another thing is that you're assuming the same population would automatically agree to grant the house elves the status of full-scale citizens, which I also think is quite unrealistic to happen; and a completely separate subject for debate.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione clearly can't address every bad thing in the world at once and just because she decides to address one of those doesn't mean the others don't matter or that she's obligated to address those too.
#+end_quote

Yet another misunderstanding: I'm not expecting her to address all those problems. I'm saying that /nobody else/ is obliged to pay her house elf campaign any attention --- especially when they have so many other things to deal with, and when she's getting in their faces with her moral superiority delusion. If she has decided to focus on the house elf problem first --- she's free to try fixing it either by herself or with the help of people who share her opinions on the importance of this issue. /Not go and try forcing people into abandoning their own problems and fixing it for her./

p.s. If your next response proves to be as rushed and poorly thought-out as the last one was, I'm afraid I'll lose interest in continuing this discussion with you.

She never stops to ask herself why the Hogwarts elves were gradually becoming terrified of her. She wanted to give them more rights without asking them what they themselves thought their rights should be like. She never tries to research what kind of creatures they truly are. Maybe most of them don't need money because their brains are wired in a way to directly reward them for doing work for wizards, similar to the lower castes in Brave New World. Maybe they do not have the same type of intelligence that humans or even centaurs have, so intuitive projection would not work for understanding their patterns of thought. I am not saying these were what was definitely the case in canon, but she never investigates to learn /what/ was. She just /assumes/, and jumps right to the part of politicking and annoying others.

Well, that's partially the point --- we (and she) can't know if she was right or not because she did not do her research into house elf psychology (only into their history in the wizarding society).

True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since, firstly to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.

and partially against Deathcrow's Hermione-to-be. A story writer (or a story's character) does not need to make excuses for not prioritizing the house elf issue above others to not “look like a crazy sociopath”.

#+begin_quote
  In any case Hermione's criticism of House-Elf treatment is ultimatetly supported in the text (Harry and Dumbledore both supported the issue).
#+end_quote

Three problems with this argument, IMO. 1) Treatment of specific house elves (Dobby, Winky, etc) is one issue [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/68kv0s/houseelves_need_a_bond_to_survive_why_should_they/dgz9orz/][(problem #3 mentioned here),]] while wanting to completely revamp the existing wizard-elf relationship is another. 2) I wouldn't trust the judgement of either of these two characters on this issue, even though for different reasons. 3) This is both an appeal to public opinion and an appeal to authority. Her criticism can be valid because [insert logical reasoning], not because [so and so believe it is valid].

--------------

p.s. Just to try clarifying my position on this: I think that the #2 issue [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/68kv0s/houseelves_need_a_bond_to_survive_why_should_they/dgz9orz/][(link)]] has not been proven in canon to be a legitimate problem (it can be, or it can not --- we don't have enough information to judge), while #3 issue /is/ a legitimate problem but not a severe enough one to redirect resources from fixing more important ones first.

Another similar scene is her interaction with the kitchen elves during which she again demonstrates that she has no idea what principles the house elves value, what worldview do they have, and what should or should not be a proper way of warming them up to the idea of self-freedom and paid labour.

      If she had thought this would cheer Winky up, she was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.

      “Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!” she squeaked. “Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!”

      “Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly. “But -- Winky, come on! It's Mr Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn't do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you --”

      But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn't hear a word, and screeched, “You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr Crouch! Mr Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!”

Instead she just keeps blindly pushing ahead. With no regard to how effective her adopted tactics really are and no attempts to update her hypothesis about house elves based on the empirical data that her very interactions with these creatures are giving her.

  Yet Hermione gets a tunnel vision fixation on the *black slave* issue, for some reason, and starts annoying random people --- who are not obligated to help her in any manner whatsoever --- which just alienates potential allies and makes them want to avoid her in future.
#+end_quote

Are we morally obligated to help if /we personally/ enslave and /torture/ sentient and sapient race / species?

I think yes. A decent being should always protect another sapient being if possible. It agree that it is harder and more grey in the modern world, were you often can't see the cause and effect (Buying the meat in the supermarket means that people in Africa have less to eat), but the cause in this case is clear:

Wizards in the UK enslave house-elves and order them to punish and hurt themselves, and abuse them. A prime example is Dobby and Winky. Hermione directly and obviously profits from the work of (tortured) slaves without being able to give back.

And look at how house-eleves are actually treated:

#+begin_quote
  That Mr Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he's got her bewitched so she can't even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn't anyone do something about it?

That was how Winky was treated. But hey, "House-Elves like it!" Let's completely dismiss their slavery, because Hermione 'annoying' people is bad. Also, it 'alienates allies'. Hermione is fifteen during the SPEW-plot. I sure as shit didn't think in "allies and foes" during that time. She is a student first, fighting for a single cause, not a politician.

And if you don't have a cause (for example "Betterment of the rights for everyone, even not yourself") than what do you need allies for? The only thing I have is 'being selfish'.

#+end_quote

Holy fuck, have you looked at a definition of Slavery before making such an absurd point?

#+begin_quote
  Slavery is, in the strictest sense of the term, any system in which principles of property law are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals, as a de jure form of property.[1] A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration. Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalised, de jure slavery. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is de facto forced to work against his or her will. Scholars also use the more generic terms such as unfree labour or forced labour, to refer to such situations.[2] However -- and especially under slavery in broader senses of the word -- slaves may have some rights and/or protections, according to laws and/or customs.
#+end_quote

We don't know specifics, but Dobby is "the Malfoy's" house-elf, strongly implying ownership. But what is clear:

#+begin_quote
  A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration.
#+end_quote

That certainly fits. The rest of the quote makes clear that Dobby was a slave in every sense of the word.

2) That is why I used the term "sapient being". 2.1) is a point, but I pointed out Dobby as a /clear/ example of a slave being /unwilling/ to work for their master, not liking their punishment, and wishing for a change of status.

#+begin_quote

That's not what Hermione is trying to do? Since someone else pointed out her plan for SPEW I won't repeat them here.

But, more importantly: How is /not/ giving them the right to /chose/ to be free not a contradiction of this argument in itself? That directly takes away their right to make decisions. Hermione's goal isn't to take away their right to work for wizards, but to give elves the ability to refuse to work. She doesn't want to take away anything.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione has the same problem your current argument has --- she has the uncompromising opinion that not only her stance on the house elf issue the only valid one, but also that it entitles her to get into other people's space even if they do not share it with her.
#+end_quote

No, at multiple points in my argument I said "I think" or something similar, implying opinion. You just imply that I presented my opinion as fact. You can disagree that we need to protect another species for example.

Also, I think Hermione is open for multiple sides of the argument, however every counter-argument that she hears ("They like it") has been

- made exactly the same for black slavery
- easily disproved, by stuff Hermione saw /with her own eyes/ (Winky, Dobby)

Why would she change her opinion if no one really gives her a reason to change it? If you have a different opinion, argue for it.

#+begin_quote

Of course! But she's fourteen, give her some slack. In the world of Harry Potter Dumbledore let two students being almost killed, because he didn't want Draco Malfoy to be killed. Minister Fudge thought it was an okay strategy to present a fourteen / fifteen year old as nutter because he didn't want to accept some truths. Umbrige thought it was a good idea to send two dementors after a schoolboy. People make mistakes, Hermione isn't perfect. She was to agressive, the name was stupid, and selling buttons wasn't the right way to approach this issue. Quite frankly, when I read GoF the first few times, I found her incredibly annoying.

But all of that doesn't mean that her underlying cause is wrong, or even that 'bonds' would change anything about most things about her argument. Also, what she has seen with her own eyes is that two house-elves are paid by Hogwarts and surviving, and one of them is thoroughly enjoying it, the other has been a mess with and without work.

6) I even acknowledged your counter-point before you made it. I am aware that simply by living in the western world I support the system, but I'm also arguing that in the HP-verse it's way more direct.

****** My reasoning is that nomajical definition of slavery may (or may not!) be inapplicable to house elves because they are not humans. I keep writing the same thing again and again and people keep ignoring this important detail, for some reason.

Let's try it like this: let's write down a list of some possible outcomes that ff!Hermione's research can reveal about house elves' nature:

1) on the “hardware level” house elves are very similar to humans, but their culture has been turned into such that they see being free house servants for magicals as their purpose of life

2) on the “hardware level” house elves are fundamentally different from humans, their brains literally reward them for acting as servants to humans and for nothing else.

3) the magical nature of house elves is such that if they agree to work for a wizard, they will bond to him or his family, which will form a master-servant relationship (e.g. Malfoys-Dobby) and make the elf unable to leave the relationship on their own.

4) house elves are just another magical species with their own unique magic, the families control their house elves through customised magical contracts.

5) house elves are magically advanced golems who pass the turing test.

Now consider 5 parallel universes, in each of which the Hermione of that world comes to that specific conclusion. Do you think the nomajic defintion of slavery applies to house elves from universe 1? What about universe 2, 3? 5? What if it's such a universe that each defining subpoint for nomajic concept of slavery is negated in its own way? That's what my argument is partially about: that Hermione has to first find out what exactly is the nature of house elves, to be able to determine whether a) they're not being slaves b) their culture has been hijacked (exploitation, but at the current state of affairs a mostly willing one) c) defining them as slaves would be pretty accurate, and so on.

If she finds out that it's literally in their nature to serve humans, then all that can be done is to gradually implement laws that would make the owners of house elves to take good care of them.

If it's b), Hermione and Co could gradually change their culture, until there comes a generation of house elves in which the majority thinks like Dobby, of themselves as of free creatures.

If it's c), then it's outright slavery, and so on.

But she wouldn't know how to proceed without first finding out how exactly do house elves tick --- and that is the point I am trying to make. Going with a nomaj's knee-jerk reaction of “it's slavery” without doing all the proper research first is just being ignorant /and/ unwilling to learn.

#+end_quote

Anecdotal evidence is not enough for disproving this. She'd have to contact and check up on other households with house elves (or observe in some other manner) in order to get an accurate answer. Right now all she knows is that 1 elf was likely being kept in slavery (Dobby), 1 elf was mistreated by owners (Winky), many elves willingly agree serving humans for free (Hogwarts elves).

#+begin_quote

Has she ever tried to ask if the elves themselves want these things? In case of the wages, the Hogwarts elves have plainly stated that they don't want to work for money, but she didn't care about what they had to say. In case of the other two things, I don't think I remember her ever asking anything like that to a group of h. elves.

#+begin_quote

You can't /force/ someone to have a right, because then you make it into an obligation. All you can do is ensure that whoever wants that right, will be able to make use of it. Dobby wants to be free --- that's one case. But if Hogwarts' elves /don't/ want that freedom, and you are trying to forcefully give it to them --- through deception, for instance --- then /you/ are being the one who is interpose on their will. I think a suiting analogy would be the real-world right to live \ right to die issue. If you make someone live even if they don't want to, you're making that right into an obligation for them.

However, five would be the only possibility that I'd treat differently.

If it is three, I do not see why the life should be dictated by such a magical bond. If you make it a law (normal, wizard) law that you have to release a house-elf when he - I dunno - says "<Elf> is drowning in tomato ketchup" you have a convenient way to work arount this issue.

Yes, in this case it is. The existence of multiple house-elves that were horribly treated around the main canon characters (Dobby, Winky and even Kreacher!) is a clear indication that there is something systematically wrong.

We do not have many examples of elves that are happy. But we have a Dobby that breaks out in tears when somebody offers him the mildest form of decency.

Yes, because in my opinion my position *is* superior (unless you convince me otherwise), or why would even I bother arguing for it? "Moral high ground" does exist. There are things that are not gray, but black and white (or at least dark and light).

Philosophers since thousands of years have tried to define what moral behavior is, and the ways they went to 'okay' slavery are awfully weak compared to the rest of their arguments about the make-up of the world.

And you know what? So are your arguments for it. I bring counter-examples directly from canon, I extrapolate based on what's written in canon, but all you give are some bullshit what-if scenarios - that in the end don't fucking matter, because they are not even slightly hinted at in canon, and need to be rather convoluted. If four out of the five points in your post would be true Hermione's actions are still way better than of the people abusing the house-elves, and if 5) was true that it wouldn't even matter.\\
So *worst case* Hermione is wasting her time and annoying some students. Bo-fucking-hoo!

I'm not sure how I can continue to argue here anymore, I'm out of arguments now. The ones I made still stand, and I don't think you've convinced me that a single one is outshined by "But they like it" or "But they might possibly need it" or "She should have read on it" (How do you know she hasn't? It's more probable than the opposite), so I stand by what I said.

I only want a factual discussion, and that was the whole point of me correcting this.

Yes, I fucking have. I have donated to multiple causes that I find important. I'm a student at a university, so I'm not exactly well off, however I regularly donate to:

- The German Red Cross, as they do a lot of good projects for the community
- Human Rights organizations (however, I've yet to find one that I'd trust completely, so different ones)
- The German Protestant Church (Even though I don't believe in God), I have talked to the pastor (?) a bit about how their money is spent, and it is mostly well-spent imo. They even do human-rights projects.
- Netzpolitik.org to defend my rights in the internet, a medium I use daily.

Three of the things I donate to don't do anything for me. I think this is a fair balance.

I am not denying neither of those things. I am saying that in both cases she should've /asked/ the elves first if they wanted to assign a representative, or to start receiving wages. /Before/ assigning these specific changes as the long-terms goals of her self-declared pro-house-elf club. It's like if someone found a reclusive tribe somewhere in the Amazon rainforest and decided on their own that the people of this tribe deserved \ needed to have a representative on [insert international alliance] and then went right on to trying to make it happen, without asking them first if these people even wanted anything to do with such a representation.

For the record, ok-ing slavery doesn't necessarily have to do anything with your moral views winning in this case by default or mine losing. Since my counter-arguments aren't based on "slavery being ok" and for yours the "slavery being not ok" is neither sufficient nor necessary.

Step two means that you don't have to change anything law wise other than perhaps clamping down on allowed behaviour. The bond is basically calling out Hermione's gryffindor trait of leaping without looking. Its saying hold on, you don't know everything. The second part where they tend to show that most house-elves are happy and that people like Malfoy are the problem not the norm is their actual argument. The bond is used to call out potential ignorance, its a device for that, I don't think I've ever seen it used to say abuse is fine. It is used to say if you didn't know about this, what else might you have missed? Which leads nicely into missing the vast majority of well treated house-elves.

Malfoy is powerful, if its a minor rule then he can ignore it. Would someone attempt to prosecute him if it endangered their family's well-being? Its not right but its entirely possible that there are the laws etc, they just aren't enforced. Dobby is the single example of a mistreated house-elf. Winky takes the fall for Crouch but thats nothing about her being an elf. People have been taking the fall for others as long as blame has been a thing. Kreacher and Sirius don't get on but we know Regulus got on with him well and it seems that Sirius' mum treated him well. The kitchen elves seen happy enough and so did the Smith house-elf that was set up by Voldemort. The bond is used to show how ham-fisted Hermione's attempt is, what happens in regards to the Gryffindor common room and the elves in fifth year shows that it wasn't appreciated. Now you can blame the elves for being brain washed or you can say Hermione was ignorant or perhaps you can say there is more to the issue that we can tell from a set of books about a kid's adventures in school.

I disagree. With disillusionment charms, invisibility cloaks, extendable ears and pensieves the amount of investigative means Aurors have at their disposal is beyond measure. Dobby looks and behaves like an abused house-elf and the Malfoys don't seem to hide it. It's an open and shut case, even without the the victim as a witness - the evidence would be staggering. There could be government mandated yearly health check-ups for house elves too in order to spot such abuse. It's very simple to enforce (not that it could prevent all abuse, but the worst of it).

How do you figure abused children who don't report it to their teachers are found? Because there's laws and regulations to protect them and if a doctor or teacher notices something they will usually report it (which is also a social standard that's clearly non-existent in magical Britain, putting more evidence towards 'House-elf slavery is disturbing'). These processes work without assistance by the abused child.

I don't think it's just a matter of laws, it's really a cultural matter that /needs/ to be rectified. Wizards (and there are a lot of instances of this) treat House-Elves like they are beneath them-which really can't be justified
