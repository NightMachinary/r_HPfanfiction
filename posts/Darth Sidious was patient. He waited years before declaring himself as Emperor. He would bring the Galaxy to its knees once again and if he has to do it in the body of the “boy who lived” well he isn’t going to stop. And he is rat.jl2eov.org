#+TITLE: Darth Sidious was patient. He waited years before declaring himself as Emperor. He would bring the Galaxy to its knees once again and if he has to do it in the body of the “boy who lived” well he isn’t going to stop. And he is rather interested in this rather complex planet.

When the legend of the boy who lived became known he was known as the savior of the light. Among other things a /certain group of people/ were shocked that a baby defeated their lord so they came to the conclusion that he needed to be destroyed. However in the chaos a rumor was formed that he would be very Powerful in the darkside. That he would be a stronger Dark Lord than You-know-who himself.

Many people including Albus Dumbledore brushed this of as the death eaters getting desperate.

Oh how right the death eaters were but even they could not imagine the evils that Sidious/Harry would unleash into the wizarding world/galaxy.

Yes yes, this could work. Sidious muses over an unconscious Unspeakable. He had used a rather strong mind probe on him and had found what he was looking for. It's ironic really. He had groomed the Chosen One and now he was the Chosen One... of a completely different prophecy though.

Looking over the prophecy he went over the contents of it. “/the one with the power to vanquish the Dark lord approaches/”. This was absolutely true. “/for neither can live while the other survives/”. Well he supposed this was correct considering “Harry Potter” ceased to exist a long time ago. “/the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal/”. So he will be viewed as an equal by the pretender? Huh? Sidious scoffs. No where in the prophecy states that He will view Voldemort as an equal, superior or inferior. “/He will have a power the Dark lord knows not/”. Of course he will because who was Lord Voldemort against a Dark Lord of the Sith.

No one, absolutely no one will be ready for him and when the truth come out it will be glorious thinks Thee reincarnated Dark Lord as cackles madly.

Neither the Jedi or the Wizarding world saw this coming. The latter was too terrified after Voldemort and Dumbledore perished at his hands. Their respective followers either joined the new Dark Lord or died.

The former was also slaughtered but not before they realized what this was

The Second coming of Emperor Palpatine

**** That is intersting. How did he become Palpatine though? Did Voldemorts curse/Lilys sacrifice send him to Star Wars Galaxy where he got adopted by Some Nobles of Planet Naboo and fall into the clutches of Darth Plagueis in his youth like in canon?
