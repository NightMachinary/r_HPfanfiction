I've been thinking about this for a while now. What would have happened if Voldemort received the Kiss? Would he be able to come back or would he basically be a spirit that wouldn't be able to go to Hell until someone destroys his horcruxes?


** It was not clear what would happen when you create horcrux other than you can't be killed. But dementors don't kill the body anyway. It is not clear for me whether your body will decay after you age for so long. Voldemort seems to age normally even after creating horcrux. So it is possible, but since dementors are in his pocket, there was no chance to test it.

*** Maybe dementors negotiate a deal with him instead of just eating his soul because eating souls is a quantized process, and fractional souls can't be eaten just as fractional photons can't be emitted by objects.

**** I thought souls split all the time when one is killed by another, just not become horcrux. If that's true, then anyone in azkaban for murder will be safe from dementors kiss.

***** No, they're damaged when someone commits murder, but it doesn't split unless they create a horcrux.

****** In Half-Blood Prince, Slughorn tells Voldemort how to split the soul “By an act of evil --- the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart.”

******* Yes, killing rips the soul, but it doesn't make it split off.

***** I assumed murder damages souls like hitting your arm really hard damages your arm bones. It's split, but both pieces are still there and will heal back together if left alone. The purpose of the horcrux creation ritual is to extract one of the pieces and stick it to an object outside the body, where it can't heal back together.
