Sorry for this total noob question, but why not have, say, an ebook that people can download? Have you ever seen fan fic presented as an ebook?


** I think (but don't quote me on it) that both ffn and ao3 have an option to download it to a pdf or ereader.

There are a few other specialized fanfic sites, but I couldn't say the same for them.

** You can! There's a button on the bot here, AO3 has it as part of the website's actual functionality, and you can download everything from FFNet using a plugin on Calibre called Fanficfare where you just copy in the URL and it does the work.

But otherwise, it's cause it's easiest to just have everything hosted in one place for people to access. Whether it's saved as an Ebook format or a webpage is not really all that much different (as those ways that I mentioned before exist to save webpages as ebooks), so it's saved as a webpage because it's easier/more traditionally-fitting technologically and keeps it accessible for people who don't have ebook readers.

** [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] (available as a stand-alone command line application or the Calibre plugin) can download from [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/Supportedsites][tens of various fanfiction websites]]. I read almost only ePubs downloaded with this application.
