I remember them being popular a few years ago. It was the most stupid thing I've read (not counting My Immortal). It was pretty much the books with some commentary. Why did people like it??


** I believe the vast majority were reported for plagiarism, so people stopped writing them.

*** They're explicitly disallowed as "not writing" on fanfiction.net.

They're also 90%-99% a literal copy and paste of the source material, and so /are/ basically plagiarism.

About the only way to actually do a "X reads the story" fic would be skimming the story for the important/funny parts, and then exploring how that would change things in the fanfic's setting now that the characters have "read the books"

** I guess it's entertaining to see how characters would react to the books and especially from harry's point of view, how people's opinion would change of him etc.

I kind of enjoyed them, but I'm sure what really happened with them, I guess people just lost interest.

*** It was pretty much the same though. I majority of the fics ,the books would be read at the great hall and people would alternate between giving Harry sympathetic looks and thinking about how brave he is .

** They were garbage, everyone of them. A copy-paste on the original books with characters talking or suddenly acting OOC because "they would never do that". Or just a bashing fic.

** I could never read those because of second-hand embarrassment. Also fics where the characters discover fanfiction. Just no.

*** I think I've read a good crack fic where Dumbledore find fanfiction and then Snape comes to know about it. It was the only one I liked.

** If there is more own story and less copying of the Rowling's text, it could be actually fun. For example, linkao3(A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel;A Sensational Story by Srikanth1808, White_Squirrel)

**** I gave it a go, but it's really not my thing. The whole thing is very unrealistic to me. I don't think a book would hold up in court as evidence if the author doesn't have solid proof about everything in it happening. Who'd believe everything in a book published by a muggle company and is supposed to be from the future?

** I've only seen 2 -- one where Umbridge reads them out to the Great Hall, one where Severus and Lily read them as kids (pre-Hogwarts). The former was good, the latter was unfinished early on.

Are you saying this used to be common? I've never seen any others.
