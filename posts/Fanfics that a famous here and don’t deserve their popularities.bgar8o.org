I don't think it's fair to judge the most popular stories on FanFiction.Net. They are good for the most, especially for the first time readers.

This sub has different tastes and this post is about them.

There're a lot of recommendations here. Some stories are recommended more often than others.

In your opinion what stories among those don't deserve their popularities?


** I've tried to read linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) several times now, since it kept getting recommended, but I always start cringing at Harry's overpoweredness by the 2nd or 3rd chapter and I've yet to make it past the point where the time-traveled 17 year old Harry in a 8 year old body hits on an actual 8 year old by planning out how they'll get married but he's GOT to have multiple women in his life and she'll have to be okay with that.

*** If I read about smirking it's bad. It does have a couple good points, but frankly, his characters are stupid..The Potter twins (which is a terrible plot device) are both irredeemable. The girls have no personalities, being subservient to Harry. It seems like bad wish fulfillment.

** Seventh Horcrux. To be fair, this would have worked if it was, say, four or five chapters. Instead it's 100k words that repeat the same joke over and over again.

Novocaine. Haven't seen this one recced on here for a while but it never should have been. Robotic characters spend their time talking accountancy and management. The only people who can really like this story are loss-adjusters.

And I'm afraid it's time to include The Mind Arts. A pity because it showed a lot of promise but I think the plot has started to meander and a lot of the conflict seems manufactured. It's not a bad story per se but I think it gets recced far more often than it deserves.

*** I'll provide some reasons I love it:

- It's well written and engaging
- It's a compact story that doesn't really have a slow spot or deviation from the main plot, unlike most longer fics recommended here.
- It has a believable Dark Harry. He isn't a Machiavellian 11 year old and he doesn't intend to conquer the world - he just found a point he wasn't willing to bend on and is now an adult who can choose to break from societies rules if he's willing to pay the price.
- Public opinion turning further against werewolves post-DH fits perfectly with everything we learned about Wizarding Britain in canon.
- Harry gets a new signature spell, but not because he suddenly develops a knack for studying - he learns by practicing (and the fic doesn't slog through descriptions of it, thankfully), echoing how he learned in canon.
- No bashing of anyone in the trio, they're all good and prominent characters, and the side characters get fleshed out nicely.

Was there anything specific you disliked about it? Or did it just not hold your interest?

**** Not OP, but here's briefly why I'm unimpressed by it.

By the 19th time Harry mentions that 1) he doesn't want to but goddamn he'll be a Dark Lord cuz that what needs doing 2) he's not all Black but he's got the Black family cookoo, there's no more space in my skull to roll my eyes. "Slytherin-Gryffindor Dark Lord". Dark Lord being an official position, like Harry's reluctantly taking a post on the Shadow Cabinet or something. The timeskip skips over the interesting part of the story. Everything up until then seemed like a drawn out prologue to actual Dark Lordship, but then there's a timeskip to Harry Dark Lording over Britain. The author skipped the second half of the story, the ~100k words between "GGRRR burn it all" and Harry being the enthroned Dark Lord of Britain.

It's like Delenda Est if the author wrote the boring half first and then didn't write the cool half at all.

Everyone seemed to jump on the bandwagon very quickly. Not that post war Harry doesn't have the star power to just magnet people to himself, but I'd have liked at least a few bumps on that road.

I found it rather uneventful as a dark Harry story and unfinished as a Dark Lord Harry novel.

The premise requires so much convenience that it's like the opposite of canon, where instead of a pretty standard fantasy setup followed by a series of conveniences, instead it is this super convenient setup that causes it to play out in the way the author wants it to. I just don't buy it, and because of that it didn't grab me.

****** To be honest, I'm not sure it's that difficult to pick holes in those two.

Grow Young With Me, if you're cynically minded, has many problems. It is overly saccharine in places and seems to delight in trying to enforce 'feels' upon the reader, often going out of its way to do so. This has knock on effects for the pacing, which is slowed by the need to beat the reader over the head with emotions. If you're the kind of person who hates Pixar for playing so brazenly with emotions, I imagine there's a lot to hate in Grow Young With Me.

That said, I'm the one who recced that story on DLP, so I'm probably not the right person to deliver a scathing review.

The Shadow of Angmar is much easier to pick apart, in my opinion. While the style is clearly a choice, it is not hard to see someone disliking the unwieldy sentence structure or word-choice.

The biggest issue, however, is the use of characters and places as disposable scenery. People come and go like they're on a tread-mill. The reader is never really able to build a relationship with any of the supporting characters, as they are all ephemeral.

This has knock-on effects, I suspect many readers do not see the point in becoming invested in new characters as they appear, as by now they've realised that the character will likely only appear for a couple of chapters before they are gone forever.

Now, all you really need to do is to take those points, add a few more complaints (Pick from: Harry isn't Harry, too many self-congratulatory A/Ns, Location-porn is utterly formulaic, all Harry does is steal other people's thunder, author's understanding of canon doesn't match mine... etc), wrap it up in an overly lengthy angry diatribe, and voila! They're trash.

Everything has issues. Whether those issues render a story unreadable are entirely down to taste.

Yeah perhaps you pat yourself on the back a bit more than is strictly necessarily, but it's largely well deserved. In any case, you manage to provide interesting ancillary information without using without relying on it as a crutch, while also building a rapport with your readers.

******** I actually agree with them, while I enjoy an update from Shadow of Angmar I genuinely got a giddy feeling when I saw those last Elves Most Fabulous updates. It is short and beyond silly but that is the point.

*** I cannot stand MOR. I don't understand how people see it as anything other than shrill soapboxing by an author who almost certainly ends all disagreements in real life with "You just don't understand" because it's impossible that their view might not be perfectly sound conclusions of infallible logic.

** Black Comedy and Dodging Prison are literally the next ones on my queue. The recent take-down of Black Comedy was probably enough to make me not do it (Sirius anally rapes an innocent house elf as a prank?) but anyone wanna make me reconsider taking both of these off?

*** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches just about works if you treat it as a crackfic. Unfortunately I don't think that's the way the author intends it to be read.
