No fighting, no voldermort/supporters. Just a nice little complete romance story with harry/hermione or harry/luna. There can be some in-fighting with the weasleys as long as it isn't central instead it's there, but not really commented on much.

Edit: I will read story's with conflict if harry basically stomps the opposition so the main focus is still a relationship, also i don't care if there is physical intimancy as long as it is there for the reason two people should get close, to get intimate and create a closer and stronger bond. It shouldn't be there for the sake of being there. If the romance is sex than it's not romance in my opinion.

Edit 2: I would also like a minimum of 20k+ words please unless you believe it is good enough that 'less is more'.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2918348/Stanrick][Stanrick]] has some lovely Harry/Hermione stories.

He does tend to get somewhat needlessly wordy though. Doesn't lessen the quality of the stories for me personally, but it is a valid complaint some people have.

  An old house sits at the end of a lane. Abandoned and forgotten, no one would have guessed who was going to buy it... or how full a life that old house was yet to live. Harry/Hermione

** There's admittedly not much of a "story" in here, but it's definitely fluffy.

  Everyone said they were the least romantic couple in the world. A love story: HarryHermione.

** You might enjoy [[http://keiramarcos.com/category/fandom/harry-potter/][Keira Marcos]]' stuff. No Voldemort in any of the Harry/Hermione. Most conflicts are resolved pretty quickly - the focus is definitely the relationship in all of them.
