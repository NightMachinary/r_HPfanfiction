Are there any good Harry/Ginny/Hermione soul bond threesome marriage type fanfics that aren't M rated? I don't want any sex scenes (like at all, not even one) just a nice story that explores a romantic relationship between all three of the aforementioned characters. If possible I would like the story to to have others plots going on besides just straight romance but if not that's ok too.

I appreciate any help in finding such a fic, so thank you!

I don't remember there being any smut, though adult situations abound. It starts Harry/Hermione, adds Ginny, and then adds a fourth whom you'll see coming a mile away, but I won't spoil here.

The period where it's a triad is long enough for the relationship to develop, and at that point they're too young for more than cuddling.
