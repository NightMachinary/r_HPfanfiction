** Harry keeps losing his wand in The secret language of plants (starts with linkao3(the secret language of mistletoe)). Edited to clarify: this is because he doesn't care about his wand; these are intentional losses

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Certain that he'd been about to die, Harry is mystified to find himself alive and healthy, and somehow in 1981. Disillusioned to Dumbledore's meddling in his life, when he discovers his fifteen-month-old self in a basket on the Dursleys' doorstep, Harry does the only thing he can. He takes the child with him.WARNING: This story is a W.I.P. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
