After a crossfire of spells during the battle of the Department of Mysteries, Hermione is sent back in time to the year 1921. Forced to join the ranks of the mysterious Unspeakables, with no possibility of getting back to her own era, and the threat of Grindelwald looming over the horizon: will she be able to live a quiet life without changing the time-line, or will she have to prove that she isn't called the brightest witch of her age for no reason?

This is an idea that has been in my head for some time now, and I haven't found any fic like this. I've never written anything and I don't know if I'd be able to do it justice. What do you think?? Would someone be interested in it?


** Not exactly, but “In the Bleak Midwinter” by TheLoud linkao3(15430560) may make you happy as well.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

**** Setup is really great, but it gets a bit weird lately. Unfortunately, it seems to me the author didn't manage to keep the quality of writing he started with.

** Time travel has easily become my favourite genre this past year, so the more the merrier! I would highly recommend you read Birds of a Feather by babylonsheep. Not strictly a time travel one, but one in which Hermione is born back in Tom Riddle's day and they grow up together. It absolutely takes the cake in historial accuracy (even the dialogue is era appropriate!!) so would highly recommend you check that out to see how to pull off such a historical setting well.
