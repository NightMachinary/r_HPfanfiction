Does anyone know of any fanfics where the teachers are competent on doing their jobs?


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1237073][Severus Snape and the Boy Who Lived]] is an absolutely fantastic series. The whole premise is that Snape is actually a strict, competent professor instead of an abusive incel. It's a blend of epistolary, lectures, and conversations instead of a strict story format.

** I don't know how to link to stories, but "In the Name of the Brave" on AO3 by Lullabyknell is one of the best portrayals I've read of Hogwarts functioning as an actual school, and features an expanded staff, and more competence.

It appears to be abandoned though, which is a crying shame as it's shaping up to be a fantastic story.

*** I second it. It's fantastic. But I'm still hoping that the Author will come back. They update very slowly and they stated that they want to finish FDitH before any other of their HP works. Hopefully it isn't abandoned forever.

**** I would /love/ for LullabyKnell to return to this fic. It is one that I would quite happily disregard all of canon for, it's that good.

I'm a sucker for a re-write anyway, but one of that quality is so rare. I'm still learning how AO3 works so need to figure out how to set myself an alarm in case of updates (back in the day when I first started fanfiction, there was just FFN and the Restricted Section (for all your NSFW needs - don't know if that even exists anymore).

I am also still quite new to Reddit so thanks for doing the link!

** Try Families And Familiars by Sherza on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]. The teachers are much more competent there.

Summary: Hogwarts is alive. Familiars are more than mere pets, and Harry Potter has a destiny far greater than he knows. Enemies of the Heir, beware, for under his guidance a new future will be forged, either for good or for ill.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** thats one of the core ideas behind linkao3(of a linear circle) but it deviates pretty hard from canon and it's not the canon teachers who are really the competent. I would look at the series summary and see if it's your cup of tea!

  “Are we friends now?” Joe asks. Nicky reaches up to pat Joe on the back, shifting his weight through his hips so he's got enough power to push Joe into the water. When Joe comes up, spluttering, hair hanging lank across his face, he stares at Nicky, who looks back at him with a lopsided smile.“Now we're friends.”  Ten years, two best friends, one couch that seems to have its own agenda. Friends-to-lovers with all the trimmings.
