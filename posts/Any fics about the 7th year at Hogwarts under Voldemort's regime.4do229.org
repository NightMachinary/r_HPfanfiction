You know any fics about what Ginny, Neville and the others were doing during 7th year? They can even be from Slytherins' POV.


** The best 7th year fic I've read is definitely Not From Others by FloreatCastellum. The story is from Ginny's point of view. Its overall style is very close to canon, and all events are canon-compliant. Very well written, and the Battle of Hogwarts was just heartbreaking.

  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen. DH from Ginny's POV. Canon.

** I've never even heard of Not From Others, though I have it open in another tab as I write this and will be checking it out immediately. The fic that stands out to me as the best DH Hogwarts fic is linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness by Thanfiction). This is one of my favorite fics of all time, and a true classic of HP fanfiction.

** [[/u/SchroedingersKneazle]] is absolutely correct in saying that Not From Others is stellar - that's my go-to as well.

Another couple of fics that I really enjoyed were A Call To Arms by MyDearProfessorMcGonagall and While You Were Gone by jcooks2010. Both are darker, but also great stories, very well written, and both pull at you.

  Written from multiple perspectives, this shifting fanfic chronicles the war at Hogwarts; focus on Ginny's/Neville's experience. DH Compliant except a bit of Epilogue. Nev/Han, R/Hr, H/G Other pairs. Rated M for language, violence, and sex.
