I think Voldemort/Bismarck in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl who walked on water) is probably one of the weirdest I've read, but there's probably much weirder stuff out there.


** Hogwarts Castle and the Giant Squid from the Hogwarts lake was probably the weirdest pairing I ever read though it was a Crack pairing. Otherwise it's always weird for me to see Snape paired up with someone, even worse if it is someone from Harry's generation. Just ugh... I don't think he'll ever get over his obsession with Lily, which is also a reason why they wouldn't work, at least not as long you don't change him or his past in a significant way. Another weird pairing is Harry and Moaning Myrtle. I've needed Brain Bleach after that ;D

** THAT Hedwig/ Harry fic.

But on a serious note, I'm going to get downvoted to hell but SSHG is weird af as well. Schoolgirl and a teacher 30 years her senior, would definitely cause a huge uproar irl, much less the extremely conservative Wizarding World.

And canon ship, Hagrid's parents. Like what the actual fuck.

** Haven't really dived into those levels of bizarre. But from the 'traditionally' weird pairings, are the teachers hooking up with someone from Harry's generation, or Voldemort with Harry. Idk, im quite a liberal person when it comes to age gaps in couples, but something feels so wrong reading about people in their mid 30s (at the youngest) hooking up with people they knew ever since they didnt even hit puberty. Even if they actually become enamored later on.

** Harry/Dobby/Winky/House Elf OC?

It's a random fic that I found years and years ago that I wish like hell I could find cause it was so appalling. From what I recall, it was a bi-sexual house elf orgy, with Harry in the middle. Don't remember the why's or the how's, but the who's and the what's were mind-shattering.

*** *German battleship Bismarck*

Bismarck was the first of two Bismarck-class battleships built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. Named after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the ship was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in July 1936 and launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Bismarck and her sister ship Tirpitz were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.

** Not that I minded any of these ships (some of the one-shots I read were really sweet!), but I remember being really surprised that there were a dozen Cho Chang/Dudley Dursley stories on ao3.

Then there was a request for Dudley Dursley/Pansy Parkinson on this sub a few days ago. Not expecting either of those pairings, seemed pretty random to me.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
