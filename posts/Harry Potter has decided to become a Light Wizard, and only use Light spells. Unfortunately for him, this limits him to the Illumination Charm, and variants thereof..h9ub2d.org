** "Lumos Sacris" Spaketh the Chosen One, and lo the Lord heard his child, Lamb of the Wizarding World, and sent forth his Angels to bring low the Dark Lord.

The Dark Lord was bound in chains of fire, and bound within the eternal and MERCIFUL Light of the Lord, and the Eaters of Death with him, and the Lord cast them out to an empty place where they were left with naught but their own terrors, to hound them for all eternity.

And the Lord beheld it, and saw that it was good. The Dark Lord had his eternal life, his followers had the eternal company of /their/ Lord that they had so longed for(and a place where those who were not magical would never infiltrate) and the Chosen One was savéd.

The End.

*** "Lumos Appolonis" Intoned the latest Bard of Bards, in a pleasant baritone, from whence began the Song of the Sun.

Ethereal music descended upon the earth like the gentlest rain, and the softest snow. The warm, golden light of perfect summer evenings and the crisp shine of a childhood's winter morning flowed across the field of battle.

The younger Sun God, lord of healing and music caressed the soul of the Nameless One, and it became one again, a perfect harmony that spelled the doom of the Dark Lord.

For next, the horns did sound, and the Celestial Legion of Olympus descended to bring the fury of the Gods to bear against the hubristic fool, who sought the immortality that was the sacred and sole birthright of the Gods.

When the fury passed, the Chosen One and his Foe were no more, save for in the distant shimmering of new stars, from whence the soul of the Bard could gaze down upon the world, victor over the dark serpent at his sidereal feet.

** Actually a not so extreme version of this would be really cool. Harry who only uses lumos (to varying degrees of power), expecto patronum, healing spells, illusions, divination, inanimate transfigurations. Mind magic maybe.

** So his arsenal:

Fire spells (LIGHT) (wait wat about fiendfyre?)

Lumos\\
Spells to blind people with light

Spells to conjure lightsabers

Spells to manipulate light and make illusions

Spells to send gamma rays at people for instant kills

Invisiblity (Manipulate light around him)

​

If he made a really good illusion, he could trick voldemort into his death easily.
