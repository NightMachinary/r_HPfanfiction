I was remembering a fic I read a long loong time ago where Ginny died in the chamber, and Harry's conscious was shared between her body and his own. I believe it was fairly short, and incomplete, but involved Harry learning to multi-task between his bodies, and expanding his knowledge of the wizarding world.

Anybody know what the name is? Thanks!


** This was my fic "In Essence Divided". It's no longer on FF.Net but you can retrieve a copy from my Dropbox archive:

*** Damn you for making me read yet another of your abandoned fics.

Do you have any other stories that aren't on FFN?

One-shots, mostly. The full archive is here:

The only other multi-chapter fics in there (that aren't on FF.Net) are

1. Alexandra Potter. I do not recommend reading this if you are reading Victoria Potter as, while much has changed, it will still contain some spoilers. It's also just far inferior!

2. The Mysteries of the Department. I believe I wrote this in 2007 and it's the second thing I ever wrote (the first is lost in some hard drive of a previous computer, thank god - it was about a half-vampire Russian wizard who was an offshoot of the Black family and became Voldemort's second in command. Very wanky.). "Mysteries" is quite awful but interesting in so far as it shows how I've developed as a writer.

*** I agree with [[/u/glencoe2000][u/glencoe2000]]. I thought I would hate it but kept reading anyway because I love how you write magic. Now it's one of my favorite fanfics.
