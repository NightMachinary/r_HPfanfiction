So I just found out my psychology teacher reads fanfiction, and now I'm curious if there are any psychological-ish HP fics.

Bashing, crossovers, slash and dark!character fics are fine. Please no harems, genderbending, mpreg, romance/smut-centric plots or pottercest. Thank you!


** I have no clue about psychology, but if an introspective, character-driven story counts as that, then I want to suggest linkffn(11762850)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I don't think you'll find much better than linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher by Ecthelion3).

Also, this is a different type of fic altogether, but [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry by The Seeker]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary: What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse. Appropriate disclosures will be contained in the Author's Notes above the chapter when warranted.

** To reach without depends heavily upon a psychological exploration of the effects of Harry's childhood. While Harry within it comes to some startling insights that are more or less decently presented, I don't think the author goes about describing the healing process all that well. His thoughts, turbulent circular, are laid in too much detail, chapter after chapter, and it quickly becomes cumbersome. Still, despite its shortcomings, it is an interesting story.
