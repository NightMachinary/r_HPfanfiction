I'd like to ask you, lovely people of the community, for recommendations of HP Xovers! No matter the fandom, I want to give it a go.

I want the best examples of your favourite crossover; find me a severely underrated fic, or one for a fandom that doesn't get a lot of love, or for the maddest, most insane idea ever, that actually really works when done right. Open my eyes, broaden my horizons; show me something new!

I only have three basic requests:

1. That the fics be actually GOOD - I'm looking for a great story or premise, strong plot line and some character development - I'm not asking for all that much :)
2. A brief explanation (and it can be very brief - I don't mind) of WHY you think this story is good. Whether it's the writing style, or the representation of the other fandom or even just a single scene that you keep re-reading, let me know so I know what to look out for while reading
3. Some explanation, (slightly) preferably within the story, of the principles of the other fandom; some of these universes I will (probably) have never heard of before - I have no basis of knowledge for understanding it, and I don't really want to have to study for it as if it were an exam, so some basic indications of the foundations of this new world are greatly appreciated

I love HP and JK's world, and I adore seeing how people make it interact with other creators' universes; any universe! As I said before, all fandoms are welcome; I'm just looking to expand my area of interest.

Thank you in advance for the recs and I look forward to reading!

<3

** linkffn(8177168) Wand and Shield -- HP/Avengers crossover: surprised no one's mentioned it yet here. It is unfortunately incomplete and on hiatus, but I re-read it quite often, it's very well-written (her Tony Stark is spot-on, along with Peter Parker), and does a really good job at tying the two worlds together. Harry, as Master of Death, leaves his world and arrives in the Avengers world, where he /seems/ to be the only wizard on Earth. Timeline is set at the beginning of Iron Man (along with all the other Marvel timelines that coincide). There's a great scene in here where Harry meets Bruce Banner (in both forms). There's a cool (if obvious) parallel of the Hulk and the werewolves in the HP world.

​

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603/chapters/7050041][Island of Fire]] -- HP/Temeraire crossover, but you don't need to know anything about Temeraire (well, I think -- /I/ didn't know anything about Temeraire and still greatly enjoyed it). An epistolary novel with incredible world building; if you're into magic and it's non-combative possible uses, it's a great fic. Set during the events of Goblet of Fire, a portkey mishap happened and a bunch of the wizarding students from all schools find themselves trapped on an island. The entire survival part, from gathering food to building shelter, with magic, is a delight to read.

** I have 1 recommendation-

Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon

It's a crossover with Firefly, a sci-fi TV show set in the future. It was cancelled after just one season, but they did an awesome movie to tie up the loose ends.

I'm not sure if I can judge whether or not the story properly explains the setting of Firefly within itself, since I already knew its plot going in. At least I don't remember having any problems even though it had been many years since I last watched the show or movie. But if you want to familiarise yourself with Firefly, you can just watch the movie (Serenity (2005)) first. I'd recommend that anyways, since it's a great standalone movie and the plot of the movie plays significant part in the fic. You can skip the show without missing anything much.

As for the fic, it's my no. 1 all time favourite Harry Potter crossover. It plays well with the canon of both sources. It doesn't make Harry out to be some OP immortal master of death, just what we actually see in the books: a regular guy with powerful magic and a slight instinctive understanding of magic (remember he mastered Patronus at 13). It just scales that up to what he might be like at age 150. And throughout the fic we see how interactions between the characters lead to personal development for all of them, not just one or two main characters.

Next, the link between the two sources is explained very well, resulting in an overarching plot that is intriguing and not something you could have guessed. Instead of going from one fight to the next, one mission after another or something like that, it can easily leave the mould of an episodic TV series, since it is set after the end of both sources. The plot of the story itself is about the link between the source fictions.

Overall it's a fun story with many jokes thrown in, and it always keeps you laughing or enjoying yourself. I haven't found many that are as good as this. I cannot recommend it enough.

However I would suggest watching the TV show before the movie, since the movie is set after the TV show and spoils some major plot points of the show.

I take issue with this, because the show is some of the very best TV you will come across... But as far as understanding the story, yeah it helps but probably isn't /needed/.

PSA for those jumping into the Firefly TV series for the first time: if you are worried you might not get into it, particularly with a pilot episode that's double the length, start with "The Train Job". It was aired as a substitute pilot since FOX thought the original pilot was too slow burn.

Don't get me wrong, I think the intended order (actual pilot first) is best. But if an hour and a half feels like too long for you to dive into, "The Train Job" is a good starting place as well.

**** To be truthful, I'd also recommend watching the TV show. It is great at combining a future sci-fi multi-planetary civilization with western elements, while keeping the best of both. I was really disappointed they cancelled the show after just one season. At least they did pretty well with the movie and gave closure to the fans on most plot points.

The only reason I said the show could be skipped was because OP didn't want to spend too long trying to get into a new series just for reading a fic. But I'm hoping anyone who reads the fic or watches the movie will like it enough to go looking for the series themselves. It might be slightly spoiled, but I doubt anything can really take away Firefly's charm.

This was actually how I got into Worm myself, and even though it was somewhat spoiled for me, I greatly enjoyed it anyways. Great writing stands well enough on its own. Always.

***** Though, to remind OP or anyone else: watching the show, while recommend, is NOT necessary. Watching the movie Serenity should be more than enough if you're only looking to get into the fic. The movie will give you a complete picture of the setting so there will be no confusion. But if the summary/comments of the show make you want to watch it, then definitely go in the correct order of show-movie-fic for the most complete and spoiler free experience.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]] I am recommending this specifically because I have never seen it recommended on here before. It is decently well written and is the start of a bunch of sequels (both official and unofficial).

Because of a prophecy Hermione goes universe hopping to pick up some heroines to help her deal with a demonic invasion. Crosses over with Buffy, Stargate, Secret World of Alex Mac, DC , and Million Dollar Woman. You don't really need to know much about the other fandoms for this one. They explain what you need in the story. I hand never heard of Alex Mac before reading this so it should be pretty accessible to any HP fan

** In the Fate branch of crossover, linkffn(10918531) is quite good. You might need *some* notions of the Fate world but even then it takes care to explain everything that doesn't appear in the canon.

It has some real character growth, an extensive worldbuilding and isn't afraid to veer into AU.

Also, it is one of the few fics that makes justice to Mr. "Just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right!" also, it makes you like (or empathise) with one of the worst (excuse the language) shitstains in the Fate verse.

.

Still in the same branch of crossover, linkffn(12881601) manages to be a tad more accessible for newcomers while still having interesting character development and some decent worldbuilding along a fairly good plot.

.

On the Tolkien side of things, linkffn(11115934) is extremely good, with the author making some extensive work to fill the gaps in canon (gaps due to the lack of material, not due to any mistakes by Tolkien). No canon knowledge should be required (though having at least seen the movies is obviously a plus).

.

For Naruto, I have linkffn(11634921) that is pure crack but somehow extremely good.

You should know the Naruto canon til at least the timeskip to fully appreciate it.

.

Again for Naruto, linkffn(8525251) is quite a nice read, especially if you like (slightly) darker AU (on both sides).

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/163632][What's Past Is Prologue]] linkao3(163632) is a Doctor Who/Harry Potter crossover. Hardly an obscure crossover, I know, but it's a pretty unknown fic, I think. You do probably need to have seen the Tenth Doctor era for this fic to be worth reading. I like it because Harry after DH and Ten after Journey's End are an interesting character combination, given that both have experienced a lot of loss, and carry around a sense of responsibility.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3771373][One-Eighth Of A Chance]] linkao3(3771373) is a Harry Potter/Discworld crossover, with absolutely no Discworld knowledge required. Short, humorous one-shot with a neat premise.

** I've got quite a few, I love crossovers, but of of the best is linkffn(Child of the Storm)

It's a mega crossover mostly focused on the marvel universe though, with a few other characters and references here and there. The idea is that James Potter was a failed reincarnation of Thor to teach him humility, but the trauma of watching his family die as a spirit drove him mad so the memories were removed. Until Harry needs help and sends an unconscious distress call to Asgard...

It's got a lot of the Avengers doing their thing with wizards mixed in. The fic itself is finished but it has a sequel that updates almost weekly. Combined they are over a million words. Even if you don't know marvel beyond the movies and don't know any of the other occasional crossovers, it is an extremely good fic.

Tell me if you want more, I read so many crossovers

*** I really wanted to like this one, especially because of how long it is. I wish the author didn't rush everything so much at the start by making everyone somehow related to each other as family or friends and making the universe in the fic seem minuscule. It is a bit of a turn off for me because it takes away one of the most special things about xvovers, which is the two different universes meeting and coming to terms as the characters meet.

I'll definitely try this one again, and I'll make sure that I make a good go at it this time; what you say intrigues me. If you have any other recommendations, I'll happily take them!

As a result Harry spends a year being tortured by the most evil characters of the world until the end of the first war. He is rescued by elves and has to try and make his way home.

** I recently stumbled upon this HP-GoT crossover fic called The Winter Witch; linkffn(12689889)

Basically, Hermione accidentally lands smack in the middle of the Battle of the Whispering Wood, where Robb Stark routed the Lannister army (I am assuming that you, like me, have a cursory knowledge of the GoT universe), and then the story proceeds from there. I was about to board a flight when I unexpectedly found this fic and I gave a quick skim through it during the journey. However, I must admit, thanks to some deadlines that I had to meet at work, I totally forgot about the fic after that trip. I was reminded of it only after I saw your post.

In the few chapters that I managed to read, I found the writing to be good. The underlying, universal trope of all superhero comics was basically what captured my attention in this fic - a witch who can virtually do anything, all thanks to her wand, in an ancient world of warriors who've had very little exposure to modern ways or magic. Additionally, I think the plot tries to adhere to the Song of Ice and Fire books, because you'll encounter characters who you've never seen on the show. However, I must warn you that the fic does does tend to lean towards the super-Hermione trope that fic readers generally hate.

It's a three-part fic (part 2 ongoing) and since I haven't completed the fic myself, I'll not go to the extent of recommending it. But you could have a look.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her. Part 1 complete; Part 2 is now ongoing!

** A bit of a late response, but here's a writeup of the HPxX crossovers I'd recommend on my favourites list. If you want me to go into more detail on one/chat about it feel free to say so. :)

- linkffn(*Harry Potter and the Natural 20*)

Milo, a D&D Wizard, finds himself in an insane world with other people claiming to be wizards but who clearly follow different and bizarre rules of the universe. Shenanigans ensue. Very solid read, especially if you're somewhat familiar with roleplaying games.

- linkffn(*The Shadow of Angmar*)

Probably the best LOTR crossover, Harry wanders around in Middle Earth about a millenium before the events of LOTR. Totally awesome.

- linkffn(*The Power He Knows Not*)

By the same author as The Shadow of Angmar, Harry finds himself in Middle Earth during the events of LOTR and meets the fair maiden Éowyn. Sticks close to Tolkien's style and is completely wrapped up.

- linkffn(*Strangers in Bars*)

Harry finds himself drinking in a bar with Marvel's Thor, exchanging battle stories. Pretty short and very fun.

- linkffn(*One-Eighth of A Chance*)

Humouristic one-shot that features Discworld's Death but doesn't require any knowledge of Discworld. It's funny and it's great.

- linkffn(*I See The Moon*)

Bruce Banner, on the run, meets a not quite sane Harry and they become great friends. Mostly fluffy and a totally lovely read. This fic is great.

- linkffn(8145794) - *Chance Encounters*

Harry runs into the members of the Avengers throughout his life, a chapter at a time. The first half is a good bit better than the second half imo, but it's still overall a great story and I'll heartily recommend it.

- linkffn(*Discordant* by Heather Sinclair)

Harry's a bounty hunter in the Star Wars universe and gets involved in the storyline of the prequels. It's a fun and solid romp cut short by presumed abandonment. Current contents are worth reading though.

- linkffn(9978546) - *Mistaken Identity*

The Tenth Doctor (played by David Tennant) crashes into the HP universe and finds himself mistaken for Barty Crouch Junior (played by David Tennant). It's a short story but it's a good one and it's a lot of fun seeing the Doctor running around interacting with various characters.

- linkffn(*Harry Potter: The Last Avatar*)

A blend of the Harry Potter and ATLA universe with a good bit of AU sauce slathered over it, this is a quite compelling tale. Sadly abandoned though.

- linkffn(*All Hallow's Eve - New York*)

A fun one-shot which finds Harry Potter, Master of Death, rudely interrupted while grocery shopping when he is summoned by a madman from the Marvel Universe.

- linkffn(*Steve and The Barkeep*)

Captain America befriends Harry Potter, a local barkeeper. It's a nice story that'll leave you with a smile on your face.

- linkffn(*The Sea King* by Doghead Thirteen)

A one-shot crossover with Discovery Channel's Deadliest Catch, yes you read that right, has Hermione on a quest to track down Harry finally finding him, at sea. It's got some flaws but overall is surprisingly great.

- linkffn(*Avatar* by Von)

A crossover with James Cameron's Avatar. Harry wakes up from a magically induced coma and finds himself on an incredibly polluted Earth where magic is gone. He struggles to find a place for himself while also being in the eye of the public as a curiosity.

** Yo, here are my favourites...

- Like the Rain Chooses the Grass by Tsume Yuki

This is a HP/Black Panther xover. I recommend this fic because it has visible and well written character development, Tsume Yuki creates a realistic Erik Killmonger who you are able to empathize with, and it has the right mix of HP-verse and MCU-verse. In regards to Black Panther, Erik Killmonger is the nephew to a previous King of Wakanda. By Wakandan law, Erik has the right to fight for the crown. However, due to circumstances in Erik's childhood he became orphaned in the slums of America. Erik grows up fighting, studying and working his arse off trying to gain the Wakandan throne and better the lives of himself and all black people.

linkffn (like the rain chooses the grass by Tsume Yuki)

- Gives You Hell by azzie adams

I'll probably get crap for this because of the "obligatory" "ew Twilight" but, for reals, give it a chance. If you've ever read Twilight or watched the films you'll see that family (genetic and chosen) is a major concept in the plot. I believe that Gives You Hell really showcases the strong bonds that come with family that we choose throughout time. (Also, I really dig the mention of Albus and Gallert's previourelationship [which is canon]). You probably already know or have an idea about Twilight. "Teen" animal-blood-drinking vampires live in a small town in WA, USA when a trouble-magnet Bella Swan comes to town. She attracts human-blood-drinking vampires, head coven vampires and werewolves.

linkffn(Gives You Hell by azzie adams)

Also, I'd recommend checking out Araciel and AlwaysEatTheRude21's works on ffnet as they have a lot of good quality HP xover fics. (But they tend to start a lot of new fics and they update them sporadically if infrequently).

*** Thank you for your suggestions. While I have already read Tsume Yuki's work, it is a great suggestion, as it's one of my favourites that they've done recently, although I despair at Tsume Yuki's propensity to abandon their fics about 10 chapters in, just when I'm getting super invested (D:) Gives You Hell, however, I look forward to reading, and I certainly don't mind that it's Twilight; there's some good potential in the twilight universe, especially with vampires already present (and only briefly explored) in the HP universe. I've never heard of AlwaysEatTheRude21 before, but I shall definitely check out their works. Again, thank you for suggestions. <3

I was really hoping she might not do this with Tell it to the Marines, since she seemed really into writing it for a long time and got way further than the typical 5-10ish chapters, but alas that too seems to be done now since it's been almost a year since the last chapter. So many of her works have such interesting concepts and good starts, it's a shame nothing that isn't a one shot will ever be finished. And I'm saying that despite not even liking romance which much of her work usually features pretty heavily

** Linkffn(The Magic of Torchwood) is probably the best crossover with HP and Torchwood. It's pretty long, but the humor is great and the characterization of everyone is perfect. It's my favorite fanfiction and I reread it every chance I get.

Linkffn(De-Aged) is also a really good crossover between Doctor Who and HP. The characters are true to form, however, I will say there's not a lot of the main group of Harry Potter characters. I reread this one pretty often as well.

** Tad late here, but as someone who reads almost entirely crossovers, here would be my picks.

linkffn(12772385) This one is a HP and High School DxD Crossover where Harry and Ginny don't have a good marriage, so they break and Harry goes to Japan with their only child, Lily Luna. Also, this is updated close to monthly whenever the poll's lean its way (Almost always) with chapters of 30 to 60 thousand words.

The HSDxD verse itself is a very fanservice heavy harem anime, but it's set in a world where most gods/religious figures are real, resulting in very powerful people (and also harem). HSDxD revolves around a peerage (team/family of reincarnated devils) and its place in the supernatural world.

​

next up is linkffn(9443327) A Third Path is a HP and Marvel Comics crossover featuring a "dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty" launched into the marvel comicsverse (earth 616). Also its by the same author as above and below, and is updated every couple of months with huge chapters. (avg word count of 45K).

​

And here is my personal favorite out of this author's stories. linkffn(11577249) is an HP and Star Wars crossover which takes place pre--prequel and involves Harry meeting his mums ghost who's like "I have to go now." before he goes "NO!" and teleports his little kid self to a Galaxy Far Far Away. (Also has really long chapters, updated every 2-4 months.)

This is set in the Star Wars Legends verse (All the old books like the Thrawn Trilogy), but should be readable with just an understanding of the movies (though the Clone Wars tv show would help a tad).

​

Moving on from Vimesenthusiast, we have linkffn(12307781) which is an EWE (I think that's how you use it at least) story where Harry moves to New York a couple months before Marvel's Avengers (2012). Story is updated 1-2 times a week and is currently moving into Civil War. (Kind've assumed you've watched the MCU here, lmk if you need more of an explanation.)

Also, I'd like to second the recommendation of 'Wand and Shield' great story.

​

linkffn(7591040, 8186304, 10301672) The Queen who fell to Earth and it's 2 sequels (discontinued) are HP and Dragonriders of Pern crossover stories where during the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry realizes he has no chance and decides that suicide by dragon is a good way to go. Instead of that happening though, one of the eggs hatch and the dragonet bonds with him as well as reawakening the intelligence buried within all Dragons. Kind of a political story and I think the pairing is supposed to be HP/HG/f!OC.

Dragonriders of Pern itself is a book series by the now deceased Anne McCaffrey and her son Todd. It's a story about humans living on a planet called Pern which is struck by astral attacks of 'Thread' that rain from the sky and eat organic matter for 50 years every 200. (Knowledge of Pern isn't really necessary for TQwftE, but it does make the story a bit more fun.)

​

linkffn(8096183) Is a D&D and HP crossover where a D&D character 'Milo' is summoned to the HP world by Lucius Malfoy, battling off the weirdos with masks, Milo gets picked up at Hogsmeade and is sent to Hogwarts to learn magic... which he can't perform as it doesn't fit with his system. Pairing might be Milo(OC)/Hannah.

D&D knowledge is required to the extent of "I know how the stats work."

​

Back to DxD and we have linkffn(11976393). Sitting on a Bench is a 4-shot Harry and Koneko in the HSDxD world. No knowledge of DxD is required. Cept for maybe knowing the characters, so a wiki could be useful for that. Or just tell me and I can provide dem knowledge drops.

​

linkffn(9622073) is a HP and Inheritance Cycle crossover featuring immortal dimension traveling MoD!Harry taking the place of Eragon's (The main char of IC) teacher 'Brom' as the latter died in front of him to poison.

IC is a 4 part series about Eragon and his Dragon Saphira as they battle against the Empire and it's dictator King Galbatorix. Thankfully, they have help in the form of the Varden, the Dwarves, and the Elves. (Parallels Star Wars a lot.)

​

linkffn(10716188) is an HP and Naruto cross where Harry is Naruto's cousin or something, Naruto finds out he has a cousin, and goes to meet cousin. Cousin takes him in, summons to soul of dead father of cousin, and talks to dead father of cousin before going with cousin back to cousin's home.

At the current point of the story (Not being updated in over a year being that point), very minor knowledge of Naruto is required, some names and places will do.

​

Also, seconding 'Itachi, Is That A Baby'.

​

linkffn(4044086) HP and Naruto where they have a shared mental space and grow up spending the nights with each other, Naruto mentions chakra, and Harry learns magic pre-Hogwarts. Knowledge of Naruto up to end of Part 1 is quite useful.)

​

llinkffn(12091997) Harry is reborn in the world of Remnant (from RWBY by Roosterteeth) and is found by Qrow Branwen (An important character in RWBY canon).

Remnant is a planet where Humanity has been forced behind walls by the forces of the Grimm, infinite waves of black soulless beasts. The main characters are four girls who go to a school for Huntsmen and Huntresses, those who protect humanity from the Grimm.

​

linkffn(11815818,12651746) Harry is kidnapped by order of Lucius Malfoy and ends up in Japan after 2nd year. Stuff happens, and he ends up trapped within Sword Art Online.

SAO is a light novel/anime series about a VRMMORPG without magic, which turned into a death game and trapping 10K starting players inside. Main characters are Kirito (loner, OPAF), Asuna (worst girl), and a bunch of harem girls who never get into the harem because there isn't one. (Argo best girl though.)

​

linkffn(11759933) and it's sequel linkffn(12089357) are HP/Star Wars stories where the Dark Lady of the Sith (like Darth Vater) is met by Riven, Bastille, and Darth Marr (Basically important people from hundreds of years before the prequels), they send her to earth to train a new order of force users to prepare for the Empire. She arrives just in time to watch Voldemort kill Lily, scare him away, and adopt Harry. Starring characters include, Horcruxes, Susan, Daphne, Ginny (none of them being the pairing), Remus, Sirius, Tonks, those other Dark Lords from Pottermore, and a few jedi from the prequels and SW: Clone Wars.

Knowledge required from Star Wars is watching the movies and Clone Wars, from HP you can safely continue ignoring Pottermore's existence as everything is explained in the story.

​

linkffn(4521407) Harry dies to Vernon when he's like 7, Snape betrays Dumbledore for Voldemort, and the Dark Lord controls most of Britan. Luna wishes for someone to help and Ben Skywalker crashes his X-Wing nearby.

Knowledge of Star Wars Legends would be "Ben Skywalker is Luke's kid, a Jedi Knight who fought in a galactic civil war, Jaina is Han and Leia's daughter, a Jedi Knight and 'Sword of the Jedi' as well as a fighter pilot, Alanna is Jaina's nephew, and her dead brother's daughter, Corran is a Correllian Jedi Knight and former member of Rogue Squadron, his kids Valin and Jysella are also here.

​

linkffn(11576387) is a fic where Kyle Katarn (Main character of some SW video games and Jedi Master) feels something in the force which urges him to go to earth. Find Harry being sad, and trains him.

Everything SW is explained pretty well.

​

linkffn(9068231) Harry fights in a war against demons, and in the last battle is sent through a destabilized portal sending him to Felucia (The planet that Aayla dies on) just in time to save Aayla Secura (The blue skinned lady with head tails).

​

And That'll do it! Thanks for reading my list, and I hope that you enjoy the stories here..

*** Also, as this didn't fit in the other comment, here are some other's that are also good but I feel were less suited for you.

​

linkffn(10321406) Harry is Kabuto from Naruto, does science, meets Stargate people, Harem and Multi-Crossover.

linkffn(11764236) People from a lot of media reincarnated as Harry (Han Solo, Gray, Grimmjow, Gaara).

linkffn(9586702) Harry is adopted by Zelretch, a dimension traveling vampire after Harry teleported and ended up with the Gorgon Sisters as adopted older siblings. (930K words).

linkffn(11723597) The Power He Knows Not is a dragon sealed with Harry that has enough power to kill gods, also Alive!Potters + Sisters.

linkffn(12521313) WBHL!Harry is sent to live with Dursleys, meets a super powerful kitsune who burns the Dursley's house down before taking him to Japan where they live in the harem including said Kitsune's daughter, and the goddess Amaterasu until the Tri-Wizard Tournament starts.

linkffn(12132088) Unspeakable-MoD!Harry jumps through the veil cause he's bored, ends up in the Mass Effect universe (Big tech squids trying to kill everything every 50K years), and he makes a bunch of big ships.

linkffn(10554923) Harry is teleported to Konoha as a 2 y/o, adopted by the bug family the Aburames, becomes a ninja.

linkffn(12221534) Percy Jackson from Percy Jackson fight someone with time powers, ends up back in time, and goes to Britan to keep from fucking anything up. 4th year start.

linkffn(9976928) Harry ends up in Japan a while before the Sekirei Plan begins (as a kid), gets a harem of aliens or something. (I haven't read it, but it looks good and is by a good author.)

linkffn(8933408) Harry ends up in... +the land of Warcraft?+ *googles* Azeroth, where he ends up part of a bunch of shit, Harry/Harem with no Warcraft knowledge required.

​

Enjoy!

**** Heh, that's good. I find that whenever I find a good fic recommendation/request there are only 1/2 fics that take maybe half a day to read so I figured that I might as well provide lots of options for lots of reading. Then I saw a post about hating massive lists of recommendations and got self conscious, glad to see you liked my recs.

*Harry Potter + Katekyo Hitman Reborn! Crossover*

The crossover itself isn't really visible at the start, tho part of that might be that I'm not overly familiar with Katekyo Hitman (I think I dropped the Manga quite quickly, might even be back when I watched Anime)... but to me this story is first a walkthrough of the HP story with a OP-(HP)politically savvy-(Female)Harry (which I enjoy greatly) with the Flames from Katekyo being introduced/discovered at the endgame of the HP story... then it seems like it's a walkthrough of the Katekyo story with HP cast being OP background characters.

The greatness imo (this story is my favorite atm) comes from the style of writing, where MCs actions/feelings are explained in a way I feel no other does... some randomish examples:

#+begin_quote
  Finding Pettigrew that very evening and getting framed for his murder and that of twelve innocent bystanders by the cowardly rat was all a bit too much for Sirius.
#+end_quote

I think it's the irreverence and past tense that make it for me...

#+begin_quote
  Squalo recognised that Luss had sent him the best Squads first. He even understood why the Sun Officer had made sure that for the early stages
#+end_quote

yea I think it's the irreverence.

#+begin_quote
  It had been four weeks since he'd changed Squads and Squalo still wasn't sure why the Mist-mook tailing Fuseau like a disgruntled duckling was called Bolla.
#+end_quote

and the way at least the Katekyo segment is chock full of these types of descriptions of events... I simply love the tone of it all.

oh, quick note; the Harry is Sirius' daughter blood adopted into the potters due to james being sterile thing... it's just there for 1-3chapters at the begining then mostly ignored. (I felt a bit skewed out about that semi-ntr part)

*** Thank you for this suggestion, although I have read this story before. I certainly enjoyed the story and enjoyed the writing and probably got to at least the halfway point before finally getting bored with the Katekyo part, but I did eventually tire of the very slow plot, unfortunately. I believe I still have the fic saved somewhere though, so it might be time to pick up where I left off and see if I still enjoy it. Thank you again for the recommendation though <3

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** The difference one man can make linkffn(11132113): I consider this is one of the best Harry Potter and GoT crossover fanfic. With magic, Harry unites the free folks and builds strong cities in preparation for the White Walkers, while making allies with other kingdoms in the south.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings.

** Flameraiser works :

Who's This White Kid? linkffn(13095858) which is an Avengers crossover. It's pretty recent so not so much to tell about it. Harry gets transported in the Avengers universe in his infant body and bonds with a panther. He's most likely in Africa and will encounter Wakandan population but it's speculation for now.

The Swallow and the Dragon linkffn(12343855) Witcher crossover where Harry meets Ciri after learning of the prophecy. It changes his life and after beating Voldemort he's bored (he's immortal) so he goes through the Veil hoping to find Ciri again. He does indeed stumble in her world long before her birth so he decides to wait for her while preparing the World to be better for when they'll finally meet again. Lot of world building and happens on a long period of time which I like.

Let's Try This Again linkffn(11761091) SW/HP crossover. Harry is tired of living but cannot die so Death try to cheer him up and send him in another universe. He meets Revan and Bastila. Revan disappears so Harry uses his unlimited time looking for him even if he must become a Sith for that. I like it because like with the Witcher crossover it happens on a long period of time and his immortality is put to good use.

  Harry wakes up in a strange jungle seemingly de-aged and without his wand. He has to figure out how to live in this whole new environment that he has seemingly warped to. And what the hell is a Wakanda? First few chapters will be about entry into the world and not much else. Obviously takes place in the Avengers universe. Will primarily use the MCU as a reference.

  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.

  Harry Potter is done with life. He did everything and all he wanted was to pass on to the next great adventure. Sadly, rules get in the way of this and he must now find a new way to keep living. It's not all bad though. At least he gets another chance to live life his way and on his terms. Warning: Mentions of attempted suicide and other stuff to come.
