Whatever Harry wrote for his divination homework starts to come true the following year. For each death Harry comes comes back the next day, like Kenny from South Park, he is the only one who remembers himself dying. They ask him why he didn't make it to charms class and he responds he was eaten by a dragon. They say no really where were you? They won't believe him even through it is true.


** Ron's did in canon 4th year. He is talking about fire and losing something important to him I think. Just kinda funny how they were doing it and laughing and it was true

*** Didn't someone say something about drowning twice? Second task, and then the sword of Gryffindor pool in book7.

**** The predictions were:

#+begin_quote
  Harry is in danger of burns
#+end_quote

He has to face a dragon in his First Task, as well as the Blast-Ended Skrewts in Care of Magical Creatures and the maze.

#+begin_quote
  Lose a treasured possession
#+end_quote

He loses Ron in the Second Task and had to find him.

#+begin_quote
  He'll be stabbed in the back by someone whom he thought was a friend
#+end_quote

Ron briefly goes cold on him and cancels their friendship, as well as Moody being a confidant who ultimately ended up a traitor. Either of these could qualify.

#+begin_quote
  Harry will come off worse in a fight
#+end_quote

Harry fights Voldemort proper, and while Harry does come out alive Voldemort definitely ended up a lot better off and Harry was off worse.

***** It was Ron.

#+begin_quote
  “You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione.

  “Oh am I?” said Ron, peering down at his predictions. “I'd better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.” GoF ch14

** Somewhat tangential idea. What if Harry got fed up with predicting his death and instead foretold great fortunes and those predictions all come true? Like, one day he wins big in some magical lottery, the next day he gets a harem, after that a trip to the moon, on Monday Malfoy stumbles and falls from some tower only to be saved by a big pile of dragon manure, then Umbridge chokes to death on a toad before Harry wins the Quidditch World Cup and so on.

*** Since it's practically crack from this, might as well go the full hog.

*ahem*

And then during the fifth year OWLs, Harry's Patronus attacks him. The overabundance of love and happiness exorcises the Horcrux, sending a magical backdraft which Squibs Voldemort, the Death Eaters, and the rest of the Horcruxes. Voldemort and company end up thrown in a muggle Insane Asylum where Voldemort is still in denial and the Death Eaters have to increase their acting skills when Voldemort cruicios them.
