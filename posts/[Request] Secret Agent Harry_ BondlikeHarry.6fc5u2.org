Post Canon, Het, Badass!Harry if you will

I'm looking for a Story, or set of Stories where Harry (while still being called Harry and not adopting someone else's identity) is asked by the government, Muggle or Magical, to join them as a Secret Agent to stop mad men around the world. Harry has his own "Potter Girl" each adventure, much like James Bond.


** I need more of these stories. The only one I read and really liked was linkffn(Midnight Blues) feels like a James Bond movie.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

** One of the "classics" of this fandom is The Paradigm Trilogy that consists of Paradigm of Uncertainty, The Show That Never Ends and the Hero with a Thousand Faces. All of them by Lori Summers.

They are old fics, the first one was written pre GoF (more than 17 years ago! Man that makes me feel old).

They are post-Voldemort, post Hogwarts fics. In it Harry is a spy for the Intelligence Division of the international Federation of Wizards.

You can find all three fics here:

** I've written "Harry Potter and the Spygirl", but that focuses on how Harry entered (or was dragged) into the world of secret agents and spies (and dealt with Voldemort).

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
