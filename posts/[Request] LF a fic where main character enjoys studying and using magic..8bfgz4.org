I'm looking for a fanfic where main character, be that Harry or someone else, has learning magic as his(or her) main goal.

What I don't want in it :

- Massive AU. I want the world the story takes place in to be as close to canon as possible.

- Scientification of magic. I don't want main character being the best because he knows math and physics, and all other characters do not.

- Overpowered main character. I'm fine with character becoming stronger with time, but I don't want him using wandless non verbal magic in his first year.

- As little of financial/political content as possible. I can only enjoy Harry teaming up with goblins to take back his money and become Lord Potter/Black/Slytherin for so much before it grows stale.

- Post Hogwarts/Maradeur era stuff. I want the story to take place during canon events.

- Using magic as a tool to achieve some goal. I want magic to /be/ this goal.

- Too much learning, not enough using. While I want learning magic to be the end goal for the main character, I want to see him actually using what he learned, rather than reading endless lists of spells he mastered.

The couple of stories that fit that request that I've read recently:

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts by Wu Gang]]. Harry is a bit too powerful for my tastes but his progression is logical.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk]]. Pretty much a perfect fit. The only downside is that it ended on a cliffhanger and hadn't updated in a while.

Those conditions eliminate a lot of good fics, but I suppose we need a specific kind of stories every once in a while.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]]: The main twist is that he needs to be better when the danger comes around the next time, so the trio aim to improve their overall skills in the most believable way.

This is a bit OP!Harry, but he doesn't get strong in one night, it's a rather steady progression, and Harry here /does/ love learning new magic:

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

The story really picks up with respect to Harry's intense desire to learn magic once he arrives at Durmstrang. I'd propose that it's worth a second look. Also, if you're a DLP member, there are several additional chapters in the WBA section there.

Oops Mary Sue still know exactly how to break magic.

Jererenot has JavaScript enabled "ser". In this way, he will break me, as I have doubts.

The story is from Arithmansi in mathematics, but is very fast.

Still, the subtitles are "magical" and "fascinating in the world of travel problems," which they opposed with Thomas Hackers and others hoping to speak, but you can not ... public opinion. 1, You can not be wrong.

There is a problem, on the basis of the state, and with fanatic water, there is a magic available to provide enhanced purity.

Howards elements AU? Otherwise, this is not mine for me

Fandom Henry best practices the job. (What are you sure about post-Ogwa but what?)

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
