This normally doesn't cause visible problems, but in the wake of a massive magical incident (Dragon-wielding dark lord? Lycanthropy outbreak? Fiendfyre storm?), a strange phenomenon occurs; every magic show, every children's performer, every high fantasy board game and video game and movie and book, all are inundated with countless reviews and online comments, all saying the same thing.\\
"There's no such thing as magic."\\
"There's no such thing as magic."\\
"There's no such thing as magic."\\
It can't be just a botnet, people are saying it in real life too; as time goes on, it seems like a reflex for these people, parroted every time magic is mentioned.\\
"There's no such thing as magic."\\
"There's no such thing as magic."\\
"There's no such thing as magic."\\
"There's no such thing as magic."...


** The economical effects scare me. And then there's the social ramifications. To a kid, EVERYTHING is magic. To the older generations, new things are magic. And then let's dip our metaphorical toe into the one thing I never like doing online: Religion. That alone would ruin a lot of stuff in the social, economic, AND social fields.

*** Huh, there would be economical effects, wouldn't there? Sales of popular franchises would plummet overnight, potential consumers taking a look and muttering 'no such thing as magic' before turning away.\\
Marketing groups and writers and designers refusing to think about magic, because there's No Such Thing, classical mythology going unresearched because No Such Thing As Magic, even people trying to research this strange turn away from myth, religion, the supernatural and fictional in the wake of disaster would have trouble getting a straight answer out of people.\\
And then what about the next generation? Kids who weren't obliviated? How would they handle their parents and an entire older generation refusing to have anything to do with fantasy fiction?

Well, it might be a bit much for people to outright refuse fiction and religion and stuff because 'there's no such thing as magic'. But I could see them being uneasy with fantasy fiction, looking for explanations like 'it's all secretly technology' or a Scooby-Doo twist or something, and being uncomfortable with the base premise of stories including that magic exists.

** It'd certainly open a can of worms if said Muggles later turned out to be the parents of a muggleborn.

*** That'd be creepy; at a gathering, kid tells his mum that something strange happened, like magic, and at once, half of the room goes 'there's no such thing as magic'.

And how would that affect their first meeting with a Hogwarts professor? Just a family repeating again and again 'there's no such thing as magic' regardless of how they try to prove it (presumably the kid learning from their parents' example).

**** Probably the professor would cancel the charm.
