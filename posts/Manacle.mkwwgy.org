I'm never one for dramione. I don't like that ship at all. It's always drarry for me and i read so much of it. I only read dramione when I need something straight to read in between for a change of pace but hod damn. Manacle is the best fanfic I've ever read. It's so raw, real, shows everything that ever happens in a war and so dark. The story was beautiful. Major rec.


** Please, please I'm begging you put a Nsfw and trigger warning on this...

Manacled is great, I loved it. But the themes are DARK. Very not suitable for underage people. If they want to read it fine, I can't stop them But this story has mutilation, rape, forced pregnancy, slavery, mental health abuse, stockholm syndrome, torture, just a bunch of very heavy themes that should not be taken lightly. And certainly not something I would be advertising without MASSIVE WARNINGS ON IT.

It's a... Romance... Sure... There's a story of two people getting together there yes. But christ it's the most unhealthy relationship I've ever seen. Very possessive... Not something to be admired.

Like OP says, it's a great story. Very Handmaid's Tale, it's an excellent insight into human behaviour, loyalties, power imbalances. The middle arc about the war is fantastic in how it's framed. All the characters are so mature and flawed, it's great to see Harry and Ron not be perfect. I adore the dark tone because it's what I enjoy reading but christ I had to read a lot of fluff after this it is HEAVY.

just, be warned and mind yourself. Don't read this for the romance, because it's not romantic. It's cruel and dark and twisted. Its possessive desire and need born from desperation. Not love.

**** Don't be! I'm an old granny who doesn't want young people reading naughty things, full well knowing I absolutely cannot control what they do.....

It the sudden Manacled revival worries me... All the Young Dudes is a lovely story where no one gets enslaved by a spooky murder man... I'm all for promoting that one!

***** To be honest, I'd rather not read the one you suggested. The one I read was the most truthful thing I've read even if it has magic and is a fantasy fiction. That is exactly how a war is. That is exactly how inhuman people can be and how it affects so much in the world. I'd rather not read a fake sugarcoated version because the truth is not sweet.

****** All the Young dudes is definately not sugar coated... Big struggles with alcoholism, depression, abuse, abandonment, cancer, drugs, growth. There's a lot of funny and sweet moments sure, but I love it because of how honest it is. Its a truly excellent look at the realities of growing up the the 70s, the HIV crises, homelessness, war, Thatcher. It's really well written.

Everyone harps about the Wolfstar which, yeah sure. But it's not a fluffy, sweet, pining, happy ending story. Trust me, I read Manacled because I like the dark stuff and angst. I don't read fluff ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‹

But it is a lot lighter than Manacled. I think everything is though! Sure look, if you're not into that then grand I'm not telling or asking you to read it. Just if honest looks at people and how they grow and interact with their environment is what you enjoy, then this is one to have in mind ðŸ˜Š

******* Is ATYD canon compliant? Knowing exactly how their stories end would make it rather difficult to enjoy. Every happy moment will be overshadowed by the ending. Manacled having the "Happy Ending" tag made the darkness quite bearable. Things are guaranteed to get better in Manacled while they only get worse for the Marauders. For some people this is actually worse.

******** It is and it isn't.

The ending is canon. But how it gets there is the adventure. And how you feel about the ending, even when you know what it is, changes completely through reading the story. I was sad about Lupin dying in Deathly Hallows. But after ATYD? Oh it means something completely different now.

Yeah I get that, it's difficult to read something when you know the end is going to be sad. I like it, I think because it makes the little happy moments all the more treasured. It really shows how we need to enjoy the little things, it makes every fight, every laugh just that more tense.

A happy ending is predictable. And (in my own opinion) just makes the intermediary conflict irrelevant? Because I know it'll be fine in the end so this fight has no weight in it? But I've never been one for fluff and comfort fics so obviously I'm biased here.

********* Personal preference I suppose, the way a fic ends seems to set my impression of a fic's "darkness". Stories where characters recover from some horrible trauma feel lighter to me than fics where the characters are happy and content until they are horribly murdered.

I have read a large amount of Marauder era time travel stories.I am tired of all the Jily pining, Snape bullying and other cliches. Would ATYD still be enjoyable? It is quite a large time investment.

********** I think so. Don't get me wrong, it's got Jily pining and Snape bullying, it's a Marauders story. But there's more to it.

But how they portray Remus is particularly brilliant. It's a lot of growth and adapting to unsuitable environments. It's a great look into history and what it was like growing up in the 70s. It's a brilliant look at character and what makes people act the way they do. It's sad and heartbreaking at times but it's also sweet and hopeful when it needs to be.

It's an excellent story where you can lose yourself in the world of It. Its rare to find a story with such good characterisations. All the characters are so flawed and niave and it shows, it makes their actions unpredictable.

It is worth it. It's long chapter wise but the chapters are short. And I wouldn't rec something I didn't honestly believe was worth it.

** Manacled ruined me. Let me tell you I didn't even read the full thing I skimmed through majority of it because as soon as I saw how dark it was I knew I couldn't enjoy it but was too curious to know what happens. But I got all the main details (I know because I went back to some parts if they didn't make sense) and it really is a very intricately planned, well thought out story especially when Hermiones memories come back and then some things Draco did suddenly make sense.

But damn did that fic drag my heart through mud, break into a hundred pieces, scatter the pieces over a pool of lava, mend itself somehow only to repeat the whole process at the ending.

Very dark, very heavy, it's one of the stories that will stay with you forever but my appreciation only extends to the author for writing something that, like you said, is literally what you expect a magical war to look like. And I can appreciate the love between Hermione and Draco being so strong, but I hate what happened to them and I hate what they went through so I just try not to think of it because I can never imagine going through a minute of what they went through ðŸ˜­

*** It is a romance. The fic won't work if it wasn't the romance. But it is so much more than that. It's about two people in a war from different sides and it's ugly and real. And romance is the reason it went on so well. But don't think of it just as romance. It deals with real issues of war like rape and torture and human experiment, sexism, mental health and illnesses, death and so much morem like an actual war story but with romance.

** I love this fic. It came out straight after the Handmaid's Tale tv adaptation, and after binge watching that the rape elements didn't seem as shocking. Now when I reread it, I can't cope with those chapters anymore so I skip to chapter 26, which is the beginning of the flashbacks. I love the depiction of the war against Voldemort, and how the compromises taint the ideals everyone started with
