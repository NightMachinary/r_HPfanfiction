Fic request:

I'd like fics where the master of death title means something, maybe Harry doesn't throw away the hallows or maybe he dies but it doesn't matter. I'd especially be interested in Harry interacting with death (especially if death is based on either the discworld death or the supernatural death).

Alternatively I've read several amusing fics where Lucifer or the Winchesters summon death and get Harry instead so anything with Master of Death!Harry interacting with supernatural characters would be appareciated.


** There is this one where he is master of death and he goes dimension hopping every time he dies and ends up in the marvel universe in Asgard and helps bring together Lokis kids . however i do not remeber the name. ill look and see maybe post it later
