**** It's not used at all in canon (but given the amount of HP fanon, that's not a very solid metric).

It originates from the Freemasons originally as an addition to, or replacement for, "amen" at the end of prayers. It didn't have any links to "magic" until it was adopted by modern pagans and in particular wiccans, when they became widespread in England in the 1950s (mainly because the "founder" of Wicca had links to the Freemasons, from what I've read).

If this were also true in the HP universe, it wouldn't really be in keeping with the fairly old fashioned setting of Wizarding Britain to use a New Age phrase that had only really been applied to magic 40 before HP is set. Though, of course, seeing as it's fiction you can also do whatever the hell you like.

Sorry for the impromptu etymology rant :)

A world where anyone can guarantee the truth of what they say so easily is a world where noone can lie about anything important, it's like deciding that Veritaserum is a 1st year potion made of mud, salt and flobberworm excrement that's also sold for a knut a gallon in any apothecary.

** Manipulative old coot, Dumbledork, on a few memorable (and cringey) occasions I have had the distinct displeasure of reading the phrase Dumb-as-a-door. Like...if you're gonna bash him, fine. But could everyone stop using the same 6 insults they pull out of the bashing-hat in lieu of coming up with an original insult?

Oh, and on the subject of bashing, Weasels in weasley bashing fics, and particularly Weaslette. I've read far too many fics with that as an insult. It pops up everywhere there is Ginny-bashing. Its not even etymologically correct-it would still be weasel, a girl weasel is called the same thing as a boy weasel, weasel is an english word, you wouldn't change the suffix, this phrase is literally aggravating to look at.

Mind you, I say all of this mostly in jest, I don't mean to personally insult authors who use these phrases in their writing, I just am especially annoyed by the words.

**** Good Ginny bashing stories usually feature some sort of fallen hero Ginny or manipulated Ginny, so she becomes this redeemable anti-hero. In the best Ginny-bashing stories, Ginny realizes she was being manipulated and sacrifices herself in some manner so that Harry and the Love Interest can escape/survive/win/marry/etc.

In Hermione bashing stories, she's portrayed as incredibly smart but misguided, and unwilling to listen to others. There's no redemption arc for Hermione, ever.

** I specifically hate the phrase “you wound me.” It's such low-tier banter. It's just some canned phrase that people can insert into ANY conversation when they want their character to seem clever and aloof, but they can't actually think of anything clever or aloof to say.

Ex;

“Well, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess if SOMEBODY did their job around here.”

“You wound me!”

“This is the worst meal I've ever eaten...”

“You wound me!”

“You're the worst friend ever.”

It pisses me off a lot.

Also in fics where it's a wbwl or divergence from Halloween night or even no change, the author almost always puts the first chapter as Voldemort walking down the village sneering at the "muggle brats collecting candy" and the sound of his robes alerts the potters to his presence, he blows the door in...

*** What you need to do is take your favourite text editor and change all the "For the Greater Goods." into "For Shits and Giggles."

Example

"Why did I have to be tortured by the Dursleys for 11 years professor?"

"It was all for the Shits and Giggles Harry. You wouldn't understand."

"Mindrape?"

"Shits and giggles."

"Giant snake?"

"Shits"

"Dementortown?"

"Giggles."

"O I see well it wasn't so bad then after all."

*Minx*. Harry is shy around girls, gets a gf, next day "You're such a minx!"

ps - I didn't source check this, but if British people run around saying fucking MINX then I'm terribly disappointed in you.
