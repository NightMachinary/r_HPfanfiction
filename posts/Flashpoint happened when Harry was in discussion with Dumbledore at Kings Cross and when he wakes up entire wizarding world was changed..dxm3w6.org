What changes you want in new reality? How will Harry react and cope with the new reality?


** Rowena Ravenclaw was a sociopath who carried out horrific experiments on both wizards and muggles in order to understand the exact origins of magic

Ravenclaw is the dark house and Ariana Dumbledore became this universe's Voldemort when she was sorted into the house and began thirsting for a way to understand when she was a Squib until mere months before the start of first year

She begins to see cracks in global society and forms a radical group of Squibs,Muggleborns and halfbloods in order to tear both wizarding and Muggle worlds down in order to rebuild them in a new way that would eradicate the world's problems at the cost of Ariana having eternal facist control

They call themselves the Enlightened Ones and Ravenclaw and Hufflpuff become recruiting grounds . Members include Ollivander,Luna(dangerously insane in this universe),all of Harry's canonical yearmates in those houses,Cedric (reluctantly continuing a family tradition) and even Hermione and Tonks

After an Enlightened Ones attack leaves his wife and infant son dead,Lucius Malfoy reluctantly ends his family's feud with the Weasleys and becomes a hero in the fight against Ariana resulting in him ironically becoming an advocate for peaceful magical cooperation

This universe's Lily Evans committed suicide after Ariana forced her to kill the newborn Draco

James Potter is a drunken lord who lost his love (Mary McDonald) to the Enlightened Ones and has stopped caring about anything and hopes he eventually drinks himself to death

Harry learns that this universe's Ron is in fact a spy for Ariana (who had given him the attention he always wanted) who provided information that resulted in the assassination of Minister Dolores Umbridge

When Harry arrives,Ariana has almost taken control of the Muggle world having already conquered the Wizarding one. Harry finds himself fighting his friends despite finding himself to be agreeing with their cause more and more as time goes on

Pretty rough but I think there are some good ideas here

** The Weasley's and Prewetts join Voldemort after Fabian and Gideon are accidentally killed by another member of the Order(perhap Sirius or Peter). Neville is captured by death eaters at a young age and trained as Voldemort's successor. Alice and Frank are still alive and have been trying to rescue Neville since he was taken. James and Lily are still alive, but are depressed as Rose, Harry's younger sister, was killed during a raid on the cottage.

Dumbledore is unmotivated after the war dragged on for nearly 20 years, he acts his age and can barely function most days. Voldemort turned his attention to the rest of Europe and has been steadily making ground in his conquest over the last ten years, amassing an army close to 30,000 wizards, werewolves, giants, and other dark creatures. He looks like and old Tom Riddle and not a weird snake man thing, and has charmed the French minister for magic, the Russian minister, and various other European Leaders.

The statute of secrecy is hanging on by a thread, sighting of wizards are almost common, and various muggle governments have even tried to capture young wizards and witches for experimentation but have been unsuccessful.

Voldemort spread his horcruxes around his territory, meaning if Harry had any knowledge about they're location, it is now useless. Because he never attacked the Potter's his soul is still split into seven pieces, giving his magical abilities a slight boost, which is why he was able to combat Dumbledore's attempts to stop him.
