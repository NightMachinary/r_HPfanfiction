Harry being giving potions? They are health potions because he isn't being fed enough during the summer Dumbledore not telling him everything about Tom? He is 12 years old. You don't tell twelve year olds the horrifying details about the war

Stuff like that but written seriously and not as crack No slash no hinny no harem no mugglewank no bashing


** I've had an idea brewing for a fic, where during an standard issue indy!Harry fic, he goes on the customary death eater murder spree, however due to plot and an ubseen amount of animated statues, two survives, and now he's locked in a legal battle where they are frankly willing to do whatever it takes to win.

They've got evidence, memories, and the standard array of things used by indy!Harry used to get srius out of jail behind them, and they have Harry on multiple charges of murder, dozens of counts of breaking and entering, hundreds of cases of theft, murder of a anceint and noble houses familiar, dozens of misuse of muggle artefacts violations (because Harry is smart enough not to use his easily tracked bone wand(Tm) [And due to an American author] used his Colt and Weston custom silenced ammoless, lightweight shrinkable Pankour Jackhammer to avenge his parents.) And worst of all for harry, the scope of his crimes (and an accidental breach into a Hungarian embassy using his magicly guided ICBM to take down Krankanoff, this is a case brought to the ICW, so his lordships can't save him now. How will Harrison win this legal battle, can a scapegoat be found, how is all of his plans blowing up in his face? How will the hearings go, and how will Dumbledore react to see the subject of his manipulations* stray so far from the path of good?

*Manipulations not included. *Please contact the local goblin arch-shaman if you believe yourself to be the subject of manipulations.

*** Mugglewank is making muggles far superior to wizards. Essentially it's like a perfect!Hermione trope applied to all muggles and Ron!Bashing tropes applied to all wizards.
