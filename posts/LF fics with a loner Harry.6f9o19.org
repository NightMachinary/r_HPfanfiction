I would prefer it be slash or no relationship at all. I would like if Harry is a loner but eventually does get a friend.

Unfinished but I love it, Harry's only friends ends up being Magical Creatures and Hagrid. Most everyone else ends up looking past him or looking to use him

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

I think I've read a lot of these, but can't come up with all of them right now. I might add more to this list later if I remember fics that I'm missing.

Art of Self-Fashioning- Harry is a bit of a sociopath, not the Boy Who Lived and therefore nobody pays attention to him, and can't really understand friendships. He eventually grows close to Neville (the BWL) and Terry. No relationship, but the author has written a lot of other slash.

Death of Today- HP/LV slash. Wildly AU. Harry grows up in an orphanage, Voldemort has NOT killed his parents, and Voldemort is a rising politician. Really good plot. This Harry doesn't like people and is a massive loner, but he eventually grows closer to Sirius, Daphne, Draco etc.

Sacrifices Arc (first book is Saving Connor)- Draco/Harry slash in later years. I pretty much spam-recommend this series in every thread, since it's my favorite fanfic of all time. Harry is raised to be his brother's (who is the BWL) guardian, and is told that he should not have any friends that take away attention from his brother. He tries to isolate himself, but Draco doesn't leave him alone in first year and they become best friends.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
