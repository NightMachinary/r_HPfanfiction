:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Please help me find 2 fics i've read before but somehow lost.

1. It's a fic where Harry somehow got transported to a future where Hermione effectively replaced Voldemort but is anti-pureblood instead after walking to his “death” in the forbidden forest in book 7. He gets found by Hagrid and/or McGonagall and thinks he's an imposter because his death was the catalyst to Hermione going Dark. Harry somehow manages to convince Hagrid he's real and gets told about the status of things. Meanwhile, Hermione while performing her duties as dictator of Magical Britain gets told of rumors about someone who looks like Harry being spotted and she is once again outraged by the so called Impostor. Oh and Ron is one of her bullied servants. I've only read up to this point and would like to know if more were written.

2. In fic number 2, Harry is basically the only male (i'm not sure if the condtion “since merlin” is attached. I may or may not be mixing it up with another story) that can perform magic (same as how magic is done in the canon) like witches can. Males like Ron, etc, still attend hogwarts with the girls but they learn different stuff and are treated like 2nd class citizens. I've read up until the sorting, where the sorting hat is baffled by harry's memories of performing what should be accidental magic but with more control. Harry's magic is not yet public knowledge at this point and this was where i lost it. He probably gets sorted in the next chapter and/or his magic gets outed but sadly i never got to read what comes next.

Any help regarding finding these fics will be much appreciated!

** I believe that the second one that you are looking for is a world of witches by zweltstein7, it is incomplete but I hope it is what you were looking for.

*** Oh, Wow! This is exactly it. I missed a few details including a big one with there being an OC twin sister and misremembered a few things but you're right on the money. Thank you so much! It's sad that there hasn't been updates all this time but at least i've got it out of the way and will stop wondering if there have been any. Cheers!
