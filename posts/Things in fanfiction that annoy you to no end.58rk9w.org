What do some authors do that just drives you insane? For me it would be when in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3584221/1/A-Twisted-Timeline][A Twisted Timeline]] he just tells everyone he's a mafia boss.

#+begin_quote
  "Reginald Baxter, Owner of the Daily Prophet."

  "Boss Allan Michael Barone, Mafia Boss."

I don't know if i'm more annoyed by the fact that he just blurts it out, or by the fact that Baxter doesn't even bat an eye.


** The obvious answers of bashing, but hte one that REALLY has been annoying me lately has been people who can/NOT/ remember that they're writing during the 1990's.

Y'know, people talking about cellphones like they're common place, or "and Ginny, after being exposed to them, became a big One Direction fan"... people who basically can't keep to the time period that they're writing to.

I know it gets harder and harder as we move further and further from the 90's, but 3rd year Harry shouldn't be making references to "Revenge of the Sith" or how Meteora is the best Linkin Park album.

Which also goes hand in hand pet peeve number two: Non-muggleborn wizards/witches being totally up to date with current muggle pop culture. Ron doesn't know what a television is, he does not think /insert-favorite-band-here/ is awesome. Harry spent 1-3 months in summer in the muggle world. He had to lay in the bushes to hear the 6 o clock news. He is not casually familiar with most muggle movies, especially the one that came out last week.

Of course, that last one has a little wiggle room. I forget what fic it was, but I read one where Harry mentions that he's seen the start of a lot of movies, but he was always ran out of the room about half way through. Give me a reason for why the character likes the modern muggle thing, and I can dig that, but just, randomly, Ginny and Luna arguing about who the better looking muggle singer is? nope!

and thirdly... which also goes back around to peeve number one... I hate when people don't do research.

I understand, fanfiction and all, but as a details oriented person... it REALLY gets my goat when, say, people talk about taking nice relaxing European vacations in 1942. Or when people talk about a job role without any real understanding of it. I mean.. I don't believe that you must have experience being a hacker to write about a hacker, but if a major character is gonna be a hacker, you should spend at least 30 minutes googling a little to make sure that what you know about hacking is accurate.

One that REALLY FRUSTRATED me the other day was kind of stupid. in the US military. you've got officers and enlisted. Big difference between the two. Most military jobs are enlisted OR officer. not both. They can share territory, but generally /the officer is there to tell the enlisted what to do/... there are some exceptions... but generally speaking, it's pretty true.

This fanfic... had a retired U.S officer talking about his two tours of duty, in a war that hadn't begun yet, in a specific division that had been deactivated (in 1995, which would be okay, except for that part about 'in a war that hasn't happened yet'), with one of those tours of duty (just one) as a position that is generally 'enlisted only', while again, being an officer, who was medically discharged after being somewhere he shouldn't have been (as in, on top of the tank, not in it), and being shot, but not killed, by a sniper. ... then the author went into glorious detail about his wonderful AK-47 with five 10-round clips, and how he was firing "7.62 x 39 mm rounds" and many, many other details that scream "damn I love me some guns" .... Ahem. I have never read a paragraph that infuriated me so QUICKLY.

...which actually leads me to pet peeve number four... "So, this wizarding thing has some problems, so we fixed it! :D"

You know... "harry, 16 year old minister for Magic, thought that it was dumb that everyone had to get on their knees to talk through the floo, so he gave everyone magic mirrors to communicate!" "This magical belt can deflect most minor magical curses, yet the entire auror division isn't using them!" or "Here, I created this potion that will let you resist Veritaserum!" or similar. One or two? maybe okay, but when half the book is "lol wizards are so dumb a 15 year old boy came up with a better idea" :)

Okay last one: Forgetting about characters/little details... This might be "and Harry agreed to keep the little snake who he named Amrita" or "And Harry rescued the girl, sat with her in the infirmary until monday when he had to go back to class...." and then not seeing that character again, even in passing, for CHAPTERS. For no good reason! meanwhile, Harry's going to classes or whatever, so it's entirely feasible that Amrita the snake should be hissing about, or that the other girl would get out of the hospital wing or whatever. Or "Hey harry, since you've defeated voldemort, can you still speak to snakes?" "Gosh Ron, I don't know. I haven't been around one to see." "2 years pass over the next 6 chapters. No further mention of speaking to snakes."

Okay, I"m done, I promise. .... ... the last few fics I've read have been pretty bad, can you tell? hahah.

**** Seriously, I do. It's actually really frustrating. I read on my kindle, and I tend to save a few dozen at once. Every last one of these crappy fics came highly recommended by someone (here, if I recall where I snagged my recommendations from last time) in some thread or another.

But they can't all be winners and to be a LITTLE more fair, one of the fics I really hated had some really neat worldbuilding... until I realized "this... this is all about rape, and how little boys can't help themselves." with some nice hefty doses of "oh look another sex scene with some quiet reminders of how they're only 14..." and it just left me feeling really kinda gross by the end of it.

and there have been worse ones. Oh man. I hate the "and harry is perfect and everything goes right and y'know stuff goes wrong, but it's okay, nothing is really a threat to harry." but that's not a pet peeve. that's just bad writing ;)

** You know, I can look past a lot. Poor spelling, not perfect grammar, weird tenses. My brain can compensate for that.

Bad plot? Well, if it is entertaining enough, I'm fine. Strange world building? Real world is strange as all hell.

But the thing that annoys me to no end is when a fic is so, so, so fucking stupid, yet it/the author thinks the fic is the cleverest fucking thing since Einstein quantized light. For examples of this, see damn near every single independent!Harry, manipulativeevil!Dumbledore, evil!Weasleys fic out there.

*** I think part of the problem there is a lot of fanfics tend to turn Luna into a weird parody of herself. like, not able to speak without mentioning wrackspurts and nargles with every. single. sentence. Yet in the books tha'ts not really who she is at all.

So the author is, in their own way "bashing" her.. .even if it's not meant maliciously! Often times, they think Luna's a fanciful and fun character, so the characters never get annoyed by the overdose of bizzarre behavior. I've seen a lot of fun fics where she's a seer or something, that makes her 'extra weird' behaviour make more sense.... but...

generally, it's because fanfic!Luna is rarely like canon!luna.

Also, Unbreakable Vows annoy me. Canon has them as something that's kind of a big deal, and that can make Mr. Weasley blow his top, and if you think about it, a vow that can cause instant death if broken, when the only other instant-death spell is the notoriously dark Avada Kedavra, would probably qualify as the darkest of magic as well.

But whenever I see Unbreakable Vows in fanfics, the characters all go 'Oh, I'm not telling you this important secret thing unless you make an Unbreakable Vow' or 'To hold this seat of office you need to take an Unbreakable Vow' or in a particularly bad example, 'We won't let you out of prison unless you take two Unbreakable Vows, one of which could kill you by accident and the other easily used to kill you on purpose'.

*** To be honest, wands having the trace on them before being sold makes more sense to me than some obscure charm cast on all kids without anyone of them noticing it (and it not being mentioned in any form before the latter books) - and no one able to break it either, not even a curse-breaker like Bill.

Although in that story, it ended up a moot point anyway - with Hermione and co. banned from returning to Hogwarts after taking their O.W.L.s, they were considered adults by the Ministry, so no more trace for them anyway.

**** I don't think it's a charm on every kid, just like the illusion that disguises Hogwarts probably isn't cast separately on every muggle, or Voldemort's Taboo was attached to the word, not everyone who said it. My theory is that the Trace is more like a radar (think massive scale Homenum Revelio) that is designed to pick up magic from wizards under seventeen.

Btw, I kept reading. Good stuff. One of the better fics I've read recently.

***** I'm very wary of using those kind of "superspells". They usually make no sense in a world, unless you go the route of "we forgot how to create those spells" to explain why there are no other, similar spells in use. (Not to mention that the "it detects magic cast around the underage wizard" explanation causes even more questions.)

Much easier to assume that the wands sold to new underage wizards are marked.

****** Superspells are canon. As to why, say, Voldemort doesn't craft a bloodline curse to obliterate all his foes right away in OotP, I put it down as - he's one dude. The Ministry isn't just a bunch of people in the sewers, they have the Trace, the Floo Network, the DoM. A great portrayal of this is in The One He Feared. Taure nicely lays out that no matter Voldemort's personal power, one wizard cannot just take the Ministry and the country willy-nilly.

*** This is an AU story. The author doesn't have to follow canon slavishly. Trace based on wands kind makes sense and is used in many many other fics. Although not confirmed, the canon neither disapproved that, so authors have a significant freedom in interpreting it.

Furthermore, there is no Fidelius Charm in that story, and Horcruxes were implemented in a much scarier way.

***** Yes, it's location based too.

The Ministry was watching #4 Privet Drive closely (and most likely other Muggleborns' homes), so any magic picked up there was assumed to be a violation. That also meant the Trace was NOT on the person or else the Ministry would be able to make the distinction.

I think Book 6 mentioned that the Ministry could not identify underage magic cast in Wizarding locations. But then Tom Riddle killed his own family in a NON MAGICAL location with his uncle's wand under age 17, and was not detected. These facts supported the interpretation that the Trace was based on location monitoring by the Ministry and the wand.

****** On the deaths of the Riddles, there's an interesting thing about that. What we're told is that Dumbledore believes that Tom Riddle killed his family and then Confunded his Uncle to take the blame for it. That doesn't work if he was under seventeen, since it would have been him in Riddle Manor casting spells.

An equally likely scenario that doesn't break the Trace but still fulfills the circumstances as Dumbledore related them: Tom used the Imperius on Morfin while still in the Gaunt's shack, where the Trace wouldn't cite him since the Gaunts were regular spell-users; Morfin went up the hill and killed the muggles, then returned to the shack; Riddle Obliviated Morfin and left.

What that says to me is that the Trace is on the child, probably from the moment they get a wand, but various locations around the country are 'safe zones' since any underage spell use is assumed to be monitored.

******** Actually, they are supposed to be on the person, only it works in a somewhat wonky way: the trace detects magic in the vicinity of underage wizards and witches, but it cannot detect whether this magic originated from them or not. As you most likely noticed, it's unlikely that the people whose job it is to send warnings to kids want to annoy adult wizards and witches, and as such it's quite possible that any---or at least most---magic done in the vicinity of an underage witch/wizard but in purely magical areas is attributed to the adults instead but they do know that something had been cast.

This is why what Dobby did went onto Harry (close to Harry, and it was a muggle area) whereas what Tom did likely got attributed to the Gaunts simply because they already had a history of ... being less than pleasant; on a random note, it may also be why Petunia said that Lily was using magic quite freely at home---there were two underage witch...izards in that area.

That said, personally I'm fine with whatever fanfic authors manage to conceive, be it about the trace of anything else really, for as long as they don't go “this is canon because it makes sense to me, people” (well, and for as long as it's actually written well); AU is fine, pretending to be canon-compliant when something clearly isn't is not fine. Though, as I had not read Starfox's things, I am writing that in general and not about anything they wrote.

** *World*

- Muggles/technology being depicted as able to defeat/get around magic.

- Muggle society being depicted as significantly more “enlightened” than wizarding society.

- Wizards displaying significant interest in Muggle culture or technology.

- Depiction of the wizarding world as stuck in the past, or having Victorian values. Wizarding society is its own unique thing, not Muggle society 100 years ago. In many respects it is more liberal than Muggle society. In some respects it is more conservative.

- Depiction of wizarding society as lacking innovation/static.

- Ancient magic that is depicted as more powerful or advanced than modern magic.

- A wizarding world with a functional nobility. A defunct nobility is acceptable.

- Backwater Britain (with respect to other magical nations).

- Backwater wizards (with respect to other magical species).

- A magical population that is too large. I feel like 30,000 wizards in Britain is the absolute maximum, but really it should be significantly less.

- A magical economy that is too large or sophisticated. Magical Britain is about the size of a small town. It shouldn't have billionaires, a stock market, or really any kind of sophisticated financial services.

- The idea that “Dark Lord” is a commonly used title, or even a magically real title, as opposed to a made-up title that originated with Voldemort.

- Casual use of the Unbreakable Vow.

- Casual use of Veritaserum.

- Making rare and obscure magic relatively common knowledge, in particular occlumency and horcruxes.

- Depiction of Aurors as magical police who have general enforcement duties, as opposed to specifically elite Dark wizard hunters (and occasionally VIP bodyguards).

- Depiction of Aurors as having a command structure, procedures etc which are reminiscent of Muggle police or military.

- Helpful Goblins who perform a great many functions which would more correctly lie with the government, law firms, and accountants.

*Magic*

- Any kind of magical exhaustion, including “concentration exhaustion”. Physical exhaustion and general tiredness are acceptable.

- Magic as energy, or as working within the same system of laws as physics (rather than overriding/breaking physical law).

- Non-permanent transfiguration.

- Depiction of wandless magic as equally versatile and powerful as wanded magic, capable of casting all the same spells as you can with a wand.

- Magic which is presented as simple to understand and learn. In particular: wish magic, where all you need is intent and willpower, and dictionary magic, where all you need to do is look up the incantation and wand movements and practice them.

- The idea that a wizard could cast powerful/advanced magic without having studied it in some form, whether that means reading up on it or experimenting with it themselves. Corollary: the idea that a wizard could have studied a piece of magic extensively but not cast it well. The most common and egregious example: Hermione who is an expert in magical theory but not so strong at actually casting magic, as opposed to a Harry who is great at casting powerful and advanced magic but doesn't really understand what he's doing.

- Magical oaths other than the Unbreakable Vow existing.

- A Veela's attractiveness coming from passive direct mental manipulation like the Imperius curse. In canon, the Imperius-like effect only happens when they sing and dance. The rest of the time they're just supernaturally beautiful, to which some people might react by saying stupid things, just as they do in real life, but of which there is no magically compulsive element.

*Harry*

- Characterisation of Harry which ignores his resilience and turns him into a crybaby, a nervous wreck, prone to emotional breakdowns, or infantilizes him.

- Characterisation of Harry that turns him into a genius.

- Characterisation of Harry that ignores the strengths and talents of his canon self.

- A Harry who rants and shouts at adults, and generally comports himself like a 7-year-old having a tantrum.

- A Harry who tells his life story including extremely private matters to everyone he meets.

- A Harry who constantly dispenses “wisdom” to his peers, such as telling Hermione not to believe everything she sees in a book the first time he meets her. It's transparent use of Harry as authorial avatar.

- A Harry who ditches Ron and Hermione as friends.

- Overstating the level of the Dursleys' abuse.

- A Harry whose wealth is overstated. He should be comfortably well off, but any galleon count that goes into the millions should be avoided.

- Making Harry short.

*Other characters*

- Any kind of bashing, especially of Dumbledore. Bashing turns characters into shallow cardboard cut-out villains who exist solely for Harry to knock down easily and thus look powerful/important/clever for doing so. But because the villain has been hollowed out, his defeat of them carries no glory. He's playing on easy mode.

- In particular, stupid/comic relief Ron, evil or incompetent Dumbledore, scheming Ginny, smothering Molly, jealous Hermione.

- Making Harry the only character who is capable of learning. Another common feature of bashing is rehashing the same conflict over and over, where a villain doesn't learn anything from the previous conflict and continues to make plans using their old, now disproven assumptions.

- Genius Hermione. She's clever, hard working, and has a very good memory. All laudable qualities. But she's no Dumbledore, or even a Snape.

- A Hermione who identifies more as a Muggle than a witch.

- A Fleur whose identity revolves around her Veela heritage as opposed to being a talented witch who just so happens to be extremely beautiful.

- Any characterisation of Voldemort which makes his worldview reasonable or removes his psychopathy.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him too noble, or affable once you gain his respect.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him a one dimensional evil villain.

- A Grindelwald who is made a 1-to-1 analogy of Hitler, or has functional connections to Hitler.

*Plot*

- Fics without a plot or plot structure.

- Any change made to the HP world which does not have corresponding changes to character motivations and actions. For example, in canon Voldemort could not penetrate Privet Drive during the summer. If your fanon makes it so that him taking Harry's blood does allow him to penetrate Privet Drive, you should also change character behaviours to match - Dumbledore would know this, and act accordingly. When an author changes the world but keeps Dumbledore's actions the same, and then criticises him in the story for those unsuitable actions, what the author is really doing is having the characters criticise their own poor writing.

- Fics that have Harry pick up a book in year five only to discover the “real nature of magic”. He's been at magic school for several years and has been getting pretty good grades. He already knows the real nature of magic. Authors always underestimate the extent of Harry's knowledge. Just because we're not shown it doesn't mean he's not learning it.

- Romantic partners who do not have their own lives, with their own circle of friends, their own dreams and ambitions which may clash with their partner's plans, their own opinions and beliefs which differ in some areas from those of their partner.

- Naive sex god eunuch Harry. That is, having female characters be attracted to Harry precisely because he's so insecure and freaks out at anything sexual. “You behave completely asexually, which is exactly why I want to have sex with you!” said no woman ever.

- Fics where Voldemort just sits around making pointless terrorist attacks but never actually does anything to try to take control of the wizarding world until a “final battle” with no strategic purpose.

- Inconsistency in the abilities that characters possess, especially their level of duelling ability or the use of any special talents. This inconsistency is more often than not used to force the plot in a direction which it would not naturally go, given those abilities.

- Rehash of the canon plotlines with no significant changes. Especially where the divergent elements of the fic mean that events should logically diverge, yet the fic finds ways to force the original canon storyline.

- Depiction of magical warfare that ignores the high mobility and stealth capabilities of wizards, as well as the relative lack of need for natural resources or land. We should be seeing skirmishes for strategic objectives, not significant pitched battles.

- As above, time travel/dimension travel stories where the travelling character very quickly ends up telling their life story to people they barely know.

- Time-travel/dimension-travel stories in which there is more than one travelling character, or the character(s) are able to move back and forth between times/dimensions.

When you say 'magical MRIs,' do you mean 'magical Magnetic Resonance Imaging' which I agree is rather fucking bonkers and more than slightly stupid, or did you typo and mean 'magical MREs' as in 'magical Meals Ready to Eat' which would actually be a relatively decent or even a good/interesting idea?

*** I agree with most of your list (well, except for the complaint about Goblins who provide things like accounting and legal services --- a century or a century and a half ago it was hardly uncommon for banking firms to provide general assistance of that sort to customers, and hardly uncommon for legal firms to provide banking help and generally manage someone's affairs, and the Wizarding world is tiny and has a touch of Victorian flavor to some of its institutions like Gringotts).

However, I think that in some sense, all of this is secondary. It's true that most people who want to write about such tropes are bad authors, but I'll argue that every single terrible trope you mention above /can be sold by a good enough author/. It's just rare that terribly many authors who are interested in such hackneyed and awful tropes are particularly good at writing. Given a good enough writer, though (as I've commented elsewhere on this post), I will buy almost anything, no matter how ridiculous, and I've seen real examples.

Hell, canon itself is an example of an amazingly good writer selling a hole-ridden plot and terrible world-building inconsistencies. (JKR's raw writing talent is underestimated by loads of people. She's excellent at her craft. She's really really really good at the writing and characterization, and I think that's why people love the stories. It takes a lot of careful reading to appreciate how casually she pulls this off, too, as though there was no effort involved, but clearly there was a lot of effort involved or she's over the top talented or probably both.)

So I would strongly argue that if someone had enough skill, they could make Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor of the Infinite Magical Inheritances or any of the other nauseating tropes work just fine.

(I'm almost tempted to take your complaint list and take it as a challenge to write something that includes as many of those as possible but works anyway just to try to demonstrate that the writing is what matters first and foremost, but the problem is that I'm not sure I'm even close to good enough to pull it off, and it would be a hell of a lot of work.)

Firstly, the magically compulsive effect caused by their singing and dancing.

Secondly, their magically enhanced physical beauty.

We know that there is a distinction between the two because Harry is affected by the former but not the latter. He was going to throw himself off the top box for their attention when they were singing, but when he walked past them in the camp he felt nothing, not even a milder form of the earlier compulsion.

So what explains the fact that people say stupid things around Veela if the magically compulsive effect is not in effect when they are not singing and dancing? Their second power, obviously. In real life, certain men will say stupid things to attractive women all the time. Just hang around a construction site and you will see this. Now imagine that the woman in question were more attractive than any woman who exists in real life. There is no magical compulsion needed to explain these actions.

  Harry is affected by the former but not the latter. He was going to throw himself off the top box for their attention when they were singing, but when he walked past them in the camp he felt nothing, not even a milder form of the earlier compulsion.
#+end_quote

Your response was a blank denial with no argument:

#+begin_quote
  there is no evidence that is the only aspect of their charm.
#+end_quote

Which is obviously an unsatisfactory argument. When Harry is confronted with Veela, he has two completely different experiences, one when they are singing/dancing, another where they are not. It is not merely a difference in magnitude, but a difference in kind. Harry feels *absolutely nothing* when he sees the Veela in the camp and they are not singing, but he was *completely enthralled* when they did sing.

That's not a difference in strength or intensity, it's the presence of a factor vs its complete absence.

The other "arguments" you attempt to employ are just incoherent. Take this for example:

#+begin_quote
  If there was no compulsive effect Ron would have hit on Fleur every time he glimpsed her in the great hall. But he manages to not make a (greater than normal for a teenage boy) fool of himself at Fleur except for the time she dials her charm up.
#+end_quote

It's the complete opposite of the logical position. Ron hitting on Fleur every time he saw her would be evidence that he had no control and was being compelled by her presence to do something. The fact that he does it sometimes but not others demonstrates that there is no compulsion. Rather it is normal human stupidity in the presence of desirable beauty, levelled up from real life levels by the Veela and Fleur being proportionally more beautiful. And just like people in real life, sometimes they will blurt something out, other times they will be able to control themselves.

Your only real argument of any weight is the particular wording used by JKR to describe this event on one occasion. And in this case it is you, not I, who are seeking to read the words contrary to their plain meaning. The plain meaning of the words "turn on the charm" is their common use as an established idiom. Reading the words literally as referring to a magical power is /contrary/ to their common meaning.

So that leaves you with the word "blast". This is problematic for you for two reasons:

1) A blast of something is contrary to the idea of a passive effect, because it implies activity.

2) In any case given the rest of the evidence that Veela compulsive effect is separate from their general beauty/presence, and given its proximity to the phrase "turn on the charm" referring to Fleur acting flirtatiously, the phrase can easily be read figuratively.

Incidentally, on the last point, I would happily say that a Veela laughing as part of being flirtatious, as a vocal expression, could contain a mild form of the singing-activated power. But still this does not help you as the position you are claiming is wrong was this pet peeve:

#+begin_quote
  A Veela's attractiveness coming from passive direct mental manipulation like the Imperius curse.
#+end_quote

Any effect created by a specific action like laughing, singing, dancing, etc would not count as passive as it is activated by certain actions as opposed to being a constant background effect.

Ron being affected is my whole argument. It creates an inconsistency that requires explanation. When Veela sing and dance, Harry and Ron are both affected. When they are merely present, Ron is (sometimes) affected but Harry never is.

It cannot be the same power both times because of that inconsistency. If it was the same power but weaker: a) Harry would still notice it and b) Ron would be correspondingly less affected, like Harry. It's absurd to hold that the power is so weak that it doesn't affect Harry at all but still strong enough to enthrall Ron.

#+begin_quote

You have been selective as hell here, which is rather telling. You have deliberately cut off the part where Harry was affected:

#+begin_quote
  But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was answered for him. Veela were women . . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen . . . except that they weren't --- they couldn't be --- human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their whitegold hair fan out behind them without wind . . . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human --- in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.

  The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. . . .

  And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box in to the stadium seemed a good idea . . . but would it be good enough?

  “Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione's voice from a long way off.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Is your claim.
#+end_quote

So not only are your arguments are bad, but your reading comprehension is not great either. You don't even seem to have understood the point you're arguing against. It was my position that this is false:

#+begin_quote
  A Veela's attractiveness coming from passive direct mental manipulation like the Imperius curse.
#+end_quote

That is to say, a Veela does not have any passive magical effect. A Veela only has a magically compulsive effect on people when she performs a piece of magic to do so. The performance of that piece of magic involves the use of their voice and physical movements. There is no "allure" like a compulsion field around them that is always there.

On top of the ability to perform a piece of compulsive magic with voice/movement, Veela also happen to be so stunningly beautiful that people occasionally do stupid things around them. There is nothing magical about this effect, it is merely people reacting to their physical beauty.

*That* is the position you're arguing against here.

#+begin_quote
  Since she was no more beautiful than usual something must have changed.
#+end_quote

Of course something changed, but that doesn't mean that the change was magical. Human behaviour is context dependant. Do you ask out every beautiful woman you see? Of course not. But you still ask some of them out, when you feel particularly brave or confident or you just can't help yourself because what have you got to lose.

No magical compulsion is required to explain Ron blurting things out some times but not others. In fact it would be weird if he /did/ do it all the time.

** #1 Pet Peeve: bad writing. I can accept all sorts of crud, no matter how unbelievable, if someone writes well, but if they write badly almost nothing will save the story. You can give me a goddamned Harry/Pansy fic and I'll read it if the writing is good. (Hell, I can name a couple of those.) I'll read fic where Harry is really a watermelon vegemagus and discovers at a mysterious ceremony at Gringotts' that he's Lord of All The World's Feral Cats and can command armies of them to lick Voldemort to death with their sandpaper-like tongues if the writing is good.

However, if the writing sucks, it doesn't matter what the other qualities are like. I don't care if it's the most ingenious plot yet devised if the writing disappoints.

Not that I don't prefer fics where the writing is great /and/ the plot is great /and/ the characterization is great, of course, but the thing that I can't do without is good writing.

BTW, I kind of /like/ that the worst writers are sometimes so terrible that they leave spelling and grammar errors in the descriptions for their fics. Nothing warns you off better than the fact that someone has been updating something for six months and couldn't be bothered to fix the fact that they misspelled "Harry" as "hairry" in the description and even left the "H" in lower case the entire time. If they've stared at their own description on ff.net for dozens and dozens of updates and they never noticed a huge grammar or spelling error right in the blurb that they could have fixed in a second, it's a beautiful early warning.

(BTW, I can handle some grammar mistakes that slip through here and there, no one is perfect, and I can understand if you accidentally said "there" instead of "their" once and didn't notice, but we do live in an era where every editor spell checks by default. That red underline under half the words might, just might, be telling you something.)

Every single work with so much as a passing and entirely indirect reference, or even the subtlest hint at their existence, was destroyed over three hundred years ago at the order of the Concilium Ariolos! Every such book was burned with dragonfire and its ashes scattered to prevent reconstruction. Even to speak the word 'vegemagus' without authorization from the ICW is punishable by the Dementor's Kiss."

"So why are you telling me this?"

"Some of us," said Professor Sprout, "continue to practice the old ways in secret. Naturally there are great dangers involved in this, but the knowledge is precious. Regardless, every once in a while, we notice someone else who seems to possess the talent required. In your case, your latent ability is astonishing. You have more potential than anyone else since the great Flora Tannenbaum, perhaps even more than she did. I could smell the whiff of chlorophyll emanating from you from the first time you set foot in my greenhouses. Trust me, Harry, a vegemagus knows a vegemagus. Normally I would have waited until your seventh year to approach you, but The Dark Lord is a threat of such magnitude that we cannot afford to wait to begin your training."

Sprout looked straight into Harry's eyes and continued.

"But, be aware," she said. "There is a price."

"A price?" said Harry.

"Indeed. As you shall learn, to be a vegemagus is to be rooted to a lonely, blind path nourished only by manure and rainwater. But come, there is much to teach you, and I fear to discuss this with you further where we can be overheard."

** I might as well write a reply to this..

It is difficult for me to look past shitty grammar. If the grammar is good or I am feeling particularly charitable I will continue reading. After grammar what I look into is the plot and the story-telling. They are two different things. You might have a great plot but be a horrible story teller. Or vice versa. Chances are if the plot is terrible which basically means it's beyond any redemption then I won't read the story.

So for me the way you tell the story is important. Because it's all about getting me hooked. Believe it or not but chances are I probably have read something similar to what you already have written. It's how you write the story and add your own twists.

I don't dislike clichés. They're clichés for a reason because they work. But that doesn't mean there can't be something new to it.

Edit:

What annoys me the most is a rehash of fics. I dislike repetitiveness. I hate when thr author becomes stagnant. When the author is simply using other people's ideas as their own.

Another thing I hate is too many OCs. I prefer that the author work with Rowling's cast of characters. I hate to say this but I don't think there are many authors that are of calibre to introduce multiple original characters to their story. Usually even adding one is a challenge. Don't get me wrong, I love reading stories with oc. It's just that when there's a hoard of oc and the author is not doing them justice that it gets to me.

I hate when I read a story that I enjoyed enough to read the rest of the author's stories, only to realize about half way through book three that there are some VERY STRONG threads that run through ALL of the stories and well shit, I just found one of this person's non-sexual kinks, didn't I?

One example that comes to mind is... I read a very sweet Severitus where Snape rescues a very young (4? 5?) year old harry and there was a lot of hugging and back rubbing and carrying little Harry around on his hip and so forth. it was PERFECT for the story, which was basically just feel good cotton candy that didn't even cover to the age of 11, as I recall.

I enjoyed it, went to read the rest... more Severitus, which is fine by me. Here's one where Harry and Snape don't meet until he's at hogwarts.. and.... okay, they build a relationship over time and he's 14 fucking years old, where are you carrying him on your hip? and the relationships is basically exactly the same as it was for 5 year old Harry and Snape. Okay, well, he was really traumatized so I'l give that one a pass, except the same thing--complete with hip-carrying--happens in the next one too. Nope. I'm done. I feel dirty now.

....it's even worse when it happens with smut scenes between different fics. it's like a sudden window into the author's "porn" folder.

*** Oh, yes - that's a fear of mine, repeating myself. It's why I aim to change things in each story so it doesn't go down the same lane, with the same solution to the problem. Horcruxes are probably the main example for that - I try to make them different in each story where defeating Voldemort is part of the plot, just so the characters don't have to either reuse the same solution, or find convoluted reasons to try something different.

It does mean that I have to answer some reviews with "I already did that in X story, so it won't happen in this story".

** There's a lot of things that piss me off in fanfiction but something that I don't see a lot of people mention on threads like these and what's been bothering me a lot lately is when people just don't bother fact checking years, particularly years of birth. The most ridiculous to me of it is when in Marauder's Era fics people insist on making James and Lily attend Hogwarts at the same time as Molly and Arthur. Like what? I swear to God I've actually seen a few when they're in the same year and it instantly makes me so angry. Bill is, what? 10 years older than Ginny? By that logic, Molly and Arthur would have starting popping their kids out when they were eleven years old. Even if you're not confident in working out the exact years it's such easy information to google? People also put Lucius Malfoy in the same year group as Harry's parents and it always annoys me too. I suppose it's slightly more forgivable in that their years overlap somewhat, but his age is referenced at least twice in the books so you still shouldn't be doing it.

It just seems that a lot of people do it so they can play out the exact same relationships that we have in canon to a certain extent but just slap some different names on it, and in the end it's just boring and lazy.

I guess what really pisses me off tbh is just the fact that people can't be bothered to look up such easily found information. Like, I'm not asking you to know every single scrap of information about the HP universe but if it's basic information about a character that will literally take you a minute to google, yeah I'm gonna be annoyed if some random crap that doesn't make sense is in there instead.

** For me, it is authors who beg for reviews. This is especially prevalent for authors who ask for advice for such critical story elements as pairings, "what should I do with character XX," even down to "what should his animagus form be" and the like. Write your own goddamn story or post a CYOA on another site. If you don't have enough plot or ideas, fine, don't try to write a multiyear epic. Cut it down to a novella or a one shot.

Second thing that annoys me are authors (some of whom post here) who get hundreds of thousands of words into a story then abandon it. Abandoned stories annoy me - especially when the author then starts another one. I know as an author you owe me and your other readers nothing, but personal pride, to me, would mean I can't leave things undone. That's why nothing I am writing has been posted yet - I will finish it first. When I hit writers block, I skip ahead and write a different scene in the story, and come back when I get ideas.

Final thing is editing. While grammar, spelling, etc are important, having your work read by someone else is critical. With the hundreds of communities that exist on FF, not to mention DLP and others, there is no excuse to not have a beta editor.

Also when Harry comes into the story and solves everyone's problem. An example would be a HP/Avengers fanfic. Harry appears out of nowhere, charms Tony Stark's armor to be indestructible, helps sooth the Hulk's rage with his newfound phoenix powers, and heals Bucky Barnes' brainwashing with a hug and a few kind words.

This sort of insta-fix story is boring and lacks any kind of real conflict. So then the characters just sit around for 100k words rehashing some --quite frankly-- trite plot point that the author cooked up. Like Harry doesn't want to tell anyone that he's the Master of Death and thus immortal. Like THAT is going to finally tip the weirdness scale and freak people out.

*** Once upon a time, that was good fanfiction manners. Like, us old fogies did it EVERY TIME.

I'm talking out of my ass here AND GUESSING, but I would suspect it comes from the old days of print fanzines. (at which point, everyone goes 'what's that?') ... see, way back in the ways when the internet was NOT a household word, you still had people like us who loved certain shows or books.

So, you would have people who would collect stories and fan art and such from fans, and compile them into a paper magazine and mail it out. They were very, VERY firmly NOT FOR PROFIT, and were either given out for free, or for a small fee to make postage and printing costs a little more bearable for a labor of love.

I would SUSPECT that this is where the "I do not own this, I'm not making any money from this" disclaimer came from.... I've noticed that most of the harry potter stories that have that these days tend to be much older ones, or older authors in general.

When I was a kid in the 90's, putting the disclaimer on your fanfic before sending it to the email list or your geocities website was just what you DID. Because everyone else did it, so it must be important.

in addition to what I said above... fanfiction is technically kind of not really fully legal? But realistically, no one's going to pitch a fuss about it, but then you put your fanfiction behind a pay wall and start making money off of it is when legal departments start getting uncomfortable.

So, again "I am not making any money off of this story..." is a form of buttcovering.

I'm really sleepy, and the history of fan works is a long and complicated one that I"m not doing justice to. I will say this" most authors don't care about fanfic, or embrace it. but generally avoid reading it. :)

Rowling's lawyers, BTW, have said:

  However, lawyers on behalf of Ms. Rowling specifically noted that she has "no complaint about innocent fan fiction written by genuine Harry Potter fans" and she "is happy for spin-offs to be published online as long as the publications are not sold and it is made clear she was not involved in the stories", under the condition that they do not contain pornography or racism.

Obviously, the smut still happens, so I wouldn't feel too bad about writing it, jsut don't thrust it in her face. :)

*** I think it's because JKR's lawyers said a long time ago that she had no trouble with fanfic so long as no money is being made and it is clear that she has nothing to do with it. Part of it is also tradition at this point.
