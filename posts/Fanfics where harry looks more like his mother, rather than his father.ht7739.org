#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** I mean, most Fem!Harry stories I think would count.

Then there's linkffn(Harry and the Mysterious Curse of the Girl-Who-Lived) in which a Male Harry is cursed to be mistaken as a girl by the rest of the Wizarding world.

Also, TransFem!Harry stories like linkao3(Magical Metamorphosis) in which Harry/Holly actively makes herself look more like her mother.

#+begin_quote
  Around the time most young children do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence. So instead of seeing a scruffy, most-likely-a-muggleborn boy standing beside him in Madam Malkin's before their first year, Draco only has eyes for the scarlet haired, green-eyed creature who just walked into his life and instead of an enemy, he finds a reason to be better than he'd been raised to be. Not that Harry will ever notice, given he's trying to simply survive at Hogwarts.And Severus might not make it to see these boys graduate when his heart kept giving out seeing his very-Slytherin godson repeat his own history and go chasing after a green-eyed, red-haired Gryffindor. Turns out the Malfoys aren't that bad and Dumbledore definitely is. Remus is at his wit's end and Sirius gets a chance to actually live up to his title as Harry's dogfather. Tom Riddle is not prepared for any of this.

  Albus Dumbledore was sure he made the right choice when he sacrificed an innocent child. Too late he understood how terrible that mistake was. Harry Potter was not what he wanted him to be, he was not what the magical world expected him to be. He was not a replica of James. Instead, he inherited more of Lily... Far too much to be convenient.

  The appearance of a red headed baby on her doorstep turns one Mrs. Dursley's morning on it's head and some things just aren't meant to be the same from now on.   Why I wrote this: I love reading redhead Harry stories and I think there can honestly never be enough fics where Petunia is a decent human being so here it is. I've renamed Dudley because no matter how much of a prat he is in canon nobody deserves to be named Dudley.
