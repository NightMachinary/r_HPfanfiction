I have been reading a lot of crossover fanfiction lately and I have run into something that I have not seen on such a large scale; renaming Harry. I am aware that Hadrian and other such twists on his name are common enough that most people have ran into at least once. I have also run unit my fair share of Rose Potters too. I van in a way understand these. They help make someone's character stand out as being different, but still being 'Harry'.

What I don't understand would be the reason for completely renaming Harry to something completely different and contrived. When this happens I often wonder why the writer doesn't just make an OC character. I would add more, but I have to go back to work.

What are your thoughts?

Edit:just got an FYI the two biggest crossovers I was looking at were Addams family and PJO


** I dislike any renaming of any type. After all, a name has power, and to change a name is to change the character. You can make a story as AU as you want, but if Harry is still named Harry then he is still Harry. He draws to mind certain traits that you can sub out based off of plot differences. If his name is changed then he is greatly altered, it is no longer the same character.

*** What the? Names having power (literally) is fiction...does your name have some (very little) influence on you and other people? Sure!

Also: If you want to HIDE, why would you use your real name (particularly if you have magic and can just magic up a passport or leave the country without going through a border checkpoint or an airport!)?

All in all changing Harry's name is fine (if done for good reasons - if it's done just because than I don't like it at all!), as long as the author doesn't go over the top!

** People like Hadrian if they want to make him seem more "pureblood." To me, Hadrian is too contrived; Henry or Harold or Harrison makes a better legal name.

If it's fem!Harry, I'm okay with it if the name is Harriet. Rose is annoying. It's better when the nickname for her is Harry.

Names have specific associations, and since we've all read the books, we associate the name Harry with a specific persona. If Harry is renamed to something like "Aries Sirius Black" the character is basically an OC.

**** Maybe his real name is Harrison Bergeron, a genius of the mind, magic, and athleticism alike; but Dumbledore had suppressed the Bergeron family will to deprive him of his name and fortune; made his relatives starve him to cripple his body and abuse him to crush his spirit; and put blocks on his mind and on his magical core.

Fortunately, Harrison's talent and power prove too much for Dumbledore's machinations, and he teams up with Daphne Greengrass, whose beauty and grace have been similarly inhibited, to show the Wizarding World what's what.

** Granted, I haven't read all the fics, but of the ones I did read, only one pulled off the name change thing: Circular Reasoning. In it, Harry has an alternative name, but he also remains Harry and the other name is there for an actual reason that is well implemented instead of just the author's preference for Harry having a more "aristocratic" name or whatever. And even Harry has trouble accepting it when he learns about it. He goes "my name, my name, you can't take my name from me".

** Generally speaking, I think it's in poor taste to change a character's name, because it's one of those laws of fiction that you don't mess with. You can turn Harry into a girl or make Kirk and Spock gay, sure, but how ridiculous would it sound if Moby-Dick began with "Call me Mark"?

If you must change a name, however, make it one that fits, and isn't outlandishly ostentatious. Henry for Harry, I'll allow, since Harry is a diminutive for Henry and Henry is still a pretty normal name. Hadrian, on the other hand, makes no sense because his parents are named /James/ and /Lily/; why would they name him after a Roman Emperor? Also, Henry/Harry is already a name with royal connotations in England, so changing his name to Hadrian to make it sound 'more noble', is redundant, at best.

Fem!Harry's a weird one, since she is a character that doesn't actually exist, so you can technically choose any name. That being said, it probably should sound close to Harry; Rose Potter just makes me think of a fic where Ron and Hermione died, and Harry adopted an orphaned Rose.

As others have said, people don't create OCs because making a fic centring around OCs is a surefire way to make sure no one reads your fic.

As for my own writing, I pretty much never change names, even in crossovers or heavy AUs, where the canon names might come across as strange and outlandish in the new universe.

** First off, this is only how I feel about non-AU stories. If the author manages to pull off a succesful AU where it is explained /why/ 'Harry' has such an unusual name, I don't mind.

Hadrian or (worse, much worse) Harrison don't work for me because they are unusual names and thus run counter to one of the core concepts of the character: despite a wizard himself, and being the son of a wizard and a witch, and the Chosen One destined to save the world, he has a very common name.*\\
Much like James Bond in his series is not called Superspy McBadass but was named after some guy who wrote about flowers.

I can live with Henry or Harold as those are still normal names, and Harry is a plausible shorter form for it.

For girls, Harriet with nickname Harry is so contrived. Rose or another flower works perfectly as themed names seem to be a thing and both his mother and aunt have a flower name (see also male Harry: Harry, Tom, James are some of the most common male names).

*Another reason I am annoyed with the Pottermore bullcrap of calling James' father Fleamont. Charlus is a much more normal name, a variant of Charles, Fleamont is a very uncommon LAST NAME.

******* People use canon to mean different things, I suppose. I'd argue that if you write things that contradict the 7 core books, you're not writing canon-compliant stories, /but/ if you contradict any part of Pottermore, the movies, JKR's tweets or the companion books (Quidditch through the Ages etc.) then you're still holding onto the minimum requirements for something being canon. You should still mention it, especially if you call your story canon-compliant, but then it becomes a case of degrees.

Of course some people might have broader definitions of canon (much like real [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon][canon]]) but some things /must/ be included, and where there are contradictions then the source material should have priority.

********* Yes. I think a lot of people see canon more as 'what can I justify/get away with calling canon' than 'what is canon'. For them, a conflict or inconsistency is a license to call it either way and then say 'well, it's canon'. It's a bit annoying because it means that you sometimes can't tell which way the author's going to go until after it's already happened in the story (for example, in a 7th year fic where Harry saves Dobby and leaves him in the Burrow during the final fight against Voldemort - per book, he'd be fine, but per movie, he's dead, and if the author's been inconsistent so far you can't tell whether they're following the book or movie).

I don't mind AUs at all (currently I actually prefer them), as long as they're not accidental. If the author has a plan for a story that requires them to change a bunch of background crap, that's fine, but if they accidentally get names, dates, character personalities and the canon timeline all messed up it's not fun at all to read.

** Harry/Henry/Harold/James all work. Hadrian is a trash name given by trash parents and even trashier fanfic authors. Hadrian's Wall is a wall and the real Hadrian is dead, and no human being in the 21st century should be emulating either.

For the last name, if it can't be Potter, it can be Porter or Portis. Evans is great, and a similarly common last name in the UK is Jones - he could always choose Dursley, but while it would be a different name in the wizarding world, I can't imagine Harry wanting to link himself back to the Dursleys.

I've used Ezra Liber for Harry in a Skulduggery Pleasant crossover.

The thing is, in giving Harry a false name, you can still write as "Harry thought x and y", and "My name is Fakis Namen Smith," Harry said. It doesn't have to overtake Harry's existing identity.

**** Harry Potter is one of the worse worlds to add OCs too, because the world is in many ways defined very clearly. If there's a new character, their backstory needs to reference the in-universe past. You need to add family, or explain why they have none (and this will affect the character in ways you might not want). Due to the large number of existing characters, it's hard to make an original OC that isn't overpowered or a Mary Sue.

Furthermore, if you want them to be the protagonist, you either have to go /way/ off the beaten path in terms of setting or plot (like setting it 50 years in the past, or in a different country, or making the plot revolve around something other than Voldemort) or come up with a contrived reason for the prophecy to apply to them. It's usually easier to just use Harry and change his background.

Compare it to Pokemon, for example, where there's fewer constraints on OC main characters (and also many more good examples of stories that feature only OCs). The draw of Pokemon is in the world, not the specific characters and events of a twenty-year span, and so OC main characters work much better, simply due to the differences in source material.

** My view is a bit odd on the topic. For A male Harry, it has to be just that. Harry. He can have a million titles, and I really don't care, as long as the first bit of his legal name is Harry James. It's not Harry any other way.

Yet, on the other hand, I DESPISE people using Harriet with a passion, to a point where unless the first chapter is unbelievably well written, I'll just stop reading.

The way I see it, even if it's a 'Harry becomes a girl' story, that name will never represent them for me. It just seems like a cliche to try and make them the exact same character.

Personally, I never thought Harriet was a name either James or Lily would name a daughter, especially with the naming theme in Lily's family. Specifically if it's a born girl Harry, why would she use the nickname Harry. I don't think they need a male nickname to be similar enough to Harry's personality to almost be cannon.

I guess in conclusion, while I find some names for fem!Harry a bit over the top, and some I really don't think fit super well, anything is better than trying to make Harry female and then plaster the same name on top. It's a disservice to the original, and the OC.

Not even a brilliant AU of the "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][Ariana didn't die]] and therefore everything was different due to a slight change in the historical [[http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/][Conway's Game of Life]]" variety.

No, this requires re-working of the societal rules, structure and history to a far deeper, more significant level. HPMoR /could/ have pulled it of if Yudkowsky didn't decide to go with the most fucking pretentious name of all times, *while still keeping the first name as Harry*. Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin successfully pulls it off (even though it's a goddamned Hadrian). The Well Groomed Mind pulled it off (and with the far superior choice of Haraldr than Hadrian). Hell, even my favorite B-movie fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born][Basilisk-born]] makes it work, and that is because of the radically different origins of magic, and history of the Magical World present than can be inferred from canon.

*** Tdlr at the bottom

I agree it takes world building. I'm going to put what repost here my opinion on OCs.

It is a fair point. (people not wanting to read fics with OCs) I try to like OC fics when they are first written, but so often they are just used to bring the author themselves into a story. I don't mind so much of there is a reason that an OC is inserted, but only if there is some world building or reason for it.

This is also my opinion on changing the name. I think a good reason is needed. I added to my post just now about how the crossovers that brought up this train of thought were the Addams family and PJO. I understand that a godly parent might have some ideas, but why go with an overly Greek name? Apart from Percy a lot of the characters with some exceptions have fairly normal names.

Sorry for the long post Tl:dr I agree about world building when it comes to name changing and I would add that it is also my philosophy when it comes to OCs in general in fics.

I rather thought that the second sentence in my tl;dr would have given the joke away, but I guess some things just require too much inflection to work well through text alone.

*** Why did you spoiler alert your TL:DR?

And I agree, there are some AUs where having Harry's name remain Harry doesn't make sense.

** Names should match the character. A Harry, I suspect, would be much like his canon counterpart. A Hadrian, on the other hand, would be a pureblood elitist.

For Female Potters, Jasmine I think represents a straight run at 'Harry, but female'. Rose Potter signifies a Potter closer to Lily's typical personification.

All in all, I'm fine with renaming Harry. All works in view are AU--there exists only a single canon universe, and that is the universe that JK wrote.

** Harry isn't even a bad name and it's used by one of his pure-blooded ancestors anyway. However, at least in my opinion, it doesn't bother me if used by another person when angry or by an older person who tends to forget such things. As long as his real name is Harry and anything else is simply a nickname.

** Personally I don't really seeing it changed as there was a time when Tom, Dick, and Harry were common names and considering Prince Harry is a member of the royal family there is no reason to 'legitimize' it.

That said I don't mind and even like some of the changes when it makes sense and/or is relevant to the story such as in The Tears He Had Never Seen Her Cry linkffn(11575992)

In crossovers I normally find it silly to change Harry's name for various reasons except when Harry himself changes it to avoid attention.
