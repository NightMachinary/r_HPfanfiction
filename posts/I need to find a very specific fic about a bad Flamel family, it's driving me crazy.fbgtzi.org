:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok so.. English is not my first language so, be patient. Well.. the Flamels are bad and have a son (also really creepy, he steals pretty eyes, literally has a collection, and one of those are Luna's) and they didn't give up the stone but they want to do another one Is probably a Drarry fic. Lucius, Narcissa Remus and Severus (maybe) help Harry and Draco to stop the Flamels The house of the Flamels is in the Bermuda triangle and has a lot of traps and a f*cking loch Ness monster

Please, I need to find it. I didn't bookmark it and I don't remember where I read it. Thanks haha :)


** Lots of elements of The Sandman, have you tried searching crossovers?
