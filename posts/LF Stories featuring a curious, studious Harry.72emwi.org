** linkffn(Blindness) is also an option, but you get OP!Harry pretty quickly. It is a fun read though :)

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** linkffn(One World) is pretty good though abandoned, linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) is excellent. See also linkffn(Barefoot). Of course there's HPMOR linked by maniacallymottled already, and it's a good story (though a massive AU), but this story's Harry is not "Canon Harry except smarter and more studious", he's essentially a new character (though not a bad one, in my opinion). To a lesser extent linkffn(The Accidental Animagus).

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven]]) I keep recommending this fic, but really, it's fantastic.

Also maybe The Spellmaker, linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/689909]]). There's a relationship tagged, but it doesn't actually matter considering that the story was (presumably) abandoned before it got underway.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.
