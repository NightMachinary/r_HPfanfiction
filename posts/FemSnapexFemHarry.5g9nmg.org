Fem!SnapexFem!Harry


** Fem!Snape who develops an unhealthy obsession with Harry because he looks like the man she was crushing on, but hates his eyes.

So... not /too/ different from cannon if you don't make fem!Harry

** I've never even seen a fem!Snape before. You could definitely get some mileage out of it though...

*** You know, after thinking on that, I am surprised there has NOT been much if any in the way of Fem!Snape. I mean, apart from it being an intriguing twist, it also opens up the potential for a lot of interesting non slash pairings. From Fem!Snape/Voldemort to Fem!Snape/Dumbledore to Fem!Snape/Harry, and beyond.

**** A marauder era fic with a fem!snape would be hella wierd. Are James and Sirius still as antagonistic with Snape? Does Snape remain friends with Lily, or do they break apart even faster?

***** If anything I think Snape would be much closer friends with lily as a female. And I think the antagonism between James, Sirius and Snape would be much less as well for 2 main reasons. One, as a female the interaction would be different. Males tend to be more competitive with each other (at least openly), and the dynamic between the sexes would come into play. Hell... James or Sirius might even think of Fem!Snape as more of a conquest then competitor. In addition, since it would not me a "male" friend of Lily, James would likely have a completely different view of the role Fem!snape had in Lily's life.

****** Actually, you could probably write it all almost exactly the same if you make Fem!Snape a lesbian with a secret unrequited love for Lily and don't stray too out of character. Since you'd have all the same conflicts in place with the same personalities it would play out mostly the same overall. The most interesting bit would be how the author chooses to portray sexuality and gender roles in the Wizarding World and how Fem!Snape and Lily's muggle backgrounds mesh with that. For example the wizarding World could be much more liberal in those regards due to lack of religion, etc. than the relatively conservative muggle world. That sort of culture clash would mix well with the romantic antics of Fem!Snape, Lily, and the Marauders. Throw in some Voldemort Rising stuff in the background along with an ongoing prank war and that could make for a pretty good story.

**** Yeah, fics would diverge in /really/ interesting ways with an in-character fem!Snape. There'd have to be some AU tweaks to make the story hang together in the same way as canon. And I'd be partial to pairing her up with Voldemort just to see what Bellatrix would do ...

... damn it, there's another idea into the never-ending fic file of mine.

***** I literally have a library of fic ideas (like 50+ easy), and 4-5 started stories that I know I will never write or finish. Simply dont have the time to both write and read FF and have a life outside it haha. If only I was rich and did not have to work!

***** Funny you should bring a James Bond actress into this because my perfect casting for fem!Snape would have to be Eva Green. The woman has range -- crazy, alluring, ugly, dangerous, cruel, kind, she does it all. In fact, she did it in /one/ show, the recently departed /Penny Dreadful/. Seriously, just check out some of her [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud129OeFNXw][scenes -- NSFW --]] when her character on that show was [[/spoiler][possessed]].

Eye color can be fixed in post. Or handwaved entirely since it's, well, my headcanon genderflip casting.

****** I love Eva Green as much as anyone, but she makes a better Bellatrix. Realistically, fem!Snape would not be a sudden hottie. She'd still be too-pale, unappealing, with a hook nose and questionable dental care.

  As she reviewed her latest memories, Severa Snape thought she might have to revise her earlier assessment; this might very well be a potion-induced headache. Especially one that involved Harriet Potter.
