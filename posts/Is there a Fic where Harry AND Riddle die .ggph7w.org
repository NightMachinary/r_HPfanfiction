As the title say, I'm looking for a fanfic where both men die. I really would enjoy if there's one from Ginny, Hermione or Ron's PoV which isn't a one shot.

Also I include in my request fanfic where Harry goes in exil and never come back, since I think they're pretty similar.


** There's a decent one shot where Harry and riddle are on the top of the Astronomy tower and suicide together. Dumbledore finds all the horcruxes lying around, destroyed, and the suicide note. It mentioned greeting death like an old friend. I think it was TMR riddle, not Voldemort.

** There's one where the main character (not Harry) dies in the battle against Voldemort and the last chapter is Hermione and all the other characters reading the letters he prepared for the eventuality: Linkffn(A curse of truth)

It's a pretty major spoiler though.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  Waiting. He was always waiting. He'd already buried one best friend and now the other will follow. There was nothing he could do or say. There was no Harry without Hermione. Ron witnessed the beginning and now he must accept the end. HHr. 4parts Complete!

** There's a bit of a crack fic (with a few explicit sections) called Death Isn't All It's Cracked Up To Be by kinsfire where Harry uses a spell that separates Tom and Harry's souls and sends them both to hell.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
