I'd love to read some fics with the golden trio as the main pairing - but where they all love each other, not just where the boys are focused on Hermione. Though I don't mind if it's Harry-centric. But it doesn't have to be the pairing, I just want some recs for fics where they're incredibly, inseparably close. Preferably bonded by trauma as well - I love whump - but mostly where they're just so damn loving and loyal towards each other.

Does anyone have some good recs?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
