#+TITLE: Romilda Vane has a real life crush on Harry Potter, an ordinary boy. She dreamed up a series of adventures regarding him, making him The Boy Who Lived, who defeated the GOAT Dark Wizard. She didn't inject herself into the story too much because she knows that he doesn't reciprocate her affections.

*** Now I want a fanfiction where everything is the same, besides for the fact that Slytherins mascot isn't a snake, but a goat. Harry and Voldemort speak Goatseltognue instead of Parseltognue, and the Chamber of Secrets holds the GIANT GOAT MONSTER THAT KILLS YOU IF YOU LOOK AT IT. Ooh, and at the beginning of the series Harry will set a goat on his cousin, instead of a snake. And the spell Serpentsortia, will be changed to Goatentsortia. And Nagini can be a Goat as well!! That means Snape gets eaten by a goat...lol wat a loser. And at the end Neville slays the final goat-crux to defeat Voldemort! Baaaa!!!

**** You know, that's not a baaad idea. You should Goat-oo your computer and start writing. You might be able to horn in on that niche, without anyone on your tail. Maybe put on a little Baaach. Graci-ass in advance. :D

(I know an ass is technically a donkey, but I ran out of puns. :( )
