There's a fic that I read a while ago that I'm trying to find again. Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. He's an outcast for a while until he gets beat up and put in the hospital wing, I think it was a group of Gryffindors. The rest of the Slytherin house gets angry. I remember one specific scene where the Slytherin house walks into the Great Hall in unified groups after they find out Harry is in the hospital wing. It's bugging me really bad, so if you could help me that would be amazing.

**** No, I'm pretty sure it takes place in Harrys first year and he's more of an outcast. Thanks for trying though

** I know I read a fic where Slytherin!Harry was attacked by a group of Gryffindors - most of the students involved were expelled, but Ron had gotten cold feet at the last minute so he was put on probation or something instead. I think I remember a later scene where Arthur told Ron that Molly was wrong to teach then anti-Slytherin bias.

I don't remember what fic it was, but maybe that rings a bell for someone else?
