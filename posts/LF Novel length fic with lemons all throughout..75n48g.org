** ...What kind of lemons?

I checked Kevin3's work, but his Narration Irritation series didn't have any citrus-lemons, just a parody of smut-lemons.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsd1hfdnhLUkVwWkk][Harry Potter and the Secret of the Golden Unicorn]]

It's kind of a trainwreck but very entertaining. Basically, Harry inherits a brothel and also deals with Voldemort.

Characterization flies out the window, but the plot and pacing are decent. It's also complete.

Don't take it too seriously and I think you'll enjoy it.

** [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][HP and the Midnight Sun by Vanir]] - over the top cracky but still a fun romp for hybrid!Harry into Norse myth, which for some reason has chapter titles matching lines from a Lewis Carroll poem.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
