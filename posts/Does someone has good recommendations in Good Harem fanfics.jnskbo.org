Basically that's it, I love a good fanfic with Romance but also Harem... Obviously the plot has to be good but i like it with romantic scenes, I will give you a couple of example that i personally recommend -Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches -Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path So im not that picky but i Rather that they aren't mc going full Pokémon Catch them all kinda harem, If you can i rather without Genderbending (optional) And without getting into weird stuff like Mc being suddenly an Incubus and Male Veela (optional) Everything else cool, just i need those thing a cool Plot and good romance (don't care the House of Mc but i hate stupid mc so preferably a cunning Slytherin or a wise Ravenclaw) also if the story is finished please that have epilogue, i hate that they never mentioned how many children or what happened after the story... Other stories are appreciated too, but they have to be Really good like: (Other 2 recommendations) -Harry Potter and Prince of Slytherin -Harry Daniels and Order of Shadows


** Have you read The Power of Seven by Velvet Inferno? I can't link because of the rules but that is a harem. Be warned, it's got gratuitous underage sex, but I found the initial premise good, and it's a harem

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

** Harry Potter and the four founders by Darth Marrs seems right up your alley! It's a contained, non expanding harem, with real emotional connections and equality between Harry and wives, and the wives are treated as actual strong independent witches, not sex slaves. In fact, they rather enthusiastically consent. It's also got some very sweet romantic scenes, and a little bit of plot.

The girls are Luna, Hermione, Susan, Daphne, and Ginny. (small but not really important spoiler, harry inherits the lines of the 4 founders and thus can legally have a marriage for each line, so Hermione is lady gryffindor, Luna lady ravenclaw, and so on. Ginny marries the Potter line, so she gets what she's always wanted, just Harry.)
