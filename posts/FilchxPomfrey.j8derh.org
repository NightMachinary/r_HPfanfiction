"Filch, get in here please. Antonio Warbler left such a mess by his bed." "Filch, could I borrow you? I spilled some SkeleGrow on the floor and it's eating through the tiles." Filch didn't know why Pomfrey always called him in. Didn't she know he would get to her eventually? She didn't have to be there to watch him clean it. Though he had to admit he liked the tea she gave him for his aching muscles afterwards. No one appreciated a custodian more than a healer, after all.

Pomfrey would never tell Argus how gorgeous he was, strong aching muscles cleaning messes in a /magic castle/ all day long, barely a word of complaint, strong thighs lifting his bucket down long narrow passageways - yet Argus would never see it that way. He couldn't imagine a future with a /witch/. Oh Argus. She sighed and stirred the tea again, gently setting it on the table. This was all she could do. "Filch!"


** I...does Filch look more muscular in this?
