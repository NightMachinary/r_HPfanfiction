Please help, I'm drowning in cliches! What are some dark harry fics where he doesn't have any special superpowers, genius intellect, mega political influence, time travel knowledge, etc.? He could still be smart and strong but not any more than Tom Riddle was at same age. I just want to see Harry who is not a particularly good person and actually has to work hard to achieve things.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]], linkffn(4745329) Most realistic Slytherin Harry fic I know. He starts practicing Dark Magic and at the end of his fourth year / beginning of fifth you really see a difference between this Harry and canon Harry. He has friends (unlike Tom) but outside his trusted circle he arguably isn't a good person.

** linkffn(Too Young To Die) features Harry growing up as a child turning dark, without any particular magical abilities out of the ordinary. Of course Harry is a massive asshole to everyone, and generally engages in a whole host of immensely self-destructive behavior, ruining his and everyone else's lives for what looks to be a good goal.

It is kind of depressing, but definitely good.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
