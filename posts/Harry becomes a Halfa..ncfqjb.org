Basically, he becomes a Half-Ghost, like Danny Phantom.

There's, like, three moments in canon where it could happen.

1- When Harry is struck by the killing curse as an one-year old.

2- When Harry comes back to life after meeting Dumbledore in limbo.

3- When Harry becomes the owner of all three Deathly Hallows.

This almost writes itself!

** That kinda happens in Godling Ascending by High Pot in Noose. Femharry can interact with spiritual things including ghost and dementors.
