not just against Voldemort. So anyone who touches Harry with intent to harm will be burnt, /all/ harmful spells will bounce back on the attacker and anyone trying to physically assault Harry will be thrown away violently.


** The only close fic I can think of is linkffn(The-Boy-Who-Could-Not-Die). Its incomplete, short and mostly humor, but entertaining vision of a nigh immortal Harry nonetheless.

  At seven, Harry stumbles out of the car crash that killed his uncle despite the fact he should be dead. It is at this moment that he discovers that, unless a very specific weapon is used, he cannot suffer injury, he cannot feel pain, and he cannot die. Harry proceeds to abuse the hell out of this. A lot. Black comedy, dark, some bloody scenes, Harry/Ginny eventually

** Doesn't the Firebird Trilogy have this? Not actually managed to get past the first few chapters because it's weird but I think it starts with this as a premise. Doesn't seem to work on the Dursleys though.
