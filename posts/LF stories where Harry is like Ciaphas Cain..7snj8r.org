What it says on the title. I'm looking for stories where Harry just goes with the flow, looking awesome but while inwardly screaming. Crossovers are allowed but not preferable.

*** Ciaphias Cain, HERO OF THE IMPERIUM, is one of the God Emperor of Mankind's most beloved and blessed servants. Cain is a Commisar who also worked for the Holy Inquisiton and even with the adaptus astartes in many campaigns against the vile enemies of the Imperium.

He is also the star of a series of humorous novels set in the WH40K universe where he is sort of like Black Adder. Cain is a dirty coward who just wants to find somewhere safe to curl up and drink and gamble, but through a series of unlikely events he continually retreats in exacly the wrong way and ends up facing the most dangerous enemies. This gets him a reputation for bravery and he is constantly sent into ever more dangerous situations despite his best attempts to quietly retire somewhere.

**** If you don't know the WH40K novels, you might be more familiar with an older series with a similar hero, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flashman_Papers][Harry Flashman]].

***** He's a bit like Flashman in the Miles Gloriosus aspect but he's a lot more likable and less reprehensible, but Flashman books were certainly an inspiration to the author.

Not Harry, but it's Cedric Diggory written as exactly that kind of character.

  Cedric Diggory tells the story of his last year at Hogwarts, the Triwizard Tournament and an unlikely survival. Because Cedric Diggory did not die in Little Hangleton. Nor was he anyone's hero. Coward, lecher and cheat, but never hero. Complete.
