I've read a couple in the past. I'm happy to read a fic where this isn't the main focus, just a story where his parents are cured.


** linkffn(the lie I've lived)

Only one that comes to mind, and it's only Alice that gets healed.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  COMPLETE. [Sequel to Where in the World is Harry Potter?] Now that Harry has been found, he's going to teach DADA at Hogwarts again for the first time. Will he change and grow as a person? Will he find love? Enh... doubtful.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** The following, in varying degrees of "good".

linkffn(6413108)

To Shape and Change, where Snape is sent back in time after the light side fails to change things. Features- Snape is a decent person, Harry is superpowered (but like, also not? It's cool), and no forced romantic pairings.

linkffn(10772496) The Debt of Time, where Hermione is sent back in time because.. she was sent back in time. Closed loop time travel, means everything that you went back to change has already happened, you can't change anything. Pretty good story, super long. SiriusxHermione. Neville's parents are "cured" at the end.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
