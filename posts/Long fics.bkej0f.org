300k+ words, no slash, no Hermione/Draco/Voldemort/Snape/Sirius/Remus(Hr with any of these characters) pairing.

Especially if you know fics that don't reveal any pairings in the summary, but fit the criteria above. Fics with no romance at all are fine too.

If you know one where Dumbledore doesn't get bashed, please mention it specifically.

Thank you.


** /Soul Scars/ updated earlier today, and imo it's one of the best-written long fics without Dumbledore bashing. Not to mention it's one of the few fics to use a soul bond /well/.

#+begin_quote
  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.

** "The Arithmancer" by White Squirrel is easily one of my all time favorite fanfics and even one of my favorite stories of all time. The whole series is actually longer than the HP books and you will enjoy every word of it. I could wax poetic about it for ages, but you'll be better off just going to read it because it's bloody amazing.

** I second The Arithmancer. Other strong Hermione fics with no Dumbledore bashing I liked:

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined): Hermione has to leave Hogwarts due to new mudblood laws and starts a resistance group. Harry and Ron get mentoring by Dumbledore. Lots of battle action.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died): AU where Malfoy is a dictator, Dumbledore, Ron and Harry are in exile, Hermione is brainwashed and Voldemort is a half-naga.

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution): What do you do when the ruling pureblood elite write a law to force you to marry them? You kill them and become minister yourself, obviously.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief): Hermione is framed for theft and expelled. Dumbledore needs a skilled thief to break into death eater homes. And Harry wants to become an auror. How could that go wrong?

Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5): Pureblood tradition turned up to 11.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Harry Potter and the Natural 20

​

Crossover with a D&D character, it's hilarious, with some well done drama moments and 314k words long.

​

A slight knowledge of tabletop roleplaying is best to get it tho.
