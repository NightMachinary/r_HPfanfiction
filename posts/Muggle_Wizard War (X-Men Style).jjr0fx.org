If we go by the current Muggle technology then in case of a Muggle vs Wizards War, then Wizards win outright.

But let's say we give it a X-Men flavor.

We conclude that they is a magic gene that gives Wizards their powers.

What's stopping Wizards from losing if Muggles developed weapons similar to those in X-Men? A suit that can adapt to any type of magic.

Or even biological weapons? Perhaps a bio weapon that when launched against Wizards, it targets the magic gene, eliminating, thereby removing the Wizards' powers?


** With current tech the wizards lose in a pyrrhic victory. Yes they can kill with a flick of the wrist, they can also defend against stuff. But only if they know it's coming. They also need to breathe, so pepper spray, teargas, mustard gas, etc. Will take them out as well as it does non magicals, unless they are able to use a bubble headed charm, which seems to be quite difficult and uncommon. They are also out numbered thousands to one, which shouldn't be underestimated.

Apart from Harry's cloak, we know that all of their forms of invisibility are flawed, but we don't know what the limits are, eg. do they work against infrared?
