I read a SI fic some months back about a teacher contacting CWS and removing Harry from Privet Drive to her care.

I'm wondering if there are more fics where CWS gets involved and neither Albus nor the ministry interfere.

Thanks in advance.


** What SI fic?

*** Don't remember the name. I do remember the CWS person was a squib sister of a death eater, but nothing beyond that.

** If anyone knows one, I'd love to see a fic where this happens and the blood protection was actually as important as Dumbledore thought with the new family's home being attacked.
