Getting extra powers due to the "more than just a witch" bit is a bonus. Longer fics are preferable. Good examples of what I am looking for would by linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Spygirl by Starfox5) and linkffn(On Crimson Wings by Contramancer). An acceptable example would be linkffn(Eye Of The Tigress by pstibbons).

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  Everyone knew what veela were. Veela were magical creatures, breathtakingly beautiful, who captivated men with a single look. It would have been nice to have been that strain. Instead, Hermione Granger was infected by another. Instead of captivating all men, she was captivated by one. She'd die without him. She was already in almost constant pain. DRAMIONE.

** In linkffn(The Meaning of Father) she's performing dark rituals in an attempt to become an angel, which also gives her super powers. It's mostly a H/Hr romance story. It's also the only story I know of that features Jesus as a character (via the resurrection stone) and I really liked that part, despite me being an atheist.

As for Looks Can Be Deceiving, I think I tried to read it at least twice before, and it was so cringe-worthy that I could never get past chapter 1 or 2. Does it become better later on?

**** Um, specific kind of Animagus-type thing? It takes a while to get there. I'm really not sure how to describe it without spoiling.

I enjoyed both of them, and felt that they were in the same vein as Keogh. I would definitely say that the beginning is not the best part of the story. It does take a while to set up. But, I also know that different people find different styles to be unreadable.

** In linkffn(Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!) she and Harry are (magical) thieves. Also features Dark Lord Ron with his Harem and Snape receiving Yoghurt enemas.

Not sure if it counts, but in the one-shot linkffn(Caveat Inimici) she's an Unspeakable.

It's been a while that I've read it and I think it was rather mediocre, but in linkffn(Harry Potter and his Veela Mate) Hermione is a Veela.

I just mentioned the story yesterday, but in Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond by keiramarcos Hermione [[/spoiler][has a very special animagus transformation. It is revealed relatively late in the story and is not the most important point of the story]]. I don't want to spoil things too much.
