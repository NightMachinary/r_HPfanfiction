** Auror Tonks narrowly escaped the rain of killing curses when she's called to check. She sends out a Patronus to Bones and Shacklebolt for backup. As she lands behind some trees for cover, a German Shepherd Patronus materializes in front of her and speaks with the voice of one Mr. Longbottom, "Yippie Kayak, Other Buckets!!"

*** Snape finds the body of one of his men in the elevator with a stab wound and a note lying on top of him. Underneath a crude drawing of a flaming bird carrying a pointed hat are the words "HO HO HO. NOW I'VE GOT THE SWORD OF GRYFFINDOR!"

"NO MRS. WEASLEY I AM AN EXCEPTIONAL THIEF!"

"You have to the count of three to give me the access spells to the vault of bearer parchments in your basement."

"Why do you want the access codes? As soon as word gets out, they'll just change them at Gringott's in the morning"

"One..."

Snape's hand casually dropped to the table, grasping his wand.

"Two..."

Snape's wrist flicked upwards, pointing the wand dead ahead.

"What are you going to do..."

"Three..."

"I don't have the codes, I'm telling you, you're just going to have to kill me."

"Very well."

/Avada Kedavra!/

thunk.

Snape turned his head slightly to his left.

"You can break the codes, can you not?"

Mundungus Fletcher offered an oily grin. "Well, you didn't bring me along for my good looks."

--------------

Snape stood before the cowering heads of the corporation's holiday revelers. "I'm afraid your Mister Borgin won't be joining us for the rest of his life."

--------------

"GAH!"

"Whatchoo doin there, Mer?"

"Ugh, I just bit into a thousand year-old chocolate frog. What do they put into these things, anyway?"

"Milk, sugar, cocoa, vanilla, and animation charm #5. Everything a growing boy needs."

--------------

I *fucking love* this prompt.

"A common thief? There's a Philosopher's Stone in that vault. I am an exceptional thief."

** Snape would involve as few dunderhead minions as he could. He'd probably flood the building with a sleeping potion gas through the ventilation system, interrogate Takagi with veritaserum and get out with the bonds with zero casualties.
