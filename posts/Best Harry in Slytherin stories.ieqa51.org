** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness)

Harry actually feels like Harry in there instead of some indy edgy lord. The first few years are similar to canon but they're quite short and by fifth year it's very different.

****** Three books of 350k words each for the first years? Canon OOtP, the longest canon book, was 200k. I suppose 350k would be fine if it was content, not bloat. I read roughly until middle of year two and I can recall several occasions where one day took over a chapter without anything really happening. Like the plot isn't bad, but artificially inflating the story just makes it feel bland.

** It's not Harry, but linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds) does an excellent job of capturing Hermione's Slytherin side. She has a mission, and she'll use whatever tools, tell whatever lies, and make whatever sacrifices are necessary to bring it about.

The summary is a bit odd and I'm still not sure what it's trying to say, but my own summary would be that when Riddle dies, reality cracks and kills everyone nearby; Hogwarts' magic is deeply displeased by this, and sends Hermione back in time to prevent it, in the body of 10-year-old Cathal Rosier. Notably, she does her level best to avoid altering the original timeline, even to be helpful; she's there only to prevent the catastrophe.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
