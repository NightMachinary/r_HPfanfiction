Finished reading Hogwarts' Dawn by Jeconais and am hoping that someone has done similar stories seeing as Hogwarts Dawn hasn't updated in years..


** Sorry not a fic but is it on ffn or ao3? I've been looking for it but it seems to only be on this website where you need an account to read it.

***** Just some more info: fanficauthors.net has been *the* go to place for good fanfiction back in the day. Most big authors posted, sometimes exclusively, there from the mid 2000s onwards. So it is not some obscure, unknown website, if that was what you are thinking. If you have never read the fics that are exclusive to ffa.net, you are in for a treat working your way through them.

****** Wow, thanks! That must be why I don't see many fics from <2010s. Or maybe there is and im just an ignorant dumbass. I've also only started reading fan fiction for 2 years so that must explain why I've never heard of ffa.net before. Once again thanks for the info, I've needed more to fill my reading list for a while lol. ðŸ™‚

******* No problem, enjoy. Jeconais, Ruskbyte, Bobmin, Draco664 and whydoyouneedtoknow are the ones that most stand out from the authors there. Jeconais and Ruskbyte especially have written nothing that is not worth reading or at least checking out.
