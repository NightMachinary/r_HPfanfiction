Instead of the usual pro-tech cringe or pro-magic cringe, instead this fic would take them both and say, 'Both of you have your uses, and both of you are awesome.'


** That's what wizards did with the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Express#History][Hogwarts Express basically]], and to a lesser extent w/the wireless, phonograph, camera, Knight Bus, Ministry cars, Arthur Weasley's car, etc, whether either side wants to admit it or not. The magic vs science argument is stupid. Does canon magic override what Muggles consider science? Yes. But to say that wizards don't benefit from the use of science and the things created by Muggle science is stupid as well. (Yeah, yeah, wizards don't /technically/ need the Hogwarts Express or the Wizarding wireless or cameras, but we probably don't need a quarter of the shit we use either, so that point is somewhat moot.)

Also, if we are going by definitions, science is, as defined by Oxford dictionary (emphasis mine):

-the *intellectual and practical activity* encompassing the *systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.*

-*a systematically organized body of knowledge on a particular subject.*

-a particular *area of science*.

-*knowledge of any kind.*

If magic is part of the "physical and natural world" that has been "systemically studied" by wizards, and has "structure and behaviour" as shown by how potions, charms, transfiguration, etc can be observed, experimented with, replicated and taught to those capable of wielding it, then technically magic falls under science (albeit a part of the world that most Muggles are unaware exists). The knowledge of magic is organized in thousands of books, articles, newsletters, etc.

Muggle science was developed without the knowledge, observation or experimentation of magic, so of course magic seems to "break rules" that already exist.

** That actually sounds like a good fic, stuff like featherweight charms or rune clusters could enable spacecraft to possibly hit light speed if combined with rune clusters meant to boost power/energy generation, cooling runes, etc.

*** I'm thinking about writing something like this. Magic fire for power, conjuring reaction mass out of nowhere and other ways of magic augmented technology. It's a bit hard to keep things balanced, making nothing too powerful while also keeping somewhat realistic physics for everything magic doesn't explicitly interfere with. For example, if I write about a way anyone could build a really fast spaceship, I have to keep in mind that that also means anyone could build a really destructive kinetic impactor. How do geopolitics look like if random people have access to nuke levels of destruction?

** Magic has transport, storage and physical health. Muggle, however, has much more advanced ethics, scientific understanding and mental health. At least that's how I think of it.

Magic discoveries I'm pretty sure mostly come from the old 'spaghetti at a wall' approach. The thing is, they can afford to do that due to their higher base survivability and their much more advanced medical technologies.

Muggles have telephones, that allow you to have long conversations with far away people. Magicals instead just travel there almost instantaneously, but at a greater inconvenience.

***** That's a good point but human nature prevents humans from ever fully implementing them. As ironic as it is that wizards themselves suffer from the same shortcomings, especially him, Grindelwald is quite right when he says that he wants to fight against the Muggle arrogance, power-lust and barbarity.

  arrogance, power-lust and barbarity
#+end_quote

Those are human traits that wizards have just as well. Especially Grindelwald, who is arrogant (thinks himself better than muggles), power-hungry (about to take over several countries) and barbaric (dark magic, probably plenty of human sacrifice involved).

Accuse your enemy of doing what you're guilty of, a very common strategy among populists.

** The Last Mage of Krypton. Harry is Kal-El, sent to the Potters, not the Kent's. Once Harry finds his ship, Harry uses AI Jor-El to drag wizards into the modern age with a combination of Kryptonian magic and technology. Leans heavily on the higher tech and magic are the same thing trope.
