It's canon that she's quite smitten by Harry so I though there must be a few fics..


** I wonder how many more I have to write to wind up in one of these....

***** I've read the story 3 times over the years. I like it. But, there isn't a plot, and it's more of a Harry/Daphne fic than the actual tag. It's just fluff.

******** No. It's not. Harry and Daphne barely interact. The story is about Harry saving Gabrielle then about Gabrielle saving Harry. The entire story is about the way their relationship develops. The tag doesn't have to mean the pairing spend the story bumping uglies.

** Hope by that guy who isn't JBern, but has a name beginning with J and I currently can't for the life of me remember what the heck it is. He has a website of his own though, and he's one of the more well-known of the fandom. I enjoyed that. He has a few other fics with Harry Gabrielle pairings, but they sometimes skirt a little bit too close to Robst narrative structure for my taste. Your mileage may vary, feel free to check 'em out whenever you or anyone else works out what the name of the guy I'm referring to is.

There's also Back to the World, which is probably my personal favourite. It's quite nice in that slightly hopeful, slightly sad melancholic sort of way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11326267/1/Back-to-the-World]]

There's also the, uh, 'unique' Playmate. Be warned, it's quite sad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10027124/1/]]

There are a bunch more, but her being a Veela means that the vast majority of them are porn and that's not really my field. I know there's also a bunch of her paired with her sister and/or Ginny/Luna as well, some of which are porn and some of which are not, but I don't have links to those.

*** Thanks man, I just did a quick google search for "Harry Potter Gabrielle Delacour hope" and it was the first thing to come up. The author is called Jeconais, didn't know him/her but I'll check it out. I'll also check out the other two you recommended.

Yeah I've seen a bunch of nsfw fics with Harry/Gabrielle but I'm not into that as well :D

**** JECONAIS! Oh thank God. That was going to irritate me and it's seven past eleven here which is too freaking late for that. Egad. Thank you. But yes, Hope is very good.

*** I read the ‚Playmate‘-fic and I appreciate its existence for the writing and its more grounded view on such a ‚relationship‘, but damn did it tear me up.

Worth a read, but best followed up with something you like.

Pretty cute, although it is more about friendship and dealing with the war than about the eventual romance.
