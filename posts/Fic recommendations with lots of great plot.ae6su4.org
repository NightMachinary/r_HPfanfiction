I love reading fics with great plots and character relationships. My latest favorite was The Pretense by Colubrina. I also loved Aurelius. (As you might guess, I tend to read Dramionie, but I am open to other relationships or non-romance stories as long as the plot is more than just the relationship.)

*** I'm not sure what you mean. The two I listed are my best examples. Relationships develop, but it is part of a larger plot that had more to do with changes in the magical world (non canon). For example, in The Pretense, Yaxley takes over following Voldemort and is even worse. In the process of trying to overthrow him, Hermione and Draco need to work together and end up together. But it's about 50% of the story. Does that make sense?

**** I mean stories where the plot isn't as important because the relationships between the characters and their discussions, usually psychologically or philosophically driven, are put into focus. Dostoyevsky is a fan of this style. I've seen it in FanFiction a few times, but generally this genre is hard enough to find in the normal literature industry....

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** In terms of Dramione with great plot. I highly recommend some of everythursday/sage's work. They're not available online directly so they would need to be downloaded. Specifically, When the Bell Tolls and Parade of the Sun would be great starting points. For more recent stuff, you may want to take a look at:

** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Half a million words of great plot before Harry even gets to Hogwarts.

Focus on Sirius, Harry, Tonks, Remus, McKinnon, Draco, Hydrus (Draco's OC brother), Mad-Eye, Snape and Hermione once Hogwarts begins.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
