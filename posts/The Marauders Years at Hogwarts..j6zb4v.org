I know there are plenty of fics set while they were at Hogwarts, but are there any good ones that start with them all meeting until they graduate (or beyond)?\\
The only one I know of is Casting Moonshadows (which 10/10 recommend.) Curious of other authors takes on their time, though. As canon-compliant as possible.

(Bonus points if there's Wolfstar, but not a requirement.)


** All the Young Dudes. Mainly focused on Remus - completely canon compliant apart from that his father died when he was a kid so he was raised in a care home. Literally my favourite ever. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes]]
