Last year I read a Drarry fanfic and the writer said in an author's note that they did not want to go the stereotypical route with Ginny and portray her as a bad person. They wanted to keep her character intact and as close to canon as possible but then within the first chapter. The writer falls into almost every single villainous Ginny cliché out there

- *· She's highly aggressive, bordering on violent.........*
- *· She has had multiple affairs over the years*
- *· She admits she only really married Harry for his fame/mone*y
- ​

The only one that seems to be left out is dosing him with love potions and it seems to try excuse it with a sort of “well she married a closeted gay man......can you really blame her

​

Another story I read......involved Hermione married to a completely psychopathic Ron but its revealed in the first chapter she had always loved harry and only married Ron in order to be near him..........so she openly married a sadistic abuser so that she could one day steal the husband of her sister in law. She endangers her own small children while in pusuit of this dream.

Harry is also shown to mentally abuse Ginny, mocking her weight

In both cases it dosent feel like its meant to be bashing them.........but seems to bash them all the same.

The Hermione one she comes across as a complete monster basically

Is that bashing?


** Yes that is bashing

**** Indeliberate bashing and deliberate bashing are things so the fic is either just badly written or the author is accidentally doing it

** To me, bashing means to treat characters as worse than they would be in canon without having the excuse of character development to do so (For example: Ron the Death Eater after GoF is bashing. A Ron that, for some reason, grows up with the Malfoys with all their values that end up a Death Eater would not be bashing).

Here's some examples that I commonly see in fics I usually read (SS-centric).

Ron has jealousy issues in canon. Portraying him as jealous, potentially even to the point of losing the BFF status with Harry, would not be Ron-bashing -- it could have happened in slightly different circumstances. Portraying Ron as a Death Eater or someone who physically abuses Hermione would be Ron-bashing, because we have no reason to believe that canon Ron would behave this way.

Portraying James as getting off on bullying Slytherins (especially Snape) is not James-bashing, because it is a legitimate canon trait. Portraying James as having no redeemable qualities, willing to outright kill classmates, or being physically abusive towards Lily (or anyone else) would be James-bashing, because we have no reason to believe canon James would do this.

On the other hand, portraying Snape as a Death Eater willing to kill innocents during 1980 without remorse for it /is not Snape-bashing/, because our knowledge of canon Snape does not suggest him as unwilling to do something like this at the time. Doing the same at 1998? I'd consider it Snape-bashing, some other people may not.

*** In regards to Snape killing innocents in 1998 do you think it depends on the scenario? What if he's with other death eaters.....that will report back that he hesitated so he does it to keep his cover

**** Snape is a really good spy. Any guilt he would feel could be concealed. I referred to him having no qualms about killing innocents, even in the aftermath when removed from the immediate need to conceal his true allegiances.

** It reminds me of the good all "/No bashing, I'm just treating the characters as they deserve to be/".

I'm not convinced the Hermione of your example is Bashing. She is a monster yes, but depending of how the fic treat her, it could either be bashing, or setting her up as the antagonist. I think an important part of Bashing is the fact that Bashed characters are really mediocres (Retarded Ron that would be on the level of Crabbe and Goyle if not for Hermione letting him copy her homeworks, Love Potion Ginny that just loose her mind the second Harry tell her no, Manipulative Dumbledore who spend hours in his office plotting while eatin Lemon Drop, yet all his plans are thwarted by a 15 years old kid who spend a summer reading books and jogging . . .).

If an usually good character is presented as evil, but is still competent and threatening, is it still bashing?

*** the hermione is difficult because she's not portrayed as evil in fact she's presented as great but if you really listen to what she's saying you realise she's a freak.

And Harry is basically “ well if Ginny put on so much weight then maybe Harry wouldn't need to mentally abuse her

** Ginny can be very abrasive and borderline violent in Canon(hexing Smith when he was just irritating at best), and she does have a lot of prior relationships compared to Harry, Ron or Hermione so I don't even think those things mentioned are completely unreasonable

#+end_quote

She has exactly two boyfriends before getting together with Harry. Michael Corner and Dean Thomas. While Ginny "snogs" Dean in an empty classroom, we have no idea what her relationship with Michael was like.

Harry had dated Cho--though I'll admit that "dated" is a /very/ generous term to use.

Ron dated Lavender and Hermione dated Krum.

So that's two relationships compared to one a piece for Harry, Ron and Hermione.

Even the strictest definitions would say that is /not/ a "lot of prior relationships."

**** She did date other people with an 'end goal' of Harry in some people's mind. She wasn't cheating on them but if you squint hard enough after drinking a dozen shots and spinning around until you're dizzy, it does seem like a shitty thing to do.

***** It's a bit of a grey area because it's not like she's only dating these people to get his attention. She was trying to move on right?

In the doc she is outright cheating on Harry while married
