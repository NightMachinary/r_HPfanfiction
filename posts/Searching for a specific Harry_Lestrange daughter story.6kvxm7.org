Searching for an unfinished story where Harry was friends with the Lestrange's OC daughter(Cassiopeia, I think). Pretty sure it was around 60k words long and had 6 chapters. They had a falling out near the end. Pretty certain I read it on fictionhunt. He was sorted into Slytherin.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've been trying to find it for weeks on fictionhunt, AOE3, and FFN with no luck.


** Fictionhunt.com/read/10792840/1 maybe?

*** That's it! Looks like my memory was correct except for the chapter count.

EDIT - How'd you find it? I did a keyword search on fictionhunt almost daily but never found it. Tried all sorts of keywords.

**** I did a similar search but used google instead of fictionhunt's search. Just put what you want into Google and add site:fictionhunt.com at the end. Then it'll only show results from that site.

***** I tried google too, which is how I originally found the story, but when I tried to find the story nothing came up.

Didn't know about site:(website here).com thing though. Will use it.
