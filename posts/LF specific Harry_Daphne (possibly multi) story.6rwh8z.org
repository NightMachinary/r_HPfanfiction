I know for sure its Harry/Daphne but im unsure if he has any other girlfriends. I dont think so but its possible.

The main scene i remember is that Daphne suddenly breaks off things with Harry by owl and he finds out at a Wizengamot meeting that her father (i think) put some sort of slave/obedience collar on her and she was to marry a vampire, I believe. Harry goes ballistic, promptly kills said vampire and frees her, and they both escape to safety.

It is a completed story and any help would be appreciated.


** There are actually two versions of this!

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts)

linkffn(The Marriage Contracts Redux)

Both by Clell.

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.
