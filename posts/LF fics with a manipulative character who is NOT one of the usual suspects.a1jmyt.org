First time posting here, this subreddit gave me a lot of great recommendations (thank you, everyone!), so I hope you can help me. I found a lot of fics where a character is manipulating Harry and/or other characters for... reasons. And almost every time, the manipulator is Dumbledore, the Weasleys, or Dumbledore and the Weasleys.

I am simply looking for any good fic where the mastermind behind everything that happens is somebody else, if possible somebody that is usually not considered at all. Of course, with this premise I am expecting mostly crack fics, but if you have anything serious I would like it too! Any pairing is welcome, but I would prefer stories which do not focus only on the romance.

I do not know, maybe Minerva McGonagall is actually controlling Hogwarts behind the scenes, or the Prophecy is a plot to keep Dumbledore distracted while her clan of Scottish witches prepares to take over England. Maybe Xenophilus Lovegood is a crime lord and he is using the Quibbler to send secret messages to his minions. Maybe Harry is being dosed with love potions, but so is Ginny, because Oliver Wood has decided that a Potter - Weasley kid will be the greatest Quidditch player ever. Just... please, give me everything where the scheming person behind the curtain and their reasons are unexpected and original.


** I would read the crap out of the Oliver Wood Love Potion story, lol

** There was silence in the Forbidden Forest after Firenze left with Harry on his back.

"It's not like you to be so concerned with someone defying prophecy, Bane." Ronan finally said.\\
Bane just snorted, "It is when a boy like that is irritatingly noble. Too curious for his own good. I was hoping that the human Dark Lord would get rid of him tonight."\\
For a few seconds, Ronan's face was blank, before he lit up with comprehension, "Oh...too /noble/ and too /curious/. You'd never be able to blackmail him."\\
"Exactly. A worse goody-two-shoes than Dumbledore." Bane growled.

As the two centaurs turned to leave, Ronan paused and stared in the direction of the castle. An incorruptible child, perhaps he could...he couldn't be direct, not with the magical contract Bane had forced him into, but if he had a hint...\\
"Ronan, /come/."\\
The centaur shuddered as he turned and trotted at Bane's heels.

The funny thing about centaurs, is that they're good at Divination.\\
Most can see vague portents and predict the broad course of the future, that is true. But those who truly specialise in the art can see into the present and the past as well, and learn things that they ought not to know.\\
As you can imagine, that offers a lot of potential for blackmail.\\
Add a highly intelligent centaur with no moral scruples and a willingness to learn and use forbidden arts (so basically, a centaur Tom Riddle), and things get hairy indeed. Especially when said centaur has access to an illegally obtained wand and an unbridled hatred of humans.

'Bane' wasn't his original name, but it made an ideal pseudonym for a Dark Lord.

*** This is exactly what I was looking for! Great idea, and I can totally see Bane as a Dark Lord. Poor Ronan... If you ever make a longer fic with this idea please let me know, I would love to read it!

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
