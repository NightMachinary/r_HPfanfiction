I would like to read a re-writing of sixth and seventh years since many suggest that after book 5 it was the point where the series started to go downhill. I wonder what others came up with. Whether the primary plot remains in place (i.e. Riddle's past, the Horcrux hunt, Draco's conspiracy, the Hallows, Voldemort's reign) or not or if it completely diverges after OotP it doesn't matter as long as the characters' personalities remain mostly consistent with canon.

Thank you for the suggestion.


** linkffn(A Beautiful Lie by MaybeMayba) is one of my favorites. It has a great Mentor Dumbledore and even incorporates Grindelwald into the story really well. Harry/Fleur pairing

  As the looming shadow of Voldemort's threat grows, Harry prepares for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as choices and challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]]: Harry befriends Daphne in Year 6 and she (and Astoria) helps him a lot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] is rewrite after Year 4, but Year 5 still has Umbridge at school. Year 6 then becomes utterly and completely different. Dumbledore is cast in a very good light though, and this Voldemort is dope.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5648259/1/Elemental-Harry][Elemental Harry]]: Harry and Ginny gain super elemental powers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]]: Harry and Hermione run away from a marriage law (designed to screw them specifically) at beginning of Year 6, but they still direct war from behind the scene. Very helpful McGonagall, Snape, and the Grangers, but total bashing of Dumbledore. One of the best take on that marriage law atrocity.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]]: A little bit of crossover here, where super Hermione was activated during the DoM battle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][His Mother's Love]]: A more forceful Harry bullied the truth out of Dumbledore during their first private lesson.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]]: Divergent after Year 6, UK military and allied Wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge, and Voldemort. The Trio helps with Horcruxes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]]: Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. Chaos ensue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance][Resistance]]: Alternate Year 7 written before DH, features super Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]: Year 7 becomes a total clusterfuck for the heroes until they get catapulted into another dimension.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]]: Another alternate Year 7 fic written before DH. This author got Harry's and Snape's status right. Not to be confused with the popular "Seventh Horcrux".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully][Wish Carefully]]: After Dumbledore's death, Harry made a deal with Voldemort and let him build his 'Pureblood Utopia' in Britain.

*** “Escape” is probably the best of them, not changing the personalities too much (and no super!characters), but even better is its sequel/prequel “Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley” by SingularOddities linkffn(12373273), except it is Percy-centric, so there is not that much Hogwarts (well, there is not that much Hogwarts in “Escape” either, because HHr ... yes ... escaped).

  Percy met Audrey during a trying summer for Percy. Their relationship developed and eventually, they married and had children. This is a look at their story set over the course of events of the war and afterwards.

*** Reformed Returned and Really Trying doesn't have canon characterizations. Understandable, of course, since it's crack, but that's not what OP is looking for.
