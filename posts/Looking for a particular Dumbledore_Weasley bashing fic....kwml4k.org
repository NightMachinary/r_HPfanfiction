:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
...where Harry and Hermione manage to somehow get free of potions and curses and all that cliche stuff. They're planning to escape, but are discovered by Ron, who is obligated to report them to Dumbledore - his family is dependent on the man.

He instead suggests/allows Hermione to cast Obliviate on him, while knowing she only ever studied the theory and the most likely outcome is his brain turning to mush.

The fic itself wasn't much, but I'd like to find it simply for that scene - I loved Ron trying to balance loyalty to his family and his friends and being willing to make sacrifices to that end.

I'm pretty sure it was on FFN and posted at least 3 years ago. Maybe longer.
