What do you think would have happened if Peter Pettigrew ended up with Harry instead of Weasleys?


** Sirius Black broke out of Azkaban after seeing a photo of the Weasleys with Pettigrew as rat in the Daily Prophet.

So unless the Daily Prophet prints a photo of Harry with his pet rat on the same day instead of a photo of the Weasleys, Sirius won't break out of Azkaban.

As a consequence Remus Lupin might not become DADA teacher, at least not in 3rd year. Maybe 5th? Harry does not learn the Patronus spell in 3rd year. Pettigrew stays put as pet rat and does not flee - until Harry uses the Marauder's map and wonders about the name showing up next to him when it is just him and his pet rat. In which case Pettigrew is most likely to snatch the map, hide it and everything stays as it is.

Pettigrew is a very lazy person, he spent 12+ years as a rat, doing nothing but eating and sleeping. I cannot see him voluntarily leaving that position unless forced by circumstances.

Personally I would hope that Petunia would see a rat in her home and kill him without a second thought, ideally in the summer between first and second year. Dead he turns back into his own self, so they suddenly have a dead wizard at their hands. Could be fun working that angle.

*** Harry couldn't see Pettigrew on the map in the books, that was just in the movie. I assume the Marauders designed the map not to show themselves to non-Marauders.

**** No, this cannot be bc Lupin looks at the map in PoA and sees Pettigrew along with Black in the Shrieking Shack. This is why he rushes out to the Shrieking Shack despite it being close to the full moon. (Chapter Cat, Rat and Dog, page 254 of the Bloomsbury paperback edition)

***** Lupin's a Marauder. The Map reacts differently to him.

** There were plenty of pictures of Harry published in fourth year, so Sirius might have broken out a year later.
