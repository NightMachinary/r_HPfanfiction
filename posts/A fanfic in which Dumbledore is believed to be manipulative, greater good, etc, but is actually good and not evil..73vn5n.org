For instance, something similar to "Harry Potter and the Manipulative Old Coot."

linkffn(12344176)


** Just imagining Dumbledore wanting Harry to be more proactive and everything else he's tried hasn't worked.

"Ah, Rocktoe! I'm here to discuss the Potter trust. What I want to have happen is once a month to transfer 1000 galleons from that account into this one, and then transfer it all back into the original vault."

"Ron, I am glad to have caught you. I must ask that you spy on Harry for me." "Bleeding hell, Professor, What do you take me for, some slimey snake?" "Very well, you have refused and I accept that. 10 points to Gryffindor for protecting your friends secrets."

Months pass.

A very angry Harry Potter is glaring at Dumbledore from the other side of the desk. "Would you like a lemon sherbet, Harry?" "No! I don't want anything from you, you manipulative old geezer!" " Or maybe some orange juice? You're looking peaky. I know I get crabby when I haven't had enough sugar." "I want for you to give me my life back! I found out that you were taking money from my vault and you asked my friends to spy on me!"

  A straight reading of canon suggests that Dumbledore is an evil manipulator. That's not the only explanation.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** Ok, as someone that really fucking hates shitty romance angst, is it worth reading A Cadmean Victory? I understand it has got the whole OP!Harry thing, and he's turning dark, but I really don't want to read Harry/Katie and then get disappointed when it (apparently) switches tracks to Harry/Fleur

**** Well the fic made it clear pretty early on that Harry is not interested in Katie that way. The friendship between them i found fun. Personally i liked that it didn't follow the "You're female, we get along, lets be together forever and ever and make babies" trope.

Harry and Katie dated, didn't work out, Harry got involved with Fleur. There was angst in the story, but it wasn't really romance related.

***** I know what you mean. Most romance fics have the 'one-true love' trope, using some stupid analogy to a river or flowers to describe their eyes, for some reason.

Cheers though, I'll read it.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.

** It's /kind of/ like this, except you do see him try and you do see the truth at the end, in Silens Cursor's “Renegade Cause”. I have no idea if it actually is something you want here so I'll leave that and won't link in case it isn't.
