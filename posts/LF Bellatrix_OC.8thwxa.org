i took this idea from Fullmetal Alchemist Episode 35: Reunion of the Fallen and want to know if there are similar fics like this. So, Bellatrix meets an OC guy and teaches him stuff and he falls for her. Or she loses her Memories and so they have a Relationship, but in the end, when she regains her Memories (and in any other Case) she kills him. Possible Lemon\\
It doesnt have to be Bellatrix and the OC can either be a Wizard or a Muggle
