I think it's time for Hermione to have her own adventure where she is the main character. So I challenge you to write a Hermione/Arthur P. or Hermione/Merlin where she goes back in time and accidently changes things.

MUST HAVE: - Hermione helping Merlin - Hermione can not be a princess - Hermione paired with Arthur P. or Merlin, - Hermione Centric - must be longer than 1000 words - Have Hermione traveling to Camelot - Her magic is amplified because of what sent her to the past. - Reason for time travel can not be time turner.

OPTIONAL: -Hermione permanently in past - Merlin and Gaius find out shes a time traveling Witch.


** "Challenge" aka. "Please write my story."

Prompts are alright, but you can't just dictate "must have" points. If you demand those things write it yourself.
