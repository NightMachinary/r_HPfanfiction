It's been a while since I've seen one of these threads.

The title pretty much says it all, what's your favorite passage? The funniest? The best description of a fight? A quiet moment between two characters? What's your favorite and why?


** It's from a fic by Resa Aureus, "The Last Marauder" where Hermione travels back in time to prevent Pettigrew from betraying the Potters. She gets into a relationship of sorts with Sirius. If I remember well (can't find the specific passage), when they are both naked in bed, Sirius tells Hermione he named her breasts Flourish and Blotts. A mortified Hermione exclaims "YOU NAMED MY BREASTS AFTER A BOOKSTORE?"

Another one is from the Innocent series by Marauderlover7. It's a conversation between Pettigrew and Lucius Malfoy "I have an Order of Merlin -" "For dying," [Lucius] said. "And you failed at that."

These crack me up everytime!

  Harry had chosen to assume a rather relaxed posture, as he sat in a low chair before the mighty desk of the Headmaster of Hogwarts: one leg cocked over his knee, and his arms sprawling casually to either side. Harry was doing his best to disregard the noise from the surrounding devices, although the one directly behind him that sounded like an owl hooting desperately as it was put through a woodchipper was pretty difficult to ignore.

** 'When he Apparates them away from the therapist's office, it isn't to go home to their flat, but to Diagon Alley. They very rarely come here, not only because Lily can't get in without his help or that of James, but also because she is almost as famous as he was at her age, but for different reasons, ones neither of them want to discuss.

He buys her a sundae at Fortescue's---no longer owed or operated by a Fortescue, not since the last one was murdered by Death Eaters, but still named for him---and they sit and do not talk. They don't talk for a long time, until Lily reaches across the table to take his hand.

Five words, and they break him down. She holds his hand as he cries, absolutely without expression.'

** I only have one, from Hogwarts Houses Divided linkffn(3979062) :

"You're not coming back to Hogwarts, are you?" he said.

She shook her head. "The healers say ... " She swallowed. "My magic is gone."

Teddy felt the lump in his throat return.

"I know it must seem horrible to you," she said. "But ... it's not really so bad." Teddy frowned, unable to hide his disbelief. She was smiling at him, trying to look brave, though her eyes lacked the conviction of her words. "I'm Muggle-born, after all. I'm just going back to the Muggle world. And I did miss my friends from school, in London. It was very exciting, to find out I was a witch, and visit this ... wizarding world, where magic is real, and there are goblins and elves and ghosts, but my parents were never really very happy about it, you know. They won't say so, but I think they're glad that I won't be going back there."

Teddy just stared at her, not sure what to say.

"In the Muggle world," she said softly, "we have so many books and movies about children who stumble through hidden doorways or find magic chests in an attic or faeries in a forest, or something like that, and they get to go on these wonderful magical adventures. But they always return home, in the end. And that's what I'm doing, Teddy. Going to Hogwarts was like a wonderful adventure. And now I'm going back home, where I belong."

** I've never been particularly skilled at remembering exact passages from fanfiction (published works are the opposite, strangely enough). However, the following from the most recent Shadow of Angmar update hit me in an emotional location.

#+begin_quote
  In his hand was a brand new wand. It was no beautiful thing like Ollivander's creations; in truth it still looked to be an unassuming stick, blown from a mountain Pine by the winter winds. Uncomely though it was to the eye, it was without doubt the most wonderful wand Harry had ever held. He could feel the power that hid within it, it was like a drumbeat upon his fingers, and reverberated through his body and through his mind.

  He did not know if it was simply due to his greater affinity with magic, but it felt like so much more than his Holly wand. Where his Holly wand had felt like a living thing, this wand almost felt like it had a will of its own. It cried out to be used, tl be unleased.

  Harry heeded its siren call. In that moment there was only one spell he could think to cast. His voice rang out across the valley, powerful and filled with joy.

** Well, I'm not sure about /the/ favourite, but I do very much like this passage from a particular story:

#+begin_quote
  "In a way, Tom, but only in a way, there is no good or evil, only power, and those too weak to withstand it. You can get drunk on power like a man can get drunk on firewhiskey, to the point where the whiskey controls him, drains him and eventually ruins him. That is what happens when we give in to the pull of the darkness. But harness your own desires, and it becomes a tool that you control instead of it controlling you, and you can do great things -- great, and magnificent."
#+end_quote

Getting enough of the thing outside of the quote to give context would require putting a whole page here, so I'll leave it at the quote as it is the central part. The story is “Last Chance” by Laume, a story in which Albus tries to do right by Tom Riddle, and this particular quote is from Ollivander. I feel it a great quote because of how it calls back to what Ollivander said to Harry in the first book.

Coincidentally, it was my favorite fanfic as well. That I stupidly never learned how to archive and to my knowledge, it was never archived, and thus is lost to cyberspace.

In any event, to provide context, Ginny had developed a habit of asking Luna questions about herself and then seeing if she could guess the answer ahead of time. An attempt to understand Luna Lovegood that was usually in vain.

It's not stated outright, but I believe it was their seventh year, after the War.

Roughly paraphrased, since it's been at least a year since I lost it:

/It was during one warm afternoon of luxurious laziness where she and Luna were laying out in the grass near the Lake when Ginny decided to play one more guessing game and ask Luna a question. A rather personal one./

/"Luna, who's your favorite person?"/

/She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the right answer popped into her head. Luna's daddy. Her most talked about person. Surely, he was her favorite./

/"You are."/

/Ginny startled. She hadn't expected that. But then, who could expect anything when it came to Luna Lovegood?"/

/But that was okay./

/Luna was Ginny's favorite person too./

  Faith and Understanding

  by Lethe Laguz

  ...

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

**** I've googled it a dozen times, checked Fiction Hunt, googled passages that I can remember, including most of my favorite quote.

It was a wonderful, if simple, story.

From memory:

Little Ginny meets Little Luna on the Hogwarts Express, where Luna expresses her desire to become a Ravenclaw, like her daddy and because "Ravenclaws always tell the truth." Ginny notices the /Quibbler/ and remembers what Arthur told her--that although the /Quibbler/ often gets facts wrong, they never actually print anything they know isn't true, which is more than can be said for /The Daily Prophet,/ which takes a kernel of truth and spins rumors and speculation out of it.

Most of /Chamber of Secrets/ through /Goblet of Fire/ is glossed over, but if I recall correctly, Ginny is grateful that Luna doesn't treat her any differently than she did before.

She's aware of Luna's strangeness, and the comments from their classmates, but Hermione urges her to take pride in her friendship, as it really isn't anybody's business who Ginny is and isn't friends with.

Ginny takes Hermione's advice, and stands up to Luna's bullies, but makes it worse when she accidentally says a nickname she has for Luna out loud: "Loony Lovegood is my friend."

Ginny is simultaneously sick with guilt but also frustrated that Luna doesn't seem to mind--at one point demanding that Luna be angry with her, only for Luna to say that she thought Ginny was more her friend out of pity than anything else, which frustrates Ginny all the more, because she can't believe how stubborn Luna is.

An argument ensues, only for it to finish with Ginny teaching Luna how to ride a broomstick and Luna singing a little song.

Glimpses of their friendship then are seen--studying together, sitting next to each other in class, Ginny noticing Luna's growing skills in Dumbledore's Army and thinking that her bunny Patronus suits her. Luna visits the Burrow early in the summer between /OotP/ and /HBP/ and late one night Luna reveals during one of Ginny's Guessing Games ("Luna, what's your pet peeve?") that she hates being made fun of, and she's grateful, almost to the point of tears, that Ginny stands up for her.

They fall asleep holding hands.

I don't remember any details about the War, though I think the girls just sat next to each other after the fighting was over.

The story ended with the quote I posted--though I did forget the part where Ginny turned to Luna waiting for the answer and Luna "twitched her nose in that rabbit-like ways of hers."

** In linkffn(8484470) - Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy - there are too many such passages to count. I'll just give you the first one I ran across in Ch. 1 because it's too hard to pick out a good bit from the rest without spoilering the living bejasus out of it:

#+begin_quote
  "Well, there you are then. If /nobody's/ ever heard of him, I'll bet you a Jammie Dodger that whoever is /really/ running things, behind the scenes, is a Hufflepuff. The Gryffindors are too busy rushing in where angels fear to tread, the Ravenclaws can't pry their noses out of their books and the Slytherins are too busy politicking. So the prefects told me. Well, I say they told me, the Hufflepuffs didn't say much, they just sighed a bit. Do you know, I heard they actually machinate during dinner, Slytherins?"

** It didn't quite format right but here it is (from Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions):

Harry did as he was told, ignoring his audience, and shortly was pouring a stream of white soapsuds back out of its glass flask. It blinked open green eyes and blew bubbles at him with a birdlike chirp. “You are making me very angry, Potter,” Professor Snape said, staring at it blankly. “Well, I don't know either,” Harry said. “I just followed the instructions, I always tap my cauldron like that, it's not as if I was doing it on purpose.” You angled the strokes of your wand from the left, the center, and then the right, Voldemort observed. Creating the rune for life, algiz. Myrtle is also a strong symbol of life and fire, especially Myrica rubra, waxberry, which is what you used. ... “You just realized something,” Professor Snape said. “Spit it out.” “More like it... came to me,” Harry said. He had no idea what his expression was like. “I don't care if dancing elephants delivered it in a dream, Potter,” Snape hissed. “Algiz,” Harry blurted. “And waxberry. If that makes any sense. Please say that doesn't make any sense.” Professor Snape looked very blank. I am not wrong, Voldemort informed Harry. Potions may not be my strongest area, but I am capable of following a simple correspondence to its natural conclusion. Voldemort, Harry realized with a strange floating sensation, was a nerd. The potion with green eyes chirped at them both, drawing their attention to where it was trying to slide under the door of the potions ingredients cupboard. The floor, Harry noticed, was very shiny. “How do you corral the thing,” Snape said flatly. “Here, um, Bubbles! Come, Bubbles. You can stay in your nice quiet bottle for a little while and then I'll take you to the entrance hall for nice outdoor dirt.” Harry put the bottle down sideways on the floor, and the pile of soapsuds poured itself back into the tiny bottle in a way that did not seem physically probable. I can think of absolutely no martial applications for this, Voldemort mused. Do ask Severus if he can. He's quite creative. “I'm not asking Professor Snape questions for you,” Harry said shortly aloud. “This isn't your detention, is it. Don't you have people to murder?”

** I rather like the passage from The Mind Arts linkffn(The Mind Arts), in Chapter 13:

"His powers over the elements were good, he had modeled them after the Indian-God-Kings themselves, but he knew his abilities still paled in comparison to their power.

He could charge and release some electricity, while Indra could become a human bolt of lightning and lay waste to mountains. He could pull at the air, but not so quickly that it formed a vacuum, generating light and heat even as it pulled the entire population of cities inside out. That ability belonged to Vayu, Queen of the-Open-Spaces-of-the-World.

No, his elemental powers weren't so awesome and he knew that he would never match those legends, but his abilities could be impressive, even if they would always fall short of mythical.

However little it was, it was still enough to win."

Creates such a sense of wonder and awe toward magic.

  Malfoy considered that and turned back to Harry. "I presume, Potter, that you experienced accidental magic as a child, as most of us did." The boy nodded. "That is Wild Magic in its most simplistic form. You cast no spell. You held no wand. And yet, you wished for something and it came to pass, quite likely in a seemingly impossible manner. Magic in its raw form, freed of the restrictions placed upon it by the techniques taught here at Hogwarts and at other magical schools, can be summed up in eight simple words: 'As I will it, so mote it be.' Our kind have spent millennia striving to limit magic's potential, to ensure that magic is irrevocably linked to wands and incantations, defined as charms and transfigurations and potions, and restrained by the principles of arithmancy and runic matrices. The minute you picked up a compatible wand at Olivander's, those sparks that shot out represented your promise as a wizard that you would work magic according to the principles taught you here at Hogwarts. After that, I dare say you never experienced accidental magic again except perhaps under the most extreme provocations. Even if you should one day master wandless magic in some form, it will still be based on your sense memory of casting the same spells with a wand in your hand."

  "But ... why?" Harry asked in confusion. "Why go to all that trouble to ... bind Magic?"

  "It's like you said after we saw the Imago Dei, Harry. If every wizard or witch could work magic just by wishing really hard, it would tear the world apart."

** "Oh God Not Again" by Sarah1281 is one of the best, this is after Harry and Sirius realize calling Sirius Padfoot probably gave them away to Pettigrew:

“Harry glared at Sirius, completely ignoring the last part of his statement. "Well maybe that wasn't the best idea to call you that, but I don't recall you coming up with any better suggestions."

"Sure I did," Sirius argued.

"What, Snuffles? Sorry Sirius, no pet of mine will ever go by such a cutesy name. Seriously, if you want me to come up with a more badass way to have survived Voldemort than the Power of Love, then you've got to come up with a more badass alias than 'Snuffles.' Seriously, that sounds like something Ginny would have picked out."

Sirius started laughing. "Really? She can't have been that bad."

"Wanna bet? We got a rabbit last year and guess what Ginny named it. Flopsy."

"W-what did you want to call it?" Sirius managed to ask between his laughter.

"Mega Ultra Flame Deathsman. Hey, that's a perfectly respectable name for a rabbit!" Harry insisted, crossing his arms as Sirius literally fell to the ground howling. "You know, if you're not going to take this seriously, I'm going back to bed.”

**** Gosh I was off by two whole fics! It's actually from the first in the series, Where in the World is Harry Potter? This is less of a passage and more of a scene which consists of half of the length of Chapter 11:

#+begin_quote
  "He's tricking us into confronting Professor Snape. Maybe even befriending him."

  "Oh Neville, he's not that bad."

  "Do you not remember any of my Potions classes at all?"

  Hermione winced. "I was hoping you might have forgotten those, but I guess not."

  Neville narrowed his eyes. "He used to be my boggart for goodness sake. It's not the easiest thing in the world to forget."

  "He's not your boggart anymore?"

  Neville shook his head.

  "Well what is?"

  "It's kind of personal and I'd rather not say."

  "Oh I'm sorry. Of course Neville." Hermione apologized. "Would you like me to come with you when you ask for Professor Snape's help?"

  "You bet your butter you're coming with me. Let's get this over with. Now." Neville exclaimed before leading the way out of the History of Magic classroom and headed down towards the dungeons.

  Hermione quickly caught up and walked with Neville. "Is it spiders?"

  Neville turned to her. "What? No. I'm not afraid of spiders. That's just Ron."

  Hermione kept walking and thinking. "Is it girls?"

  "No. Don't be silly." Neville said as they continued. "Hermione, did you just ask me that because you think I'm gay? Or because you think I'm straight?"

  Hermione shook her head. "Never mind." She was quiet for about five seconds before she asked, "Does it have to do with your grandmother?"

  "Hermione! I said I didn't want to tell you."

  Hermione pouted. "You never said I couldn't guess though. So, is it a plant?"

  Neville was getting frustrated and stopped walking. "Alright! Fine." Neville yelled. "Have you ever seen Little Shop of Horrors?"

  Hermione's face split into a smile. "Yes!"

  Neville looked her in the eye and said, "Well it has absolutely nothing to do with that." And he quickly turned and headed on to the dungeons.

  "Come on Neville. That's not fair. I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours."

  "Oh please Hermione. What's next? You going to pinky swear to be my best friend? And besides I already know yours."

  "You do not! It's probably changed since you last saw it anyway."

  "Yeah. I know. Now your greatest fear is to receive an ancient magical tome and to accidentally ruin it by writing grocery lists in it."

  Hermione was blushing now and getting angry. "Fine. So it is. But now you have to tell me yours."

  "Forget it Hermione. You've already got enough things to make fun of me for. And I still owe you for petrifying me in first year."

  "In fairness Neville, if we'd let you stop us that night, Voldemort would have gotten the stone and become immortal."

  "Oh geez. You hide behind that excuse for everything. It's always 'Voldemort would have won' or 'Harry would have died' or 'I don't care if they're enjoying it! No more House elf flying experiments!' I'll tell you what Hermione, you show me your breasts and I'll tell you."

  Hermione shrieked. "Neville! That is completely inappropriate to even ask! And it's crude and way too personal!"

  Neville just raised an eyebrow and stared at Hermione in response.

  Hermione just huffed angrily. "Alright. Fine. I get it."

  Neville smirked victoriously and was about to change the subject when Hermione quickly looked both ways down the hall and pulled up her sweater, shirt, and bra and flashed Neville.

  "Buh...err...duh..." He mumbled out.

  "But now I'm getting proof. We're going to Nicholas's office and getting a boggart." Hermione grabbed Neville by the elbow and quickly headed towards the DADA office.

  Professor Flamel explained. "Sure. Got a couple boggarts in boxes in the back. Let me grab one."

  He returned moments later. "Neville, you sure you're ready for this?"

  He was still occasionally making sounds with his mouth. "Duh...err..."

  Nicholas smiled and said "Works for me," before lifting the lid on a box and aiming it towards Neville.

  Professor Flamel watched the boggart shift forms and shapes before settling on something very recognizable. "Wow! That's a heck of a nice looking pair! Whose are those Neville?"

  Hermione eyes nearly popped out of her head as she let out a loud "Eep!" and grabbed Neville quickly leaving the room. She yelled back from the hallway, "Thanks Professor Flamel. Bye."

  "Somehow this is Harry's fault I know it. Argh!" an embarrassed and angry Hermione was yelling.

  "Erg...umm...homina..."

  Hermione couldn't take anymore and slapped the young man harshly across his face.

  "Ouch!" he yelled tenderly rubbing his cheek. "Umm...thanks Hermione. You know, for everything."

  Hermione just shook her head. "At the very least Neville, will you tell me what your boggart used to be?"

  "It used to be Professor Snape. You know that."

  "No! I mean after that."

  Neville giggled. "Oh, no, it's always been Snape. I was just lying and wondering if you would show me the twins. In seventh year Harry taught me a trick with your mind to focus on an image and control what a boggart becomes. But I'll call us even for the Petrificus now." Neville finished with a goofy grin and headed on towards the dungeons again.

  She was thinking 'I knew this was Harry's fault!' but continued to scowl at Neville.

  "Come on Hermione. Don't hate the player. I'm trying to get into a Slytherin mindset, so I can relate to Snape better."

  Hermione just huffed but walked beside him none the less. "I can't help but wonder if Harry's cheek is contagious and spreading."

#+begin_quote
  "Greetings," Albus loudly said as the two Potters and he approached. "Lord Black and Lord Black. I'm delighted to see you accepted Professor Potter's invitation."

  Harry could feel his mother's approach and tried to pretend there was nothing out of the ordinary. "Please Headmaster, for tonight, I'm Harry and he's Sirius."

  Sirius noticed Harry slinking away and slapped him hard on the shoulder in a friendly gesture, while adding, "But unless you count his back, he's not really hairy. And I am rarely serious."

  "Oof," Harry groaned, partly from the smack and partly from Sirius' line. "Can't you not crack a name joke, just once?"

  Albus' eyes were twinkling as he added, "If it makes you feel any better, I've never been more than two-thirds bus. Further proof there really is no truth in advertising."

  Jimmy, Harry, and Sirius all turned towards the Headmaster in silent disbelief

***** What sort of other fics have you read? What's your favorite fic?

I highly recommend reading ABC to everyone. The plot is very well written and makes sense from start to finish. There is a little bit of mystery but I imagine that I in this thread and others elsewhere have spoiled it for you. There's a great bunch of action in the middle, and while it doesn't conclude with the epic battle, it's a pretty epic fight anyway. The humor is very immature in some places, but it's still funny anyway.

Harry plays a lot of roles in the fic but it's always true to who he is, as in the character doesn't sacrifice his backstory and relationships every three pages. It has some of my favorite characters in the entire fandom: Ginny, Ginevra, Sirius, Jimmy, Bellatrix, Tom, even Albus. It also has, and this is a minor spoiler so look away, my favorite of [[/spoiler][hover to reveal spoiler (sorry mobile folks)]]. And tbh it's only a spoiler because it tells you that one of the goals was achieved and I'm not going to tell you what the circumstances and result was other than fucking hilarious.

There's just too many good things in this fic, especially compared to the millions and millions of words written by kids who just don't even know how to write that clog up the various sites.

#+begin_quote
  For me to be ended this way. For me to fall here. I have never deluded myself into thinking I am blessed to live a long life. My end is on the battlefield, bathed in blood and surrounded by the bodies of my enemies. My fate, my glory is there. The death will be quick, painless, and I will die knowing that I defied the foe until the very end. But here, now, this glory is denied to me. Against the dragon, my death will be lengthy and prolonged. It will suck the magic from my core until there is nothing left. I will be forced to watch my magic leave me, feel it draining away while I am helpless to do anything. For if I break the connection, the dragon will incinerate me as soon as it opens its jaws. So I kneel. In the dirt. Blood caking my face and hate welling impotently in my heart.

  There will be no victory here. All this defiance, all this courage will amount for nothing if the foe I struggle against cannot be bested. For a brief moment I recall the tale I told of the knight and the dragon. One that lives in a fairytale. The other surviving in reality. At this time I cannot help but think I would rather be the knight in the fairytale

  I won't go into the specifics. We made it past a mess of obstacles set up to allow us firsties to make it through, although Ron got pummeled by the Chess pieces- a small amount of poetic justice given how he abuses the pieces in his chess set. Hermione was stuck at the last task for only one of us could go forward. She suggested that I should go despite her voluminous spell knowledge. Her argument was simple, and I couldn't deny it.

  "I am just books and cleverness; there are more important things, like friendship and bravery and..."

  "And?"

  "Well, a killer instinct. You don't flinch, Holly."

  I guess I must have looked a little sad as I nodded my head, because Hermione gave me a hug to compete with the strangling vine just then.

** Oh god there's so many I actually want to just spend the rest of my night remembering them. There's the easy ones, the ones that tell you everything you need to know about the characters in question, such as this from A Black Comedy:

#+begin_quote
  Albus frowned in thought. "Was the cost to you simply too high to pay again?"

  Harry considered the question before answering. "Yeah... I don't know. I'm not sure to be honest. But fortunately for me, it's not possible to pay again so I don't have to think about it."

  "What was your cost?"

  Harry was surprised Albus was asking so boldly. He let no emotion show as he watched the old man.

  Albus nodded in understanding and voluntarily admitted, "I sacrificed the ability to father children and then I lost the ability to fall in love."

  Harry hadn't known the specifics but guessed it had been something close to that for Albus. He knew how high that cost would be to a wizard like Albus. With a lick of his lips, Harry softly admitted, "I sacrificed my mother's everlasting soul."

  Albus blinked in shock. "And what did you lose?"

  Harry slowly shook his head. "My sacrifice was deemed sufficient."

  Albus couldn't even imagine what Harry felt. The word came out as a whisper. "How?"
#+end_quote

and again when he reveals this to Tom

#+begin_quote
  Harry was watching Tom closely as he stated, "That was your sacrifice, wasn't it?"

  Tom showed no surprise as he turned to Harry.

  "I know you've researched the balance. Mortality was your sacrifice?"

  Tom's face betrayed no emotion. "What was yours?"

  Harry considered it a moment and shook his head. "Not today. Maybe some other time I'll tell you."

  Tom inclined his head in understanding, before his eyes lit up. "Was coming here to this world, leaving your own behind, your cost?"

  Harry smiled darkly, shaking his head.

  "Or do you not know yet?" Tom questioned. "My understanding is that some costs aren't realized for years."

  *Harry wore a pained smile. "My victory was hollow."*

  Tom's eyes widened. "Your sacrifice was deemed sufficient?"

  Harry nodded.

  Tom couldn't keep the look of sympathy off his face. He watched Harry for a few seconds.
#+end_quote

The two most powerful wizards in the world are absolutely flabbergasted that Harry either had to, or else just did go that far. The bolded line probably sums it up best.

--------------

There's also moments of pure joy where you can feel how happy and thankful the characters are, and again I'll turn to Nonjon, this time from Browncoat, Green Eyes

#+begin_quote
  "Fawkes?" Harry asked looking at the bird in disbelief.

  Fawkes on the other hand could barely contain his enthusiasm. He was whipping his wings like an overexcited first year, just hovering in place brimming with joy. Fawkes squawked loudly at Harry's inquiring repeat of his name and with a burst of fire disappeared from in front of Harry, only to reappear inside Harry's oversized spacesuit.

  Harry began to yelp as he fell back, while the phoenix just wriggled itself against him in happiness. Harry was laughing his head off at how Fawkes tickling him, and seemed quite content to just press his body against Harry's in what could only be an attempt at a human hug. "What are you doing, you goofball?"

  Fawkes squawked something back that probably even phoenixes wouldn't have understood before snapping his beak on Harry's nose and mischievously biting down hard. Another burst of fire and Fawkes reappeared up in the sky.

  {Skip some for space}

  Fawkes just leaned into Harry pushing his head against Harry's helmet.

  Harry recognized what Fawkes wanted. "Okay, you crazy bird. Get in here."

  Fawkes let out a victorious cry and popped into a burst of fire, reappearing back inside the cramped spacesuit with Harry. Harry worked his left hand up to where Fawkes head was resting on Harry's chest. He began scratching the ancient bird in all his favorite places.

  Fawkes was relishing in the attention while Harry looked up at all the patient faces. "Fawkes here was the pet of my Headmaster and occasional mentor of sorts, Albus Dumbledore. First time I saw Fawkes, he looked awful, and he burst into flames right in front of me. I was twelve and scared the Headmaster was going blame me for killing his pet bird."

  Fawkes let out a happy coo, urging Harry to scratch behind his ears.
#+end_quote

And another scene from the end of Act 3:

#+begin_quote
  "No," Harry replied, looking at the flashes of magic all over the surface. "I don't think I've ever seen this spell before, but I know I know it."

  The others were knocking on the thick bronze, ignoring the small barrier they weren't supposed to cross. They'd begun to attract a small crowd, wondering why people were climbing on the statue when Harry gasped and took a step back. "Oh heavens," Harry felt the blood rushing from his face as he finally recognized the magic. "This spell! This is my spell! That's why I'd never seen it before. This is my spell!"

  "Your spell?" Inara asked curiously. "You own one?"

  "No," Harry said shaking his head, as his face split into a wide grin. "This is the spell I created, the one that put me to sleep."

  "Hang on," Jayne said. "Are you saying..."

  "Yes, right here," Harry assured them all overflowing with excitement. "There are wizards, dozens of them."
#+end_quote

You can't help but feel for Harry as his quest finally comes to an end.

--------------

There are so many scenes where you can feel your heart being ripped out of your chest but the utter loss I felt as a former rabid Harmonian still makes this one of the most horrible ends to an HHR relationship I've ever read:

#+begin_quote
  Somehow, Harry wasn't surprised when Hermione knocked on the door of his wand lab and stepped inside, moving slowly and deliberately as she had to do now. Harry put down the various blanks he was working with---which included the new one he was making for himself---to focus on her alone.

  He saw it all in her face. In the way she stood, and the anguish and self-doubt in her eyes. "Luna told you," he said.

  Hermione nodded and hugged herself. "My parents said I could come home, to Australia." She spoke in barely whisper, as if the words burned her throat. "They've made a good life for themselves there, and I would be there to help my sister."

  "Do you want to go?"

  "No," she said. She wiped her eyes. "Do you remember, that horrid Christmas when Luna passed judgment on me? I love you, Harry. But...I can never forgive her for doing that. I know why she did---I know the custom. It was barbaric, just like the entire idea of polygamy. I love you, and I don't want you to think I'm doing this because of anything you've done, but I just..."

  "You want to live," Harry whispered. He wiped his own eyes. "Did you know, at the Orientation, you were the first child I ever touched who didn't jerk back? I think in a way you were my first real friend." He sniffed loudly. "I love you, Hermione. I love you so much, I'll let you go if that's what you need."

  She hugged him, and her kiss tasted salty with their mutual tears. "Then let me go, Harry. I love you, but I can't stay with you. Not if I ever want to live my own life."

  "I know."

  They made love that night, Harry and Hermione, and the next morning Luna quietly, and without any fanfare, severed the bond that joined Hermione and Harry through her. It was astonishingly easy for her to do so, and Harry secretly wondered if it was something Luna always knew about, seeing how she always seemed more informed regarding Aether magic than he was. She said she got it from Ravenclaw, but he wondered.

  That afternoon, with an Order of Merlin First Class and traveller's cheques Harry insisted on giving her to ensure she never wanted for anything, *Hermione climbed into a cab and drove away in a cool April morning toward Heathrow. It was the last he ever saw or even heard of her.*
#+end_quote

It was the only way it ever could end and still be true to Hermione's character but the complete lack of happiness at the end of that....

--------------

There are many fics that bring the magical world to life and give it such detail, but none have ever been the same mix of simple and powerful that this scene had in Holly Polter:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was more intrigued by a third depository table around the side of the house that was accumulating various small objects, with a written tag tied to each. At first, given the seemingly mundane and innocuous nature of the objects, he thought they might be used portkeys like he'd seen at the World Cup. Instead he was surprised to find gold and silver watches, brass devices, carved wooden boxes and the occasional distended envelope with something more than a letter inside.

  He picked one up and read its tag:

  'My tiepin. It was enchanted to ring like a bell at dawn, hoot for lunch, whistle for tea, & clap for the end of the work-day. Never realised Arthur was the one who made it so. Loved it before, would appreciate it again. ~ R. Perkins'

  Molly surprised him when she spoke. "You can see it either way, really. Are they being selfish to ask for something to be re-enchanted, or is it just a reminder and thanks of the good that he'd done for them? There is no guarantee of return so if the bauble is worth something, it's a kind way to give us - the bereaved - a little extra help without making it seem like charity. Most of the watches will be those."
#+end_quote

Its the details like that that really make the magical world come to life.

  George Weasley goes next. When Dennis displays the photograph, some ignorant critic finds fault with the framing. "Too heavy on one side...empty space on the left. Terrible photograph...missing something vital," he concludes.

  Dennis doesn't quite know how to explain, that's the point. These are scars of the war; the blank white emptiness of the backdrop on the right hand side of the photograph is the scar, more than the missing ear that's barely noticeable.

  Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point.

  Hugs were exchanged, tearfully in some cases, and soon enough the six of them stood in three distinct groups: Harry and Hermione, Ron and Luna, Ginny and Neville.

  "Stay in touch," Luna said. "Try not to let the Nargles get to you."

  "We'll try," Harry said, laughing good-naturedly. "Thanks Luna."

  A charged silence passed briefly between all of them. Neville shuffled uncertainly on his feet.

  "I guess this is time to say goodbye," he said.

  "I think so," Hermione responded, quietly.

  "See you soon!" Ginny said, and the couples parted. Neville and Ginny headed for the greenhouses so he could pick up one of his magical plants; Ron and Luna headed for the castle to finish packing; and Harry and Hermione headed for the gates so they could Apparate to her house.

  All six looked back at different moments, watching as the others faded into the evening light. Hogwarts was behind them and they faced only the unknown future ahead. They all were hopeful it would bring happiness.

It reminds me of how much has changed since I was in highschool, the sadness for things lost, and the joy for things gained.

--------------

Maybe I'll just keep all the one-shots to this one post, because he's my favorite 'quiet moment between two characters', which is really just the entirety of The Colour of Autumn:

#+begin_quote
  'Is this really happening?' Ron asked, truly wondering if it was a dream. Hermione smiled warmly, and they kissed for the third time. They pulled away, and both of them laughed openly, hugging each other, just as the wind gave a gust, throwing leaves into the air around them. They parted, and walking hand in hand, started back up the path, and back to Hogsmede.

  Hermione had one more reason to love the Autumn.

There's lots of monologues that i've enjoyed, many of them third-wall breaking dissections of canon and fanon plots, characters motivations, things like that. BajaB's subtle rant against redo fics in Gently Go is probably one of the best:

#+begin_quote
  "To go back, even if it is a different reality, would make all of my decisions, and the decisions of everybody else, worthless. I would be saying they were not good enough, that all of the work and all of the sacrifices we made are nothing to me.\\
  "I've had my chance. I don't know if I made more wrong decisions that right ones. I don't know if I made many people's lives better or worse, or if I made any difference at all. Hell, I don't even know if I made a good husband, father, or grandfather.\\
  "What I do know, what I am absolutely sure of, is that I don't want to find out. I don't want to know how badly I messed up. I don't want to have every fault, every mistake made obvious to me.\\
  "If I do this, if I 'have another go' and do better, or maybe worse, it can only make me regret my mistakes and lost opportunities even more. What then? Maybe I'll get another chance after that, and I try again, to make up for those times I dropped the Quaffle. Then maybe again after that, or maybe I'll be too worn out and just give up.\\
  "I'll not be that man, Albus," said Harry, standing up, the weight of his age sliding off him. "I have many regrets, but I have lived with them, and now I will die with them too."
#+end_quote

I'm out of one shots I think, but remembered the saddest death that I've read in a long time from Restoring Hope:

#+begin_quote
  "You did it," whispered Hermione.

  "With help," Harry whispered back. They traded simultaneous grins as they heard each others' words from earlier.

  "It's over, Hermione," Harry continued after a moment. With the battle over, his body had decided it no longer needed to stand; he sank slowly onto the side of the bed, Hermione's hand still in his. "It's finally over. Oh God, we did it. We did it, love. Together."

  Hermione smiled happily, but even that small act seemed to exhaust her. She didn't move or speak, but her eyes never left Harry's face.

  It seemed to take a very long time for Harry to get enough breath to speak again. "When we're feeling better," he told her, "we'll go home with Hope. Not to the Place, but a real home. We'll be a family, love." He took another minute to catch his breath... he had to work hard to do it. "And we'll be married, and have more kids after Hope. And..." His voice grew fainter as he finished, "And we'll be together for the rest of our lives."

  She moved her mouth, but no words came out. It didn't matter: her shining eyes said it all. Of course we will.

  He could no longer keep his head erect. He let it settle onto the bed, his face inches from hers. They didn't kiss, but each could feel the other's breath on their lips. Harry managed a tiny smile as Hermione caressed him with her eyes. I love you, Hermione, he mouthed silently back.

  I love you, Harry. They smiled at each other, at total peace, hands still clasped, happy to be together.

  Then slowly, together, they closed their eyes.
#+end_quote

It's one thing to die in battle, it's a whole other thing to get sick and just fade away in the end.

--------------

Harry's Fuck You speech to the Wizengamot in Dementor's Stigma is pretty poignant, as is the imagery of Harry's Memorial Tree, but I think the one thing that sticks out to me is that Ron is given a noble death and takes a whole bunch of the fuckers with him:

#+begin_quote
  "No," I said in denial. "No, mate, I can't." Frustration, pure anger and tiredness at the fact that everything had still led to this, as if it was always going to, leaked into my tone. "I can't save shit. After everything, I'm not... Fuck! Fuck. I can't. Save you. I'm sorry, but I can't. I just..."

  "Then let somebody save you," Ron said with determination, fighting through his pain. The pub, aflame with hungry fire and the spent chaos, reflected in his eyes. "Let me save you."
#+end_quote

--------------

I like the early bits of Dunuelos's Lone Traveler series, and the best arc is the Building a Better Burrow series. The idea of someone so lost as his Harry being able to still have a home and family that loves him appeals greatly to me. The entire section is full of positivity and interesting uses for magic, but his speech at the end is probably the best:

#+begin_quote
  "Thank you. I'd protest this but I know Molly and I want to avoid the stinging hexes she is so proficient with." Molly looked smug even as the crowd laughed. "I didn't grow up here. I grew up in an environment much more saturated with fear and ignorance. When I first traveled here, I came upon a family who was just starting out and took steps to help them and to make certain they were safe. The things I did and the plans I made were almost entirely predicated upon ensuring they would be happy and healthy. It is would be a much darker world if we, each of us, didn't do what we could to help our neighbors and our community. That this led to Riddle's defeat was almost superfluous. I say almost because I will not cheapen the memory of those lost by so casually dismissing it."

  He paused then because he knew that he would soon be moving on.

  "I am a Traveler and I have seen much. I do my part here and there to help out. If we all did that, then this community, indeed any community, could never again be threatened with extinction. The community would never allow it. Be good to each other. Learn your history well and do not repeat the mistakes of the past. Hold compassion for each other and charity toward your fellow man. If you can do that, your future will be bright indeed."
#+end_quote

But this fic has some importance to me personally because I actually wrote an "ending" to it that still makes me cry every time I read it. Kind of egotistical I know, but the three people I've shown it to loved it and one cried, so nyeh. I could never publish it though.

--------------

I can't find a single quote that really sticks out as important to the character or fic, but I do have to say I have a weird thing for homicidal robots and Frank from Madness at the Gate and HK-47 from The Havoc Side of the Force amuse me greatly.

  A word of advice for the new readers: Harry gets broken. He gets the mud on the face repeatedly. He gets completely and utterly torn apart and destroyed for a long, long while in the book. He lingers on the edge of insanity, mental mood swings and worse for a long time.

#+begin_quote
  The Headmaster was regarding him with increasing graveness. "Harry, do you understand /at all/ why I find these events concerning?"

  "Honestly?" said Harry. "No, not really. I mean, of course Professor McGonagall would object to anything that breaks up the dull monotony of the Hogwarts school experience. But then Professor McGonagall wouldn't set a chicken on fire."

  The frown lines deepened on Dumbledore's wrinkled face. "That, Harry, is not what disturbs me," the Headmaster said quietly. "There was a full battle fought in these halls!"

  "Headmaster," Harry said, trying to keep his voice carefully respectful, "Professor Quirrell and I did not choose for that battle to happen. The bullies did that. We just decided to have the Light side win. I know there are times where the boundaries of morality are uncertain, but in this case the line separating the villains and the heroines was twenty meters tall and drawn in white fire. Our intervention may have been /weird/, but it certainly wasn't /wrong/ -"

** linkffn(11180088) Coming Home, Chapter 13, has me laughing so hard I'm in tears every time.

"Accio - Re-Remus' . . . trouser!" she called out in panic, unsure exactly what would occur by using the first spell she had thought of.

"What the hell?" said James and Sirius together eyes bulging at her frantic behaviour, not to mention the fact that she had just summoned Remus' trousers.

Within moments there were squeals heard from students across the hall as Remus shot across the tables as though he were being dragged, clutching on to his trousers with all his might, as it looked as if they were trying to free themselves from his body.

"MERLIN'S FUCKING BALLS!" he shouted as his body whisked over the tables knocking plates of food and drinks covering him and other classmates in the process, before reaching the Gryffindor table and colliding into Hermione, both of them flying off the bench and onto the floor with a thump.

"Urgh," she groaned, more from the impact of the collision rather than the comfortable weight of Remus' firm body lying on top of her.

"What the fuck was that!" he cursed, looking down on the witch laying under him, Hermione's breath catching in her throat as his blue eyes bore into hers, shifting to amber when she let out a moan of pain that sounded a little more lustful then she had intended.

Their faces mere inches apart as Hermione felt his hand drift towards her face, pushing her wild curls out of the way from where they had escaped the confines of her bun, the quill having been dislodged on impact. Hands clutching at his chest, clinging on to his jumper from where she had tried to protect herself.

She drew in her bottom lip worrying it, noticing when the wizard above her gaze drifted to watch, licking his lips in the process. Her heart began to quicken as he began to narrow the space between them, when suddenly a ball of fabric collided with the side of his head, only to be followed with a number more fabric parcels to pelt them both, making them to break apart to defend themselves.

"Will someone please - tell - me...what in the love of - Merlin is - going - on" Remus managed to say in between being hit "Are these...these....these are my trousers! WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO! PADFOOT, PRONGS!?"

"Wait a minute, it wasn't me!" cried James holding his hands up in surrender.

"Hey don't look at me!" Sirius said taking the same stance.

"Who was it then?" Hermione shifted on the spot, dusting herself off and trying her hardest not to make eye contact with anyone.

"So Remus, how was your lunch?" Hermione tried, she really did, but the moment Lily asked that, she couldn't help but burst into laughter at the ridiculousness of the whole ordeal. The moment she started to laugh so did Lily, which seemed to only confuse and irritate Remus more.

"How, was my lunch....How was my lunch....Seriously!?" said Remus now standing with his hands on his hips, reminding Hermione so much of Mrs Weasley that it only fuelled her laughter more.

"Someone here, might have accio'd your trousers," Remus closed his eyes and ran his fingers through his hair trying to calm himself down, depositing chocolate sauce into it in the process.

"Who Prongs. Who did?"

"Granger," answered Pettigrew a little too quickly.

"Rat" she spat.

There was an awkward silence for a moment, whilst Remus gathered his trouser and took a moment to calm down a fraction, Hermione noticing he had ignored the Rat comment. However he did have bigger things to worry about, as he stood there covered in food and drink arms full with the offending items that not two moments ago attacked him in the Great Hall.

"Hermione" he began after a moment "Please explain...I...I really don't understand at all," he asked, dumping his trousers on to the bench.

"Lily told me to rescue you," she blurted.

"Hey, yes I said we should go and rescue him, but I didn't say we should summon him," Lily managed to say finally recovering from her fits of laughter.

"Why did you summon me?" Remus asked turning now to look at a red faced Hermione pinching the bridge of his nose.

"Your trousers," interrupted James.

"Excuse me?"

"It was your trousers, she summoned," added Sirius "Hence the pile of slacks, you've just dumped down,"
