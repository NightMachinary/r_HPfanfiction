When I first read the original books as a kid, I really didn't see Quirrell or Scabbers/Pettigrew coming. I still vividly remember my absolute shock that both were "the secret bad guys," and it was this element of surprise, along with all the little clues that foreshadowed the reveals, that made me love Harry Potter. (Perhaps those who read HP for the first time as adults saw all this coming, but, in my defense, I was eleven when I read the first three books.)

I'm looking for fics that have this same element, where the bad guys are true surprises even though, in retrospect, the author has seeded the narrative with clues.

I have no preferences for pairings/het/slash or particular tropes. Just well written and thoughtful stories.\\
Thanks for any suggestions!


** You also have Riddle/Ginny in CS and fake Moody in GF. This is something Rowling nailed in the early books and abandoned in the later ones. E.g. the only thing which is kinda surprising in OP is the role of Kreacher, but that's really underwhelming.

*** Order of the Phoenix did it differently. The villain was obvious, but was ultimately a petty thing compared to Voldemort.

**** I'm worried about spoilers and it's been a bit so I may have details wrong but

It's an angsty HHr story.

Hermione is a potioneer of some sort, Harry is an Auror, there's a mysterious group of criminal squibs with a mysterious purple potion... Gosh really everything is a reveal.

** Linkffn(9268425) has an unexpected villain and a sane Voldemort. It's complete but the sequel was abandoned after just a couple of chapters.

I'm not sure I liked the story but it's definitely had me thinking about it after reading.

** linkffn(Renegade Cause) is a decent thriller/action. There's some weird recurring things (in the vein of "Ghost of Harry Ashworth!" from that one Bellatrix/Harry fic) but the plot is fairly tight driven by some decent three dimensional characters. It's fairly gore-y and death happens often, so not for the faint of heart

** I was looking for one from my past I never could find I suppose no one could help me unless I give the twist though I hate giving it away :-? But Luna was a villain though Harry and Hermione treated her great she had already gotten tires of everyone picking on her and Voldemort being the brilliant sociopath he is was able to make her feel loved and cared for so she turned on the D.A I've looked but haven't been able to find it

** Linkffn(13312738)

It's an ongoing series with weekly updates. Lots of original characters, especially on the villain side.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
