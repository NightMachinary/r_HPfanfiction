Crappy Title

But Im looking for fanfictions where Tom falls in love/becomes infatuated/intrested and is in a relationship with someone and were raised together and/or they go to Hogwarts together

I've just finished rereading The Dark Lord's Rose by MissRoseAlanaHorton on ff.Net and it's got me obsessed with finding similar fanfics.

- Love interest Can be either Female or Male I don't care which

  Love Interest can only be OC or Harry (including fem Harry)

-Love Interest Can NOT be Hermione, Ginny, Luna etc. Only Original character or Harry

- Don't Care if it's Unrequited love or healthy and mutual. Obsessive and Possessive is also okay

Does not have to be Time Travel and can be set in the 1940s or Harry's original time line. Reincarnation isn't too bad either

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

  "It is unfortunate irony - and somewhat poetic justice - that someone conceived under the use of a love potion is rendered utterly incapable of feeling it." In which all Tom Marvolo Riddle knows is possession and desire, because trust me, monsters like that - they can't love. They can only want and want, until their hairy hearts can eat no more and beat no more.

** I know you said no Hermione but this one is very well done. And it's a Hermione who's born in the 40s so technically she's a different character?

Either way both her and Tom's characterization are really well done. It's a romance but they're independent people. They lie to each other, have their own goals, and Tom's as selfish as would be expected.

I can't recommend it enough. If you want a love story with Tom Riddle while acknowledging that Voldemort falling in love is almost impossible, this is the story for you.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way.

It's a time-travel fic with Harry winding up in Riddle's Hogwart's years. Unlike the vast majority of fics with that premise, this one treats the situation as a comedy with the framework of a more serious plot stretching underneath. The fic is a work in progress and the author updates frequently
