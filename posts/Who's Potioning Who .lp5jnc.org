Indy!Harry with the aid of Daphne has uncovered the love potion plot of Dumbledore and the Weasleys and has barged in to confront them.

But in a surprising twist, it turns out that all the manipulations they were pulling were the result of them /also/ being potioned by an unknown third party.

At this moment, Harry's indy rage suddenly dissipates, as it was only the affect of yet another potion that Daphne slipped him.

Everyone goes to Greengrass Manor to confront her only to find out her Ice Queen persona was you guessed it, the result of being potioned. The "real" Daphne is a laid back surfer chick (later revealed to be the result of yet another potion)

Confident!Neville takes charge to find the mastermind behind all this chaos but you can probably take a wild guess what happens.

Hijinks ensues as soon the entire populace of Hogwarts is roped into the hunt for the potion mastermind, all rapidly changing personas as the dozens of potions they are all under take affect and/or wear off.


** The system of potioned minds potioning other minds is not only Turing complete, but is running the software of a self-aware mind with a desire for self-preservation. The original mastermind who potioned a bunch of people was Salazar Slytherin, but he died centuries ago without realizing that he'd created an autonomous system that could live on without him.

*** So...some kind of memetic entity? A parasitic living idea that propagates by forcing its hosts to concoct specially-designed love potions?  \\
...That could be /interesting/. By day, bash-worthy Ron whining about Slytherins and calling Hermione rude things. By night, the facade drops as he brews more bash-potion for the next victim...\\

Actually, that reminds me of Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers. It's a parody of, well, you can guess, but I was reminded of the cartoon in particular because Daffy, Elmer and Yosemite Sam are replaced by caricatures of themselves.

** And along with the string of potions is another string of Imperius curses.

Turns out this plot has been going on for decades by a Dark Lady/Lord whose aim was to merely spread chaos. Their deeds were erased from history books. They still have followers, though.
