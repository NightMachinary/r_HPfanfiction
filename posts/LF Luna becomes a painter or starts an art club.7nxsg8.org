Luna does seem to have a talent for painting as seen in the Deathly Hallows. Know any fics where she becomes a professional painter or similiar, or starts and arts club of sorts at Hogwarts.


** Linkffn(11276914) has her as a professional artist, showcasing in Muggle parlors.

  Although he would never admit it, Theodore Nott loves muggle art. Now he's about to discover there is magic even in the most unexpected of places. Theo/Luna one-shot.
