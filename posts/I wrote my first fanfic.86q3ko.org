** I think this would be a bit too much work for me to beta at the moment, but I really recommend you looking up grammar rules and conventions, particularly commas. I also don't know why you feel the need to underline Merlin's dialogue. Just keep it as normal dialogue.

** IMHO you shouldn't ask for betas before you are willing to put some effort of your own into it. It's obvious that you haven't proofread what you wrote even once.
