Can't remember if this is a product of canon or fanon, bu5 the idea of Voldemort being a "self-styled Dark Lord" has always fascinated me. I love the idea that he took the title of Dark Lord but did so whilst lacking some sort of requirement that would make him a "true" Dark Lord.

Always left me wondering what that element would be. Especially as the term was never attributed to Grindelwald, thus making me wonder what differentiated the two for this to occur.

Any thoughts on this would be welcome, as well as any fics that go into it in any sort of detail.


** Well my head canon is that Dark Wizards/Witches are individuals known to have used dark magic to hurt/torture/kill others, or those who were known for researching/developing various dark magic.

I see them as the serial killers or murderers of the magical world.

However the term is informal and pretty arbitrary. Even if you don't use dark magic, but you're known for killing or hurting an individual, you might still be called Dark or a Dark wizard/witch.

A Dark Lord is just another informal adjective. It refers to either 1) a particularly infamous dark wizard 2) a particularly strong dark wizard or 3) a leader of a group of dark Wizards

I've always liked the idea that it's all informal. There's no standard to being a Dark wizard or Dark Lord.

** Afaik, Dark Lord is just something Voldemort and his followers call him to make him seem more threatening. At least in canon, that is.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

** Being internationally recognized as ruling somewhere. During book 7 he could have upgraded from possible dark lord to Dark Lord, but as he left minions officially in charge of the government he was still self styled. This was however why no other country was officially involved, even if some private citizens came over to help.

*** That's an interesting perspective but seems like an odd requirement. Dark Lords in fiction are known to rule from behind the scenes after all.

I like the idea that it's something arcane or esoteric that he missed out on.

**** Dark Lord Sauron? Ruled Mordor. Dark Lord Grindelwald? Ruled Germany. Dark lord Voldemort? Only the Brittish thought he was a Dark Lord. You aren't a Dictator until your group rules the country, you are a Rebel Leader and a Terrorist, but you can be a Self Styled Dictator until you win.

***** I get that reasoning, but look at the Sith. The Master (and sometime the Apprentices) hold the title Dark Lord of the Sith not for their dominions but for their knowledge and prowess in the Dark Side/Dark Arts. The Baneite Sith (until Sidious and Vader) literally had nowhere under their direct control but were still conniving, dark and powerful.

Additionally, nowhere (yet) does it say that Grindelwald ruled anywhere. His base of operations was Nuremgard in Austria, and although it was a castle it doesn't inherently mean he ruled anywhere (like how Voldemort operated out of Malfoy Manor) when he controlled the Ministry.

****** After Star Wars I avoid prequels so have not seen any of the fantastic beast movies, but I was under the impression that Hitler did so well because Grindelwald had taken over the local magical government, and was preventing wizards from interfering to stop the Nazis. With one world government, already puppeted by wizards, conquering the muggles would be easy. My larger point however, was International Recognition being the requirment to be official.
