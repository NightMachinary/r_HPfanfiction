Okay so this is one of the first fics I ever read and can't seem to find again. This is a mentor Snape where Harry is abused with the Dursley and when he arrives at Hogwarts turns into a Slytherin. Harry is quiet and Snape finds out what's wrong with him. Later on Snape takes the role of mentor where they brew together and even render the basilisk together. I think that later on Snape adopts Harry.
