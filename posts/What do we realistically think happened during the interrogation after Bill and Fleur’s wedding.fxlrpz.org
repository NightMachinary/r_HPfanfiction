About 3 days after the DE's infiltrated the wedding and H, Hr, and R escaped, Lupin shows up at Grimmauld Place and tells them that the DE's interrogated people at the Burrow for “hours” and searched the house top to bottom (leaving the ghoul-as-Ron-with-spattergroit alone). Weasleys and Order members and whomever didn't disapparate in time, I would think. He also says they crashed every other Order-connected house and specifically says they tortured Tonks's parents.

Should we realistically be assuming that torture was involved in the interrogations of the Weasleys et al on the night of the wedding? Lupin didn't say as much, while he specifically said so about the Tonkses. I suppose he could have been sparing H, Hr, and R the awful truth (though in retrospect I'm surprised none of them pressed Lupin further on that topic).

Anyway, I guess bottom line, would you accept either interpretation as plausible? Either that the interrogations were pretty brutal or that they were not? I suppose one argument against it is that the DE-controlled Ministry that has literally /just/ been established in a silent coup needs to maintain the appearance of legitimacy in order to not inspire open rebellion.

(And a related, parting thought, is the timeline on this really messed up? The trio apparate to Tottenham Court Road, go to the coffee shop, then go to Grimmauld Place, and shortly after they arrive they get Arthur's Patronus saying “family safe, do not reply, we are being watched,” and in my estimation there can only have been an hour or so passed by that point --- but Lupin says the interrogation took “hours”...)

Thanks in advance for any thoughts!

ETA: Also, do we think the Order members present at the wedding tried to put up any kind of a fight at first, dueling and so forth? Or to what extent, I guess? (My instinct is probably not much of a fight, as that would have escalated things rapidly and we know nobody died, only that there was a search and interrogations; Lupin never mentions an attempt to fight and having to be subdued.)


** I would suspect what you consider a messed up timeline is indicative of a normal interrogation. It sounds as if they were taking turns asking the Weasleys as to the location of Harry Potter and Arthur snuck out when it wasn't his turn to be interrogated to quickly send a message. I don't know about you but when I torture someone, I don't allow them long-enough breaks to send off messages. I doubt it was torture because Arthur went to work and we didn't get cues from Lupin. Also they were purebloods even if blood traitors whereas the Tonks included a muggleborn.

*** It /was/ actually my initial thought on that point, that Arthur may have sent it while the DE's were still there. I had ended up doubting myself on that because I figured they wouldn't have left any of their detainees completely unattended (whether or not there was torture involved).

The strongest argument I've been able to concoct in my own mind against torture being involved is that I'm really not sure I see Lupin as someone who would purposely conceal that information from the trio.

So overall I think I am inclined to agree with you, but I didn't know whether I was taking an unrealistically rosy view of things, if that makes sense.

** Why bother with torture? They're not looking for fun, but accurate information. They'd probably crucio the uncooperative ones a few times, but otherwise I'd say they'd probably use the nigh-unbeatable truth potion that exists in the Potterverse. You don't need to interrogate someone if you've got a truth potion damn near no-one can actually beat.

*** Well, I somehow doubt Veritaserum was used on the family and Order members there, since nobody /did/ give up truthful information (such as the fact that Harry had been there that day or the truth about Ron not actually being sick in bed). Had they given up the fact that they'd been concealing Harry, someone would have been imprisoned, I would think.

I imagine anybody who kept to the, “We haven't seen Harry, he wasn't at the wedding, don't know what's he's up to lately” line could technically have been accused of being uncooperative, which was why I could see torture being a reality since we know the DE's aren't above it when seeking information.

But the more I think about it and get feedback from different people, the more realistic it seems to me that they would /not/ have started out so heavy-handed at this early stage of their new government.

Thank you for taking the time to give your thoughts!

Indeed, and considering the potion works on nearly everyone if they haven't pre-prepared the antidote or mastered Occlumency, that's a massively illogical move on the DE's part if they didn't. Three drops of a potion and they know everything they want to. But looking for consistency and logic in HP is a fool's errand, at best. The idiot-balls were really shared around throughout the entire series thanks to Rowling breaking most of her own rules. :D

Though, Veritaserum is supposedly forcing the drinker to answer what the drinker perceives as true, meaning that since Harry was in the appearance of a Weasley cousin and not himself, you could technically believe that you hadn't seen HIM, only heard his voice coming from someone who didn't look like him (and no interrogator is likely to go "Did you hear him at the wedding?" - they'd likely phrase it as "Have you heard from him?", and thus getting entirely different 'truths' in the process) and you wouldn't be lying, either. So, anyone clever could've fooled the potion. "He wasn't at the wedding" would've been a lie, but "We didn't see him at the wedding" would've been the truth as they perceived it. Technical truth is the best truth to tell murderous Magical-Nazis. :)

These are a people lead by a guy who crucios his own side and couldn't beat a schoolchild and took down the ministry about five minutes before. Might've just had more pressing things to attend to.

***** All true! Your points about technically beating Veritaserum are something I've pondered before with respect to a different fic I've been working on --- because yeah, you'd think the Ministry (whether DE-run or not) would just use it all the time and every case would be open and shut, but apparently they don't.

It is a fool's errand, but I am often known to do those. :D

Thanks again, your thoughts are much appreciated!

****** Sure. This is what I do for fun - worldbuilding is all the delight of getting to play God, after all. :)

And her logic for the lack of use is that it's basically a Wizarding Polygraph and we don't use those (which is a faulty comparison because they don't work in the slightest) and that the potion only forces you to tell the truth as you see it, which falls apart if you're insane or delusional (I think that's her rationale for why Fudge ignored Barty Crouch Junior).

"You believe the person who attacked you was Mr Malfoy, don't you Mrs Mudbloo- I mean Mrs Muggleborn, but you don't know for certain, do you?" and boom. Conviction given reasonable doubt, despite the truth potion.

I don't know what I think about that reasoning, but it's what the wiki says she said on the matter.

******* Yes I'd read that before about the comparison to the polygraph, and it makes at least some sense to me. The poly doesn't hold up in court but “passing” or “failing” it does ultimately come down to ones ability to modulate their responses, and I can see that reasoning being applicable to Veritaserum even though the potion doesn't measure physiological responses like a poly.

I think there is something to the idea that Veritaserum only forces you to tell what you honestly believe the truth to be, so it's pointless to use it on someone who is mad.

I had a thought that perhaps one could write the (legitimate) Ministry as having a rule against forcible administration of Veritaserum, sort of like a corollary to the real world right to silence --- which I like on the one hand, though on the other hand the Ministry seems not to give a shit about due process or even understand the concept.

I reckon during the first wizarding war, they were so keen to toss DE's in prison that they just seriously didn't care to inquire further than necessary, used Occam's Razor on cases like Sirius's, and just passed judgment in a rather conclusory manner.

I am a lawyer IRL, so I both enjoy thinking about these things and am driven completely crazy by them. :P

Ah, my condolences.

Sorry, couldn't resist a poke there. :D

That's the one linguistic thing I think Americans do better than us - Lawyers practice Law, Solicitors just... solicit.

I mean, sure. But also, the only named methods of defence against it are antidotes and occlumency, the former of which you'd just have to wait out or purge somehow, and the latter apparently next to nobody uses, so if you trained people in interrogation properly, then there'd be very few people who could actually fool the potion, certainly not enough to justify not using it at all. And whether or not you get stressed when you lie is very different to being able to coach your wording to give the other person the wrong idea. I guess it depends on what particular interpretation of the minimal detail we're given about it in canon that you ascribe to. For some it might be close, for others it might not.

I mean, Presumption of Guilt is also a thing, right? I know we practiced it for a little while in Europe during the middle ages, though I'd have to check to find out exactly when. Part of the whole "The Roman Empire fell and we lost all sense of civilization" thing. If you can make it work somehow, go ahead (perhaps it's just the Ministers, not the Ministry that's corrupt, for example; or just a Pureblood-sponsored 'we shouldn't be forced to reveal our secrets and jeopardise our positions/noble houses/bloodlines/careers that way' thing), but I admit I don't see the Ministry as caring about due process or justice.

If they were that keen to toss DEs in jail, they would've used Veritaserum to prove or disprove the whole 'Imperius Defence' thing. According to the wiki, they did assign watchers, but that seems quite pointless - the war was over and Voldemort was gone, it's not like they had any DE meetings to go to.

I guess it'd depend on what legal foundation a magical society might be built on. English Law is built on Common Law, for example, but a Magical Society might operate on more mythical-arcane legal rules like Geasa, or just have them mixed in to a Common Law system close to what we had back when the Magical and Muggle worlds separated. If their law doesn't have the concept, they're not going to use it, right?
