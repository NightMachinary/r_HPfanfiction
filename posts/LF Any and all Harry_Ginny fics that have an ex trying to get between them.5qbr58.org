I'm looking for any Harry/Ginny fic where they are together, anything from OOTP to post-Battle, and either an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend or any other character, tries to get between them in some way. Open to one shots and longer fics, but my only restriction is neither Harry or Ginny can actually cheat. Some examples:

- while Harry is at auror training and Ginny is finishing her 7th year, Dean/Michael tries to get back together with her or Cho tries to get back with him.
- Harry and Ginny have to keep their relationship a secret (maybe he's the DADA professor, or just Voldemort can't know about them) and guys ask out Ginny/girls ask out Harry
- while Harry is hunting Horcruxes, Neville or some other character tries to date Ginny while she's at school her sixth year.


** I do remember one where Cho gives Harry another chance, but Harry doesn't want to /ahem/ leave the party too early because that's what ruined their relationship the first time round, so he enlists ginny to teach him to control himself. Hinny is endgame. I can try to track it down for you, but no promises.

  COMPLETED! Epilogue added! Harry needs help...with women. Guess who comes along to help him out? Rated R for sex--lots of it--and language. HG pairing. FLUFF! Please RR!

*** thanks for the rec. I remember starting this and didn't like how it actually was just American Pie and Ginny was the nerdy "Michelle" character. But I didnt get past the first chapter so take what I say with a grain of salt.

Looking for something a bit different overall but thanks for putting the effort in.
