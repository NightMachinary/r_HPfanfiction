I think the title says it all. Write a story where Harry learns he is a wizard earlier, and becomes an Obscurus due to him being forced to supress his magic


** This is the basis for a story I'm writing. In which Harry learns to control it and use it in his fight against Voldemort.

**** No title yet.

Basically it goes out of control and Dumbledore cleans it up. He spins Harry's time at Hogwarts monitoring him and subtly testing him to see if it can be controlled.

After the graveyard he takes Harry on as an apprentice and by the canon end Harry uses it as his main source of offense.

** I drafted something similar a while ago, but I was never able to get it started as I ran out of steam with it. I will come back to it in a while, like all my drafted stories.

Anyway, Harry represses his magic after he learns what it is from Petunia, who explains that Lily died because of magic. He desires not to have filthy magic and it causes it to build and explode, decimating the neighbourhood. A vampire, sensing the blast, comes by and turns Harry to stop him from dying. The vampire hates himself for turning a human and spends most of the time apologising to Harry and teaching him.

In this story, vampires are a little more powerful than normal and can do a lot of twisted things, so Dumbledore is suspicious but not in a bashing manner.

Voldemort is /thrilled/.

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.

** There's a Crossover with Avengers where he is an Obscurus, though noone knows what he's at first. It also shows an Inventor!Harry that tries to combine "Magic" and Technology.

  Magic and technology. Polar opposites for some, and yet for one boy living on the streets ... maybe they can be something more. Follow Harry as he is taken in by the famous Tony Stark and starts to combine his own unique powers with technology in ways that make him more than just a wizard, or a thief, or a prodigy, but instead make him ... an Avenger. Harry/multi.

*** Have to say, the one you linked is kinda shit

It's broken up into a bunch of "books" all containing one or two chapters, you have no idea what's going on, chapters happen after chapters that come later, you have no idea who all the characters are...

was it really so hard for the author to just write a coherent story in one volume, making chronological sense?
