:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry Potter time travels to raise his younger self. He has a name that is a skin condition. He has a trial that proves that Sirius is innocent who I think then lives with them later on. It's a Time Travel!Harry Potter/Voldemort.

I've been looking for it all day please help.


** I'm assuming you mean Xerosis? I've never read the fic, but it's the only one with a skin condition name I know.

*** I never got more than a few chapters into that fic, but I recall Xerosis starts with Harry getting sent back to relive his life from babyhood, not raise his younger self. Does that happen later in the fic?

I know of a few unfinished HP/LV stories in which adult!Harry raises young!Harry, but neither one of them gives Harry an odd name. On the off chance that they might be what OP was thinking of, here they are:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1161859/][House of Snakes]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6573724/][Beyond the Breaking Point]]

**** They might be I honestly think that I am remembering a bit off on the fact that I have read so many fics and they might be mixing when I remember them, but I'll read those that you gave me! Thank you!

***** Thanks for clearing up the mystery - you had me curious, haha! I'm glad I could be of some help. Unfortunately neither of the fics I linked got very far into their plots before they were abandoned, but I enjoyed them and I hope that you will too.
