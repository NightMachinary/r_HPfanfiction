And an idiot, too. As he skulked around his lair in the dungeon, Amortentia bubbling away in one of his many cauldrons, he spoke in a tone of voice that bordered on the exclamations of a troll. "Blimey!" he blubbered "Out of unicorn blood again. Well, I guess it's huntin' time!". He grabbed his large crossbow and apparated into the forest.

--------------

Lord-Lord Hadrian Jameson Potter-Black was quite bored, and threw back his ponytail, rolling over in the grass so the sun would reach his back. "Gee, it sure is boring around here." he said seductively to nobody in particular. Suddenly, Albus Dumbledork came forth from a crack in the floor, and twinkeled so hard Hadrian had to squint so as not to go blind.

"M'boy, this peace is what all true wizards strive for!" he spoke, wisely, and Hadrian felt his face shifting into a smirky scoff. "I just wonder what Tommy's up to."

And in that moment, Severus Snape's luscious locks appeared on the ground, for he had just come by on his broom. "Your Headmasterness! Tommy and his minions have seized the ministry of magic!" he spoke, lusciously, his raven-dark hair glittering in the moonlight. "How can we help?" Said Dumbledumb, inquiringly, quirking his eyebrows quirkily.

Severus quickly took a glass orb from his robes, and the ghostly form of Professor Trelawney appeared, speaking in a ghastly voice: "It is written! Only Hadrian can defeat Voldemort!"

Hadrian quickly rolled upright, and then began bouncing towards the castle, screaming "Great! I'll grab my stuff!", even as the elder wand and the stone of resurrection appeared and melded with his very bones.

--------------

"Blimey!" said the slob of fat and ugliness called Ron, "how will I maintain my body weight in this climate?", for the three of them - Lord-Lord Hadrian Jameson Potter-Black, Hermione D'arkness McQueen and Ronald McEvil - had just begun their hunt for the evil Voldymorts Horcruxes.

Hadrian scoffed smirkily at him before emitting an ear-splitting screech of "FIENDFIRE" while flicking his wand in his direction. He expertly manipulated the demonic fire into the shape of a large spork, and eviscerated the fat, ugly, unattractive and evil blob called Ronald.

"Gosh, that was so hawt, Harry!" Said Hermione McQueen, draping herself over his chiseled, adonis-like body.

"Shut the fuck up, bitch, that's Lord-Lord Hadrian Jameson Potter-Black to you! Don't you ever speak to me again. I'm going to make sure you'll never be hired anywhere again!"

Hermione swooned so hard her brain lost circulation and she died of a stroke.

--------------

"Blimey!" Said the ghost of Ronald McEvil, who had come back to leech of Hadrian's success, while attempting to grasp the ghost of Hermione McQueen, who had come back to swoon some more. But she wasn't ugly like Myrtle, so it was fine.

Hadrianson Jameson Potter-Black-Slytherin was currently negotiating with the Dementors, and finally managed to use his hidden, secret Slytherin™ Cunning™ Side™ to pay for passage with the souls of his two friends.

Now he was finally ready for the last showdown with the evil Voldymorts.

--------------

"Blimey!" said the fat Dementor that had consumed the ghost of Rarnold, who had been too fat and ugly for the non-being to digest, and had instead assumed its form. Meanwhile, the other dementor, who was definitely still hot, had consumed the soul of Hergymine, and powered by her unending love and the hidden soul-chain, had also taken over its otherworldly mind.

Voldyshorts stood before Hadrian and his two dementors, waiting to be killed by the Author.

"No, wait, I will defeat this upstart!" he said, looking like a lost puppy, and immediately died of a heart attack.

"I don't even have a heart! Abra Kedravra!" Sadly, he had messed up the incantations for the AK, and was instantly killed as the curse curved around and splattered blood, brainmatter and various other fluids across the entire room. A bit of flesh hit Hadrian in the face, and once again screeching an ear-splitting "FIENDFIRE", it was gone.

--------------

"Blimey!" said the blob of black ectoplasm as it rolled after Hadrian, who had just entered Gringotts, only to find all the Goblins worshipping at his feet, "That is so Hawt!"

"It's him! The grandmaster!" Said BloodOrgy, the master of puppies at Gringotts, and Hadrian was instantly bombarded with small paper balls.

Rolling one out, he noticed it was a marriage contract!

With a single flick of his wand, all the contracts were transformed into needles, and immediately killed all the Goblins in the room.

MurderHobo, the goblin responsible for door maintenance, led Hadrian to Ragnarok, the most badass Goblin of all time, who took a single look at his scar and called for Bill Weasley instead of a goblin cursebreaker.

--------------

"Blimey!" said the fat skeleton of Rumbles, as Bill Wesley hit Hardian with a spell. "Horcruxius Removus!" he cried, and Hadrian fell to the floor, dead.

His brain had sadly leaked from the scar in his skull, and he was killed instantly.

The Author went to get drunk enough to forget this entire story.

The End.


** I had just noticed the abomination flair, which I didn't remember seeing before, and was wondering what the hell is that all about, and voila! An example! Now allow me to go pour bleach into my eyes so that I never have to see something of this nature again!

Edit: Just went over the abomination again, and on second thought, it reads rather like "Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked like a Large Pile of Ash."

*** I actually made a subtle nod to that piece of cultural brilliance. You see, My Immortal is actually a variety of counter-resonant cultural streamline movement, which directly contradicts the mainstream and is therefore hated. However, in their brilliance, the author sought to include cutting-edge commentary in the form of Auhors Notes, which clearly demonstrate a sharp mind and an excellent gift for pure sarcasm. I couldn't have written it better myself, to be honest, as My Immortal truly is the eigth modern wonder of the world. Everyone who reads it should feel blessed to have been able to witness it, and weep for the souls which died too soon to see it, for it is clearly our redemption as humans in the eyes of God, the Creator. I am of the firm belief that the Lord has barred entry for you into Heaven if you haven't read and appreciated My Immortal's cutting-edge sociological commentary and brilliant plotline which perfectly lampshades political realities and socio-economic misgivings of our society, even to this day. However, all this pales to the fact that in nineteen-ninety-eight, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through the announcer's table.

EVERYTHING fits with canon magic as long as it fits into Divination, charm, jinx, hex, curse, etc. Tempus? It tells you the time? Why is that against canon? It isn't. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Scarpin%27s_Revelaspell][Scarpin's Revelaspell]] does practically the same thing, but instead of time, it tells you the ingredients of a potion. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Specialis_Revelio][Specialis Revelio]] tells you the spells performed on an object or potion.

I don't think that's a rule. I'm of the opinion that the venom/fiendfyre aren't actually destroying the horcrux, it's destroying the container.

Book7, chapter 6

Harry's scarcrux didn't have any of those enchantments or a proper ritual, so that spell could work.

And really, they could theoretically study the thing for a bit and remove the protections bit by bit until it's just an item with a soul attached. And then the above spell would work.
