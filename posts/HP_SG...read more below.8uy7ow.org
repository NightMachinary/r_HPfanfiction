So I was driving to work this morning and noticed my collection of geek swag dangling down from my mirror and my little Harry Potter was snuggled up to my Spider Gwen, and it was an epiphany. I need a fic with Harry and Gwen. I have read a bunch of super hero x overs and have never seen that pairing.
