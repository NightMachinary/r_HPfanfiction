:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So as you can tell from the title, I'm hunting for an old Draco/Ron story that I think I read on AO3, though I wasn't able to find it when it looked through the tag on the site and it wasn't in my bookmarks.

Any way, besides the info mentioned above, some others I vaguely remember.

- The 1st story takes place I think during 6th year.
- Ron has some sort of mental connection to Harry, I think. All I remember is in the final chapter(s) of the first story, he somehow sees that Harry is walking into a trap and leaves Draco to help him, even though he knows he's likely to die. They have a huge fight, and I think it's when one of them says they love the other.
- 2nd story is uncompleted, but I do remember that Ron definitely died, and that Draco sort of blackmails Hermione (because he realized that she was also in love with Ron) to bring him back to life.
- I think Harry might have also died.
- Chess playing is a big thing in the story, with Ron and Draco bonding over chess.

Unfortunately I can't remember too much else. But if anyone remembers the story, it would be a big help!


** this sounds good. I hope someone finds it

*** Yeah, me too. I fear the author deleted it from AO3 and/or scrubbed it from the net.

But damn, it was so good. Like I'm not a huge Draco/Ron shipper or anything, but this fic really made me believe that this pairing could work.
