It used to be an excellent repository of completed long fanfics, helpfully organised by characters. A while back the website stopped working. I think I vaguely remember the last time I used it I was in the middle of reading something and got redirected to a new site where it had combined with its PJO and few others equivalents, but I have not idea where that was or if that is still a thing. Any help?


** The site you are looking for is [[https://www.faenfiction.com/][Faenfiction]].

** I think the site owner died? Or was that another site?

*** I have no idea how websites work, but if that happened, and presumably it is no longer paying for its server space, then wouldn't it disappear completely? The URL still works for the main page, there is just nothing on it.

**** Depends how long it was paid for, I think. If it were years in advance, it could still be up for years, barring any technical faults.
