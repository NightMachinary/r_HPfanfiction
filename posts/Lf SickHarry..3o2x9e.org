Ideally fics that have a sick or frail Harry that prevent him from adventuring as much as he'd like.


** Linkffn(Recnac Transfaerso) is a really good. It's part of a trilogy I think. Harry has cancer in this one.

*** I already read that one, actually. I felt like the author was [[/spoiler][a little too scared to allow Harry to die in the end]] and chickened out.

**** Ah yeah I read it a while ago so i don't remember details, but there's an alternate ending where [[/spoiler][he does die]] if you're interested. I think it's a one shot.

** This is post war, and it's slash, but I would still recommend it if they usually put you off of a fic.

** There's a short one I can't remember the name of that's written from Snape's perspective, where Harry saves him from a werewolf (possibly lupin in book 3) but gets lycanthropy. Canon lycanthropy, not the Super!Creature!Harry style lycanthropy prevalent in fan fiction.

If anyone can remember it, I'd really appreciate being pointed in the right direction. I enjoyed it and would like to reread it.
