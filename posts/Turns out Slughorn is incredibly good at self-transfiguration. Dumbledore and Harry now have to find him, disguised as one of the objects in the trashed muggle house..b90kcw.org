Some extra requests (optional):\\
1) Humor\\
2) Harry has a good idea what should be in a normal muggle house, Dumbledore and Slughorn not so much.\\
3) Unfortunately for Harry, the owners were some pretty weird people.


** “Maybe try the Elton John throw pillow, Professor,” Harry suggested, “Err...the one with the glasses, yeah.”

Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, and his headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, had been trying for nearly an hour to find a wizard hiding amongst the decorations and furniture of a little house in Budleigh Babberton with little progress.

The elder wizard flicked his wand at the offending pillow, and Harry felt his scowl deepen.“Of course not! Why would a wizard know who Elton John is?”

“You'll find many people have unexpected depths, Harry,” Dumbledore replied, peering at one of the dozen mirrors hanging on the sitting room walls, “if you look closely enough.”

He tapped his wand against the mirror's ornate gold frame and stepped back...only to frown as nothing happened.

“Whoever lives here is a total nutter,” Harry grumbled, nudging the nearby stuffed golden retriever with his foot.“This is the right house, Professor?” He asked, “Number 7, Corsham Road?”The professor's head snapped up, “Number 7 you say Harry? Not Number 6?”

“Err, I think Number 6 is across the street, sir.”

“Well, perhaps we should take a look across the street then, just to be sure.” The old man waved his wand and the various knick-knacks, memorabilia, and assorted curiosities shifted about, returning, Harry assumed, to their positions before the two wizards' mistaken, if well-intentioned home-invasion.

*~*~*~*

“About bloody time!” someone shouted as Harry stepped through the door of Number 6, “I thought I was going to spend all night as an armchair! What are you playing at Dumbledore!?”

Dumbledore turned, then, and strode back the way he had entered. Opening the screen door, his wand tapped the wooden address numeral hanging by the porch lamp.

A rather plump, and surprised fellow tumbled from the wall and landed on the porch.

"Blast it! How did you guess?!"\\
"Harry Potter, who I've brought with me, noticed that your neighbor across the way is at #6."\\
"They haven't got a hanging number! And my next neighbor is #5... Is this him? A pleasure, I'm sorry Albus hadn't introduced us sooner! How did you know my neighbor's address when they haven't posted it?"\\
"Sir, their number is on their post box, and besides, all numbers are odd---"

"That they are. That they are. Well, shall we have some tea?'

** Slughorn disguising himself as a chair has some cool implications.

Transfiguration is real and permanent. Slughorn was a chair but he still retained his mind and ability to use magic.

This means that Slughorn knows some kind of magic that lets him keep his mind despite having a body that is not meant to have a mind.

Voldemort created a hand made of silver for Peter.

Combining the two, it's possible to have an entirely fluid metallic body and still be capable of using magic.

Bam! Wizard T-1000

Also this means that it's possible for a portrait to actually be a wizard masquerading as a portrait.

*** There is also Krum ans his half-shark transfiguration and Hermione mentioned something about submarine.

That's actually why I had to specify "self-transfiguration". Seems like it should be a separate extra hard branch of human transfiguration for exactly that "keeping your mind" reason.

** I always thought it was an odd choice that a character who would be revealed to be a Potions Master would choose transfiguration as his method of evasion. Not sure what he could have applied his Potions expertise to, but I just thought it unusual that the story went there.
