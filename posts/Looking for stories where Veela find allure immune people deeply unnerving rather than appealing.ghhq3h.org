** Hell yeah. This would be a great trope inversion. You could either go route a) where Harry just doesn't get her (whichever Veela) when he thinks his immunity would help, or route b) where they get together before they discover his immunity, and she has to learn to live with his weirdness.

** I could see that. "My magic reads you as a corpse and that is unsettling on a primal level" style of thing.

Personally, I'd find it more likely that allure-immune people read as gay. Veela don't affect women, after all.

** People who are immune to their allure automatically put Veela on guard, as they are considered possible enemies since it reminds them of one of their most oldest foes, Toadstghouls. They are one of the most ugliest, most foul tempered humanoid toad like creatures that ever lived.

Luckily they are thought to have died off as their hasn't been a sighting of them in main-land Europe in many hundreds of years, besides they have a tendency to try and breed with humans and who would ever want to breed with something that looks like a toad?

** That`s one of the few tropes that makes sense actually(if the "allure" worked like that in canon), I mean, who would want to date someone who can`t have a single coherent non-sexual thought in their presence?

*** Depends on if you want to assume that as a race they're somewhat psychopathic in the sense of manipulating people for their own gain and lacking empathy and general capacity for genuine affection. I don't think I've seen a fic make that assumption, but if one did that would make this suggestion make a lot of sense.

**** Even if they're not, it could be rather unsettling. Fanon allure is like a level of control that a Veela has over others at all times. A constant safety net.

Even ignoring that, there's just the "this person is different" factor.

*** It's implied that Veela can turn it on and off, or at least strengthen it or weaken it, judging by Harry's comment after Ron tries to ask Fleur out when she was trying to get Cedric to ask her.

Ron centric long fic, there's a few chapters where he resists the Veela Allure in a chess tournament and everyone looks at him like a god. It's only a small part of the story though. (The whole thing is def worth reading imo)

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

****** So, through year 1 and a lot of the summer and wanted to give my thoughts since some commenters below seemed curious: First of all, it's 22/115 chapters as of now, and definitely felt a bit drawn out, but not brutal by any means. Premise and plot are all novel enough that I'm definitely still very invested. To this point, it's probably the least Mary Sue Daphne I've read yet, and while she is a tad annoying, she's also 11, so I'm hoping she can grow out of it. Way less obnoxious IMO than Hermione so far at least.

On the other hand, the author has already shown a dislike for time jumps, and I'm pretty confident that at some point that feature alone could kill this one for me, but I'm definitely still invested enough to give year 2 a shot

******* I started reading it again bc i want to see how the story ends bc the main plot is interesting despite how little of the story it is. Yeah iy doesn't get better. I'm finishing it only out of spite as a challenge.I definitely don't reccomend the fic to anyone. So much padding. On chapter 58 I had to read through tens of thousands of words building up to a dinner party where literally nothing happens. And the chapter still isn't over. It definitely has its good elements, and i won't make a final judgement till i've finished the chapters that are up; it's a lot. I think it suffers from way too many POV's, too many asides that don't influence the plot directly or a conflict will start but will immediately be resolved thereby gutting all the tension driving the plot.
