Does anyone else really not care what the pairing is in a story? I personally like Harry-centric, non-slash stories. But it could literally be Harry/any other female character in the universe and I wouldn't mind as long as it's written well. I've just never been much of a shipper. The only one I can't seem to read is Harry/Fleur, but I think that's just because I haven't found a good story with that pairing yet (with the exception of Deprived which sadly hasn't been updated in a while). Most of them involve veela bonding and allures and crap like that which I'm not interested in at all.

So, am I the only one here? What are your thoughts?


** I care to the extent that I'm not really interested in stories with certain pairings such as those including Snape or Riddle. Beyond that I don't care as long as it's a good story. I read het, slash, femslash, gen, Harry-centric, stories where Harry doesn't even appear, etc. I have certain pairings that I do read more than others, but I have no OTP.

I think one of the problems with shipping is that the pairing should serve the story, not the other way around. The writing invariably suffers when it's merely a vehicle to force two characters together because you think they Belong Together.

** IMO, when a pairing goes bad, it goes bad because of the way the author has to degrade and distort characters in order to make the 'ship work. Think the Harmony 'ship where Hermione is reduced to Harry's perennial damsel in distress, with no personality or initiative of her own or, conversely, where Harry is suddenly more interested in reading than in Quiddich --- or, even without degrading any given character, a 'ship that simply erases their rough edges, even though that's what makes them interesting; think the Dramione 'ship where Draco is suddenly this suave, rich, badboy sweeping a bookish ingÃ©nue (who cleans up nicely) off her feet.

** Yeah, I'd go one step further and say I couldn't care less about the romance in the HP world, it wasn't what drew me in to HP anyway. JKR had just the right amount to make the characters feel human, but a lot of fanfics read like adult soap operas set among children.

** I prefer stories that don't focus too much on romance yet pull it off well. Romance stories on their own tend to have pretty annoying drama and leave everything else as an after-thought. I wouldn't say I particularly prefer a certain ship, but Harry/Luna particularly amuses me when it's pulled off (which is like never) and Hermione is nice too (but I see a lot of crap fics with her as the main pairing).

As for a decent Fleur story. This one is pretty good. The romance hasn't been developed entirely, but it's still updating I think and everything else is pretty good too. linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind]])

**** linkffn(7352166,3862145) Harry and Luna that is very well done. I usually avoid fics with Luna, even as a minor character, because they're always so OOC and bad. These two stories are Luna heavy and well written. They really capture that unique voice that almost everyone has a hard time recreating.

**** Technically Prince of the Dark Kingdom is Harry/Luna since it's literally the only relationship (though not a heavily detailed one) he's had, so that's one (she's also a werewolf). I haven't read that Firebird series yet either so I'll see how that goes, but I don't think it's exactly what I have in mind. It's definitely a nice pairing and I think it could work if someone could write it without it getting bogged down by certain things and not forcing it. They had some solid chemistry in-series with the threstals and such. No problem, I hope you like it and I think that well known time traveling fic, Wastelands of Time is Harry/Fleur as well.

** I tend to read more romance fanfiction than romance fiction. I think it's because I prefer to fully know a character before I start shipping them with anyone. I don't like jumping into stories where you have to describe a character AND describe a romance at the same time. My mother likes to read trashy romance novels, and she thinks I'm very sophisticated for reading non-romantic books. Little does she know, I get my fix elsewhere...

I prefer strictly canon pairings (or pairings that could be canon if you spin a good story), but I will read otherwise in extreme AU's and crossovers. I will not read a pairing with an adult character and a non-consenting minor, but if you wait till they are of age/do some funky time-traveling...that's cool. It's my own morals -> I work with children. It makes me mad to see it glorified.

My favorite pairings: Harry/Ginny, Lily/James, Remus/Sirius, Rose/Scorpius

Funny enough, however, I think my favorite stories are always the ones that have romance as a side-plot or none at all. Usually, these are stories that expand upon canon, or they are about characters who don't show up often in the main series. For example, the Alexandra Quick series and Against the Moon are two of my favorite fanfictions...and neither of them have romance as the main plot.

** I dislike a few ships. I absolutely wont read Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco. Or Harry/Snape Hermione/Snape or any other child/adult pairing for that matter.

I also dislike Ron/Hermione quite strongly. I think its the worst thing JK did with cannon and I prefer fics that /fix/ this oversight on her part.

All that said. I don't care if Harry is with anyone else, or Hermione, or Ron or Ginny or whoever.

Mostly it is about my ability to enjoy a story being hampered by a ship, rather than a ship enhancing a story.

Most snamione stories I read have Hermione as 18+ when the relationship begins which makes it weird how people refer to her as a child when criticizing pairings. those that don't at least have her above 16 which still is above the age of consent in most western countries, even a lot of the states.

***** No, I don't care if both characters are above the age of consent (18 where I live), and thus both adults. But I do come across lots of fics where they aren't, and not only do I not enjoy them, it exposes me to extreme legal liability that I don't want. I do care if one character is a teacher, and thus in a position of authority over the other, but that's just personal taste from personal life-experience, and I wouldn't call for restricting that.

Especially Harry/Snape fics tend to make Harry 14 or 15, and a good number of Snape/Hermione fics do this too (perhaps half-and-half).

And you know this because you read both Harry/Snape and Snape/Hermione so you have seen this in fics you've read or are you just stating what you think based on no prior experience reading those stories?

I read Snape/Hermione (but not Snape/Harry so I can not speak for them) and I've never read a fic where she has been 15 or younger in a relationship with Snape. Most fics I read (and I read a lot of Hogwarts Era fics), she is 17, 18 or even 19 (if it's an 8th year fic). A good portion of Snape/Hermione fics happen after Hogwarts as well so the age stuff there is a non-issue.

Though when I started reading fics, 9 years ago, it didn't. And a little over 3 thousand fics seems about right, if you keep in mind by "read" I mean read a fic until I find one of the pairings I object to above and stop. That brings it down to maybe 2500 that I read all the way through, or less. And...a bit under a fic a day sounds about right for what I do. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but...around there.

** Not to nitpick, but your post makes it seem like you do care at least a bit about shipping with the whole "any other *female* character in the universe." I mean, slash is shipping; it's not an extreme form or anything, it's just shipping.

My two cents though are that I don't mind shipping as long as the fic is well written... given the chance though I will definitely take a Harry/Draco fic over a just-as-well-written Harry/anyone-else fic.

I wish there was a better way to define ships. I have a lot of ships where I don't need - or prefer it without - actual romance. Draco/Luna for example. I just think stories about their interaction and/or friendship would be interesting.

I'm not usually a fan of Harry/Draco or Draco/Hermoine simply because it often involves Draco as a classy bad boy, and that's simultaneosly boring and not very true to Draco's character. I find him much more interesting when he's his whiny canon self with questionable morals but a strong loyalty to his family.

I certainly have ideas of who I would have paired up in canon (Harry/Luna, Viktor/Hermione), but part of the fun of fanon is exploring the outlandish pairings and seeing them work, in my opinion.

You know what I mean. Those stories when after 50k words of bed gymnastics the reader is reminded that there once, in a land far far away, has been a story to follow.

Also there are some ships that (most of the time, there are always exceptions to the rule) are creeping me the fuck out. Hermione / Snape (/Sirius, /Remus,...) is such a case. Most of the time they feel just so fundamentally wrong to read, its disgusting.
