I've seen lots of authors say that Luna's mother was a Malfoy one Pandora Lovegood and yes that is her cannon name except there was one particular family known for both madness which the Lovegoods hold in spades as when as naming children after different stars and other celestial bodies. Sirius, Narrcissa, Orion why not pandora? Is it possible that luna is a black?

It's funny you specifically mention Narcissa, one of the few members of the Black family who isn't named after a celestial object.

Your theory certainly is not impossible, but there's no backing for it. It's just as likely that Pandora Lovegood was a Black as it is that she was a Malfoy, a Potter, or a Dumbledore (Aberforth's secret love child!)

*** Also, fun little fact, Bellatrix is also a poisonous flower. So it's not hard to believe that she was named after something else

**** Naw.

Bella/donna/ is a poisonous flower. Bella/trix/ is part of orion (a star).

***** It's actually both. Seattle gave the corpse flower the name of Bellatrix, and on a website, it's listed as a flower of the genus gentians called Gentiana Bellatrix

****** Something-something cultivar name. Dave's Garden has it as gentiana sino-ornata "Bellatrix" - meaning that it probably came into existence after the character. It's also not toxic as far as I can see.

But: fair enough. TIL.

** Although she was a Black, Narcissa seemed to fit in more with the Malfoy naming theme more?

All the other known Blacks were named after celestial objects (except Walburga?), so I'm not sure she'd be a Black.

Heck, she could be related to Umbridge, for all we know, but that doesn't fit a naming theme either?

What pureblood families have Greece/Roman names? There's Daphne (Greek nymph who escaped Apollo's attentions by becoming a tree), Astoria means "like a hawk", so I think maybe Roman in origin (as Michael is Christian and Susan, Hebrew), so they are a possibility.

The Malfoys too, but they seem more French?

Then again, it always seems to be the more 'darker' purebloods that stick to esoteric names: other purebloods like the Potters, Bones, Longbottoms, etcetera have names you'd see more in modern society, with little-to-no emphasis on their names' background and origins (Susan, Neville, Harry, Cedric, et cetera).

** I think the Malfoy thing is just because the Lovegoods are also blonde, and often an excuse to have some redeeming aspect to Draco's character.
