** linkao3(4308786) is one of my favourite oneshots.

The author is writing a lot of those. I guess it comes down to whether you enjoy his somewhat unique writing style.

**** IIRC he never bothered with specific descriptions, it's simply the beginning of the chapter. No clue if that's intentional or if Ao3 just grabs it directly when no description is given by the author.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

** I'm new here so I have no idea how all these shortcut things work. There's this very, very well-written fanfic like this. It has a few cliches, but they're done well. It's long, and it's still in progress. I do not like WIPs. This one, I like. A lot. Some fluff, lots of paternal moments, and quite a bit of perspective into Dumbledore's life.

** I'm sure there's a whole huge fanfiction around this topic (and a sequel). Haven't really read it though:

  Following Voldemort's downfall attempting to kill Harry, the Hogwarts professors appeal to the Ministry of Magic to allow the young boy to live and grow up at Hogwarts, away from the world's dangers. He grows up unlike any other child in the Wizarding world, meeting years of students before he is allowed a wand. Now, he will meet his fellow classmates to finally learn magic.
