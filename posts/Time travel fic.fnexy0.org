:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember much about this fic but I remember Harry travels back in time to his younger body. I think it might be dimension travel because I vaguely remember his parents being alive but I might just be meshing two stories together there.

One distinctive thing I remember is that Harry hires Remus as basically a secretary but Remus doesn't know it's him, he pretends to be older(polyjuice I think?) and he also owned like half of the stores in diagonal alley. I also remember one scene where he uses a time turner and polyjuice to be his own guardian at the doctors.

I have been trying to find this for a long time so help would be appreciated.

** I just read this one... Molly's brother is alive in it, right? And Harry is part of some secret society, and working with the Goblins... yeah, I've got no idea what it's called, it was good though.

*** This wasn't the one I was looking for but thanks for the recommendation. I just finished binge reading it.

It's similar though, both stories have Harry pretending to be older to run a business and switching back and forth between two identities.
