** Professor Barten from Timely Errors linkffn(4198643)

Ex-auror, he first becomes interested in Harry due to Harry's disturbingly accurate knowledge of the Unforgiveables. He teaches a well placed punch can just as effective as a curse. And during a Hogsmeade attack, engages Voldemort and isn't immediately slaughtered.

Harry of course intially distrust him because he's a DADA Professor.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

*** Started reading this and good grief the Ron bashing is blatant and you can tell in the first chapter that the author is setting up Harry and Hermione.

EDIT: Just realized that I replied to the wrong person. My bad. Downvote as needed. I meant this as a reply to the Amalgum recommendation.

**** How are you getting upvoted for this blatant lie? Ron got sent to the Dark Ages and complained about it, and Hermione scolds him barely because he doesn't appreciate how amazing the history was? There's no setting up Harry/Hermione, because Harry is in the past for all but like 3 chapters. What are you on about?

**** Hi, Amalgum rec-person here. :)

You're absolutely right, and the bashing of Ron gets so strong in later chapters you can practically taste it coming off the screen like you've filled your kitchen with aerated paprika. But I honestly think it's in character. Not for Ron, but for Lockhart. I always read him as hella creepy, so I think the Ron-bashing and Harry-Hermione matchmaking firstly augments that creepy to all new levels and secondly twists it into a more Harry-esque form. It's ridiculous, but it's very Lockhart ridiculousness.

*** I love lockhardt as a main character but did the author have to be so hateful to Ron? Honestly, I gave up after reading "not that he could cast it anyway" the only addition that gives the story is spite. If your going that route just don't have Ron exist as a character

**** I mean, personally, I think it's in character for a Harry who dislikes or is mildly irritated by Ron to have that dislike totally violated and changed into spite after blending with someone like Gilderoy Lockhart. You are right though, it doesn't actually add anything to the story. He does give up on it though, towards the end of the second act. Actually makes that Ron a little 'redeemed' too. Though that redemption comes alongside Draco's, so that might irritate you too.
