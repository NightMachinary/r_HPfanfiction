  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.
