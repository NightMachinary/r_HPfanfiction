I don't know why, but I'm nervous to start reading fanfiction. I want to read all these different stories but I'm scared to... change the experience I have when I go back to reading the books? I'm not sure. Have any of you felt that before? Am I just being ridiculous and I should jump into fanfiction?


** It has changed the way I read the books, but I think they way I read the books was changing anyway. Reading them as an 11 year old and on through all the releases was different that re-reading them now as a 22 year old. The way I see it, my experiences on reading the books was going to alter as I grew up anyway.

By allowing myself to read a veritable world of backstories and more intensely themed stories, I'm "controlling" that change and feeding my love for Harry Potter. I usually read fan-fiction and the books themselves at the same time. I often take my hard copies of the books on the bus to work, and my relaxation time after work is coming home to a new fan-fiction. Why can't we have both? (:

Sometimes I read a fanfic that is /so good/, I feel like I'm cheating on the original seven books... but without JKR's original works, none of this wonderful fanfic-world would be here. So I try not to think of it as cheating, because each author is just lucky JKR lets other people play in her sandbox .

Take some time to get to know side characters - this is one of my favorite things about fanfics. In my top 3 stories is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A_Difference_in_the_Family_The_Snape_Chronicles][The Snape Chronicles]], which I recommend in here probably way more than is necessary. This is the best fiction about Snape that I have ever read. The author goes to great lengths (in my opinion) to keep things as close to JKR canon as possible. Start out with a canon compliant fic, and see if that's your cup of tea. Or, if you feel like that is too close to the books you already love, go completely AU (alternate universe) - AU is a great way for you to experience more stories about the characters you love without being too uncomfortably close to the books. Another great thing about fanfics is their ability to completely ignore that epilogue. Pick your favorite characters, and I guarantee someone has written them in love at least once. Don't be scared off by the weird pairings off the bat, though... There are some stories I just won't read! haha

Ok, phew. I just wrote a novel. Sorry for dumping all that and rambling. But I've felt something at least similar to what you're feeling, and this is how I've sorted it out.

TL;DR - Think of fan-fiction as a way for embellishment on the world we already love. Start with well-written stories that embellish on canon (like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A_Difference_in_the_Family_The_Snape_Chronicles][The Snape Chronicles]]), and go from there. (:

*** I can't thank you enough for this response... Good to know I'm not the only one feeling this way about it! I'm going to take your advice and start with canon before branching out slowly... Snape Chronicles here I come!

**** Quite welcome, I'm glad my midnight ramblings made sense.

And do let me know if you enjoy TSC. (: It's a rather long one, but well well worth the read. It has one of my favorite fic portrayals of Dumbledore and Hagrid as well!

** Nah, don't worry about it. As long as you don't fall into the trap that makes 60% of fanfic writers think all characters are secretly gay, you'll be fine.

** Just jump in, buddy. But don't go into anything with romance to soon. +A lot+ Some of those will read like hardcore porn that should have never happened. Other than that a lot of it is pretty cool. Try "Twist of Fate" by FirePheonix8 on FanFiction.com

** I must recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledores_Army_and_the_Year_of_Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and The Year of Darkness]] on fanfiction.net. It takes place during Deathly Hallows while Ron, Harry and Hermione are away from Hogwarts. When I read it, I really felt like it could have really taken place, and I have always wanted to know what happened at Hogwarts while they trio was away.

I think this would be a great step into fan fiction because it is very close to canon and is really well written.

*** I'm halfway through this, and can attest to how awesome it is. I only started reading fanfic 2 years or so ago, but this is by far my favorite, even though I haven't finished it yet.

**** Yeah, this is definitely a good one to start with. Stick with canon stories to begin with and you'll have less to complain about.

I would also highly recommend stories centering on the Marauders - my absolute favorite fanfic of all time is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2598097/1/][Moments of Bliss]] by moonymaniac on Fanfiction.net. It centers on Remus, so if you're a fan of his, it's perfect. Personally, of all the fics I've read (which is a lot), this one captures the personality of the canon characters the best. I really can believe that this is how the Marauders would have acted as teenagers - please read it!! :)

** Reading fanfics won't change the experience although it is a shame you waited so long to start. I started reading them after book 5 I think and they really opened my eyes to minor characters and potential plot directions. Now I don't read nearly as many, but they are still fun and I would recommend just jumping in (find a high review story featuring your favorite character or one you would like to learn about).

** Hey there! I felt the same way when I first fell in love with the HP series...like I was afraid to let anything tarnish the experience! Then my best friend introduced me to a few stories and I fell in love!

It looks like you've already got a lot of suggestions for cannon-compliant fics, so I'll give you a few that are AU (alternative universe.) My personal favorite is A Year Like None Other by aspeninthesunlight. It shows a completely different side of Snape, and I loved seeing his character be developed in a whole new way. It's an eventual Snape-adopts-Harry fic, which is KNOW sounds crazy, but it actually works really well and is super cute in the end. Lots of violence in parts, though, just so you know.

I've got a million other fics to suggest as well if you want. Just comment back and let me know who your favorite characters are, and I'll see what I can come up with!

I also run a Harry Potter fan fiction blog, called The Magic Word, with my best friend, and you could wander by if you want more suggestions right away. You can find us at hogsmeadebooks.wordpress.com.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you want more recs! Always happy to help keep the fandom alive and strong! :)
