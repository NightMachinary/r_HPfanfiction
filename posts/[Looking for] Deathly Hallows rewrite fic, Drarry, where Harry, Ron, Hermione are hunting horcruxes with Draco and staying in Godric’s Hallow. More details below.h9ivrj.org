:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The general vibe is horcrux hunting and destruction, with an overall feeling of "this is the summer my annoying roommates and I try to save the world!" No ships in the fic are established, and the focus is really on saving the world with an unlikely friendship.

Finer details: Hermione uses the Internet to help solve one of the horcrux destructions, Ron is really into Mars bars, they befriend Moaning Myrtle in their search, and there's a candelabra horcrux that, I think Hermione, needed to hold while its candles burned down to kill the horcrux inside. To my knowledge, this fic was only on FF.net.

edit: I've been doing some digging myself but it is not, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3337693/1/No-Turning-Back][No Turning Back]], though there are some similarities. I also remembered another detail: one of the horcruxes is made of human skin

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
