I'd like anything with Harry and Narcissa that has them getting together. Bonus points if it has Draco acting disgusted by their relationship. No angst please. I hate angst unless it's resolved quickly. Edit: no infidelity please.


** Draco: Wait until my father hears about this.

Harry: I am your father.

Draco: Nooooo!

  Harry agrees to do a favour for Draco Malfoy - with delightful results for Draco's mother. Guilty pleasure Harrissa in two acts.

** linkffn(10990939) Why are you in my house? - it's probably the longest Harry/Narcissa fic. Post Hogwarts and book compliant, too a degree. It's decent and fairly written.

There are some on AO3, just look for Harry/Narcissa, there are quite a few but they are shorter and most are just smut.

  Harry and Narcissa romance, several years after the battle for Hogwarts, Harry's marriage to Ginny is on the rocks, a chance meeting in Grimmauld place changes everything. This is my first ever fan fic, I hope people like my effort, all comments, suggestions and story ideas welcomed currently updating all chapters (hopefully making it better)

** On FFnet you can just filter by character: Narcissa and rating: M, there are a good few of these types of fics I'd guess. There's probably smut fics with everyone in HP by now.
