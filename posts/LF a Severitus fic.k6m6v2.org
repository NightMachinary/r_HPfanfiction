:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I remember is that Harry was cought by Voldemort at some point and they were torturing him (and maybe wanted to burn him for some ritual?), and Snape had to participate in this even though he didnt want to.

Harry was rescued somehow and then he was blind and had episodes of strong accidental magic that nearly destroyed the hospital wing in Hogwarts and the only one that could calm him was Snape. And nobody understood how and why.

Thats all I remember. Thank you already in advance!

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

*** Oh is it really that one?\\
I was hoping not because I just cant read/ finish that fic... It is so sad and everything just seems like it gets worse and worse with no light at the end of the tunnel :/\\
But that would explain, why I dont remember how the story ended..

Thank you anyways! I might be emotionally strong enough to read it some day, but that would not be today..

**** I think so. It does have the blinding then Snape rescuing Harry and destroying the hospital wing with accidental magic. The story is pretty dark but it does get happier.

** Is that the one where Harry was tortured and blinded by Lucius Malfoy using needles? When he tries to use a wand, casting /lumos/ was like using a laser beam that burns through everything, so he eventually uses wandless magic so /lumos/ makes his hand glow instead. If yes, I'm also looking for that fic!

**** Thank you! I believe this was a work-in-progress at the time I started it, so I never got very far and thought I'd go back when it was done. It's taken years to remember it!
