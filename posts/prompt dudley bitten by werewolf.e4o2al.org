today i had the weirdest idea whirling in my head:

a couple days after the Dementors incident Vernon and Petunia decide to send Dudley in a summer camp near a forest, (maybe they had it planned already, maybe it was a spur of the moment idea) to change environment, calm him down or something in a place that won't be associated with the trauma or harry..?

but while Dudley is there one night is the full moon and the boy for whichever reason maybe plot relevant maybe not,

(example: a dare to demonstrate he is not a wimp -something the other teens think because he's been distracted and reserved in his first days at the camp or something) is not in his dorm but wandering in the forest nearby and gets bitten by a werewolf (here too, it might be for plot reasons, i don't know, greyback has kept an eye on harry's family to attack and show harry and his relatives are not so safe, or it was just a werewolf and a muggle boy in the wrong place at the wrong time i dunno), he miraculously survives the experience but either Petunia has contacted Dumbledore to ensure Dudley's survival because she notices something strange in his injuries, that are definitely not normal and not responding to muggle medicine, or maybe some of the wards are set off by her son newly acquired status as a werewolf (that he still doesn't acknowledge he just believes to have been mauled by a particularly vicious wolf) and Hogwarts headmaster is definitely informed and next thing he does he introduces Dudley to the Order and to Grimmauld Place to ensure the boy is safe (and of course he ensures a well protected room is arranged where the new lycanthrope can transform and not be a danger to everyone else)

And i don't know, Dudley is basically presented the wizarding world but not in the idyllic light Harry was introduced on his birthday, after three bad experiences with it and in a situation that is decidedly grim both for the obstacles it will present to his life and because Voldemort is back but the ministry won't ackowledge and yadda yadda all that we already know.

​

TL;DR

Dudley Dursley is bitten by a werewolf few days after the dementors attack in little whinging and is forcefully transferred to the Order of the Phoenix Headwuarter for security reasons.

​

i don't know, anyone interested in this insane idea?


** Dudley Dursley and The New Normal: Dudley gets bitten and has to adjust to living as a werewolf. Post-Battle of Hogwarts, but should otherwise fit:

It's complete, and not on FFNet any more, but these links should work.

*** Thank you for the answer. I don't know if it is because yesterday i disabled cookies on my phone after having spent 30 minutes trying to opt out of the vendors on one site (i loathe that you cannot just opt out everything with a tap/click but most of the time they redirect you to as many other sites as the vendors are, with long boring disclaimers and hidden, or at times NON EXISTING, links to finally opt out) or is because the page was canceled but i cannot seem able to retrieve this story, and I'm a bit sad.

I mean i still kinda hope someone as weird and crazy as me gets inspired by this prompt and ends up writing it but not everyone would read a Dudley centric fanfic i realize so these alternatives you and the other person have posted are well accepted, thank you for the trouble of looking for all the parts

**** Thank you for your time looking for that story. I haven't had time yet to check it and from the summary it seems the focus is a bit different but I'm open to alternatives.
