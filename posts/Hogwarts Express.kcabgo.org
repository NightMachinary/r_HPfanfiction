How come the students get tickets for the train but no one ever comes by to check them? The only adult that ever comes by is the trolley lady. Why do they give the children tickets? Does it serve a purpose or was it just a plot point so that Harry would see that he had to go to Platform 9 and 3/4? I'd like to think that a conductor comes and punches their tickets, but so far, I've seen no evidence of that.


** I am shocked, /shocked/, that JKR engaged in sloppy worldbuilding!

Yes, it was a plot device to set up the platform mixup. IIRC, tickets were never mentioned again in canon.

** When I lived in England and was poor (in the late 90s, early 2000s) I constantly rode the train without paying. Yes, you were technically required to have a ticket, but between some stops, I knew the chance of running into a ticket inspector was nil. So like the petty criminal I was, I planned out all my train journeys as shot hops, getting on and off at rural stops that were usually unmanned, especially after hours. 95% of the time, nobody checked the tickets. On the off chance they did, I pretended to be either drunk (depending on the hour) or a very guilty stupid young adult who was late for work/an appointment who KNEW she should have a ticket, but who barely had time to jump on the train, let alone wait in the queue for the ticket machine. (Being able to manufacture tears on command helped).

I have no idea if you'd still be able to get away with this today but at the time, it was eminently feasible.

Anyway, the point of this story is that /instead/ of sloppy world-building on JKR's part, I'm choosing to head canon it as a cash-strapped Harry realizing ticket enforcement was lax and saving his money.

*** I had to take a train to get to high school

ticket inspectors where quite common one kicked me off a few stops early due to my ticket expiring in the morning and I had to walk an hour to get home.

meanwhile I had caught bussess for years and never had a single ticket inspected Until a few months ago when I had two on the same day

** Because children know that to ride the train you need a ticket. That is all.

** At this point I'd think just about anyone who manages to get through the barrier could potentially stowaway on the train. Sheesh, even the polar express has tighter security

*** I'd read that fic. Perhaps one of Dudley's kids does it on a dare from James. They make it all the way to Hogsmeade at least.

  It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.

  When the ticket inspector signaled to him, Ron, and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not expected at all.
#+end_quote

From those quotes, we can deduce that the tickets probably are checked, but it happens when the students arrive on the platform, not on the train. I'm guessing that it was just too small of a detail to bother mentioning. Or maybe the tickets are magically scanned or something.
