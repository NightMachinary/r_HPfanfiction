It's Little0Bird's The First Day over at FF.net. I've not finished it, but the writing is just as canon as Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.

** OP in case you haven't read them yet you will likely also like Northumbrian's stuff on ff.net or Shut and Be a Bud Again (unfinished) on siye.

*** I'm not nearly self-educated to give your questions the answers they themselves need. However, I will be able to come back to this posting and give your a more thought out response. Your post does give me some excellent questions to ask myself when recommending other things now.

** I don't like her characterization of Ginny, but that story overall is super good. I love the moment when Harry just breaks down in front of Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.

*** I agree wholeheartedly on the scene with Molly and Arthur. However, I found Ginny to be quite agreeable. I've read a few fanfictions with her portrayed more as sex-starved. And of course, Arthur's classic quote, "Think with your heads, not with your willies."

**** Haha, she's just too passive for my taste. I've read some of the subsequent stories, and she really doesn't stand her ground with Harry. There's one where she totally needed to fuss at him, and she just kind of gives him the cold shoulder instead until tension resolves. Also, she's a little too innocent (see the story where she gets on the Quidditch team). Note, this is just me being picky. It's literally my only complaint. I love the story dearly. I agree with you, though...some stories make her more of a sex-icon and it's uncomfortable. However, I like a Ginny with more guts and personality.

You're going to love the stories with the kids, though. I hope you keep reading :)

***** I will continue on reading. And I always want that Molly Weasley firecracker written with Ginny's character. Thanks!

** If it's a fanfic, isn't it automatically not canon?

*** Canon /compatible/ is the usual claim, as opposed to single point of departure or alternative universe.

**** Being quite new to the world of fandom, I'm grateful for your explanation on how the two differ. I'll be sure to use it in the correct sense hereafter.
