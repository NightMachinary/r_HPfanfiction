A lot of the ones I've been reading have him living in a big manor which is good but I really like the idea of Snape living a relatively modest life in a Victorian terrace house with not a bucket load of money.

Any ideas?


** Well, there's the Resonance trilogy, but that's already pretty much the best known severitus story... they do just live at Spinners End iirc.

*** Can I possibly get a link? I keep seeing the trilogy come up but when I search I end up finding fics for other fandoms for whatever reason.

*** Funnily enough I don't think I've ever read that (that I remember) - can you link it as I'm getting a lot of random bits up?

** [[https://terri-testing.livejournal.com/tag/too%20much%20there][Too Much There]] by terri-testing has Spinner's end as an element, which continues into her (abandoned) [[https://terri-testing.livejournal.com/tag/unlikely%20allies][Unlikely Allies]] AU.

linkao3(Far Beyond a Promise Kept by oliversnape) is recced a lot, but it does have this.

#+begin_quote
  Snape never wanted anyone to know of his promise to Dumbledore, but has realised that he can protect Potter much better by taking a less passive role in the boy's training. Actually liking Harry Potter has never been part of his plan. mentor/guardian.
