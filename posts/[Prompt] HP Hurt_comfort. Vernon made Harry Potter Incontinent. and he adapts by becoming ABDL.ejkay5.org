*** ABDL, for a Person that will forever be confined to well, Diapers is a positive. some people genuinely Cope with HAVING to wear them (for bedwetting, or medical reasons) by finding reasons to Enjoy them.

for males, they sure feel nice. granted, I'm a bedwetter.

*** Bedwetting is Pedophilic? being Abused and Raped is Pedophilic? this is WAY more of dealing with trauma. and apart from the Sexual ABUSE, is NOT a story thats really anymore the T.

to put it BLUNTLY, YOU are the gross 1. because of the simple fact that you would ABUSE a kid/Adult that has ZERO choice but to adapt to having to wear diapers for their own health needs. grow up!
