I'm fine with any trope or pairing as long as the fics good except for no self inserts or having the main character be an original character


** Harry Potter, Squatter is pretty good! I haven't read the last 5 chapters yet, but I really enjoy it! Granted, my knowledge of the Percy Jackson world is compromised solely from the movie (I am aware it is not very accurate), and other crossover fics so I can't judge the characters on that end. However I think the author does pretty well with the HP characterization.

*** Squatter is good, but I can't really get over the fact that Harry's still less than 11 years old. Like, I know young heroes doing crazy things are a staple of the genre, but it seems weirdly egregious in this case.

*** I was never able to finish this because the characters led Harry to believe that he was abnormal for not wanting to have sex at age 10. This is obviously very incorrect and made me quite uncomfortable.

** Linkffn(Percy Jackson and the world of magic)

Some smutty scenes, but I loved the story concept as a whole and still comes back for periodic rereads. Also recommend the author's other works too.

** linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d) is bad, but popular.

linkffn(Dies Irae by MufuMufuSan) is my favorite.

linkffn(Carpe Diem by seagate) is a surprisingly decent WBWL fic, but it's looking pretty abandoned.

linkffn(Serpents and Celestial Bronze by Levity Lirum) is also pretty abandoned, and barely had any connection to HP canon before then, but it's decently enjoyable.

  A person's destiny is never set in stone, Harry now knows that better than anyone. After all, his destiny has been completely turned on its head by the actions of both his mother and a capricious goddess. Whether this is for good or bad is yet to be seen, either way Harry's life has been set on a new course, and he for one could not be happier about it.

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.
