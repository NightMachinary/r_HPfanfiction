Don't get me wrong, I have always liked a good time travel story. I do however wonder: are there any good AU fics in which timeturners don't exist? (And in which, preferably, Sirius is still saved) Timeturners just seem to create so many paradoxes and unlikely things. Could Rowling have done it without?


** Rowling went back and kind-of-but-not-really fixed them in Pottermore by saying they have a 5 hour limit and you can really fuck things up if you mess with the wrong events. Also they were all destroyed in book 5.

But it's used well in PoA, so I doubt people have tried writing the entire book without it. Some multi-year fics don't need to use the time-turner because they already saved Sirius through other means, but I don't think that's what you're looking for.

No way, Jose! Good to know. Too often the "extras" slip through the cracks.

*** A 5 hour limit? Maybe only the British ones do. Somebody has to have developed a few Time Turners that are more powerful.

** Such fics usually center on Hermione, since she's the one who acquires the Time-Turner (or doesn't). Here are some examples off the top of my head:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][/Applied Cultural Anthropology, or/ by jacobk]]: ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead. *Why no Time-Turner?* Snape can't/won't pull the same strings for Hermione as McGonagall might have, and she doesn't take All The Classes, either.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/][/The Arithmancer/ by White Squirrel]]: Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. *Why no Time-Turner?* Professor Vector --- who is Hermione's mentor in this continuity --- advises her against taking All The Classes and to focus on Arithmancy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/][/Harry Potter Without Harry Potter/ by Nim-the-Lesser]]: "Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)" *Why no Time-Turner?* Hermione gets pulled out of Hogwarts after the Troll Incident, but manages to trick her way into Durmstrang.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by DianeCastle]]: In Alex Mack's universe -- a universe without magic -- there is also a Hermione Granger. A teen Hermione who has her own Ron and Harry. A Hermione who will have to deal with their very own He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named... *Why no Time-Turner?* It takes place in a heavy AU where Bond-style superscience takes place of magic, and "Harworts" is a school for training the next generation of the United Kingdom's tumultuous "Intelligence Community". Time travel is, as far as we know, impossible.
