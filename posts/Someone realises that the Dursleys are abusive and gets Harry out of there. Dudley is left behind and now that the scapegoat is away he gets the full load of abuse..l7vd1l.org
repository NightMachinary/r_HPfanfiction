Inspired by my increasing annoyance at the fact that people seem to think it's totally okay to just leave Dudley behind. Because of course it's totally not bad for children to watch as their parents abuse another child and as we see in the books Dudley grew up completely healthy and without any problems himself.


** Or what if Harry is a figment of Dudley's imagination to cope with the abuse he suffers at the hands of his parents? Harry never existed but it was a hell of a lot easier to imagine a little boy who got the brunt of I'm his parents' abuse whilst he got to be pampered.

*** Yo wouldn't that be crazy! Like the S6 episode of Buffy the vampire slayer “Normal Again”.

Harry doesn't exist and the Dursley's are just horrible parents. Vernon periodically is extremely physically abusive but they always apologize and pamper Dudley afterwards. Dudley very early in life like around 3-4 develops DID (aka multiple personalities) and Harry is the part that takes the abuse and being locked in the cupboard (whether for protection by Petunia or not is up to the author). This is kinda trippy because it could really work (prior to hogwarts of course) I would guess that hogwarts would be whatever “Harry” gets up to while Dudley is at boarding school when not needed. Or he goes into a psychiatric facility at age 11 when his dad tried to take him to an uninhabited island and leave him.

*** Dudley remembered from a young age his parents talking about his freak Aunt Lily, her freak husband, and their freak son Harry.

One day in elementary school, his teacher sends him to a time out and he gets angry. His teacher falls over backwards and when she gets up, her hair is standing straight up and is colored electric blue.

His mother yells at him when he gets home that he's a freak just like his good for nothing cousin and he must stop it immediately. He is given chores, which he has never had before, and gets his first spanking from his father.

More odd things happen around Dudley and his extra chores and spankings turn into abuse. Every time he is told that he is just like his freak cousin Harry. One day he just comes to the conclusion his cousin Harry must be doing all these strange things. So creates a game with his friends called 'Harry hunting' where they run around the neighborhood trying to find a kid with messy hair and beat him up. A few kids get beaten up at random as a result. Dudley always finds Harry on his way home and locks him in the cupboard under the stairs to keep him out of trouble.

This goes on for years with 'Harry' continuing to do strange things around Dudley and continues to get the blame for it, his hatred for Harry growing. Then one day he gets a letter in the mail with a wax seal on the back, addressed in green ink to:

Dudley Dursley The Larger Child's Bedroom Privet Drive #4 Surrey, England

He is just about to open it when it gets snatched away by his mother who burns it immediately and screams at him, his father punches him in the gut and throws him in the cupboard under the stairs. When he opens his eyes, he sees 'Harry' staring back at him. The two stared at each other all night.

The next morning the doorbell rings and he hears his mother open the door and scream, then slam it closed. The cupboard door is opened and his mother tells him to go up to his room and shut the door. He leaves 'Harry' sitting in the cupboard and runs upstairs. The doorbell rings again and he hears his mother yelling at someone and the conversation moves into the living room. There are two women guests, one of them sounds Scottish. After a lot of yelling, his mother yells 'Dudley, come down here!'

When he arrives in the living room, there is an older, tall, stern looking woman with small spectacles. She reminds him of the mother superior from the church he went to as a kid. The other woman is a little younger than his mother with flaming red hair and bright green eyes. She feels familiar, but he's not sure why.

The red haired woman speaks first. 'Dudley, you don't know me, but I am your Aunt Lily. Do you know who I am?'

Dudley stares, and then looks at his mother's angry expression to which he looks back at his Aunt with the same expression and says, 'yes, you're a freak!'

Both women gasp while his mothers expression softens and even has a small smile. His aunt looks a little sad. The older witch...

I'll finish this later, it's starting to spiral.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** Unfortunately, I don't think this would be realistic in Harry and Dudley's case: the reasons why they have an abusive persuasion towards Harry is because a) Harry is magical and b) Petunia's awkwardly repressed love/hate relationship with her (deceased) sister.

I fully expect that if Harry did vanish or were removed, they'd only care about what the neighbors would think, Petunia would feel inwardly conflicted but outwardly happy, and Dudley would probably find other kids to try to bully -- he'd still be a spoiled tub of shit, though.

Unless Dudley suddenly shows himself to be magical (doubtful), which they may hypocritically overlook (but I doubt it), Dudley ain't ever going to be abused in some way -- er, unless their spoiling and sheltering him is abuse, in some way.

*** Well yeah there is a chance they wouldn't actually full on turn on him and he anyway wouldn't fully become the „new Harry“. But there is a good possibility that with Harry gone, who was always blamed for every of Dudley's failings, they would continue to cuddle him when he does something perceived as good but would flip their shit when he does something perceived as wrong. (Edit: meaning probably something they are afraid the neighbours would talk about and without Harry there their perceived frame of what the neighbours /could/ talk about probably gets more and more small). It also would not just happen from one day to another but over a longer period of time and slowly getting worse. Because no matter how much people try to say that the Dursley's fear of Harry's magic is the reason they treated him the way they did, no one can tell me that they would have treated him any better, had he been a squib or even in a Muggle AU where idk Lily just went away to some school for gifted children or something. At the end of the day the abuse had nothing to do with magic and everything to do with Petunia being a jealous and spiteful person and Vernon being some sanctimonious asshole with anger issues.

But no matter that, the point is that their treatment of Dudley isn't healthy at all on it's own and it's in absolutely no way right to leave him behind with people who have shown themselves to be more than capable of abuse and not even at least inform any muggle authorities what was going on with Harry so they can check up on the situation. And realistic or not I really want to see that backfire for once.

*** Yes that it was bad for him too was the point, I was being sarcastic. And it's possible that with Harry gone Dudleys live would go on as it was but that would make a kind of boring prompt as it would mean he has pretty much the same live he has with Harry.
