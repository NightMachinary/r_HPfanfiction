I just saw the request thread for a fic where Harry is conneected somehow with royalty. I thought I'd ask a very simple question... which royalty?

At the time of the SoS adoption, Oliver Cromwell was running roughshod over England. Assuming the wizards are Catholic (and there's no reason to assume otherwise IMO, but I could be wrong), I don't think they'd accept the Protestant rule of William & Mary, which leads me down the rabbit hole of the Jacobite claim to the British throne. I could see wizards saying God Save King Francis II... uless there's a magical child somewhere in the family tree that was scrubbed from our history books. If such a child existed, I could see them inviting him or her to claim the throne of Magical Britain post-SoS, while still recognizing the Muggle Jacobites as the, to them, legitimate rulers of Muggle Britain. If Harry were somehow connected to this... I don't see Dumbledore even having the ability to place him with the Dursleys (assuming ceterus peribus, which I know is a huge assumption).

Just my thoughts on the topic that I think deserves its own discussion thread.


** Why would wizards and witches be catholics if the catholics were going out of their way to burn them at the stake? I'd assume that magical people don't have a religion, because magic seems to provide most of the answers.

*** Catholics mostly burned pagans at the stake for refusing to convert. There really weren't too many witch burnings where people were actually accused of consorting with demons.

****** I mean we had the whole Matthew Hopkins thing. It's always taught in history classes about how he went travelling to different areas, accused people of witchcraft for various different reasons, each pretty unbelievable, and then set some stupid trials to test them. Granted he wasn't Catholic, but he was Christian.

******* Sorry for the late reply, but I wanted others to finish this before I jumped in here.

"Those followers of heretics and schismatics Luther, Calvin, and others are killing people wantonly for something that can't be proven. We in Holy Mother Church allow people to have a defense for their actions, and only kill the unrepentant"

See how easy that can be spinned away?

****** I mean I'm not very knowledgable about IRL witch hunts, but in HP Canon it seemed relatively common back in the day? At least from what i remember from the old JK Rowling website (not Pottermore)

******* Well, Wizards also used to shit themselves in HP Canon, so I'd rather go with tried and true historicity to add depth to a narrative in favour of JKR.

** As people said before, it would need to be AU. In Canon, Muggles and Wizards have 2 separated government the separation during the XVIIe century, also, this separation happened after the king refused to protect the wizards who asked for it.\\
If you were to compare this with an historical (muggle) situation, the wizards revolted for their independances, and if not for their "disparition", their would probably have been a war. It would mean that, with canon situation, a Harry descendant of the royalty would have:

- No claim on Magical Brittain because their are not a monarchy and never been
- Either have no claims of this government because he is either a descendant of a dynastie who came into power after the separation (from what I saw, either Hanovre or Windsor), or he is a descendant of the dynastie who was in power during the separation (Tudor) who "lost" his claim when he left the wizards leave.

​

But even if you create an AU to make Harry a member of the royal family. Why? The only "interest" I can see to make Harry Muggle royalty would be to make him so kind of symbol and so a target for the Death Eater. But he is already the Boy-Who-Lived and 1st place on Voldemort shit list, and doesn't need this to be at risk. Of course it may also be because it's a mugglewank where wizards are subject of the Muggle crown but I don't really like this kind of fic so not able to really discuss about it.

If you really want to make Harry "noble" or "royal", I think it's way easier to link Harry to Arthur Pendragon to maintain the story in the magical world.

** Harry as royalty should be strictly AU.

Even if he is, a few obliviates are more than enough to eradicate his existence among remaining members of the royal family. Assuming no Muggle wanks in which some ancient treaties with the British royalty could nerf the wizards, Harry as royalty has zip implications on how the war against Voldemort would be fought.

I think there are some in the fandom who still think Muggle bloodlines mean something. But my personal take is that Wizards give a fuck about those things.

*** If I'm understading you right, you don't think wizards would accept a magical Stuart on their throne because of Muggle royal blood. I can underatand that theory, but wouldn't they want at least some continuity in government, even if they had to wait a while?

Speaking of, wouldn't changes to the Muggle timeline (even small ones) be AU for HP purposes?

**** After SoS, no.

In canon, British wizards didn't have a magical monarch to begin with. They were running their own government, completely independent of Muggles. Therefore, I absolutely don't see why they should give a damn about Muggle royalties.

In other countries though, where we hardly know anything about due to JKR's world building, there could certainly be magical royalties who were once related to their Muggle counterparts when the SoS went into effect. For example, Magical Russia could still be ruled by a Romanov wizard. Or Magical China could have gone through an even bigger civil war between Pureblood monarchists and Muggleborn republicans.
