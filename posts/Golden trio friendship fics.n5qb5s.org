I just want to see the golden trio being the amazing ultra-close friend group that they are. Preferably longer fics (min 10-15k) with minimal angst (less than canon is ideal, but if it sticks very close to canon that's alright as well, just nothing above canon). Thanks!

P.S. I think a lot of post-Hogwarts fics do a good job of this - golden trio learning and healing together. But them still being at school is perfectly fine as well.


** I don't know if it's what your looking for but if you want just a friendship fic there's this.

  Harry accidently gets good at chess after playing Ron for 6 years. Pity he doesn't even notice.All the chess matches are real and linked in the fic for you to follow along for context since, as it turns out, writing chess is bloody difficult!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
