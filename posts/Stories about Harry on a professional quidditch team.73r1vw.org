Looking for a story with Harry playing professional quidditch! I've read a couple, can't remember what some of them were though, the longer the better! Thanks!


** There's also [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope by Jeconais]] which has a fairly prominent quidditch focus.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2638737/TheEndless7][TheEndless7]] has a few stories featuring pro quidditch. Vitam Paramus and The Quidditch World Cup for sure and I think the others have quidditch elements too, but the two above are the only ones I've read.

also

linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality)

linkffn(The Pride of Gryffindor) <- abandonded

and my personal favorite - although it's not Harry at the helm, this is my favorite incarnation of Ron in the fandom (and I generally don't like reading about him).

  Ron Weasley, an aging quidditch player in the middle of possibly the biggest game of his life, looks back at the places where his life changed for the better and the worse. Book 7 compliant but not epilogue compliant.

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.
