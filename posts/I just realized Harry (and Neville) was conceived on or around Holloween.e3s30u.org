I don't know how I missed it all this time. I haven't even seen it used in any fanfic I've read.

Any fanfics that make use of this in some big or small way?


** My headcanon has Harry be conceived at Halloween, given how much of his life and major events happen around that date.

** Harry being conceived on Halloween is actually highly symbolic. There's an old Judeo-Christian tradition that prophets, and later saints, died on the same day they were conceived. It's one of the reasons why Christmas is in December, because it's nine months after Easter. (See e.g. [[https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/how-december-25-became-christmas/][here]].) So Harry is conceived on Halloween, and then two years later, he also "dies" on Halloween.

Combine this with the fact that there's a lot of saint imagery around Harry. Draco calls him "Saint Potter" in Book 2, and Lucius calls him "Patronus Potter" in Book 5, which means almost the same thing. Not to mention the whole Christ analog thing in Book 7. So having him be born nine months after Halloween just completes the picture.

(Granted, July 31 is also JKR's birthday, so I don't know what she would have done if it wasn't.)

**** Tumblr is permanent - I link all my tumblr ficlets on my blog in chronological masterlists. I have about 300 stories there, and though I do put some on ao3, that would be a huge undertaking to upload them all. A lot of them were written (and still are) during a time of significant emotional stress for me and I didn't want critical feedback, so I just kept them to tumblr where it was less likely to be picked apart.

I'm planning on uploading the Marauder stuff as one story once I have a more cohesive and filled structure. So far I have some major moments for them, but filling it in a little more as I go.

***** OK, just to say that Tumblr is as permanent as long as Automattic wants to keep it around. Just saying (remember Geocities? ‚ÄúYour website for life‚Äù). I would trust AO3 or FFnet more, but that's your business.

******** I'm going to be honest, the nice, gentle encouragement I've been getting on tumblr has been a really big help during a really deeply horrible time for me - it's why I all but vanished from here and the bigger sites. I'm really happy just on there to be honest, having less of a spotlight, and then the pieces I feel particularly proud of I put over onto ao3. But as I said, there are like 300 of them now, so that's a lot of admin.

** *Blindness* by AngelaStarCat mentions it.

In the story, Harry's and Neville's parents were both married on Halloween in a soul bond ceremony, and both boys were apparently conceived that day. And that's coz the soul bond ceremony messes with contraception magic as Harry and Hermione discover after /their/ own marriage.

** Hermione was likely conceived on Christmas (9/19-280 days is 12/14)

Ron's estimate is 5/26... nothing interesting around there.

Ginny's 11/4... could also be halloween

*** Memorial Day (USA) is 5/30. I don't know if the British have something similar.

Maybe it has a connection to his 'strategy' aspect of being good at chess? (I know it is a reach but it is all I could think of.)

** Because Why Not by starspangledmeatball on AO3 makes mention of it and uses the idea that people who have been cursed in the past are especially unlucky during the month of their conception, and a lot of unlucky things happen to Harry in October and Hermione in January. Its a Cedric/Hermione Fic but there is some focus on Harry as well.
