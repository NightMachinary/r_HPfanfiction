:END:
There's this fic I remember I read a long time ago, but I didn't finish. It's a Ron-fic about his childhood. The twins keep bullying him and it's becoming quite severe. It was definitely on FF.net

Notable moments are:

Ron gets away for a while and befriend a pygmy. Not long after, the twins... i don't remember what they do, but they kill it, or at least really hurt it that it dies a slow death and Ron watches.

the twins try to force Ron in an unbreakable vow. Arthur comes in the nick of time.

In the present, Ron is in Auror training and is starting develop an invasive occlumency attack, where he just jumps in people's brains by accident. Ron is very worried because it's getting out of hand.

At dinner at the burrow, Ron and George get into a fight, don't remember anything except one of them (i think Ron) follows the other outside the house as they're walking out of the apparition boundaries to storm out. George explains that Fred and he only did the unbrekable vow to keep Ron safe, because Ron would have to do everything they said, and would be able to keep him out of trouble on all their adventures. Ron thinks that's bullshit. Ron accidentally pulls into George's mind, George gets very angry, and Ron explains that it's been happening recently and he didn't mean to. George gets worried and wants Ron to see a healer.

Somehow it's linked to Voldemort's return? I think it's like a continuation.

idk if im remembering different fics or not.
