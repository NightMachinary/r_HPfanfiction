I had the idea of snape waking up one day in a cupboard andbeing very confused as to why he's so short and then he has to live through Harry's life.

any character is fine Snape is just the one I thought of.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

  When Harry Potter dies trying to save her life, Daphne Greengrass takes his place to prevent the wizarding world from collapsing into a panic at the return of Voldemort and the loss of the boy-who-lived. Can she keep her secret and pretend to be the hero the world needs long enough to find a way to bring the real thing back to life? Or will she eventually stop needing to pretend?
