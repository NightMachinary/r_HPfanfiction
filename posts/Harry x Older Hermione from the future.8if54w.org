preferably some time travel shenanigans but is not needed


** How else, exactly, would Harry get with an older Hermione from the future /without/ having time travel involve in some way?

*** (De)-aging potions has apparently been a thing in some fics. I haven't read many, but there you go.

** I think there was a thread a while back that was looking for a fic with something similar. I don't remember the name but it had plot where present Hermione went back in time to teach Hermione and Harry, she flirted with younger Harry a lot and caused some changes in the present or something. I think there was a scene where she was caught by nude sunbathing by Harry at Hogwarts.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.
