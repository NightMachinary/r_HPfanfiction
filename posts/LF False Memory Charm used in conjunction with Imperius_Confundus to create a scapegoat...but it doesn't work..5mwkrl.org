Confusing?

Well, I was reading a bit of a fic, one of those Lord/Independent/Super/Whatever!Harry ones where Umbridge is exposed during Harry's 5th year trial and she tries to stutter her way out of things, and I got to wondering...

What if when one of these popular bash targets (Umbridge, or Fudge, or someone else) was accused of X evil deed (being behind the dementor attack is always nice), they claimed, yes, they /remembered/ doing it, and that they felt especially euphoric while doing it, before going on to allege that (insert 'Mind Healer' here) had determined that they were under the Imperius Curse while doing the deed and someone had cast a False Memory Charm on them to cover the identity of the caster? And then, for added measure, voiced their suspicions about whoever was doing the pushing to investigate them for the deed?

It could be true (and a complete plot twist), or it could be a brazen lie, but in any case, does anyone know any fics where someone alleges having been Imperiused and their memory tweaked when accused of dirty deeds?


** That 'false memory' magic would be a massive game changer, and a nasty one too. Suddenly, the things you could remember are all suspect. Did they actually happen, or are they false memories? At least with Obliviation, you can't remember the memories that were erased.

*** Hermione just did that to her parents.

Obliviation and false-memory charms were basic spells to maintain the SoS.

**** Yup. Three explicit instances of the false memory charm exist in canon; once when Hermione alters the memories of her parents to make them believe that their names and desires are completely different (wow, how'd a 7th year student pull that off?), and two instances where Voldemort alters the memories of Morfin Gaunt and Hokey to make them believe they had committed the murders he had.

...Career wizarding criminals probably get away with stuff all the time just by putting memories in scapegoats, don't they? No wonder Veritaserum isn't considered useful in court, it only tells you what the drinker believes.
