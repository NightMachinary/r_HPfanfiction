What ideas, main plot points, tropes, etc. would you like to see more of in hp fan fiction?


** A story focusing on the Weasleys in a world where Arthur did die. Molly would be sent on more Order missions; Ron would mature; Ginny would get character development; Fred and George might end up like in On the Way to Greatness; Bill would become the breadwinner; Percy would either come back or the estrangement would be permanent.

***** It's an aspect of the story I've been posting; as a consequence of Harry learning Occlumency from someone able to teach it well, he doesn't stick around in Voldemort's head long enough to see the attack, so Arthur isn't found soon enough to prevent his death. The most recent chapter ended with the Weasleys seeing that Arthur's pointer had fallen off the family clock.

So when I say I'm working on it, I mean that's exactly what the next few chapters are about.

*** What you say above would HEAVILY depend on WHEN Arthur dies. Ron isnt that mature until late (and even then not super mature) and I dont see that changing. Fred and George have their own dreams and like Charlie and Bill, want to get out on their own. Molly is unlikely to want to continue full time with the Order with Arthur dead and dealing with the family. Ginny is a vastly changing character over the course of the series (and depending on timing Arthur's death may affect her relationship with HP). Percy does not share much of the families values.

If Arthur dies early on I can see Bill and Charlie taking a more active roll in the family (and being breadwinners) but that's about the only major change (although Ginny may not end up with HP). If Arthur dies late I can see the family morning as a group but than moving in a vast array of directions rather than coming together.

Just pointing out that the Weasley family is one of the things JK tweaks heavily as the series goes on, so timing is key.

*** It can be explained in a not-too-OOC way, I suppose. Hermione's thirst for knowledge can be skewed as not just for knowledge's sake, more for power and going somewhere in the world. She's very much a perfectionist, which can come off as very ambitious, and while she's loyal it can make her quite mercenary (the contract penalties with Marietta Edgecomb for example).

Ron is slightly harder. He's quintessentially Gryffindor and he isn't especially ambitious or cunning as a key trait. I think any Slytherin!trio would have to drastically alter Ron's personality or circumstances to make a Slytherin sorting make sense - perhaps Percy went to Slytherin first and the home Weasley culture shifted to accept an ambitious Slytherin son, which in turn made Percy less insufferable and Ron has a lesser prejudice against the house than in canon, and encouraged something more self-reflective in a young pre-Hogwarts Ron.

And then that sets the stage for Harry to hear that not all Slytherins are bad, and going with a Slytherin sorting.

** I like slice-of-life fics, especially those featuring Ginny and Luna's friendship. But keeping it platonic. Let some of Luna's Luna-ness rub off on Ginny.

Ideas? It may be nice to see more of Remus as a teacher--not many fics focus on him during Prisoner of Azkaban, but don't have him pine over Sirius. How would he interact with McGonagall or Snape or Hagrid? Imagine his reaction if he overhears students bullying another (who may or may not be Luna)?

Plot points? I'd like to see more Harry-and-Dudley-reconciliation fics. Or where Krum stays behind at Hogwarts and joins the Order of the Phoenix.

Funny scene that I want to see? I'd like to have seen Sirius and Snape get into a fight. A Muggle duel where they pull hair and bite and kick and Sirius mentions that Snape has to get over the ghost of Lily.

Other funny scenes? Zacharias Smith getting beaten up in various ways would be nice.

** setting idea: Potterverse on Mars & Mars terraforming. Basically my idea (and please steal it!) is that to preserve the Statute of Secrecy is getting very hard, so they go settle mars. A single paling lens would hide magical stuff so that from Earth, the planet just looks like a mostly unchanging dead planet. Every probe seems to have mechanical difficulties, etc.

Story could elaborate about those old martial canals, etc. Perhaps some of the non-human races have been there centuries; plus the mandatory artifacts from a unknown precursor race. Maybe a seven year series about a muggleborn being taken to mars, so seeing all the magic-technology necessary to terraform from their POV. Or a bradbury-esque anthology. Anyway, Potterverse on Mars. That's the AU I wanna see.

Eighth year, canon compliant fics where Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione deal with being apart and being famous, where jealousy is a big issue they deal with, along with general long-distance issues. Especially with Ron, I could see this being an issue in canon and just surprised there aren't more fics exploring this.

** Harry lives in the DC Universe, he goes to work and a local bank gets robbed by some super villain, why? Because he lives in a city without a hero, Harry's home doesn't have that protection that deterrent that many other cities have and that day watches as a few dozen police officers are killed along with a large number of regular people paralysed by Magical Law. And so Harry decides that he will be his cities protector, not because he's related to some DC hero, not because he's a alien not because he's dating a hero, but simply because he has a power to protect those who can't protect themselves. Harry gets his shit together, builds a Super Suit and goes out saving people fighting Villains. And in no part of this does Harry join Superman or Batman or does he move to a city with a established hero, it's not about Batman, he doesn't even appear till the Justice League shows up. It's all about Harry balancing his normal life, the fact that he is breaking the law by helping and his hero life. It's Harry's Superhero CW show rather than adding Harry to anything else.

I don't want to read about Batman 70% of the time in a Harry Potter/Justice League Crossover, how about making Harry the ride along character, or even worst the entire story is built around Batman being a dick.

tldr: Harry Potter in the style of his own CW Superhero Show, where the story is about Him and solely him defending his city. Yes Batman Exist, but he is OVER THERE and doesn't matter when Harry is trying to Juggle his Girlfriend, His Job his Heroing and hiding his Heroing from people who would get him out to the Aurors

On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

However, he thinks these actions are immoral (perhaps because he thinks no one's appointed him as judge, jury and executioner. Something like that) . The fic could explore how far he can go in the war while still remaining within the boundaries of his code.

** I read almost everything out there, from tame T rated sweet romances, to really dark sexually explicit fics. So i figure ill post a list of the 10 ones I would most be interested in seeing more of from all areas.

Top of the list by far?

1. Really well done and detailed AU world building.

I know this is a very vague and big category, but there are so many fics out there that have such potential, if only they would put more effort into actually building the world they explore when going AU Harry Potter.

Other big ones:

1. Time travel or parallel dimensional travel. I love when they are well done.
2. True Grey Harry (not beholden to Light or Dark)
3. Much more detailed explorations of Magic in general
4. More fics like Blindness or Barefoot with unique magical interactions
5. Harry/Katie (or Quidditch team) pairings

And a few guilty pleasure ones:

1. Good world builder Harem or Poly fics
2. Dark has won / Sex Slavery / Slave Auction fics
3. Harry/Teacher pairing fics

And a finally a crossover I would love to see more of (if there are even any to begin with)

1. Harry Potter / Twilight crossover (vampires exist in both worlds)

See thats the thing. There ARE stories out there with such things (super dark, slavery, harems, age difference pairings), that ARE really good. Delenda Est is the perfect example.

It can be done... it just is rarely done. I often ask for edgier recommendations like what I listed as my guilty pleasure ones, but that doesnt mean I want to read crap heh.

linkao3(Bleak Manor) is a promising Dramione WIP. Lots of subtle world building. Really gets the tone right imo between the fact that no one really knows the rules to this new social order & Draco being a legitimately terrible person but not the worst of the bunch. Obviously heavy on the non-con, but the author shows some awareness and those scenes play into the plot (as such) & character development.

** In my head, there's a fic where Voldemort figures out he can make MORE voldemorts out of his horcruxes. Death (or fate or whatever) brings additional Harry Potters to this universe. There's a Gryffindor Harry Potter (like Cannon) but also a Slytherin Harry (probably gay and in love with Draco), a Ravenclaw Harry (probably a typical "try and think the universe apart" kind of ravenclaw Harry). Probably a hufflepuff Harry too, although there aren't as many of those. Maybe the friends as well? Plotting and assassinating the different Voldemorts of different ages, sassing each other . . .

If we had so the horcruxes got bodies, and they were fully functioning copies that existed on their own, so they are copies of the dark lord at the time he made them then they make a horcrux etc.\\

To add to that vagueness, I would like more originality in fanfiction (at least originality in terms of what we have in fanfiction). And if you can't think of something look at threads offering fic ideas, or get inspired by unsuccessful LF threads. Try to write something you haven't even seen written.

I'm a thousand words into writing my first fic based on an idea inspired by a LF thread that no one had any recommendations for. It doesn't even fully align with the idea presented in that thread, but once the idea hit me I couldn't resist writing it.

** A somewhat believable OP Harry. As in where he is the strongest, yet he faces challenges that he cant just backhand into oblivion.

Also, can never get enough of fics that sideline Hermione.

If SteelBadger ever resumes writing Harry Potter and the Sun Queen, I would be a happy camper.

*** I actually read an one-shot a bit similar premise. Though in the story, it featured some usual troops as well: an asshole Sirius, no Voldemort, Ravenclaw Harry, no bad blood but no close relation with James/Lily, Harry closest to Lupin's, no bashing of Dumbledore/Wesley's - infact a supportive Dumbledore to Harry, the brother of BWL not becoming a sudden star etc. But unfortunately I can't remember the name.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Magic being magical.\\
No magical core : one can use magic or not, and "strength" is just a result of knowledge and training and intelligence and stuborness, of one character.\\
No arithmancy as a magical science, but as a study of numeric symbolism; runes as magical poetry, not "inscribe a rune and hop, a ward !"; astronomy with importance; rituals and staves not as heavy weapons, but as an older and somehow unpractical (when compared to a wand) way to cast spells;...

*** Maybe not bashing, but I agree. I'm honestly bemused at how every AU fic sets up some weird background for Harry (e.g. psychopath raised by Bellatrix), then awkwardly tries to justify how Hermione could still be his bff. /Accidental Horcrux/ and /Prince of Slytherin/ both did it.

**** It didn't seem that awkward to me in Prince Of Slytherin? I haven't read Accidental Horcrux in a while so I don't remember that. I do agree on that point, especially when it's Harry's who believe in blood prejudice, or who are just plain dicks to everyone. (Dark Harry Fics usually).

** I'd like to read a story with Harry abandoned at the Dursley's while Lily and James raise his twin (who may or may not be the Boy (or girl)-Who-Lived), Harry comes to Hogwarts angry and confused. He tries to become friends with his twin, tries reaching out to his parents. No response from either, possibly hostility from his twin.

And so one day (maybe Halloween) Harry just walks up to his twin in the Great Hall and kills them. In front of everyone. No hesitation.

I don't think it would be a good fic, but I'd like to read everyone's reactions, their horror, the worry from those in the know about the dead B(or G)-W-L and what that means for the prophecy.
