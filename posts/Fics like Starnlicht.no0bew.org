Are there any fics that y'all would say have the same vibe as Starnlicht? By that I mean an historical fic set before canon with a wide range of OCs, you can tell the author did historical research, fleshed out characters and a gripping story, and a female lead?


** Historical fic with wide range of OC's and historical research.. linkao3(Of A Linear Circle) series. Especially the later installments.

  Set against the political backdrop of revolutionary France and its wizarding backlash, the three heirs of Salazar Slytherin look to find their way in a changing world while remaining true to their hearts and keeping favor with Britain's most powerful man, Septimus Malfoy. A tale of ambition, cunning, pride, and above all love, this is the untold story of the strange events surrounding the 1792 Triwizard Tournament.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.
