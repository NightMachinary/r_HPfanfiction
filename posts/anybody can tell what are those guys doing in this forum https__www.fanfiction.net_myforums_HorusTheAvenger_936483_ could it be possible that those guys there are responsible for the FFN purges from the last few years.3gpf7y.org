** That doesn't look so bad... the first subforum has to do with plagiarism, which I see nothing wrong with being reported, and the second one concerns copyright infringement, which does not concern HP fics mostly. (Unless someone likes inserting song lyrics I guess?)

Anyway, they don't seem responsible for the FFN deletions of good stories. Afaik, those purges a few years back were due to some dudes called critics united or something. They would post a review naming the author's 'violations' and warning them to change their story or face their wrath (report!) .

*** What's the popular opinion on these Critics United fellas? They seem sort of masturbatory and anal. Like Percy Weasley on a power trip. I took a peek at one of their threads and a member is complaining about someone not reworking their second person story to comply with the site rules.

**** In my opinion, they are about as useful as a condom factory in Vatican.

I guess it has something to do with the 'people wielding power' thing, even if in this case that power is fictional --- pun intended.

****** From what I've read regarding both The Eliminators and Critics United, while their mission statements seem sound enough the reality seems that often there is a highly aggressive tone taken and they set out to humiliate those they target as much as anything else. They are vigilantes and in some (not all) cases bullies, this is not to be condoned. The site should be responsible for its own policing.

*** so I couldn't read the best fics because of guys that don't like that there are inserted lyrics here and there or the author has inserted a copyrighted line or text in a story with over 300.000 words? Wtf... that's just lame

**** The author will just have to remove the copyrighted material and re-upload. It shouldn't be too hard, though it does indeed suck. Thankfully song lyrics rarely add anything of value to a story, so it should be even better.

** Wait, they want to stop plagiarism and copyright infringement for FANFICS?

Holy Pendantic Bullshit.

It's fanfiction guys, it's all plagiarism and copyright infringement. If it wasn't it would be original fiction and you could sell it.

*** I was in the middle of reading a story when it was taken down. When I asked the author why was the story taken down, he said to thank those guys... I went there and I found that the story I was reading had some plagiarize material, some song lyrics... I mean... really wtf... for some stupid lyrics that almost had nothing to do with the story? I asked the author that and he told me that they were harassing him... so yeah... I can say I'm mad at them for this
