"Ugh! Who decided boating people across a monster infested pond would be good for precious little children like moi?" Harry plucked a strand of seaweed off his elbow, and his upper lip curled in disgust. "You must be Harry Potter." Harry opened his mouth to say something smartly to the boy who had his albino hair plastered back on his head, making him look like an old man. "I'm Malfoy, Draco Malfoy." Harry smiled sarcastically.

"I'm Potter. As in, I like doing ceramics. Quite a nice pasttime, don't you think, albino old man? And also, what are you doing here, this is a school for children." Shaking his head, Harry pushed past the surprised aristocrat, while the muggleborns laughed.

"There are four houses you can be sorted into;Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin-" "WHo decided to name a house Ravenclaw? Like, uncreative or what? Slytherin? This is a house for /children!/ Goodness sakes woman, come up with better names!" Interrupted Harry, shaking his head. Mcgonagall's lips tightened. "I didn't found this school, boy, that was thousands of years ago-" "Yeah, you look a thousand years old!" Harry cried.

Before Mcgonagall could reprimand him, the door burst open, and the group of students walked in. Everybody was staring, and Harry loved it. Making kissy faces, shaking his hips, and then when people stared at him weirdly, he just said angrily "Whatchu goggling at you fata**?" Needless to say, the Weasley Twins loved him already.

When Harry saw the Sorting Hat, he sneered. "We have to wear that? Um, hello, lice anyone? I don't want to wear anything that she" here, he pointed to Hermione," has worn. Mhmm?" He crossed his arms, and pouted his lips. "Harry Potter!" cried Mcgonagall, looking up expectantly. Harry walked up, and turned around to the stunned Hogwarts.

"Yes, my name is Harry Potter. I'm beautiful and amazing, so stop badmouthing me behind my back. It makes me feel insecure. You all are just jealous cause I'm gorgioso!" And with that, Harry sat down, facing the dumbstruck crowd. "Hmm" said the hat. "Yo wossup?" Harry asked, picking his nails.

"Yes yes. Definitely not Hufflepuff. Can be rash, oversmart, sarcastic, oh very nice. You'd have to be..."

​

In the next part, Harry kisses up to Snape, is hated by everybody except his house, and is punched in the face by a Quidditch captain.

Thanks for reading! Also thank you to "Tobeabreeze" for an edit!


** Just fyi, sorry if this is not quite appropriate... but do you perhaps mean moi and not muah? Muah is more like the chef's kiss sound. Moi is referring to yourself, usually with sarcasm.
