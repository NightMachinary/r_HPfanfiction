Ok.

Last night, I had this amazing dream.

It was a mashup of Ender's Game-ish and Harry Potter.

Harry Potter, age 8, for some reason knows quite a lot of magic, and is tapped for some kind mission on humanity's first interstellar (but slower-than-light) vessel. We were going to colonize a planet, or First Contact, or something. Ship had a massive antimatter-fueled engine of some kind

It was expected that the mission would take about 80-100 (from POV of those on ship) years, so they were looking for really smart children who would live long enough to complete the mission, because generation ships go wrong very easily.

They didn't know about magic, and HP and I were trying to figure out the distance limits (if any) on apparation, Vanishing Cabinets, portkeys, etc, so we wouldn't have to leave the Earth behind, and also so we could still attend Hogwarts for some reason (despite knowing more than most 7th years leave with).

We ended up shoving a ridiculous amount of such things, plus supplies, into a bigger-on-the-inside trunk.

Then Lt. Graff discovered we were wizards, and we started rebuilding the entire ship with magitech.

I think I accidentally transfigured some antimatter incorrectly, and there was a massive explosion, ending the dream.

'Twas a most wonderful dream.

Anyone know of some good fanfics of this crossover that might assuage my loss?


** While it isn't a crossover, linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) /is/ the HP version of Ender's game.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has the Voldemort-possessed Quirrel organize "mock battles" between three armies; it takes up a dozen or so chapters towards the middle of the story and is a self-confessed pastiche of /Ender's Game/, justified in-story by the fact that Harry has read /Ender's Game/ and is mimicking it on /purpose/.

** This is a Ender in Harry's body third year story. I think it's pretty good. There's a little bit of space at the beginning (when Ender is Ender) but maybe not what youre looking for.
