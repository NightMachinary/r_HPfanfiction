Recently read Requaero Probum by Evansentranced and I loved it. I haven't found many other adventureish fics and thought you lovely folks could assist. Prefer 100k+ and well written.


** I haven't read that particular fic so I'm not positive these hit the same vibe. But all are great, fairly action packed and have a Draco/Harry pairing.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/753415][Paradox]] and the sequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/753418][Convergence]] are a cool time travel Draco goes back to end of 5th year that's a canon rehash but with a twist. The adventure is the DH stuff.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1227880][All of our secrets laid bare]] is an auror partner fic with a really good slow build.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/330906][The Boy Who Only Lived Twice]] is a "secret identity" fic like I've never read before. In it, Draco and Harry are both unspeakables - spies who use polyjuice to hunt criminals and work in pairs. They are partners but neither knows who the other really is. Until Draco finds out Harry is Harry...

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164][Eclipse]] is a classic Drarry where Draco captures Harry for Voldemort, has a crisis of conscience and helps Harry escape in an epic journey to evade the death eaters.

  Harry Potter is an Unspeakable. Draco Malfoy is the wizard who shagged him. Adventure! Intrigue! Secret identities, celebrities, spies! It's all right here, folks.

  "You're dead, Potter... I'm going to make you pay..."  Draco swore his revenge on Harry for Lucius's imprisonment, and Harry all but laughed at him. But Draco is planning more than schoolyard pranks this time. The old rivalry turns deadly when Draco abducts Harry for Voldemort. It's the perfect plan, guaranteeing revenge, power, and prestige, all in one blow. But when Draco's world turns upside down, the fight to save himself and Harry begins, and the battle will take them both through hell and back. If they come back.

  Thanks to a clever bit of magic and the help of an old acquaintance, Draco is given the chance to relive his years at Hogwarts with the knowledge of what exactly is in store for the future. However, when things tumble out of Draco's grasp, he finds himself losing his memories of the life he's already led as everything takes a startling turn away from what he'd always assumed to be his destiny.
