Memory is very foggy with this one, sorry.

It's a very AU story, and its starts with Harry as some sort of experienced traveler/druid type journeying through pagan/fae lands. Much like Shadow of Angmar, the story begins with Harry in this AU role.

He encounters various mythical irish/celtic? characters, but I don't think any canon characters really show up, nor does the plot ever reference or approach canon material or locations really. The writing was dream-like, felt like I was reading a good fairy tale. It wasn't cracky, took itself seriously.

I don't believe it was a crossover with another property, and it appeared to be a singular story.

Likely not the following:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10313612][The Traveller]] (its a trilogy, and has voldemort as a prominent character)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian Trilogy]] (its a trilogy, and has canon locations and characters)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13034167/5/Druid-of-Holly-and-Yew][Druid of Holly and Yew]] (was hopeful for this one given the first two chapters, but then story goes into hogwarts/canon characters)

I've done various "pagan/fae/fairy/faerie/druid/celtic" searches here, but almost all of them seem to be canon-like stories with familiar characters. Does this ring a bell with anyone? Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Story was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12805831/][Testimony of the Avarice by joe6991]], found by [[/u/colorandtimbre]], despite the inaccurate details in my post. If anyone else is looking for this story, this is that one where it starts with Dumbledore waiting for Harry in a pub, its raining outside. Harry gets a key to go into Fairaeland with a dog as his companion to find a horcrux. He later bumps into a fae who takes on Hermione's face. Hope this helps future searches.


** I think I know what you're talking about. Did it start at a pub with Harry meeting someone (Dumbledore)? It was written by someone in the DLP circle, if so, I'll try to find it.

*** I don't quite remember how it started anymore. But I was a avid reader on DLP a while back, so that sounds promising compared to the nothing I have right now. If it isn't too much trouble, could you take a look and see if you can find the story you're thinking of?

**** took a bit, but I found the one I was thinking of: linkffn(Testimony of the Avarice by joe6991). Hope it's what you were looking for. I probably should have checked his profile earlier, ended up rediscovering some good stories though

***** I think this might be it.... That, or the author had the same idea. Thank you so much!

How did you find this btw? Did you remember the author, or did you use keyword searches? I tried a bunch of searches on DLP but didn't find anything similar.

****** I checked the profiles of the DLP authors I have favorited on ffn, specifically the ones who were active ~2016 bc that's when I thought the story was from (I was wrong) and also checked their favorites lists (and the profiles of the authors of those stories, if I thought there was a chance they were the author). Takes a while but given how little I knew I think it was the best option. That's also how I find most new stories, it tends to work better than any other system imo

******* Thanks for the tips, I'll try doing that in the future. And thanks again for finding it. After rereading through the story last night, I definitely got a bunch of details wrong in my post. I'm lucky you stopped by!

Is that one possible? He takes a potion and it sends him to another plane.

I may be reading your description wrong.

*** I'm afraid not. I think my white whale story starts out fully AU, no hogwarts intro, no potion shenanigans that I can remember. It's very much like Shadow of Angmar in that way, I think it just starts out with Harry in the AU world and barely references canon at all.

Thank you for looking though, really appreciate it!
