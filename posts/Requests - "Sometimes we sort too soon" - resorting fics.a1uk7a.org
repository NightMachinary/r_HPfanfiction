Are there any fics where the students are resorted when they get into say 3rd, 4th or 5th year? I remember one was a Marauder era fic and Severus was resorted into Gryffindor, I think 5th year or so. Any other fics like that?


** I've read a few in which Harry is re-sorted.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12271480/1/Other-People-s-Choices][Other People's Choices]] - The Sorting Hat re-sorts Harry into Slytherin when it lands on his head in the Chamber of Secrets.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]] - An little-known bylaw of Hogwarts allows students to request a resort if they have survived a traumatic event (murder attempt by a family member, etc.)

**** Eh, /Benefits of Old Laws/ explores some of the pureblood culture tropes. In my opinion it's a great read, but I understand that it doesn't appeal to everyone. The pace of the story is slow, focused on day to day interaction as the characters work through their problems. It might not strike your fancy if you are looking for action.

/Other People's Choices/ has some flat characters (Dumbledore, Sirius) but it has some great moments as well. I liked the unique portrayal of Theodore Nott and his father, and that Harry took a stand against going back to the Dursleys.

***** Hmmm. I think I'm feeling a bit over the pure blood stuff. Thanks for the details. You've flipped my interest to Other People's Choices actually.

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much. COMPLETE, sequel to come.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
