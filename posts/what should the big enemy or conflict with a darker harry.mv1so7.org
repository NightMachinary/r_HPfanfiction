** Hard to say without knowing your characters and their relationship

What motivates your dark!Harry? What motivated your sane!Voldemort?

What goals do they cooperate on? What do they disagree about?

Your villain should be someone who has goals and motivations in direct conflict with your two characters. They should be have something about them that drives a wedge between them as well, whether or not it's temporary. Once you outline that, you have two-thirds of what you're looking for. The rest is technical details, the looks and hows and all that.
