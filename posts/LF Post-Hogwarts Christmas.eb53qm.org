Looking for fics, one shots or longer doesn't matter, focusing on/set during Christmas, post-hogwarts. Any and all pairings are fine.


** - linkao3(2684903)
- linkao3(12951165)

Yes, they are both by Northumbrian. And so what?

And yes, I wrote (as a reply to Northumbrian ;)) one myself, linkao3(13363083) ... when we were signing the song in the church yesterday, I was thinking about it again.

  This is suggested 17th chapter of "Aurors and Schoolgirls" by Northumbrian. We were waiting for the continuation of the story for so long I have decided to take matter in my hands. The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with caution.- Albus Dumbledore

** I wrote one set around Christmas of 1981, which was post-Hogwarts for some characters, but probably not the ones you're interested in.
