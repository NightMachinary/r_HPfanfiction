Im looking for a fic series I read a while back. The first fic was set in the marauder era, and the fourth (or third, can't remember which) was a Harry/Ginny fic. I think the first fic was around 200k words but I might be wrong.


** Could it have been the amulet of time? It's a 4 part series with, the first is set in founders era, the second in voldemort era, the third in marauders, and the fourth back in the original time. It has Harry ginny in the fourth and possibly third part.

*** No, it wasn't a time travel fic iirc, Ginny & Harry isn't present until part 3 or 4. the first part is marauders PoV.
