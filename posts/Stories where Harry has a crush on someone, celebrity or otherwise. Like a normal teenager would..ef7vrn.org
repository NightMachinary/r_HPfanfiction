*** I don't know why, but that never really seemed /real/ to me. Not the book, the crush. Same with [[/u/InquisitorCOC][u/InquisitorCOC]]'s suggestion. That one seemed forced, tbh.

**** It is very difficult to find teenage romance, and often it's poorly written in fanfictions. You can try looking for fics with James and Lily since James has a crush with lily in Canon, but I don't have a recommendation on it, the last romance fic I liked is A Most Peculiar Girl by KingOfJacks. It's Harry / Daphne. Linkffn(13356003)

  With some amount of horror, Daphne realized that she could not remember the last time she had even protested his presence. When had that happened? Was Harry Potter her...friend?

** ravenclawblues' The Heir Of House Black linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) has adult Harry as a kid, though a different kid in the 1960's/70's pre- Wizarding War. He has a thing for a star seeker.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]
