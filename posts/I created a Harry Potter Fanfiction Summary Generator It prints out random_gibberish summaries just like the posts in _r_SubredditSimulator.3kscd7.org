  DH spoilers, ignores epilogue, HPDM preslash. When Ron dies, Hermione falls into a coma and when he realized he was shorter than the headmaster. That couldn't be, he'd been taller than Albus ever since he was three, and now has to face Voldemort and learns to be human again.

The best part? I checked to see if this was mostly an existing summary with a few words changed (which does happen), but it didn't in this case! That was strung together from 6 different summaries!

Edit: actually 5, sorry. I thought the "Now complete with epilogue" came from a different one since that summary had asterisks around it, until I realized the asterisks in the reddit comment just made it italicized

*** Haha that's an effect of using multiple previous words to predict the next, so it can pull out complete phrases from existing summaries if that particular phrase is especially unique.

You can tell in that example that it has pulled words from at least two summaries, since the pronoun changes from "his" to "her"

** Since people seemed to like my previous post analyzing character choices, this time I analyzed the word and phrasing choices used in the summaries! It's based on the use of a Markov chain (read post for more info) that was constructed by analyzing the top 25,000 fanficition summaries on FFN, sorted by number of reviews.

** So, as a student, I really want to do some work in machine learning and AI. I absolutely /loved/ your explanation of Markov Chains and the supplementary post - you explained Markov Chains extremely well, approachable to someone who hasn't touched on probability for years.

Thank you for that! Two questions:

1. What is the time complexity for the algorithm? The thought makes me shudder. It feels like it would be between O(n^{2} ) and O(n!) (of course, there are multiple inputs, so that's not very specific)

2. Where can I go to learn more about stuff like this? Any recommendations for videos/websites/books/PDFs etc?

*** Thanks! To answer your questions:

1. I don't know the exact complexity, but it's definitely not efficient. I'm also not very familiar with algorithm analysis, but I'll give it a shot. The heavy lifting is done with the matlab function ismember(a,b) which takes two lists of strings /a/ and /b/ and returns the locations in /a/ that are found in /b/. According [[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/271030][to this thread]], ismember first sorts the lists, an O(n*log(n)) process, and then starts comparing, so it can terminate early once it's found a match. I think there's too many factors for me to give a good answer, e.g. as the list of keys gets larger, the searching for existing keys takes longer.
2. You can find plenty of blog posts like mine, e.g. the two I linked to in the supplementary post or [[http://blog.codinghorror.com/markov-and-you/][here]]. Also, I haven't read these sources, but they seem promising: [[https://www-alg.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/%7Ethomas/publications/fow06hz.pdf][1]] [[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/assignments/markov.html][2]].

*** I briefly mentioned this in the supplementary info [[http://uncertaindecisions.com/index.php/markov_details/][here]].

*** Hmm. In this context, it's just a way of thinking about likely word transitions, so if I ask you to complete the phrase "Chamber of...", what would pick as the next word? Being a Harry Potter fan, you might say "Secrets", but someone who hasn't read the series might say "Commerce". It's all about your prior experience.

I wrote a computer program to mimic this. I fed it a large body of text (in this case fanfiction summaries), and the program "learned" which words are most likely to follow others. Then, to generate a fake summary, I give it a starting phrase and ask it to keep going, randomly choosing words based on what it has learned.
