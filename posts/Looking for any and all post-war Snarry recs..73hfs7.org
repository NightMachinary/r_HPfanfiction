** My favorite is [[http://pir8fancier.nfshost.com/harrypotter/hp_hfn.html][Snape: The Home Fries Nazi]]. At first glance, the premise is remniscient of an LSD-inspired crack fic, but I very much enjoyed it.

  In which Harry is a tad messed up after the war, but Snape gives him a run for his money. Or: an epic tale of PTSD, recovery and gay porn! (For detailed warnings, please see author's notes.)

  Dumbledore is up to something and a minor obstacle such as death isn't going to stand in his way; Hermione remains a clever-clogs but experience has diminished her know-it-all tendencies; Ron's skill at chess is far from being a fluke; Harry sets out on a journey of self-exploration; and Snape still suffers the after-effects of doing as he was told. The Fair Folk are Not Nice, and neither is Snape, but at least he never pretended otherwise. There's also a lot to be said for being a Wanker.Contains gratuitous use of mythology. This fiction begins immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts, so Harry, although old enough to know better, is not old enough to flaunt his activities in Australia. Keep away from babies, children and impressionable pets. Contains profanity, irreverence and expletives. Handle with extreme care and dragon-hide gloves, particularly when grasping hawthorn bushes. Contents may settle. Beware of the wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.

  Severus never expected to live through the War. He never expected Potter to survive either. All he asks is that he be left in peace --- to his garden, the brewing of his Potions, the alphabetisation of his book collection and, for once, to the staying out of trouble. Why does it seem Life always has other plans?

linkffn(The Fourth Year by caligryphy) - also not canon compliant, and rather OOC, but I love it anyway

linkao3(Sadness of Eros by loupgarou1750)

linkao3(Death and the Open Mind by loupgarou1750)

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2919&warning=4][Möbius]] by mandy/geneticallydead - on an old Snarry archive. EWE.

[[http://geneticallydead.livejournal.com/289555.html][Yearning]] by mandy/geneticallydead - still only on LiveJournal, alas. I keep hoping she'll transfer it to AO3

[[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/snarry_games/181113.html][Look for me here]] by Tarteaucitron - I LOVE Tarte's fic. All of it. (Click on the link on the fest page and it will direct you to the story.)

linkao3(No Place at All by Sinick, ac1d6urn) - an odd but lovely fic, even though Harry with beaded braids is a bit much!

linkao3(Kestrel by Lomonaaeren) - Wingfic

linkao3(Yet Here You Stand by sarkysue) - recommended only if you like harsh, dysfunctional versions of their relationship

linkao3(Going Concern by crystalusagi) - a low-key, quiet antidote to the fic above, written for a fest prompting unusual careers for Snape or Harry

And if unfinished and in-progress WiPs are allowed:

  Can we ever see ourselves as we really are? Sometimes we need to look through someone else's eyes, and even then the truth can change. Over ten years we visit Harry and Snape on Harry's Birthday, starting from when they are forced together in 1998 to keep Harry safe. I wanted to give both Harry and Severus the chance to be broken and to learn how to live with themselves. I hope I've done them proud.Warning: Contains scenes of domestic abuse that may be disturbing and/or a trigger.

*** Caligryphy. Dammit, it's been so long since I've read her fics, and I've been spelling her name wrong.

I'm curious since you recommend No Place at All -- have you also read The Price of Magic? And if so, what did you think? It's one of the older stories I've seen recommended (less so now, but a long time ago it was), and I've tried reading it a couple times without getting too far into it.

Lots of stuff here that I haven't read yet, so I'll be going through a lot of these as well. I think I know why I haven't seen/tried many of these yet -- the length. I really prefer longer stories to show character development between Harry and Snape before they get together. But I think I'm reaching the point where I need to start reading the shorter stories (<30k words) if I want new material.

**** Actually, you're not wrong. She spelled it both ways, depending on the site. I suspect she couldn't always snag the user name Calligraphy before someone else got to it. Or she liked the hybrid word. Or something.

The Price of Magic is a tricky one. There are some excellent things in it, but it starts slow, and in the first chapter Harry's voice is much too childish and his speech patterns make him sound like he has a lisp. Liberties are taken with Snape's background and characterization as well, but that didn't bother me as much.

The story finds its feet around Chapter 3, and some of the annoyances subside. The fic shifts POV now and then, which would be off-putting if handled wrong, but I thought it added to the worldbuilding here. Basically it's a touching, slow-burn love story between a living person and a ghost, embedded in a nostalgic/dystopian meditation on what's lost when magic goes away. Snape's sense of desolation is shaken by Harry's stubborn optimism, and Harry has moments of questioning his own existence. There's a mixture of melancholy and hope throughout that I appreciate, although the somewhat naive tone never entirely goes away. It also has some of the flaws typical of a WIP: rambling, some pacing issues, some punctuation errors. So it all depends on whether the sweet, sad nature of the story balances out the rest in the end.

I think by Chapter 4 you can see where it's going, even though the romance hasn't really gotten under way yet. The state of the survivors and the heartbroken longing for magic pervade the fic in counterpoint to Snape's struggle not to develop feelings for a dead boy. If it still doesn't feel promising enough by that point, I'd say you're unlikely to change your mind about the rest.

As for fic length - most of my favorites are on the short to moderate side, not by preference but because my favorite authors tend toward more compact fics and character studies. But I'm always on the look-out for good new authors, and fic length is irrelevant; it's the style and flair and grasp of characterization that appeal to me.

***** Thanks, I guess I'll keep reading for a bit more to see where my feelings land on the "should I keep reading" spectrum, though I have a feeling I'll have to bail. I'm normally a big fan of the slow burn stories, but there's something about this (maybe it is Harry's voice, now that you've pointed it out it has been sticking out in a .... eh, not-positive way) that just rubs me the wrong way.

Out of curiosity, do you read other Snape pairings?

Edit: And that's understandable, re: fic length. I used to read a lot more short fics, but when reading a very good one, those moments of experiencing such good writing are so fleeting, and the moments of feeling hollow afterward are so prolonged, heh.

****** Probably 90% of my HP fic reading centers around Snape, and although I consider Snape/Harry my OTP, I'm fond of a lot of other pairings as well. I especially enjoy seeing Snape thrown together with Filch and either of the Dumbledore brothers. There are individual fics I like that pair him with Neville, Remus, Sirius, Draco, Moody, Kingsley, Slughorn, Flitwick, Firenze, Silvanus Kettleburn, or Viktor Krum. I enjoy Snape/McGonagall and sometimes Snape/Lily, and there's an Aberforth/Minerva/Severus fic I love and a Snape/Millicent Bulstrode/Dennis Creevey fic as well. I even love a rather heartbreaking fic that's Eileen/Severus.

In other words, Snape is my little black dress. He goes with almost everything, and he can persuade me to read about characters I have no interest in (Remus and Draco, for instance).

I'm never exactly glad to see a good fic end, but it's rare that I get a hollow feeling from finishing a wonderful reading experience. Sometimes I'm a little dazed and unwilling to leave a story behind if I've been deeply absorbed in it, but that's not quite the same thing.

******* I remember Snape/Dumbledore used to be rather a popular pairing as well, back in the time when Snape/Harry was also more popular. I never gave any of those fics a shot, but over the last year it's been something I've considered. A well-written Dumbledore is even more elusive than a well-written Snape.

If you have any Snape/Draco stories you like, I would love a link. It's very rare that I see anything for that pairing (which is my OTP) that isn't some established-relationship or PWP piece. I'll have to pick your mind for more Snape fics in another thread that's perhaps more on topic (with visibility to other Snape fans). I like your taste in fics though; I've been making my way through some of these other, shorter pieces linked up thread.

A long time ago in the time of geocities and before the series had ended, there was another Snape fan I had a few good conversations with, and I wonder if you were familiar with her as well. She had a lot of interesting things to say about him. I'll have to see if I can find her site, on the off chance it was archived anywhere.

Edit: Ha, I can't believe I found it. I need to go back and read through it all, but it was great back in the day: [[http://www.geocities.ws/mssnape_34/][Snape's Sanctum Sanctorum]]

** Unfortunately I went through a period where I read nothing but snarry fics for a few months and I didn't bookmark them. I know I've read more than the following that are good but I've no idea what they are.

linkao3(In Time, Once Again by avioleta) post-war time travel fic where Harry ends up in Severus's first year teaching. It was written for Snarry-a-Thon 2012 and you may have read it before. [[https://snape-potter.dreamwidth.org/261224.html][Sweet Afton]] has the same premise but they are pretty different fics and I enjoyed both immensely.

linkao3(A Time to Forget by GatewayGirl) Harry starts teaching at Hogwarts after he and Ginny divorce. Author said it's EWE, but I skimmed the first chapter and Albus is already 14. It's also a de-aging fic. Written in 2008. I remember it being quite funny.

linkao3(Like a storm over the sea by keikoHPfan) I've read this a couple times by accident but it pulls me in whenever I read it. Can't remember why though, haha.

linkao3(Time and Time Again by Mottlemoth) really amazingly written Harry saves Snape/time travel fic that is heartwrenching.

linkao3(No Milk Today by Lyowyn) time travel/postwar/crazy timelines kind of fic. Can't remember it well but I know I liked it.

linkao3(Sanctum Preserve by queen_of_OTPs) cheesy & kind of clichè but a good read nonetheless

linkao3(Subconscious by mallerina7)

linkao3(Wisdom by Alisanne) everyone thought Snape was dead, turns out he isn't, Harry is obssessive and Ginny hates it. This fic is still ongoing and updates once or twice a month but it's really brilliant. I have trouble keeping track, so I'm going to just restart it whe Alisanne finishes it.

Also, [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2048&warning=4][Paradox of Existence]] by Dragon Light is pretty good. Another postwar time travel fic (I've probably read all the snarry time travel fics out there, it's my favorite premise), and the postwar factor is only big for Harry cos he goes back 16 years.
