So a couple years ago when I got into HPfanfics, there was a story I really enjoyed. It was Albus proposing to an OC named Nott, just before their graduation ceremony. The reason he did it was because there was a law that going to be passed and Albus tried to help her. Rose and Scorpius are also in the story. If someone could help I would be super grateful! Thanks in advance!
