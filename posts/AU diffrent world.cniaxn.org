I want an AU where basically, theres a Slytherin Hermione like from Applied Cultural Anthropology

Slytherin Harry, like from On the way to Greatness

Ron has some sort of mental illness, sees people like pawns, basically a ''Chessmaster'', can be in any house, but preferably Slytherin also.

In the start i want the three not to be friends or whatever, just acquaintances. The pov switches from them.

Later, they will begin working together, each for they're own goals. Ron wants to basically be in the shadows controlling people, essentially he has lots of political power, but people will think he is unemployed or something.

Hermione becomes a dark lady. And Harry turns out to be the second Tom Riddle, just smarter. Cortrolling Britain and western europe through money.
