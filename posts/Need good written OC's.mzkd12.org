I used to read fanfiction a lot, but now I have a hard time returning to them. I like to read the ones that have an original female character as the main character, but what I hate is after a while they all sound the same. They don't all need to be bff with the golden trio, or a rival to next generation characters to lovers, same with the marauders era.

I want a character that always wanted to study dragons and found many beasts fantastic and mesmerising.

Or someone who is a bitch and hates magic; her acceptance letter made her discover that she was adopted and she thinks she was perfectly happy before that.

Or if you wanna go the cliche route at least be creative about it. Voldemort' daughter, sure but make her a production of dark magic with a powerful/sophisticated creature like a mermaid (give me reason why the dark lord will try to have a child) but because she was the production of dark magic she's mute and it can't be healed unless using similar dark magic.

These are just random examples, and yes I want some fluff and a romantic partner on these stories I just need to feel like she actually exists and not just a perfect character for whomever she's paired with.

tl;dr give me links to stories that have OCs with depth in their characters.


** In Coven are two OCs. They're not the main character, the main characters are a beautifully clashing Hermione and Pansy, but Megan Jones (I think that name was made by JK but the author has filled her out beautifully and in a way I've never seen before so she counts, right?) and the OC is Victoria Garcia and she's so awesome. Just. So awesome. And not in a Mary Sue way, she's a muggleborn arithmancy obsessed character who is a Hufflepuff with Jones and I don't want to give away the rest.

Anyway they're probably the best OC's I've seen other than the ones who get blended with a time travelling fem Harry, and That's not the same thing at all linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15234645/chapters/40263638]])

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”

** Linkao3(Cisme by DarkAndChaotic) For sheer character depth. The SI has a complicated backstory. A study of the Dursley household from an SI's perspective. Hasn't reached Hogwarts yet.

Linkao3(Sincerely, The Stranger You Call Sister) SI as Tom Riddle's sister. Extensive backstory for OC via flashbacks. Hogwarts first year.

Linkffn(Always In Your Shadow: Calista Snape Volume I) Snape's daughter with Bellatrix gets rescued. Recovery followed by all 7 years at Hogwarts and beyond with Canon in background. By far the most detailed OC I have come across: 1M words.

** I really loved this SI/OC Tom Riddle redemption fic linkao3(Seven Devils by please_dont)

The MC comes from our modern day world where she read the HP books and gets thrown in the HP world reality to just before Harry arrives at Hogwarts. She's a Muggle but this doesn't stop her or slow her down in any way, she's still becomes a valuable asset to the Order. All the characters are really well done, I personally think Dumbledores character was the best version I've ever read in fanfiction.

Highly recommend this, it's in the god tier of fanfics for me and I think it's the type of thing you're looking for, the OC not being the usual cookie cutter character.

  “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold.“No, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”“You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --”“Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”“You are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

Harry is still the bwl and gets send to the dursleys. But when he turns 7 his accidental magic creates a snow storm at the end of July. (harry is an ice elemental) Lillian Morris is a muggleborn whose mother died when she was young. Her father loves her but kinda neglects her for his work. When Lillian was 7 she created a firestorm bigger than fiendfyre and nearly killed her entire village. (fire elemental) Harry uses his "ice powers" to scare the Dursleys and gets a better life. Lillian is terrified of her powers so she doesn't practice. Harry is kinda like daphne greengrass usually is in fanfiction but with more. Lillian is a lot like Lily potter but isn't afraid of punishment so she uses her flames to hurt multiple people.

The fic has some lemons in it but you can easily skip them.

Also granger/weasley bashing. Canon!Dumbledore.

Edit: it is still updated but slowly also 400k+ words and only in 6th year!

** linkffn(Green Eyed Monster)

Don't be put off by the "twin fic" aspect of this. Audrey is one of the best, most fleshed out OC's i've ever seen and completely avoids the pesky Mary Sue problem because she is real, flawed, and magically powerful while at the same time being magically impotent. In other words, she is balanced in ways other OCs aren't all whilst being hilarious.

**** Yes! And I think you'll love that Audrey has very unique magical interests. Like you said above in your blurb , she's Interested in care of magical creatures and later in the story is forced to dive into some obscure, arcane branches of magic which were really cool. The best part of this fic is IMO the characters interactions and worldbuilding. The romance was pretty good although I think the other factors of the fic were my main attractors. It was really good to for once have a realistic OC who wasn't outrageously gorgeous, saccharine sweet or just straight up a “female marauder” ...ew, Audrey is her own person
