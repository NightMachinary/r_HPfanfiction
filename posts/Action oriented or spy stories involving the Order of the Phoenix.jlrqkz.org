I'd rather have Harry NOT be the main character, he can be in the story and mentioned, but would rather follow someone actually in the Order.

Just a shame how we tend to have this cool freedom fighter type of organization, and yet not much if anything is done with them in canon or Fanon.

We might have some stuff with Tonks, but normally she's used as a sex partner for either Harry, Bill or Remus. Or we hear of Severus doing something, but don't get to see it.

And then there's underhanded people like Mundungus, who are really tricky, but we don't get to see anything with him.

Moody (the real Moody) is paranoid but still rather cool fighter, and yet we don't get much. As well as other Order Members.

Would love to see more action oriented and/pr spy stories involving the Order characters.

Would rather NOT have Romance as a main plot, but romance can be a thing, would just like the characters to evolve outside of romance plot.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

If there is romance: Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes.

  Some things never change, no matter a past which no longer sleeps. This is a lesson Alastor Moody must learn first-hand.
