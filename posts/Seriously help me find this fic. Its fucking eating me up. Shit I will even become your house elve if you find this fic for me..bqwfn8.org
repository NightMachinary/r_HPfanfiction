*** Well being a house elf would suck but is there even any point about owing a life debt? I mean, we do know some character who own them (Ginny, Snape, Pettigrew . . .) but did these debts have any true influence on their life?

I mean, Ginny didn't seem to do anything about it. Snape did try to protect Harry, but I always felt it was more because he was Lily' son ("Always") rather than James's one. As for Pettigrew, I always wondered if he died because of the life debt, or because Voldemort cursed the hand to kill him the moment his loyalty waver.

**** Ginny married Harry, thereby paying back the life debt with the life saved.

Snapes magic twisted his mind into devotion to Lily Potter, which in turn made him side with the light.

Did Pettigrew owe a debt? Who too?

But yea, they're a lot worse in fanon, than in canon. But they still do something. There's also Hermione, who owed one each to Harry and Ron. She married ron, and helped harry on all those adventures, becoming a lifelong friend.

****** What did Pettigrew owe Harry for?

And why didn't Ginny or Hermione? How do you define a life debt that Snape owed one but Ginny didn't? D'you think Snape was more likely to die being mawed by a werewolf than Hermione was being crushed by a troll?
