So I was wondering. Are there any (good) interactive stories out there? And why not? :D Joking aside, if there aren't any good ones, we as a community could easily do a big branching one where everyone could contribute with a small chapter. Of course the starting episode would need to be "generic" enough so it can go in many different directions. What do you think?


** Erm, the DLPers had a link to a story where they had readers vote on one of several outcomes as the story progressed. I think it was set either post GoF or OotP.

I remember [[/u/Taure]] and [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]] were writing at least parts of it along with some others. Found the link after some searching: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/37xvui/harry_potter_and_the_perils_of_investigative/][here]]

** Alright I found a website that looks great for this. How many of you would contribute if I would create an interactive story?

*** I'm interested. Should make sure that the site supports the notion of 'none of the above, I'll add my own branch instead' as a valid option.

**** I'm not sure that's possible, but I want to include in the rules that every chapter has to contain a "Something else" option so there is always a way to include your own storyline :)

** Now that you mention it... it does seem strange that I'm not aware of any such thing existing.

Spacebattles (and I assume Sufficient Velocity and Questionable Questing) have 'Quests' where the readers vote on the MC's actions (and sometimes on other things) but I don't know that I've seen any properly done out Interactive Fiction with all the branches written.

I'm not sure what the +proper+ entertaining premise would be for that either? Do you abandon any pretense and do it as a 'choose your own adventure' where you run Harry's life like an SI?

Or... do a Hogwarts mystery story where you have to investigate some strange occurrence?

Or maybe do it like one of those text based adventure games where you move around compass directions and have a 'map' of Hogwarts that you explore?

*** I would honestly go with the choose your adventure route. The others would need at least some minimal communication between the authors and lets be honest, thats never gonna happen. If people are interested, we could start one, I'm just unsure which website would be the best to host it on. If everything falls, I might as well write my own website to do it XD

**** True enough, I lost track of the 'group effort' aspect while typing.

** Alright, well for better or worse, here is the interactive story I created. There isn't much in it, literally only the start which I made as general as possible. Please check it out and contribute! I really would like to see this grow into a thing, but we'll see.

*** linked site claims I do not have access to view the story.

Probably want to edit the defaults so that it's viewable.

**** My bad, forgot to set it to public after I finished with the preparations. It should be accessable to everyone now.
