House Elves can Apparate in and out of Hogwarts, I think that they'd be able to Apparate in and out of other places, even if they have Anti Magic Charms or anything like that.

Dumbledore told Harry what the Horcruxes were in canon, (Despite what I've seen in some fanfictions stating the contrary) so if Harry contacted Dobby and was like: We need the Salazar Slytherin's Locket, Dobby should in theory be able to find it, same with other Horcruxes. Especially if they have guesses as to where the Horcruxes are.

Feels like House Elves were underused, imo. They seem relatively powerful from the little that we saw of them. And at least when it comes to Dobby, is able to protect people if another person is about to be attacked. (For instance how Dobby stopped Lucius Malfoy from attacking Harry).

No Weasley Bashing if at all possible. No OP Harry, Harry smarter and/or stronger then in canon is perfectly fine, but I'd like for it to be believable, because he worked for it. If Harry is "Lord" I'd want him to still help people.

As for pairings am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Et Cetra)
