I am looking for a fic where Harry time travels back to before Hogwarts and is adopted by the Grangers. I remember a scene where he explains that he and Hermione are magic and stuff about him coming out of his grounding to help Hermione in the garden most summers.

My Googling ability clearly isn't up to scratch because I can't seem to find it. Cheers in advance.
