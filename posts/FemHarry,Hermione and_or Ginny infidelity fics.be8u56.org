Would like to know Fics, that have said Girls commit infidelity. its not necessary, that said Girls are in a Relationship or even married, but more, that they are the cause of infidelity of their Partner. Lets say, as an example Malfoy develops an interest in Hermione, Ginny or Fem!Harry, but he is married. However his mind would soon change, so that he would cheat or leave his Wife, if it means to be with said Girl. It might be, that The Girl do gain an advantage of this escapade (like an item or a permission). All of them wouldnt deal with Malfoy more than necessary (one of the reasons is because he is married). So its a one-night-stand. Doesnt change the fact, that He is still attracted to them and wouldnt say no to a potential 2nd night stand, but they made a point.

I can imagine Fem!Harry be in such a place (maybe an AU version of Harry crosses the Canon and he gets attracted to her) or Hermione.
