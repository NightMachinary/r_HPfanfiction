** Deputy head, head of Gryffindor Dumbledore and McGonagall teaching together makes perfect sense. Far more sense than Deputy Head, Head of Gryffindor McGonagall teaching by her lonesome.

  What the hell is the Head of Transfiguration Department, and why do you need a department for school teaching, it's not some Ministry of Magic work or research team.

I've never gone to a school without different departments for each subject. I'm not sure of what it all entails, but I know teacher's are told which classes they'll be teaching, textbook/book decisions by grade level, performance evaluations are discussed.

** Are...are you new to how schools work? Subjects have multiple teachers all the time, I'm actually confused at this being the hill you're dying on

  Not only this but there's a rule that former students cannot be hired within three years of their graduation.

I don't remember this at all, where in canon did they mention this?

** I imagine that perhaps before the First Voldemort War started Hogwarts had a lot more teachers and students. After all, Hogwarts is a castle, yet it's stated that their are only 12 classes that have O.W.L.s. So I think that the head of the department for subjects would create and distribute lesson plans, as well as manage funds for that subject. While other teachers would teach the subjects. But once teachers and students started dying from the War, the other classrooms would become obsolete.

The 12 OWLs mentioned in the books are Transfiguration, Charms, Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Potions, Divination, Carr of Magical Creatures, Muggle Studies, Herbology, History of Magic, Astronomy, and Defense Against the Dark Arts.
