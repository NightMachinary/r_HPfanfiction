When i first read the series i was so taken up in the story of harry that i didn't spend time to think about many other characters it wasn't until i started to read fan fiction that i started to think about the world around him/ the people in it like veela discrimination , goblin politics and culture and in this particular discussion one third of the trinity of in the potter-verse Ronald Weasely.

At first like i imagine the case was for many people Ron was pretty cool loyal sort of funny a sidekick to the end but ever since i started seeing more and more portrayals of Ron ( as well as re reading the series) I've discovered i don't really like Ron from the first encounter to him tripping in goblet of fire and later in i want to say deathly hallows part 1( but i could be wrong) Ron is an inconsiderate belligerent with no regard for others but at the same time he is loyal for the most part putting his life on the line for harry when its truly important (and doesn't involve spiders) I don't know if I've let the weasely bashing get to me ore if I'm right to not like that ginger pratt I'm not sure.

What about you dear redditor? what do you lean towards


** I used to enjoy Ron bashing, but no more, simply because:

The fact that he, as a pureblood who could have laid low, stuck his neck out for Harry and Hermione against overwhelming odds is enough testament to his character.

--------------

And don't give me the vibe about him abandoning his friends. I firmly think it was mostly caused by the Locket Horcrux. *Just minutes after taking that thing off, Ron regretted his decision, but then he ran into a snatcher squad and was held up.* By the time he got free, Harry and Hermione already left and their protections were too good for Ron to find them again.

It was Harry who got that brilliant idea to wear a Horcrux around their necks. It was utterly insane IMO. Why the other two didn't object was beyond me. Harry had as much to blame for Ron leaving as Ron himself, and he seemed to feel partially guilty about that. In the subsequent weeks, he was constantly worrying that Hermione would leave him as well.

So when Ron came back in such a spectacular fashion (saving his life, destroying the Locket), he was more than happy and relieved.

--------------

Furthermore, the movie screenwriter Steve Kloves worked very hard to trash his character and Ginny's, and lots of haters used these scenes to justify their hate:

- In PS, when they fell into the Devil Snare pit, it was Hermione who panicked and Ron who saved the situation. In the movie, they reversed the roles.

- In POA, when Snape accused Hermione of being an annoying 'Know-it All', movie Ron rubbed salt into her wounds by agreeing with Snape. *Book Ron vigorously defended Hermione.*

- In POA, when Sirius threatened the Trio, it was Ron who stood up (despite a broken leg) and defended his friends. In the movie, they again reversed the roles.

- In DH1, check [[https://i.reddituploads.com/4ab32f01f41a435984b104ac204a5fe3?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=31ccdf02a9e0f9be7e2da9fc432430db][this link]] about how badly they messed up Ron's character.

- Here is another [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4xojoh/of_all_the_moments_in_all_the_films_this_is_the/][scene]] that trashed Ron's character. In the Books, Harry hid under his Invisibility Cloak, saw them, but decided not to approach. He met Neville in the Entrance Hall and asked him to kill the Snake. Then in the Courtyard, he found Ginny helping a wounded student, and almost gave up.

I will never consider Movies canon, like 70% of [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] and 80+% on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. It's simply another AU fanfic for me. I will also never let fanfics change my perceptions of Book characters, even though I may like or hate them in that particular settings.

--------------

Then there are people who complained that Ron was 'useless'. Well, he hadn't done a lot from Book 4-6, but he accomplished a *lot* in Book 7:

- Stunned Rudy Lestrange, potentially killing him, in the Flight of 7 Potters
- Prevented the other two from saying Voldemort and triggering Taboo
- Saved Harry from the pond
- Destroyed the locket Horcrux
- Disarmed Bellatrix at Malfoy Manor
- Took great care of Hermione in the aftermath
- Came up with the idea of using Basilisk fangs
- Opened CoS with fake parseltongue
- Saved Harry again in RoR
- Brought down Greyback together with Neville

--------------

How many of us can claim to have a friend like him in our lives? He perhaps made *one* major mistake during 7 years, as a 14 years old teenager boy; and he deserved *your* eternal hate?

*** You missed one of my favorites. Ron was the first to speak up (He beat you!) when Voldemort trotted Harry's 'dead' body out from the forest to break their spirits.

**** The thing is, so does Ron: the narration makes a point of saying that calls Hermione a know-it-all more than anyone. The point of that scene is that Snape, a teacher, is being an abusive dickhead and that Ron is the sort of person who would call out abusive dickheads and rush to their friends' defence. The point of the movie's version of that scene is that Snape is kinda mean and the only difference between him and Ron is that the latter doesn't insult Hermione as loudly.

*** W.r.t the one major mistake, I believe Hermione was wrong in book 4 about Ron being angry with Harry due to jealousy. Harry was just as much at fault as Ron in that conflict.

*** Holy shit dude( or dudette) ... I dont know why but i feel like apologizing i got schooled plain and fucking simple. I wont be a coward and switch up but you make far more than a good point but even a potter buff like yourself can admit that not every "ron fucked up" with circumstance im not tryong to say hes terrible do no one should like him im just sayong he pisses me off very often . not really much i can say about this i dont really want to say its my fault morea difference of a opinion even if the writers for the movie switched up details its not on them no ones is at fault really but ...not sure where im going with this you covered your bases gg( speaking of how long did it take you to type this)

Its wierd that movies dont stay true to the source material i understand that it would be very difficult to stuff all the detail into 1 to 2 houra of film but some seem to pick up the basic idea of the book and sort of improvise from the like annabeth being a brunette or ron defending hermione thats like a sure fire way to be a box office failure right. Oh and all of death note the netflix version

** Oh, wow, more poorly-spelled Ron Weasl*/e/*y bashing. Did my heart love 'till now? /s

Ron messed up twice, and the second one wasn't really his fault (If you don't blame Ginny for the diary, don't blame Ron for the locket).The Horcrux fucked all of them up, Ron just had more insecurties for it to feed on. Plus, it was Harry's stupid idea to /wear it/ in the first place!

The only reason why Ron bailed on Harry in 4th year is because he thought that Harry bailed on him first when he "supposedly" entered without him (Hermione's 'brilliant' reasoning did not help at all). Even then, he still attempted to apologize before the first task, but Harry was now (justifiably) angry at him and wouldn't hear it. It was an overblown misunderstanding.

*** My headcanon is that the Horcruxes especially effect redheads.

Ginny, Dumbledore, and Ron.

On a serious note, he's actually a good friend to Harry.
