what if the kid was less stupid and after coming out of Gringotts's thing "hey I got a hella dough" and says "yo mistah haggraid my man are there any other institutions of magical though brother" and hagrid says" well 'arry there are a few bu' Hogwarts tha' bes'." then harry says " I know I know but my situation is dire and about other schools I wish to inquire. you see about other schools I don't know so how am I to really know where I am to go. I don't wish to visit another nation looking like a foolish squire. I have wealth so there will be much I have to know." and hagrid says "what." so harry continues like "dude it'll be a weight off my chest knowing that I weighed my options"...

I don't know something like that you got my point.
