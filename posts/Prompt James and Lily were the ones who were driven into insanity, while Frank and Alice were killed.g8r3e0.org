What happened to Sirius? Did Death Eaters capture and torture him for information? Is he in St. Mungo's himself? That's for you to decide.

Is Harry still Boy Who Lived, or is Neville? Again that's up to you.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
