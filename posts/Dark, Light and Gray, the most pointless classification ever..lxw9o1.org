So many fics have factions in the Wizengamot. Most often Light, Dark and Gray. Usually it means Dumbledore supporters, Death Eaters and Greengrasses. Furthermore, the stance of those families is usually absolute with no dissension present. People don't behave that way. Teenagers rebel against their parent and more often than not are politically opposed (in real life, of course). There is constant change and I just hate how in fics there are actual blocks of families that do politics.

Yes, I know the Wizengamot is not a parliament in canon... and yes I know that JKR's world building was flawed as f u c k. But I'm strictly talking about fanfiction tropes here and the way they perverted the very interesting idea of the Wizengamot.

Why should a family be Dark or Light or Gray? What does that even mean in a world where spells are commonplace and you can live in a post scarcity society?

I just really dislike this trope.

In the modern world. In the past children were dependent on their parents to receive an inheritance or provide access to jobs, either in the family business or via patron-client relationships or pay for apprenticeships. So rebelling was a lot more costly.

There were definitely historical Whig and Tory dynasties in England before the twentieth century.

A lot of fics derive politics from business interests e.g. The Greengrass family's business relies on contact with Muggles so they oppose Voldemort. If the family business is going to be your livelihood then it would make sense to align yourself with the politics which protect it, which would also be your parent's politics.

**** I think that's the thing -- there isn't really any sort of purely political divide, based on "normal" issues like whether to collect a tax to fix cobble-holes in Diagon Alley, or provide assistance to people who need help with food & housing. Instead all that exists is a moral divide, dark=evil/illegal/unforgivable, and light=inclusive/goody-goody/anti-"dark." Can we call them the anitda? I like it.

I'm not even that into politics, but I would love to read a story that included a society that had realistic political differences and was divided on more than just whether they think that muggleborns don't deserve standing in society or whether blood magic should always be illegal.

It's such a good point about kids often having differing political opinions than our parents, that I never thought about before in relation to the wizarding world. I suppose the wizarding world is thought of as so archaic that kids just don't do that for fear of getting disowned or shunned in society or whatever, but when one of the HP kids goes against their parents it's as if it's practically unheard of and a HUGE scandal, which is just not realistic.

People largely don't have the capacity to think in terms that affect wide breadths of the political/social/economic spectrum; so best to just choose my "guy" or "gal" based on whether they stand with my views on X issue. It's simple. Not easy, but simple.

It's also why some political movements are so easily co-opted by their enemies. The more complex the idea, and so the solution to whatever problem, the easier it is to boil it all down to talking points and paint the movement as farcical. Complexity is nuance the masses can't speak about, but inherently understand.

Edit: People /know/ there is inherently a problem with income inequality, for example, but the solutions to such a problem are complicated and nuanced, so they get boiled down to nonsense in the political realm and nothing actually gets done to solve it, especially when you have weak leadership on either side of the spectrum.

**** See, that's the rub with the DLG (Dark, Light, and Gray) system: Its definition varies depending on (the quality of the) writer.

In bad fics, the "Dark" faction is exactly as [[/u/muleGwent][u/muleGwent]] says; they're glorified thugs, either Death Eaters or Umbridge clones, and they're super bad apples, mustache-twirlers with zero redeeming qualities.

In decent fics, the Dark faction is a unified, slavishly loyal bloc bound by either a desire for dark magic legalization, magical Conservatism, purebloodedness, and/or muggle/xenophobia. Not all members are bad, as certain members (typically named ones), can be "redeemed" in these fics from their Dark ways, but the philosophies they hold lack redeeming qualities.

In great fics, the Dark faction is not a bloc but a group of (usually) likeminded individuals, each with their own characterizations and goals. They are never saints, sure, but they are rational, self-interested, and even "good" if evaluated under their own morality system. They might, for example, only be Dark for monetary reasons (purebloods have money), due to fear (of Voldemort), or simply because they see no need to fix what isn't (to them) broken. Heck, they might even be idealists crusading against what how the Muggleborns seek to destabilize magical culture, acting to make sure their children have a safe and happy world to grow up in.\\

**** In some of the fics I read, those classifications aren't about some sort of good and evil, or stance on muggles. They rather separate the wizarding worlds based on types of magic. In one fic dark families are oriented with dark magic, which was synonymous with rituals and more traditional magics, while the light side focused more on spell casting. In another fanfic people born to dark families, or had a dark core generally had more powerful magics, but they were much less fine tuned.

To add to this, the concept of "teenager" is a modern one. It's a marketing term for companies to build malls and hangout spots to feed money from adults to their not-quite-adult children to spend stupidly.

I think the term "teenager" didn't even appear in the English language until the early 20th century. So after the industrial revolution.

In the old world, in the world of farming and hunting and gathering, you're either a child or an adult, based on your capabilities. "You've succeeded on your first hunt" sort of thing. Some of these traditions have carried over to the modern world in forms of celebration of birthdays, but really, in the old world, it was your first X milestone that marked adulthood and you were expected to learn what it meant to be a responsible member of your tribe from thereon out.

*** They often don't use those labels, in many fics they instead call themselves purebloods and say the light are blood traitors. This makes them seem like "honorable defenders of tradition" while the blood traitors label makes them look like... Well, traitors.

But you're right, if they did use the dark label there would have to be a good reason for it or else it's just making them look bad. Maybe that the word dark has a better connotation in the wizarding world than in ours. I'll often see the defence in dark!Harry fics where dark magic "isn't actually evil it's the user who makes it evil" (despite dark magic literally being designed to create suffering and death and tear apart souls, but fanfic is able to change canon so... Fair enough). Or as a rebellious way of embracing the hatred that had bogged them down for centuries. Irl some disadvantaged groups will embrace the slurs that had defined them as a way of reclaiming power (e.g. the n word).

And yeah in a lot of fics the "Dark" side doesn't self-identify as such, but in some they do without any explanation of why they accept this label from the "Light" side, which messes with my suspension of disbelief.

In fact an easy explanation would be the one I gave as an example: the "Dark" side wants to keep magic hidden from even muggleborns (perhaps) while the Light side wants to either bring the muggleborns into the light, or bring the knowledge of magic into the light for muggleborns (and therefore their families) to see. I've never seen this done though.

Is it, though? We could probably debate real life examples, but as far as the HP Canon world goes, they pretty explicitly consider Muggles worth less than wizards (which, to be fair, if you reduce worth to "magic", they are -- but of course the entire theme of the books is choices, not abilities ...) and are happy with that.

Not canon, but something which I prefer and which I use in my head. I still dislike considerably the term Light wizards (or Gray), and the types of Dark Wizards as you describe them.

But I have a question.

Do you have a suggestion for an alternative name which can define a group that are essentially a secret brotherhood. Not dedicated to evil, but who differ politically, socially, and even their connection to magic?

I believe Victoria Potter touches on this with Deep Magic. But every name I come up with sounds stupid. Dark Brotherhood, repurpose Knight of Walpurgas etc. and if I simply use Dark Wizard (in the Out of the Night sense) then naturally this can bring unwanted baggage.

*** I wanted someone to mention Raining Ink fic, since it's one of my favourites.

Her definition of Dark wizards flies against canon, but it's the best one we had so far. It has it flaws. Since the irrational hatred of all things Dark in that fic is kind of strange, by the Light wizards I mean... But it was so well written I'm willing to forget the author for that.

However, even in that fic, the author was smart enough to understand that it should be a super secret club. It's actually one of the most important plot points, that nobody knows who is a Dark wizard. It's anathema, it's a literal death sentence. Nobody calls themselves Dark in society. Ever.

Which is kind of a strange way to reinforcing my point, but not really. Since Raining Inks version of Dark wizards was not synonymous with the overwhelming fanon version of pureblood supremacists who want to murder muggleborns, muggles and every other magical race. JKR really went ham on the Nazi similarities (even if her understanding was flawed as hell).

The only way I can see political parties work in a world where Fudge was Minister of Magic and Dumbledore a Chief Warlock is for some people to want more integration for muggleborns (conservatives) and those who want them to be left alone and find their own path (progressives). I don't really have a name for either party so far, or even agree they should exist, but they probably would. Canon really doesn't make much sense in these matters, especially with the cartoonish portrayal under Voldemort's regime, which was ostensibly status quo, but brutalised people left and right.

To summarise. I don't think anyone would want to be classified as Dark, but if they were truly of that leaning they would try to hide under a veil of propriety and goodness.

*** While I could accept that there is a partisan divide in the Wizarding World, I can't accept such a clear distinction. Dark in fanon usually means practising Dark Magic, casting Unforgivables and generally being racist as fuck. Nobody wants to be called that, ever. I can see that being the case in 1600s but not when a half-blood is the Chief Warlock and muggleborns are accepted everywhere. It's just bad politics and totally stupid.

Again, talking about fanon here.

As for canon, even Lucius Malfoy tried to present himself as a moderate, compassionate wizard. His interaction with Arthur Weasley points to that. He insinuated, taunted, but as a Voldemort's chief supporter never dared to be obvious about his political views. The whole Dark, Light and Gray thing is just poor writing on behalf of fanfiction authors. In my opinion at least.

It has nothing to do with real world politics, or at least is a simplistic reduction of such.

**** ... I'm not sure this makes sense. Or I'm misunderstanding your argument. You are presenting a definition for "Dark" using your external standard, apply that to in-story reasoning, assume some secondary motivations and expected behaviour, and then wonder why it creates contradictions?

It's only the most immediate problem that /if/ the world in the story were as you describe it, muggleborns /wouldn't/ be accepted everywhere. More fundamental would be asking where the assumption that no one wants to be called "racist" comes from, why they /would/ be called racist, and how that would influence their behaviour anyway. In /Canon/, Malfoy is commonly known to be discriminating against Muggleborns. Arthur literally tells him that: "We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard." And Malfoy:

#+begin_quote
  “Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. “The company you keep, Weasley... and I thought your family could sink no lower---”
#+end_quote

That's as subtle as a ton of bricks. And the reason he's not afraid to go there, by the way, is that /in Canon/, the outlier view is Arthur. All relevant people are biased against Muggleborns, which is what Dumbledore tells Fudge in GoF:

#+begin_quote
  You place too much importance, and you always have done, on the so called purity of blood!
#+end_quote

And he's just one example. The point being, even in Canon I don't think your argument works. The wizarding world isn't a nice place, and this is basis from which the stories you talk about extrapolate: Instead of showing the side of (e.g.) Dumbledore, they take /that world/, and show the side of Malfoy.

Honestly, the biggest problem I have with those stories, e.g. Sarcasm & Slytherin, is that the "Light" side is incompetent, and their behaviour unmotivated. They ban certain magic because ... because, fight for their opinions ... because and nothing makes sense and you wonder why half the world (the light half) is so dumb.

And that most FF writers can't write politics is of course true, but I don't think that in particular is the reason for the Dark/Light thing you are talking about.

***** While you raise some good points about canon, I think you miss the point. Half-bloods and muggleborns are everywhere in canon JKR made (as of 1991-1996). Lucius is a racist asshole but he is the outlier, not as you said Arthur Weasley. Arthut is a renowned Ministry of Magic employee who makes laws. We know from DH that there are many employees of the MoM that are either muggleborn or married to one. Lucius Malfoy in canon is no-one. He is only part of the Board of Governors ( and friends with Fudge, that's all. He is in no position of power.

My main issue was with fanon and the reduction of the divides in Wizarding society to meaningless labels. Dark, Light and Gray are an immensely stupid reduction by lazy fanfiction authors, that was my main point. Even if I didn't raise all of my points in the original post, I tried to expand it in the comments.

****** Arthur's office is basically a broom cupboard, and his job is considered a joke or unimportant. (Before his promotion.) Lucius Malfoy, on the other hand, has Fudge in his pocket -- he bribes him --, and is otherwise a notable figure in the wizarding world (before his Azkaban stint), as he gets to comment on issues in the Daily Prophet and is recognised on sight and by name.

Furthermore, Muggleborns exist in the Wizarding World, indeed, and that's pretty much it. There was one Muggleborn Minister of Magic since ever, and he was subsequently poisoned by Abraxas Malfoy in the '60s. (Of course nothing was ever proven.) And the one Muggleborn Department Head, a highly skilled wizard able to do probably any job, got the joke department of Goblin Liaison. The general view of Muggleborns, in turn, appears to be Slughorn's 'Oh no, I'm not prejudiced. I recognise talent. I'm just surprised a Muggleborn is this talented.' I suppose that's one step up from 'I can't be racist, my gardener is black.'

 

But yes, your point was with Fanon. I'm just trying to figure out if our different views of Canon might be a reason why I'm not sure I understand your point?

If it's just about the /names/ Dark/Light/Grey, others have pointed out you might as well call them Progressives, Conservatives and Neutrals, and a lot of stories do, sometimes they even do both. If it's about the bipartition as such, though, I don't see this as illogical. Such a thing is quite common, dating all the way back to the Roman Republic, since it's exactly what happens if you have a highly polarising issue /and/ make that issue a central issue in politics (with the Romans, it was land (re-)distribution for veterans, and lead to civil war). This would be true for both the issues "Muggleborns" and "Dark Magic".

And as for political platforms, if your point is /no one would campaign or rally around 'let's be more excluding'/, I refer to real life as well as what I wrote above, plus adding that Voldemort succesfully perfomed a coup and installed a Minister that managed to go literal Nazi for an entire year without any hassle, until Harry decided it was time for a counter-revolution. Without him, Thicknesse would still be Minister.

What I would say, however, is that the splits might be off. If you had those two blocks plus centre, the Conservatives/Dark faction would probably on the lower end of 1/3. We know 20% are Muggleborns, and Purebloods and Halfbloods 40% each. If there /was/ a fair representation, I'd expect the Conservatives at perhaps 20%. Depending on how radical the Progressive agenda was, and how much Dumbledore could leverage his celebrity status, they, in turn, might exceed 20%, perhaps up to 40%? But that would leave the remaining, Neutral 40% with a quite conservative tilt -- not quite going on "kill all blood-traitors!"-rants, but enough to consider the merits of Draco's "I really don't think they should let the other sort in..." as a serious option (even if it were in the end rejected).

Or that's my best guess, for a generic Wizengamot setup, anyway.

But for some reason, we never see much of it coming from Malfoy. Lucius says to look favorable to Harry, but as he is introduced while mistreating the Weasleys, it seems obvious that he is a villain.

Draco is even worse, as he insults Ron within the first five seconds of seeing him and then insults Hermione for being a muggle born while wishing them all to die. Of course, he was a spoiled 11-year-old brat who didn't realize the potential to manipulate people, but still.

There are some items that magic cannot create: we know that food can't be created from nothing, for instance, and it follows that certain potion ingredients can't be conjured either. Furthermore, several items require expertise to create - wands and the like. A post-scarcity society is one such as the Culture in Iain M Banks' novels, where none of these constraints apply.

** I don't necessarily hate it. Yeah, it may seem like the "dark side" are automatically calling themselves the bad guys and Voldemort supporters, but if it's well done, it can be a make for a pretty interesting fics. For example, I don't think it'd be stupid if the political system of the wizarding world was structured like this:

The dark, light and gray aren't clear cut, it's not like a family has some kind of label declaring them light, dark or gray, or that a group of families would proudly call themselves "Dark Side" like some political party. Rather, dark, light or gray would be determined through... their usual behaviour. People know what they are like, and they are therefore considered a part of a faction. But it's nothing official and in many cases not clear. For example, a family could be borderline dark. They support legalising more dark magic, but are pro-Muggle. Etc etc.

Fact is, in canon we are presented very little of the political system of the wizarding world and of magic for that matter. The books are written from the perspective of a teenage wizard who didn't even grow up in the wizarding world, so he's learning about it alongside us, the readers. It's up to the fic authors to change or expand on things. In the books, if someone is dark wizard, they are evil... that's it. But what if there was more to dark magic than simply kicking puppies and throwing around crucios like candy? We haven't seen that many different kinds of dark arts, after all. It's all about the unforgivables, horcruxes, a few other spells, and that's it. And then dark creatures, of course. But there has to be more to the dark arts than that. Perhaps it could be used for other stuff, too. And if so, there might be "gray" families that want to legalise all magic and judge people based on their actions, rather than the alignment of their spells.

Tl;dr dark, light and gray can be cool if done well.

In fics where L/D/G is an individual classification, I've seen it be used as an indicator as to what members of the family normally is (typically for these fics Light = Control, Dark = Power, grey either doesn't exist or is for inconsistent families).

Fallen Jedi have to be taken on a case by case basis, and Dooku just hadn't been doing it for long enough or was perhaps a bit resistant.

Also, Harry and Co. are fighting a war so a lot of the talk about dark and light families is part of the covert intelligence gathering and sharing.

In the real world there would be different sets of groups based on blood purity, wealth division, educational matters, progress, religous matters, secrecy policy, tactics, muggle treatment, etc. etc. the list goes on and on!

In many fanfics everyone in the dark camp believes in blood purity, a strict class system, a biased and dark arts educational system, no progress or change in anything (whether that be spells, science, culture, etc.), paganism, coming to power via terrorism, and (depending on the fic) either total secrecy or an end to secrecy as wizards take over the world and crush the muggles.

In real life, those in the dark camp would have varying stances on all these issues. Some might want to have complete blood purity, others would only want purebloods to be the ruling class. Some might believe war is the way to power while others would want to go through the government. Some might cling to tradition while others accept and even encourage innovation.

In real life, people who might agree with one thing may not agree with another. Social issues have never been clean and easy. But I know this nuance is often simplified to make writing easier, so it's okay.

Even post-scarcity societies would have different views on certain aspects of their culture.

It would make sense for people to use the other terms as simplifications, though it's much more probable most people would see it as only having two options, placing those that were "on the fence" with those they had more of a leaning with.

On Pottermore JKR has said the Wizengamot is Legislative too, IIRC, it also can make well-written political fics more interesting.

** My problem with the whole thing is mostly that it's portrayed as actually functional. Like, no. That sort of government system will create feudalism. Without representation, the vast majority of people will be oppressed peasants while the people on the gamot will be rich lords.

And it's not like in these fics the authority of the families is limited in any way. Nah, you can just create a law, drag some guy in and then sentence him to death for breaking that law you just invented. Boy, that sort of power never has a good ending.

People like to romanticize elitism and nobility as this thing to aspire to without realizing that it /fucking sucked/ if you weren't a noble or even if you weren't raised as one. All those stories about harry suddenly gaining respect and authority? Nah. The gamot would turn on him, strip him of his titles and wealth and then he'd be made the slave of someone. Because that's how these systems work.

You can either have parties and factions or you can have ancestral seats and pureblood nobility. To write some false, idealized version of a feudal system is pretty disingenuous.

** I dislike this trope when it isn't explained... or isn't explained well.

It's generally the same as being a conservative or liberal, right, left, or center.

However, when you throw magic into the mix, it isn't just about being conservative or liberal, it is about the types of magic that are performed.

The invention of the wand was the start of modernizing wizardry. A lot of fics will touch on the idea that witchcraft and wizardry are two different things, not gender separations. Witchcraft was magics that did not use a wand and wizardry was ones that did. Historically, there were more women who practiced witchcraft, and more men practicing wizardry.

Though before the invention of the wand, there was no separation, and everything was performed without a wand. In more modern times, the older methods of performing magic began to be looked upon as archaic. Since early magic involved blood, bone, and sacrifices, many types of magic without a wand began being looked at as dark. So traditionalists and conservatives began being associated with Dark, while progressives declared themselves Light.

Many rituals would be based on the seasons and the positions of the stars. That is most likely the reason why Astronomy is taught at Hogwarts as a core class, despite it being next to useless as none of the supporting magics are no longer taught as they are probably considered by the current political atmosphere to be 'Dark.' I would imagine that the only reason why Potions is still taught is because of the usefulness of the products for day to day life or they wouldn't be harvesting dead animals to be mixed and ingested, inhaled, or used as topical creams on their bodies.

Labeling someone as Dark is just a way of silencing their views, however after continuous use it got labeled as a political faction because those that were labeled as such to try to be silenced banded together to form a voting bloc to counter those trying to do the silencing

** Dark/Light/Gray is relevant in the Wizengamot because your family's political affiliation will affect your decision on the Wizengamot. And while it is possible for a child to be of a different political affiliation, it is very unlikely in Pureblood society.

** I gotta be honest, if having classifications like dark gray and light bothers you, don't read those fics.

Really, this sounds like a topic to bitch about just for the sake of bitching about something. There are other things in canon and fanfiction that deserve discussion far more than light vs dark

** imo i think political parties would probably be phonetic pronunciations of a acronym or like... name of a historical leader of that party don't think they'd call their parties « tories » or anything bc their political history is completely different since the statute of secrecy, and they haven't had an industrial revolution

** I'd rather say dark, light, and neutral for different political views. But then there's Dark, Light, and Grey for "magic classification." Like a genetic way your magic swings or whatever. Like you're better at that type of magic over others. And Dark magic is just a different type of magic. Like how some people are better at Charms while others are better at Transfiguration. Some people are better at Dark magic, some Light, and then there's Grey magic which is strictly neither light nor dark but also both.

For my own headcanon (which I don't always use), when you join the Wizengamot (like when your parents step down) and you're inducted, you get to choose whether or not you're conservative, neutral, or liberal (is that the right word?). And you can change this at any time.

** The most annoying one to me is the ones trying to be "deep" about the color gray. It's literally light black or dark white, depending on the shade. Not a "centrist" place to be.

Also, the Harry in those fics would make canon Voldemort blush.

** Honestly yeah I agree with this. Dark wizards should be just that, wizards who use dark (illegal) magic and the politics should be party politics at this point. HP seems more like evoking 19th century but the family faction style is like Roman Republic era.

** u/Sescquatch:
#+begin_quote
  Why should a family be Dark or Light or Gray?
#+end_quote

I mean, if you're arguing FF, why /shouldn't/ they? Obviously because you dislike it, which is fair enough, but if you're already changing everything when writing FF, you surely can come up any kind of reason to make such a classification necessary. So maybe this is a literal thing, and Light and Dark families use fundamentally different kinds of magic. And maybe magic warps their minds such that they wouldn't even consider anything else.

You get what I mean? Without Canon as the baseline, there's all sorts of stuff you can make up to make it logically consistent within the story, and that's all you need to do. So it's hard to argue about this.

On a more tangential note, I disagree that offspring is "more often than not are politically opposed". Historically, this just doesn't work out. Societies with strict, hierarchical social classes can be quite stable (think e.g. Regency England), and this is the same as saying people become what they were born to be. So if you are writing that kind of society (which vaguely appears to be what those FF attempt), then Sirius will be the exception, and children following in their parents' footsteps the norm.

And as far a families doing politics in blocks, this has been a thing already in Ancient Roman times.

** I don't dislike the trope. There are plenty of interesting things you can do with it if you're creative (if they are that way, think about why they are, and what consequences would arise from them being so). But I do admit there are easier ways to do interesting things with other ideas. And there are so many other ideas to play around with.

Like, we know bugger all about the Wizengamot. It's literally just a group of old people sitting in a room who turned up to Harry's trial that one time (slight hyperbole). You can make up most anything and it'll fit with them - are they meritocrats? Are they judges? Is this a military junta of ex-aurors and magical badasses? Are they all hereditary nobles? Did they pull a wand out of a stone to become +Kings/Queens of England+Members of the Wizengamot? Do they meet regularly, or only when something happens? Do they regulate or pass laws, or do they only mediate things?

Plenty of potential to play with. :)
