** "There will come a time, Miss Granger, where a villain will present you with the choice of turning to the Dark Arts."

"Why?" The 13 year old girl asked.

"It happens to the best of us eventually. And I have no doubt you will be among the best should you survive."

Hermione gave him a beady stare. "And Harry?"

Dumbledore laughed. "Oh no, don't you worry about that. Tom already tried and failed, mainly because the offer wasn't an entirely serious one. No, you still have yet to be offered such a thing and, well, it gets harder to refuse the older you get."

The girl raised an eyebrow. "By that logic, isn't it almost impossible for you to refuse?"

"Exactly. Which is why there isn't a man alive who knows what I really want." Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eyes. "Which brings me to the crux of things- you would do well to remember that whatever they're offering you, it's a scam."

Hermione glared at him, unimpressed. "I figured that out, thank you."

"You may have, but Dark Wizards have the uncanny ability to get in your head when you least expect them to. Which is why you must learn the two most powerful words in magic."

"Avada Kedavra?" She asked.

Dumbledore flinched. "0h right, ha. No. The two most powerful words in your arsenal are 'fuck it.'"

Hermione goggled. "Excuse me?"

"Fuck it." Dumbledore repeated. "There is no way this ends well, the chances of you getting what you want are virtually nil and the consequences are incalculable. So fuck it. Don't fall prey to temptation, don't try and reason with your Dark Lord ex-boyfriend, don't bother hunting for fairy tales that are explicitly known for being super cursed, just... Don't. Fuck it. Let a hero deal with that. It's why they exist."

Hermione just stared at him.

"So... Any questions?" Dumbledore asked.

Hermione nodded her head.

"But you need time to process."

Hermione nodded.

Dumbledore sighed. "Go on, then. Though I'd caution against mentioning any of this to Harry... Well, fuck it. You're going to need companions down whichever road you choose anyway. Run along now!"

*3 years later*

"What happened to 'fuck it'?" Hermione asked, gesturing at his skeletal arm.

Dumbledore shrugged. "Eh. Fuck it." He answered.

** I like the prompt except for the “Lord” part, the idea of there being something like light lords has always been synonomous with cringy fanfics to me.

** Sounds kind of like the plot of [[https://sshgreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/sgcbearcub-spellcaster.pdf][Sanctuary by sgcbearcub]] where Dumbledore sets her up to be the next Lord of Light with a reliance on muggle scientific thought, etc. Etc.

Should note that this is Hermione/Snape because of a marriage law, but there's not really much romance. It circles back to the plot- she marries Snape for revenge and because they think he might have something that they need.

*** It usually isn't treated as a bad thing.

Exception: a story where light is not good and the dark are the just misunderstood.

*** In my personal, subjective opinion, a "Light Lord" is a bad thing not through itself, but because of what it takes to make one, same as 'Hero" and "Messiah".

To make a Hero, there must be disaster.

To make a Messiah, many must be facing damnation.

To make a Light Lord, people would need to lose the Gift of Eden, be lost, undecided, herds of sheep unable to determine their path, trying to lay their burdens and moral dilemmas on the back of one individual to then follow.

Of course, this is assuming that "Light is Good", and thus a Light Lord/Lady will not make a bid for power unneeded - that is what we can a Dark Lord XD

​

TLDR: I hate the idea of a Saint, because the opportunity for saintly deeds is an evidence of a fucked up world and/or bad writing.
