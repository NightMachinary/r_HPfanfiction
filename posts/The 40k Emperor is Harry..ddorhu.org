***** He's not a heretic. They're saying you are. He is the God-Emperor of Mankind. From warhammer 40k, a tabletop scifi rpg.

******* Him calling you a heretic is a reference to the fact that the worshipers of the God-Emperor tend to be fairly dogmatic and declare anyone who doesn't agree with them a heretic. The Inquisition is one of the most powerful political organizations in the Imperium and has a tendency to destroy entire planets if they think there are too many heretics.

** I would not read it. From the info you posted it would be a massive copy paste of the books but with a bigger healthier Harry when that fact would change everything even before Hogwarts.

Then as if that was not enough you have him acting the same when his earlier life is very different.
