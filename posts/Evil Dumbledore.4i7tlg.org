Yes, I know evil Dumbledore is not canon, but I still like reading these fics.

I have already read Athey's works and that fic where Harry gets raised by the Flamels.


** Linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind) arguably has an evil Dumbledore

*** I finished a reread yesterday. It seems abandoned and it's a bit wordy sometimes, but the manipulative!Dumbledore is exquisite and I honestly could believe this being a better, more mature version of what could really happen in canon.

  Minor events can have repercussions far beyond their size and importance. When one of these minor events occurs to a ten year-old Harry Potter he finds his world turned upside-down and it starts him down a very different path than the one he expected to follow.

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny
