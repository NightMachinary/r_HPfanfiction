I'm a terrible writer. It's true. I am, however, a pretty good storyteller (that's what my D&D groups tell me). To the actual title

One of the issues I see with retellings of the Harry Potter series is that the change is made early, and we the reader are forced to watch every little change by reading through book 1-7. The next problem is that we get to book two or three and Harry is OP and a master politician. I don't really like these. The first tends to result in unfinished stories, the second results in boring or unpalatable stories. Here is my suggestion:

The story starts in 5th year. The major change is that Dumbledore has worked to ensure that Harry is safe and happy.\\
In book 1, while Harry was doing classes.

Book 2, not much happens and Ginny does not get the diary (so none of that plot happens).

Book 3, Sirius Black escapes and Dumbledore is worried that he is coming for Harry and thus works to capture him. Of course, Auror's and a few dementors are placed at the school (Harry learns the Patronus from Lupin). Dumbledore ends up finding Sirius and learning the truth. He is able to prove his innocence and Sirius goes from being a crazed killer to media darling. He and Harry reunite and Harry gets his father figure.

Book 4, Harry begins to have visions and begins to learn occulemency. Nothing else happens of significance.

The actual words of the story start in book 5. Professor Quirril is DADA and the Stone is at Hogwarts. Quirril teams up with Crouch jr and together they plant the diary on a student and get the Basilisk released. This is while Quirril is working to get the stone. The climax of the book has Harry face the basilisk and then run the gauntlet to face Quirrilmort.

Book 6 is the Triwizard Cup. Harry competes legally (it did not occur the previous year).

Book 7 has Harry and Dumbledore teaming up to destroy the horcruxs. By the end of the year Dumbledore is dying from a magical poison. In order to safeguard Hogwarts from the resurgent Voldemort, Dumbledore hires Harry as the DADA.

Next book is Professor Potter battling the dark forces of Voldemort. The story has a lot of set piece battles and really cool magic. The climax has Harry and Voldemort facing off, alone.

Some notable items:

-I envisioned the story being a light Harry/Daphne to play up the house unity/not all slytherins angle. (this isn't mandatory, but I'm a shipper)

-There were probably more teachers, because the low number doesn't make sense

-Lockheart is the history teacher (and he's pretty good at it) (yes this is an idea that was dropped by AlfheimWanderer in the Matou Shinji series)

-There is a longterm dueling club. Harry is in it every year as is Theo Nott. The two have this rivalry, with Nott slipping further to darkness. I saw a moment where the two of them are talking and Harry sees the gravity of the moment where he could save Nott, but doesn't have the right words to stop it

-Ron is actually pretty good at Divination. We learn later on that his skill with strategy (and chess) is due to Ron having a limited Prescient ability.

-Harry takes runes, which he incorporates into his combat style (boots marked with speed runes, jacket marked with protection runes). He thinks he's the only one that does this until he gets messed up by Antonin Dolohov.

That's it. The bare bones of my idea. Please, steal it and write a better version.


** A lot of fanfics tend to follow the original order of things, which isn't a problem, but rearranging can often lend itself to unique juxtapositions. This particular order has potential.

** I personally love canon rewrites with whatever slight changes to see the new outcomes. Sounds cool but to me, I also don't like stories that randomly start in the middle, ie year 5, I'd rather see it all unfold naturally.

*** I mean, I get it. The thing I also know is that all my favorite canon rewrites lost steam around 3rd year.

**** For real, all the good rewrites seem to lose steam; I've seen a couple go all the way but too many stopped. I still hold out hope for em tho

** That is the memory that would have come from the horcrux not a vision which would require voldermort to be alive

*** How did Book 4 start? The book opens with Harry in a dream seeing Frank Bryce, the Muggle groundskeeper for the Riddle House, being killed by Lord Voldemort. Harry is awoken by his hurting scar. He then sends a letter to Sirius about the dream.

Thanks for the input though.
