"No, thank you."

** I have a question. Doesn't Killing someone means to best them? And voldie did kill Harry (he survived because of deathly hallow thingies but still he was bested), so why didn't elder wand change allegiance? If expillarmus and physically grabbing changes allegiance then avada should too (voldie killed snapey for that reason alone). Or am I missing something?

*** Killing someone doesn't necessarily mean besting them. Harry willingly went into the forest with the intention of allowing Voldemort to kill him, and in doing so bring about Voldemort's death. Thus there is no way whatsoever that it can be counted as Voldemort besting him.

That was also the entire reason Dumbledore wanted Snape to kill him. If he had died on his own terms without ever being bested, the Elder Wand would have lost it's power altogether. (Or at least, that's what he theorised. He could have been wrong) Of course Draco messed that up, but it ended up working out better than expected so it's all fine.

*** Not truly. I believe that The Elder Wandâ„¢ is a twisted artefact, such that to gain its allegiance the owner must not want to part with it or if the owner wants to lose it in some meaningful way, the plan will go wrong such that someone else will become the owner. You cannot want the wand to change allegiance to someone who you want to gain its ownership, because then you would have never been bested in that way.[My Head Cannon] So! When Harry went to die, he accepted his death and became the master of death for a short whole when he gained the resurrection stone, allowing him to live in exchange for voldies horcrux. Hence voldie did not gain the allegiance of the wand as he hadn't really bested harry.

*** Yes, that part doesn't make a lot of sense. We could say that since Harry was already considered Master of Death at that point, the previous Hallows rules no longer apply to him, although it is only a personal hypothesis. Only reason may be that we do not fully understand how the Elder's Wand works, so perhaps, although in most cases death counts as "defeat", what happens if the murdered person is resurrected? Not to mention, contradictions have been seen in the Wand's behavior, like when Grindelwald is defeated in Fantastic Beasts, but in the next movie he uses the Wand as if nothing had happened. (If you do want to assume that the above is something from the history and not a plot hole).
