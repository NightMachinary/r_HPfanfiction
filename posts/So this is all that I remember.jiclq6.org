:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
... Harry goes on a date with someone that works at a clothes store but it can't last because she's a muggle... Later on he talks about it briefly to Hermione and (I think) Ginny. What's the fic?.... I'll probably remember scenes of you tell them to me but currently that's it.


** I think this could be the one you are looking for. There is a scene that's kinda like the one you mentioned. I'm not sure though

  It's the summer before Harry's 6th year, and Harry is wracked with grief. But what happens when Harry makes a vow to himself to take control of his life? Harry's life takes a sharp turn when he gets an unexpected visitor one night. HPGW Independent!Harry

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.
