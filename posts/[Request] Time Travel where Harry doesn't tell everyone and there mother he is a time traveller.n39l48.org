** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God, Not Again]], Harry uses the "My scar has prophetic abilities" for most of his future-knowledge.

When he does admit to being a time traveler, he claims it was "A drapery accident. Very traumatic."

** This bugged me so much about the Lone Traveler stories. I swear it was Harry's mission in life to tell every single person he met he was a time traveler. And yet somehow nobody knew who he was?

*** I was just re-reading the Lone Traveler series, and as far as I can see people do recognize him by don't believe it, and he tends to tell them his name so he is taken more seriously, afaik... I might be wrong, but oh well

** linkffn(the second string by eider down) kind of fits but not exactly because of spoilers. It's one of my favorite fics of the past few years.

linkao3(my head is bloody, but unbowed by NorthernRanger) is relatively new/not as popular yet-- he does reluctantly tell a few people eventually. The first story is complete and the author recently published the first chapter of the sequel.

*** /My head is bloody, but unbowed/ is soooo good. I haven't seen anyone rec it before but I found it when it had about 3 chapters written and it's one of those stories where you're hanging on for every chapter.

  Once again, she lifted the spell, and the wizard behind him moved forward. He reached down and took hold of Harry's arm, pulling his shaking body up and twisting his arm behind him. “We should take him to the Dark Lord,” he said, and Harry's heart beat wildly. Voldemort was dead. The war had ended. What was going on?

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.
