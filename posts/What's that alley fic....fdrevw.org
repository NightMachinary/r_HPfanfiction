:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry inherits some storefront property on Diagon / Knockturn Alley, and is basically the landlord for a lot of the shops. He tries to get people to go down Knockturn more often, offering his renters incentives to relocate from Diagon to Knockturn (to drive businesses down). He definitely got Ollivander to agree (contingent on others). Definitely got Quality Quidditch to move (and gave it two entrances, one on each alley). Also remember him planting plants along Knockturn, fixing the lamps / lights.

Might be confusing this with another fic, but he possibly discovers that he owns the land the only orphanage uses. Its super rundown and hasn't been maintained in a long time, so he fixes it up for the matron there (building it with a library, and plants everywhere, with funds for Christmas gifts and proper clothes for all the orphans - people donated children's / educational books to fill the library.). I thiiiiiiink Justin Finch Fletchley or some other Hogwarts student lives there (orphaned and slightly bitter at first). Snape also visits to help out the matron because he used to stay there at times when he was younger. He visits yearly to maintain the wards / fix the roof.

Potentially even painting some storefronts. One store he repaints is a sweet shop, possibly across the street from the orphanage. He ends up selling sweets for the hag who runs it, cleaning up her shop cause its pretty grimy too. (that poor orphan friend also ends up working there, as an assistant for the store owner).

Some involvement from goblin account manager and estate lawyers. Seeking emancipation so he has to prove he can be responsible with money and take care of himself. He doesn't have access to the estate because, obviously, Dumbledore has restricted his access as his magical guardian (don't think it involved any *shudder* Dumbledore!stealing though). He can't access the vaults, but he can control the money that goes into it, so that's what he does to fund his revitalization of the alleys.

When he first gets to the alley / discovers he has money, he goes to his family's lawyer but the receptionist kicks him out / denies him an appointment because of his clothes / she was super judgy. Ends up with a less expensive Knockturn Alley lawyer, potentially in offices close by to the orphanage. Doesn't stay his lawyer forever, but does advise him for a while until he is able to get in touch with his estate's lawyer.

Any of this ringing any bells all put together (I know its tropey, but it was a good read). Pretty sure it wasn't on ffn or ao3. I think it was one of the smaller fanfic sites...


** Found it after some searching. Leaving the post up in case anyone finds the fic interesting and wants to read it. Think its abandoned but still worth it:

*** It bugs me that Justin is the character they decided to use for the Knockturn orphan, when canonically he talks about his mother and is portrayed to be a bit pompous (opposed to the cockney he seems to speak in this fic) but the premise is interesting so I'll reserve judgement for now.

*** I love this stories. It's brilliant, especially Knockturn Alley and also the other alley with the magical creatures. And all the shop owners. And pretty much everything else. I think it's not abandoned but the author has a lot of stories and it takes some time until she updates some of them.
