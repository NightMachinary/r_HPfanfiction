** "Avada Kedavra," Flitwick screams, hitting Lisa Turpin.

"Avada Kedavra," this time he hit Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis.

"Avada Kedavra," he hit Hermione Granger in the face.

"Avada Kedavra," he hit Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott.

"Avada Kedavra," he hit Harry in the face.

As the Great Hall sat in shock at the death of the entire first year class and Flitwick being taken away, Harry sat up giddy, "I met my mum! She was great!"

** I always thought Hufflepuff would be a better house for that

as hufflepuff tends to be about community, I always pictured the claws being sink or swim

*** The whole house bullying Harry, and Sprout kind of encouraging it, doesn't exactly scream great learning environment and I normally love Hufflepuff.

Honestly, if you leave aside Luna getting bullied Flitwick seems by far the best professor & head of house. And I say this as someone who likes most of the professor characters....

Snape: ex-criminal who belonged to a hate group (Dumbledore never goes "gee, I wonder if this will make any muggleborns uncomfortable in his class") who basically bullies children.

Minerva: thinks it is absolutely fine to send a bunch of children in the night into a place called the "Forbidden Forest." Should be looking out for her kids---but does nothing about the fact that Harry is clearly too skinny and wearing rags. Let's kids be ostracized and vastly overreacts with her punishments.

Sprout: the whole GOF mess.

**** You forgot one thing in groups and outgroups

How hufflepuffs treat a puff is different to how they would treat harry who they see as stealing glory and attention from the puffs.

I picture Ravenclaws as being focused in academic matters, but in a keep up or being left behind way they are all highly independent and not prone to teamwork
