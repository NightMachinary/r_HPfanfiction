** Personally, I wouldn't put Ron anywhere but Gryffindor, and I've never read a fic where he is in Hufflepuff. (I do wish that fic where he's a Ravenclaw would update!)

That said, if I WERE writing Ron as a Hufflepuff, I'd base the decision around his innate kindness. He */is/* kind under all of his bluster and dumb comments. The way he shares his family/home with Harry despite his jealousy of Harry's fame and his fear that everyone he loves will love Harry more establishes that. When Harry didn't write to Ron after first year, Ron freaking stole a flying car to bring Harry home. That's the part of Ron I'd tap into to make him a Hufflepuff.

Also, the Hufflepuffs seem to react hard to the belief that they're less-than, which is why they were so fixated on Cedric as their champion. Ron, the Chudley Cannons fan who believes his mother loves him least of all of her children, can identify with that underdog mentality.

Any character can be written as belonging in any house. If that's not the case, you have a very one-dimensional character.

*** I don't think I've ever read Ron sorted into Hufflepuff either, but I have seen Slytherin in a one-shot. Although that was done by a time traveling Harry controlling the Hat.

In fairness, there was a valid reason for the sorting outside of Harry's dickery.

** I'm not entirely sure if "always" is the right word, since I've never rly come across him being a hufflepuff but I do have one theory.

Although the golden trio is in gryffindor, both Harry and Hermione have a lot of traits from another house; Slytherin for Harry and ravenclaw for Hermione. To complete the pattern, people might project hufflepuff traits onto Ron.

*** I mean to be fair Ron is loyal he is the one who says Sirius will have to kill him to get to Harry in book 3 for example. And in book 4 you can even argue that the fight they have is Ron perceives a lack of loyalty from Harry as he thinks Harry didn't tell him how to get to the cup. He's wrong of course but loyalty is a big thing for Ron's characrer.

Hermione id say is most hardworking though. She grinds away at those book and alot of her shows of intelligence are a result of her hard work.

He was really only cunning when he tricked Ron into thinking he drank Felix Felicis. In the other situations, he wasn't very cunning at all (especially since he kind of failed in both). Hermione was much more cunning, since she set Harry up to fall in love with Ginny.

That was Ron's plan, not his.

I think these points reaffirmed that Harry is not very cunning, since Hermione, who's weak point is her cunning, /still/ manages to be more cunning than him. Even Ron shows more cunning than him, since he regularly lies to his teachers too and was the one who made the plan in DH.

Because it's pointed out multiple times in the books that Hermione is not cunning at all. So if Harry's even less cunning than her, that would mean he's not very cunning. It's rather simple logic.

It's resourceful, but I though we were arguing about how cunning he was.

There's a reason why I said "kind of". He either failed in his main objective used a different plan to achieve it. Harry wanted to know what Draco was doing, and he got the memory through other means.

#+end_quote

This conversation actually started when you commented that Harry was cunning and fit into Slytherin and I replied that Ron and Hermione fit Slytherin better, so she is included in this conversation. And even if she wasn't, Ron still probably beats Harry in cunning. Also, she was stated multiple times to be horrible at trying to deceive people.

Okay.

#+end_quote

Being cunning and being manipulative are two different things. Someone who's cunning has to "achieve one's ends by deceit or evasion". Someone who's manipulative has to "influence or attempt to influence the behavior or emotions of others for one's own purposes". Manipulative people can be incompetent all they want, but cunning people actually have to /succeed/. Therefore, Harry was not cunning in those situations.

It was to prove that Harry is not cunning. If a character who is said to be horrible at being cunning is more cunning than Harry, that means Harry is not cunning at all. I'm sorry if it seemed like an attempt to showcase Hermione's skills. I could do the same thing with Ron:

PS: Spurred Hermione into action and won the giant chess game.

CoS: Escaped the Slytherin Common Room and broke Harry out of the Dursleys

etc.

I acknowledge the talents of Harry. He's the best at handling stress, thinks extremely quickly, is very witty, can feel pure emotions in a way that Ron and Hermione can't, etc. The thing is, being cunning isn't one of them. Both of his friends are much more cunning than him, and that's not a bad thing. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Ron isn't any less of a great character for having insecurities, and Hermione isn't a bad person for not handling stress well. Why are you acting like I'm devaluing his character just for pointing that he's not very cunning? I'll admit I don't like his character very much (especially compared to Ron and Hermione), but I still acknowledge that he has his own set of skills.

Also, even JK Rowling said that he doesn't fit into Slytherin at all. According to her, the only reason he almost got sorted there was because he had a horcrux in him.

** I like Ron just how he is, but many people feel the need to make him "better", so they project traits on him that he never really had in abundance compared to others. Ron's defining traits aren't his loyalty, hard work, or patience. It's his Gryffindor traits. He's practically the perfect Gryffindor, so I think people should play to his canon strengths, and not add random ones willy-nilly.

** From the Sorting Hat's 1995 song:

#+begin_quote
  For instance, Slytherin

  Took only pure-blood wizards

  Of great cunning just like him.

  And only those of sharpest mind

  Were taught by Ravenclaw

  While the bravest and the boldest

  Went to daring Gryffindor.

  Good Hufflepuff, *she took the rest*

  and taught them all she knew,

The Hufflepfuff is often considered the "leftovers' House".

Personally, I think that Ron has the best case of the Trio for Slytherin.

** It's part of the "trying to create an all-house group out of four Gryffindors" trope. Hermione is a closet Ravenclaw, Harry is a closet Slytherin, etc.

Quite honestly, out of the Gryffindors, I always thought HARRY was the closet Hufflepuff: he stays loyal to Ron even though Ron is actually a pretty fair-weather friend. Neville is often given the label of closet Hufflepuff, but he faces his self-doubts more directly than the rest of them and is definitely properly sorted into Gryffindor. Ron is ambitious, as proven by his visions from the Mirror of Erised, although he has no intention of actually working to achieve those dreams.

Based on Ron's personality, I have come to the conclusion that Gryffindor, not Hufflepuff, is the true house of leftovers. He's not loyal or hardworking enough for Hufflepuff, not clever or cunning enough for Slytherin, not studious or inquisitive enough for Ravenclaw, so Gryffindor is the only option left. Brashness is enough of a substitute for bravery.

Ron (and Fred and George) stole a car to make sure Harry was okay.

Ron shared his home and family, even though he's afraid people will love Harry more then him.

That underdog mentality that Ron has, would fit rather well with Hufflepuffs.
