So Marauder Era characters suddenly de aged in the future, Golden Trio Era people de aged in the future, or whatever.

So say as an example: Harry is 30-40 and de aged to his Hogwarts years or younger, but the timeline is still when Ron, Hermione and the rest are adults, and other similar things.


** If you don't read slash I guess you wont like it, but 'away childish things' is a pretty popular fic where harry gets de-aged in a potions accident and there's also a case to be solved
