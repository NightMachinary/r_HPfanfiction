I have always been a huge fan of Fan Fictions, and as an artist and writer have written one or two myself. However its always been hard to find some of the hidden gems with so much out there. So I am reaching out on reddit, hoping some folks can provide some suggestions.

/Note: I just recently got done reading Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/

To help clarify what I am interested in and what I am hoping for in terms of suggestions, read the below:

--------------

*Harry Potter Series - Looking especially for :*

- -HP is more powerful (god like or simply more independent or blazes his own trail in the wizarding world)

- -HP ends up with hermione (or even a group/poly/harem relationship like say with Hermione/Ginny/Luna... just not the typical harry/ginny ron/herm)

- -Unusual paths (think HP:MoR)... where the path of the entire story is shifted to a different house, or different beliefs or something.

*Eragon - Looking especially for:*

- -Different paths taken or a more powerful Eragon.

- -An actual much deeper development of a relationship with Eragon/Arya

*Twilight - Looking especially for:*

- -Story continuations beyond the 4th book

- -Bella/Alice lead (romance) instead of edward

- -Alternate story directions

  --------------

/Any Fan Fiction of a similar nature related to SERIES stories (think also Divergent, Lord of the Rings, Hunger games, and more), would be most welcomed as a suggestion/

However I am primarily looking for Harry Potter, Eragon, and Twilight Fan Fictions with Harry Potter being the focus. I will literally read anything at least once, so suggest whatever you heart desires, but again I did list my primary focus in terms of what I am looking for. I do not care what the story is rated from General to Explicit, I will read it all.

Thanks to any and all who read this and provide me with suggestions, and comments, and perhaps others can find new fun reading material from the suggestions here as well.

HUGE thanks to all the writers out there who create such material. If I come across ones I really like, i always post positive reviews, and If possible, contribute to your continuation of such stories.


** I don't read story continuations of twilight because the main characters irritate me and the imprinting J/R makes me feel ill, but here's a good AU book 1 Bella/Victoria femslash: linkao3(465249) and a Leah/OFC continuation fic: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/series/38313]])

This is my favorite Twilight fic ever but it's a sendup of Twilight so YMMV if you love canon: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/928015]]) minor crossover with Supernatural, Leah Clearwater comes home & kicks ass.

I don't read Eragon fic.

Edit: how could I forget Luminosity?? It's inspired by HPMOR and is an attempt at a rational Twilight: [[http://luminous.elcenia.com]]

  After two years on her own, and two more as a hunter with Sam and Dean Winchester, Leah thought she'd escaped her old life at La Push. But when she's called home to attend Jacob and Renesmee's wedding, she brings a little company, and the stage is set for her old and new lives to collide.

  AU. Bella's always been a little different. Glowing skin and malfunctioning electrical devices are only a small part of the problem. No, Bella's also attracted a vampire. A vampire who's name doesn't end in 'Cullen'. Victoria/Bella Femslash

** Just fyi, you can try posting this on [[/r/fanfiction]] too as they're more likely to be able to help with the non-HP stuff you're asking about.

If you liked HPMoR and want stories with a powerful Harry/other path Harry, I'd recommend the following (all with good grammar and spelling, and of a decent length with a somewhat steady plot and characterisation):

linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners) has a strong Harry, and makes fun of a lot of fanfiction tropes in the HP fandom without being a crack-fic. There's a small amount of smut, but it's all in one chapter.

linkffn(Ruthless by AngelaStarCat;With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat) are both stories with a stronger Harry who is changed in some way. If you like one, you'll probably enjoy the other too, but they're different enough that if you didn't know it was the same author you wouldn't guess it.

linkffn(RuneMaster by TigerMan) is a classic powerful!Harry. I personally don't like it, but I thought it was great when I first read it (which was shortly after I finished HPMoR). Give it a try if you really want to amp up Harry's power level. The issues are mostly, in my opinion, that he's given a lot of power for no sensible in-universe reason, but if you look past that it's interesting enough.

linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) This is a very well-known story in the community, and the author has gone on to get other work published. It was written before the series finished, but it's got the best Triwizard Tournament in fanfiction, and the Sorting Hat is great too. It's also not just a canon rehash - the changes ripple outwards and create a new and unique story. I strongly recommend this one.

linkffn(A Black Comedy) A classic comedy, it's great if you enjoy reading about Harry and Sirius going on an adventure together. Lots of humour, some intrigue and drama, there's a reason this is recommended so often.

There's also a subreddit at [[/r/hpmor]] with several continuation stories by other fanfiction authors. I haven't read any, but the consensus seems to be that linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence) is the best one.

I don't know of any good stories from the other two fandoms. However, if you want to read more 'rational' stories in the vein of HPMoR, there's a list of them on the [[/r/rational]] subreddit. The best are in the Pokemon and Naruto canon, though. If you're interested in hearing more about these, let me know, but this post is long enough as is now :)

**** Thanks for all the suggestions. I enjoyed HPMoR, so its not as if rational ones are not interesting to me, but sometimes they, imo, fly too closely in the shadow of the original. As for fandoms, I am not picky but generally prefer the bigger book series I listed (or similar stuff). But I am always up for new suggestions, although while I enjoy the anime, I feel no interest for fanfiction based on cartoons or anime stories for the most part.
