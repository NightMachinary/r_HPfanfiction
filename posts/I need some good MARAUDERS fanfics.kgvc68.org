^ Follows Remus 1st year through OoTP. You'll laugh, you'll cry. Youll cry some more. It's incredible. All the OCs make it. Come fall in love with Grant with me!! It's won multiple awards for it's characterisations. Cannot praise it enough.

*** Exactly. That fic is a bloody masterpiece. I love how the entire fandom has read it and have fallen in love with Grant! This fic won two awards for the best characterisation of Remus and James! And Sirius is so damn perfect here. This is /that/ fic you'll want to read again and again.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** Does it have to be their teenage years? Sirius and Remus get quite a lot of screen time, and exploration of their perspectives, in the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series. The author also has a story set during their school years, White Flags.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
