At first the professors of the think tank and various mathematicians shooed himaway from the building. But eventually they let Henry hang around having him collaborators periodically and eventually teaching him some of the more interesting quirks of mathematics. The boy wasn't a genius he was a normal child but he took to mathematics like a fish to water under excellent excellent instruction from some of the greatest mathematicians England had seen in over a century by the time he was 11 calculus was easy since he had hours of nearly daily tutelage in the subject his teachers at Saint Gregory is primary we're discussing ways to advance him in mathematics without consulting the Dursleys as petunia Dursley seemed to be in denial of her nephews abilities harry was an average child and every other respect A bit of a loner some would say but quite intelligent when it came to mathematics though he never mentioned Surrey institute to any of his professors teachers at school.

​

When the letter came from Hogwarts on his birthday and all the kerfuffle happened instead of having no one to talk to Harry when he went to Hogwarts wrote letters to the members of the medical institute his odd questions were more about quantum mechanics and the possibility of someone learning to manipulate the laws of physics mathematically rather than theoretically it broached quite a few interesting topics and well when the headmistress took a look at them a few times over hairy shoulder Minerva couldn't make heads or tails of the letters so I thought they were harmless gibberish used by children.

​

By the time he was 14 Harry had a paper on quantum mechanics who authored by him and Dr. Frederick Simmons one of the gentleman from the Institute who had taught him the basics of linear algebra when he was about nine or so.

​

In third year harry chose arthimarcy Instead of divination and the rest was history. Hermione still found it vexatious that the only class she wasn't top marks in besides defense against the dark arts was that particular elective were hairy was the one actually helping her with homework it made for an interesting dynamic when proofreading papers for one another.

​

Ron use Harry's mathematical abilities to its full capability when talking probability and statistics with chess and how magic affected the Wizarding version compared to the muggle versuVersion


** darling this is wonderful, but there are so few full stops I had to catch my breath after reading,lmao! But I love the idea.

But also maths people, if you're interested, I have a prompt where Harry becomes an auditor because Vernon is scared of them and Harry thinks if Varnon fears auditors they must be cool af. But I have dyscalculaia and can't write a maths story, so someone else should.

But I always love ‘Harry hides/finds sanctuary in this Muggle place and teach him things that will change the way he views Magic' storylines, and this is awesome.

** I love this. Sort of feels like the Arithmancer series only with Harry instead of Hermione. I would love to read it!
