I suppose they use something to weigh potion ingredients. I suppose it wouldn't be a muggle scale or a balance, however.

1) Old fashioned balance arm scales

***** I want to argue that if a "weight measurement charm", existed, a arm scale would not present in the list of school furniture. I guess one could argue that "the brass was for his 1st year when he didn't know any spell yet, he learnt it later", but I think it is pretty unlikely.

Concerning the "Tempus" charm, the tradition ask for a parent to give a watch to his child for his 17 birthday (so when he is supposed to be formed). If the Tempus charm existed, it would be the worst gift ever. It would be like offering water cuff to someone who have just finished to learn how to swim.

****** it could be a charm for higher years. Harry learns accio in his fourth year by himself, meaning it's taught later then fourth year and that's just a summoning object charm.

it could also be that some potion ingredients are magic sensitive. Snape tells them right away that they won't use their wands in his class.

regarding tempus, you can still get a watch from your parents even if you have a smartphone. it can just be a pureblood tradition which maybe started before the charm was invented.

#+end_quote

Specifying units and using "standard measurement charms" all assume some sort of inherent measurement system in nature, which isn't true. If artificially induced, it would have to be one of the most advanced yet deceptively useless spells to ever exist.

****** Well, no. If you can specify the units then you just have the concept of “grams” in your head as you say something like /Metimur Grams/.

I was saying standard measurement charm in the sense of the charm being standard not the measurements.

******* That would be horribly imprecise.

Say a student has trouble lifting a stone pillar with a /Wingardium Leviosa/, but a more experienced wizard can lift 20 times that. How accurately would they be able to quantify the difference, and then convert it?

If they could, this /could/ be an argument in favor of the non-existence of "intuitive potions genius", but everything in the wizarding world points to potioneering as an imprecise and often experimental science, even after the "proper instructions" have been laid down.

And besides, wizards didn't need to discover it, just have a wizard measure something and it comes out as 925475 units, and the wizards don't care what the unit is, so you can get relative measurements without discovering it.

** Old school brass scales, enchanted to automatically duplicate/vanish weights in the deluxe models.

Or outside of Hogwarts just an off the shelf battery powered electronic scale, same as in my chemistry classroom.

Let's face it, given the small population -> small number of innovators -> few inventions in the wizarding world there are probably more practical solutions for a lot of problems available in the muggle world. I wouldn't surprise if someone bought various muggle items, added enchanted batteries that last forever, transfigured the surface plastic into brass or something else old school looking, and resold it as super duper enchanted stuff.

** brass scales are canon.

I would think there is a measuring charm, though it's not used for potions because some ingredients are magic sensitive. and that's why students need them.

I wouldn't be against believing the healers were using such a charm on their patients to check if they are gaining/loosing weight or on newborns too. the charm could just measure without the person being lifter. it could come out of the scan the healers use (damn, are healer scans canon or fanon???) .

then other heavy stuff or food or whatever. goblins for measuring gold, although the goblins also had scales in the bank. not sure if only in movies or in books as well. Flamel in fantastic beasts 2 had also some scales on his table used for his alchemy stuffs.
