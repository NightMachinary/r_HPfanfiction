What the hell


** Such a random trope. And I think wrong? It's short in the Order photo and Moody says the McKinnons are killed two weeks later, meaning that pic is from late summer/early fall of 1981 if you go by Lily's letter. So he wore it short for most of his life pre-Azkaban.

I've always thought the length is just a by product of him being too miserable to do anything about it. It's short in GoF then long again in OOTP. So if anything his hair is something he specifically /doesn't/ care about.

Edit: but thinking about that pic that might be another example of Rowling and math. Unless every single Order death happens in the span of like two months at the end of the war...

It's implied that the months and weeks preceding Voldemort's failed attempt to kill Harry were the most intense phase of the war. Furthermore, at this point Pettigrew had switched sides and was feeding Voldemort inside information. So it's likely that a large amount of the Order deaths fall into that period of time.

Also it's likely that other Order members died before the photograph was taken. Most of the victims of the first war are only named in the context of that photograph, so the victims preceding the photograph wouldn't be mentioned at all.

**** Ah, you might be right. I thought I remembered the Bones, Prewetts, Benjy, etc. appearing in the picture but perhaps I need to read again if they're only mentioned. I'm trying to write something set in the first war now and finding the timeline for everything often difficult to pin down.

***** Don't forget the fact that at the time the photo was taken, it might not have even been the entire members in there. Some might have died earlier, or were missing when it was taken, or couldn't show up.

The Order was 50 people. So ~25 over 2 months isn't really unfeasible. It might sound odd, but given that we know almost nothing about the first war, it might have been a looming conflict or a cold war for most of the time. I mean, given that the Death Eaters are liberal with deadly force, the Order would have needed hundreds of fighters to sustain a prolonged campaign.

*** My hair means a lot to me. It isn't exactly unrealistic for people to grow attached to things that are attached to them. I've fucking flipped out on bitches when they even joke about putting sharp objects near my hair.

** I always thought it was pretty clear that he wore it short for most of his life, but let it go long during his fits of depression.

I don't think it's a stretch to suggest that at some level he takes pride in his good looks in general and nice hair in particular. But crying over a bad haircut... no.

** I feel like it's a fandom thing that probably developed because girls showed interest in Sirius/he was obviously attractive when he was younger. But...it wasn't Sirius in one of the flashbacks who was messing with his hair when people were looking. It was James. And I don't think even James would cry at a haircut.

** People seem to forget that Sirius is actually a very complex character, and was incredibly talented and skilled to boot.

He doesn't see Harry as James, he might see similarities of course, but he is aware that Harry isn't James.

Sirius was with the Marauders, they became an Animagus at a incredibly young age; which becoming an Animagus is suppose to be a super hard thing to do.

He survived Azkaban as a dog, where as most people would surely succumb to insanity.

His "pranks" are often rather cruel, he takes things too far, is too hot headed/brash.

But he's still incredibly smart, helping create the Marauders Map, becoming an Animagus, overcoming his parents prejudice, leaving his family, is very loyal to ones he cares about.

I also highly doubt that he was a womanizer, but yet so many people write him as one. If anything I'd say that he was a virgin before he was sent into Azkaban, he'd be the sort of person girls fall for, but the girls are afraid to go near.

I mean yeah, he put up those pictures of those women, but come on; he mostly did it to piss his mother off. (And maybe even being attracted to them, at that point and time; I mean heck, he was 14/15/16 when he did it, what straight male wouldn't be at that point?)

But yeah, for a lot of people it's easier to make him someone he's not, but is too often portrayed as, in fanfiction.

** Without context- give the author the benefit of the doubt, I suspect it's a knowing, wry reference to Wizard Howl. I for one would actually enjoy MORE sly refs to Diana Wynne Jones in HPFF.

But perhaps context indicates a fan fiction enmeshed in melodrama and distractingly OOC moments.
