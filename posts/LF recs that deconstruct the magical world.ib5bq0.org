Hi! I'm looking for recs that explore gaps/problems with JK's world---eg house elves, the prevalence of memory modifications, POC Hogwarts students, the trauma of being child soldiers, etc.

I prefer long (50k+) fic and well characterized but totally happy with minor canon characters or OCs being the stars. Not a big fan of “here's this super overpowered magic element that wasn't in canon (Harry can sense magic/is secretly an elf prince/etc),” but happy for AUs or explorations totally outside of canon events.

Some fics along these lines that I've enjoyed: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/][Memorium]]

** I also really liked Goldstein! Haven't read the other two that you've listed, but I'll check them out.

I found *A Squib at Hogwarts* very good, although it's only partially an examination of the treatment of squibs in the wizarding world.

---

The *Alexandra Quick* series addresses a lot of the issues with the wizarding world - house elves and children's issues in particular - excellently, although it takes a side role to the plot and characters, which are exceptional. It's set in an alternate version of Wizarding America, which is really well constructed and very different from Rowling's Britain.

*The Pureblood Pretense* has some really great exploration of classism in the Wizarding world in particular, as well as its warped politics, but again it's an AU and it's not the focus of the story.

  Gather close to hear the tale of a woman who lied her way into Hogwarts, threatened animate objects, tricked her teachers, and fooled her classmates, proving once and for all that Squibs deserve better.

*** Oh interesting! I bounced hard off Alexandra Quick the last time I tried (a bit too Mary Sue for my taste), but might be worth trying again! Thanks

**** Huh, I've seen a lot of arguments on both sides (Mary Sue and anti-Sue) for Alex. I wasn't particularly skewed either way, as I don't see her as particularly successful or appealing in the first book, but also didn't find anything in her intrinsic character that's out of place for an eleven-year-old. Her character certainly didn't grate on me (and it seems you as well!) as it did for some others.

I will say she's not particularly academically inclined, her okay social niceties find flaws later on in the series, and she works her way into situations she actually just cannot get out of. I would give it another try: the second book has one of fantasy's truly wonderful friendships and really steps up the plot another level.
