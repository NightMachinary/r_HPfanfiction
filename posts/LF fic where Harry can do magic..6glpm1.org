This one has Harry using a deck of cards as a pseudo wand and the cards have varying abilities. One of my favorites. It really reminds me of A Black Comedy where Harry and Sirius goes around messing with people.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.

****** Oh dear.

Multi pairing almost inevitably ruins a Harry-centric fic, unless it's played up for laughs.
