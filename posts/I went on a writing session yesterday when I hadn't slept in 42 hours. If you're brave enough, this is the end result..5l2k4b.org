*Ron/Molly bashing and Manipulative!Dumbledore.*

Please don't. Like... please, please, please - pretty pretty please, don't. The first chapter has such a nice tone to it, don't ruin it by making this a bash-trash fic.

Just think about the fun you could have with a time-traveling Luna interacting with a fun and benevolent Dumbledore! Think about it!

I would argue otherwise... but yea... At the very least I'd say that any bashing will never go above "not quite harmful to the story".

Which is the point. There is a clear difference between bashing and exaggeration for comedic purposes. There is little humour in just punching down on a character.

But hey, given the first chapter I'll just go with benefit of the doubt here and let myself be surprised. But would this be the a movie, I'd be the sidekick that goes "I have a bad feeling about this" but then still follows the hero.

**** Ron is */synonymous/* to Pettigrew? WHAT?!

I wonder, in all honesty, if you have ever read the original books. Every opinion you seem to have on characters, plot and stories, and care to share on this sub, is tainted by fanon, often to an degree where canon doesn't seem to play any role anymore.

I mean, explain to me in what way Ron is even /close/ to Pettigrew!

Not to mention that bashing is objectively bad writing.

***** Unfortunately, although your statement was clear, simple and straightforward, there is some difficulty in justifiably assigning to it the fourth of the epithets you applied to the statement inasmuch as the precise correlation between the information you communicated and the facts insofar as they can be determined and demonstrated is such as to cause epistemological problems of sufficient magnitude as to lay upon the logical and semantic resources of the English language a heavier burden than they can reasonably be expected to bear.

I herewith refer you to the betrayal in Goblet of Fire when he accused Harry of bewitching the Goblet of Fire, holding back information that could have benefited Harry, weaseled his way back into Harry's good books.

I further refer you to the act of betrayal in Deathly Hallows when the coward decides to leave Harry and Hermione on the hunt, conveniently coming back when Harry was in danger of drowning.

Then there's the actions that led to Hermione almost becoming troll food in book 1, accusing Hermione for having her cat from eating a certain rodent and the Broomstick saga. It was Ronald who blew it out of proportion you know.

Then there was the Yule Ball, where he virtually accused Hermione of near enough being a slut by going to the ball with Krum.

Don't get me started on the cluster fuck that was Half Blood Prince!

It's merely just /slightly/ showing the true attributes of those characters in such a way that one could reasonably assume that the writer, such as the honorable gentleman herewith referred as the original poster, has a sufficient grasp on the canonical works of Madam Rowling, herewith referred to as the Original Canon Author

****** Temptation to post to [[/r/iamverysmart]] is *so high* right now. We all know how you comment normally, Tom. You aren't fooling anyone. But I'll ignore your blatant attempt to sound smart by abusing a Thesaurus and go right to the juicier parts.

First, all the examples you listed to make Ron "synonymous" with Pettigrew can be easily countered by pointing out that Ron was /a teenager/ at the time. Pettigrew was a grown man when he decided to tell Hitler under which roof Anne Frank is hiding. You completely ignore the fact that Ron lacked maturity. But then again, Ron also never actively tried to kill Harry, so even making that simple maturity-argument is overkill to debunk your statement as complete bull.

You state that a 14 year old is jealous. You state that the only one of the three who actually had family left outside of the tent got beaten by his own fears - magnified by an artefact that is built to empower the worst traits and fears of a person. Then you take simple struggles of normal children. Ron didn't know Hermione would end up in a bathroom with a troll. He was a bully, *with 11*, yes, but his intent was not to make her troll food. He had cause to think Crookshanks ate Scabbers, as the cat was shown to have it out for the rat. The Firebolt was less of an issue, than Hermione going behind their back about an object both of the boys were out of their minds excited about. The Yule Ball was a bout of ugly, but simple jealousy and HBP was simple teenage hormones and angst clashing.

Or in short: You accuse Ron of being a clueless, emotional teenager. Or just teenager. Ron was the normal here. He was the character that had true flaws - actually palpable flaws and worked through them, even if there were setbacks.

It was Ron who had Harry's back fro the very start. He was abrasive, loud-mouthed, but he didn't even so much as doubt Harry for a second when there was trouble. And Harry and Hermione would have died, had not Ron reminded them by asking "Are you a witch or not?" just before sacrificing himself to let Harry and Hermione proceed in what for all he knew could have been a lethal situation.

Wasn't it Ron that went with Harry to face Aragog? Fully in the knowledge that they followed a trail of spiders - Ron's /greatest fear/ - and yet he was the one who stopped to pull Fang into the Ford Anglia, risking a death by spider to safe the boarhound. And it was Ron who climbed down to the chamber with Harry, /knowing there was one of the deadliest creatures the wizarding world has to offer waiting down there/.

Sigh... At this point I've honestly burnt through the energy I had for this rant. All the arguments I would still make for Ron are out there, in countless versions - comments, articles, text posts,... And you know whats the funniest? I don't even like Ron all that much. But I despise the way in which this character gets abused by the part of the fandom you represent.

But hey, its not like there's gonna be any point in arguing with you. I'd have to convince you that everything you write is built on purely the worst of fanon and, of course, you would never admit that. It would undermine the entire genre you try to fill up with your uploads. It would undermine the "GryffindorTom Online site" your flair says you're building and the subreddit you created for yourself. Why would anything shake such a well built image?

And no, bashing is not just "slightly showing the true attributes" of a character. Its taking the *bad* attributes of a character and completely forgetting about the /good/ attributes. Its not taking a good character and making him an antagonist. That would require actual work in character development - can't have that, now can we? Bashing is taking a 3 dimensional character and making it a caricature of the figure - a cardboard cutout that only shows the few traits you want to use in order to have a simple target for the protagonist to shout at.
