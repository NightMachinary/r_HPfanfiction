I'd say that a "memory", in regards to what you view inside of a Pensieve, is a bit of a misnomer. I mean, really, not only do you not view the memory from the perspective of whoever you took it from, but you're able to glean entirely new information that would have been impossible to be picked up in real-time; Such as listening to a conversation from people too far away from the memory owner's earshot, as we see in Half-Blood Prince.

So, really, it's much more like you're viewing an imprint of space-time, with the "memory" being the anchor. But that's another discussion entirely, I suppose.

Being able to hear/see a memory from within a Pensieve, what do you imagine would happen if you were to view the memory of someone being told/reading about a secret hidden under Fidelius? Would the memory owner just not even be able to /give/ that memory?

** You would not receive the Secret, as the secret keeper must tell You. Identity and intent matter in magic. You may hear the secret, but you will never be able to say it. More likely you wouldnt even comprehend that it was mentioned.

** It will sound like gibberish to the person watching the memory

*** It would likely appear like a tampered memory, like Slughorn and the Horcruxes or Morfin's conversation with Tom Riddle Jr.

** My personal headcanon is that someone who isn't the secret keeper can't remove the memory (or any memory containing the secret) from themselves.
