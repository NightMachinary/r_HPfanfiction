Excellent, well-written, complete fic.

When people imagine why Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione wouldn't work out in post-DH or post-Epilogue AUs, it's always the Weasley's fault. Perhaps because the writers don't like them, perhaps it's because the Weasleys cheated, perhaps they see themselves as Harry or Hermione and would, in their position, dump the 'freeloaders', perhaps they're pushing for a certain pairing (/cough/ Harmony /cough/), or maybe they want to write a low-effort bash-fic. It's rare that the divorce or break-up is mutual and /even rarer/ that the split is initiated on the Weasleys' side.

This fic is that very rare exception. And not only is it initiated on the Weasley's side, it also provides a balanced perspective, even though Ginny and Ron's (third-person) POV. It's a quick two-shot, under 3,000 words but leaves one wanting more. For anyone wanting a change of pace from the usual Weasley bash/Harmony wank fics, this is for you. My only complaint is that it's too short.


** i liked it

it showed them all to be human and have actual personalities and flaws and still suffer from the consequences of their own choices as well the choices of those around them.

reminds a bit of Dorothea Greengrass's "Save me" series
