Currently reading Warning Signs Read Desolation and thoroughly enjoying it. What are some of y'alls favorite stories where Voldemort acts as a father figure to Harry either due to adoption or capture or what-have-you


** linkffn(Prince of The Dark Kingdom)

I think they both state they are "just friends" and there is no "familial connotation" in their interactions, but Voldemort certainly acts like a strict father most of the time, i.e protective, sort of demanding, lecturing and so on (but he also has some Dark Lord episodes), while Harry has a ton of unruly but well meaning teenager moments, that he knows will piss off Voldemort (but he's secure in the knowledge that he'll ultimately be forgiven).

It's a fun dynamic.

*** The relationship between Harry and Voldemort is great, but I'd sooner describe it dark master/on-the-fence apprentice. I think Snape is far more of a father figure to Harry. And no, Sirius isn't a father figure either. Sirius is the somewhat deranged but mostly cool, rarely seen uncle.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upsite down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

*** THANK YOU!

There was a series of them that I found on Schoogle (maybe?) where Voldemort kidnapped Harry and eventually Harry started referring to Voldemort as "father" [[/spoiler][Harry eventually kills Voldemort and he comes back as a ghost in the next book and takes over Harry's body.]]

Ring a bell?
