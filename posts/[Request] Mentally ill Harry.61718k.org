Do you guys have any really good mentally ill Harry whether it's caused by abuse from the Dursley's or something else? I like really accurate and profound depictions of mental illness where it's not just used to further some super/god Harry plot where he's a crazy guy going on a massive killing spree.

A couple of really good examples stories like this are linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) and linkffn(The Hundred Acre Woods).

Also, no slash, pairings are fine but H/Hr is not preffered.

A rather sad story, but kinda sweet too. Definite HG pairing.

** linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) Brain-damaged Harry gets sorted into Slytherin, and Dumbledore orders the House Heads to interview the firsties on a weekly basis. Also includes Hermione (Hermes) Granger in Slytherin and a bunch of other damaged children.

Does turn into a Snape-mentors/adopts-Harry fic, but isn't total shit.

WIP, last update May 2016.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
