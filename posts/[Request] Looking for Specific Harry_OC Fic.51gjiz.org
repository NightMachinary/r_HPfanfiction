I was reading a Jeconais fic (Princess) the other day and it jogged my memory of another fic. If I remember correctly, it took place after the war and Harry moved near the Delacours in France and he got involved with one of Fluer's friends/cousins (can't remember which) who happened to be a member of the veela royalty. I'm also pretty sure that she had a sister who was Gabrielle's age and Gabrielle treated Harry like a favorite uncle.

  Harry won the war! So, why is he sitting all alone at Grimmauld Place while everyone else is off celebrating, or planning his life? Well, maybe it's time our hero took a little vacation and enjoyed the lost summer.
