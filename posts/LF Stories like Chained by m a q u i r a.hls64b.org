I just read Chained by *m a q u i r a,* I really liked the plot of the story, unfortunately, it is very short. I'm hoping to find one where Harry goes back in time and the Order believes he is a death eater.

  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he gets captured by the Order of the Phoenix. There's a catch --- from the moment they set eyes on Harry's forced Dark Mark, they despise him. (Post-canon, ignores epilogue.)

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable. "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.”At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts an undercover mission to assist in his search for the Hallows. Only, the young wizard finds himself involved in far more dangerous matters than he could have ever imagined.

** YES. Here's a fic that low-key inspired Chained.

Harry travels to an AU where the Order fears/hates him due to certain ~reasons~ and he has to prove he's not as evil as they think while trying to get along with the Boy-Who-Lived of the AU (Tom Riddle).
