So I recently read a one-shot which inspired this request: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19397077][Ice Cream]]. It's a spin of the Ice Queen trope, where Daphne is still 'ice cold' (at least, she's putting on a persona) but on the other hand, she's a lover of Ice Cream, hence the name. I'm doing a bad job of explaining this one shot, so I HEAVILY suggest you read it - it'll make you smile.

Anyway, in essence, this fic is what I'm looking for. Fics without all those uptight Lord Potter-Ravenclaw-Slytherin- bullshit, pureblood etiquette, galas, arranged marriages - all of which I find extremely boring. Any suggestions?


** "What's this?" Daphne asked, handing over a flower she had plucked.

"That's a rose," Harry said. "Think of it as the most beautiful flower in the world. It has the most vibrant red petals, soft and yet firm, wrapped in delicate and intricate twirls. Lovers all over the world use this flower to show their love."

She touched the petals, counting them, trying to make an image in her mind.

She sighed in sadness when all she felt was like someone had bundled up a few grass leaves. So many sensations just out of her reach...

"This however..." Harry interrupted her morbid thoughts, as he always did, "are called Wisteria." He handed her a stem with a bunch of flowers on it.

"It doesn't look very impressive," he continued, peeking her interest, "in fact, you could find this growing out like wild flowers."

And he paused. Daphne knew he was baiting her, but she couldn't resist.

"What's the impressive part?" she asked as she ran her hand over the bunch.

Harry held her hand, and brought the flowers closer to her face. She could feel his breath on her neck.

"It smells heavenly."

She inhaled, trying to smell their fragrance. Daphne agreed with Harry, it really did smell heavenly.

"Sometimes," he continued, "all you need is closeness."

And just like that, Harry was walking ahead, leading her by holding her hand.

Of the two, Daphne decided, she liked Wisteria more.

This is nothing like Ice Cream. At all. Daphne gets drunk off butterbeer, she doesn't savor the taste of ice cream like a 'connoisseur'; she gets drunk like an alcoholic off a substance with almost no alcohol and makes a fool of herself at the ball.

** I've been on the hunt for actually good Haphne stories for a while and haven't had much luck. I actually really like the fanon version of Daphne but most stories are just trash. The only thing I loved was Contractual Invalidation and even that leaned heavily on those tropes you mentioned but the author was good enough to mostly pull it off.

So I have nothing to recommend you, but thank you for Ice Cream, it was awesome.

** Honest question, if you like Harry/Daphne but don't like lordships and pureblood culture and politics, what is it exactly about the pairing that you like? Because Daphne Greengrass is literally just a name mentioned once. Take away her fanon Ice Queen persona and she might as well be called Tracey Davis or Millicent Bulstrode (maybe not her) or a completely original character.

For me at least, I think it's the fact that Daphne is a Slytherin. It creates so much interesting and complex situations and interactions, and gets me hooked instantly. There's so much questions to answer ("what about her family? how will malfoy/parkinson react? how will ron/hermione react? how will harry's gryffindor-ish personality interact with daphe's slytherin personality?")

This is party why I enjoy "The Changeling" so much, where Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. The dynamics between Ginny and the slytherins are enough to keep me reading. Maybe I'm just inherently interested to Slytherins.

Not gonna lie here, but we all know Daphne is as much of a blank slate as the other Slytherin girls, such as Tracey Davis or Bullstrode. But those characters (Bullstrode at least) aren't represented in a good light at most of the fanfics I read throughout my stay in the fandom - thus causing me to subconsiously favor Daphne Greengrass. Plus, most of the fics I've read of this pairing contains those cliches, so it's a bit refreshing to see a completely different take on the so called "Ice Queen." My request is completely based on fanon - if fanon doesn't exist, this request wouldn't exist. But to me at least, after reading so much fanfiction, there is such a thin line between what's canon and what's fanon that I consider Daphne "Ice Queen" Greengrass as canon, at least subconsciously. I probably worded it extremely poorly, but that's just my take on the whole Daphne Greengrass thing.

*** If you want to put Harry with a Slytherin girl without going full OC, you have 4 choices : ○ Pansy Parkinson ○ Milicent Bulstrode ○ Daphne Greengrass ○ Tracey Davis (And maybe a 5th one with Lily Moon but she is less used , dont know why, and not even sure in Slytherin or Ravenclaw )

From these 4 choices, Pansy is showed as just as bad and Draco (and seem to like him ), and Milicent as big and ugly. So these 2 characters are out (not nice for Milicent but yeah physic does matter in stories ). That leaves Daphne and Tracey. And of the 2, Daphne is favored for several reasons : ○ She does appear in the book (even if only as a name ) while Tracey come from Rowling,s notes ○ Daphne is seen as a pureblood, and Tracey as a Half Blood. Having her being "noble " does add some drama with, for example the potential refusal of her family. ○ Especially with after school fics, Daphne has the advantage to permit the entry of Draco Malfoy in the story as a brother in law. Usefull for the ones who dont want to have Draco as some kind of nemesis.

So yeah Daphne is popular because she is the best non OC candidate every time author want to ship Harry with a Slytherin. And people dont use OC because OC dont have the best reputation (cause writing name is hard, and too much self insert I guess ) and Daphne is basically an OC with a recognisable name.
