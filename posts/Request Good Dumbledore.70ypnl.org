I feel like all I have read for ages now is manipulative dumbledore or dumbledore bashing.

Can I get some rather recently written old-fashioned Dumbledore the Wise and Great and Good fics?

I could also go for Dumbledore's youth/life as long as he grows into a Dumbledore the Wise and Great and Good


** It seems we had the same request 5 days ago, but here is my list of fics with competent Dumbledore:

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** If you don't mind a fem!Ron story, the Weasley Girl series has a good Dumbledore. He's got some really great scenes here; he makes mistakes but he's portrayed as a clever and powerful wizard, not to mention a good and sympathetic man who does his best to look out for the students in his care.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway.

Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

Dumbledore is absolutely perfect in this story and the closest to the original Dumbledore that I've ever seen in fanfic. It's really interesting in that he acts as a mentor to a young Tom Riddle that is almost murdered by a time traveling Harry.
