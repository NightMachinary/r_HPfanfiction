#+TITLE: LF good original fics written before the series was finished, such that they continue the story in their own direction rather than rehashing tropes for the millionth time.

I recall one such fic that I quite enjoyed had Harry getting a magic snake for his birthday - I don't recall the title, but I'm sure someone will link it. I'm looking for more stories that feel like that one. Stuff with the feel of the earlier books with none of the baggage of the later books.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

**** Oh, shoot, sorry! Didn't realize that.

In hindsight, that's a LOT of the fanon, there.

I'll say it again, though, without a link. “The Firebird's Son Trilogy, if anyone cares to look it up. Very VERY AU. Rated M for a Reason!” As I said before...
