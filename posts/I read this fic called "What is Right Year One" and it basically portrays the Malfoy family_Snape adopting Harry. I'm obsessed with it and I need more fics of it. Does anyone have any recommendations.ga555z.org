** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590]])

It's Drarry series. Snape adopts Harry and both of them are very close to Narcissa Malfoy. Lucius gets booted off the family for continuing to support Voldemort, so it's technically not Good!Malfoys fic.

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.

  Minerva McGonagall steps in on the awful night the Potters are murdered and arranges to have Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black and his somewhat cousins, the Malfoys. Draco and Harry grow up as almost brothers and everything - well, almost everything - is different. Gryffindor!Draco. Dramione. AU.

** linkao3(Cunning and ambition)

There are quite a lot stories like that. In general you might want to look into Slytherin!Harry fics, in these Malfoy or Snape often play a bigger role.

  Harry Potter has found out he's a wizard and is on his way Hogwarts. He is found by a boy on the train. Who knew one simple sentence and one simple gesture could change history? A Slytherin!Harry AUABANDONED DURING BOOK SIX (I know the post said it was the whole series. The post was wrong. Sorry)
