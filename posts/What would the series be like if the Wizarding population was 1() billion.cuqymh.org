** On top of what [[/u/wandererchronicles]] has said, the thing is that while it's plausible with a small population that there would only be one or two geniuses of Voldemort's caliber in a generation, this would not be the case with that many wizards. Without the need to aggregate around singular incredibly-powerful individuals, the entire way Wizarding society works would be overturned, and a single Dark Lord could never impose himself over the /entire/ Dark Side like Voldemort was able to, because there'd be a dozen other warlocks of equal power competing with him, and as many of Dumbledore's skill on the other side. Or, rather, there would be a lot more sides than just two.

The pessimist in me also wants to say that the world as we know it wouldn't last very long with the possibility of a dozen Voldemorts per country running around. Sooner or later they would go on all-out war against each other, plunging the Earth into chaos. And that's if one doesn't do something daft like try to create self-replicating nuclear bombs and then blow up the universe by accident.

** There's no way you could hide one in eight of the world's population being magical, so wizards would be out in the open, known about. It's entirely possible that some nations would be /entirely/ magical, or under the domination of mages; others would have open pogroms and witch-burnings; others still would be somewhat combined, maybe with apartheid segregation between the populations.

I would probably consider England one of the latter, with Voldemort as a faux revolutionary attempting to impose wizard superiority on the Muggles, and the "Light" side trying desperately to keep them from coming down on all magicals like a hammer.

*** More than one-eighth -- around one-sixth of the population would be magical, since the global population in 1991 was 5.375 billion.

** There's no way to hide the magical world. There's also no way for a single wizard like Voldemort to gain significant power because the magical government would be much, much more powerful. Hogwarts might be an elite school like Oxford but a lot less significant. There'd be thousands of wizards like Dumbledore, powerful and respected but with a lot less influence than Dumbledore in canon. With 1 billion magicals there magical world would advance and innivate just as fast as our 'muggle' world, so they wouldn't be stuck with medieval societal structures. They'd be far more advanced technologically, with spells, enchantments and potions far beyond what any canon character could imagine. Magical gene editing would probably be advanced enough that they could make sure that children from one magical and one muggle parent would all have magic, so within a few generations of that process being invented there wouldn't be any more muggles. All of history would have gone completely differently, so there probably wouldn't be much technology in existence, but ridiculously advanced magic instead. People would probably take holidays on Proxima Centauri b by traveling through the interstellar floo network.

** Hmmm interesting. Completely different genre but interesting nonetheless... In the final arc of the anime Magi, the story is set in a country ruled by mages (minority) over Muggles (majority). The country rules using apartheid lol.

If there are a billion wizards, there should be countries where the majority are wizards. These countries would be extremely powerful. As for countries where wizards are in the minority, expect wizards to turn violent (aka Magneto).

** Provided the Statute was ever established, the existence of the wizarding world would be an open secret in the higher rungs of society. The rich and powerful Muggles would enjoy every comfort magic could offer. There would be black markets for potions and magical artifacts. Over time, the worlds would no doubt merge.

** As a lot of others have pointed out, if there were that many wizards they could never have managed to stay hidden. Probably the entire history of the wold would have gone differently; we'd have wizards living out in the open, we'd have established wizarding nations and quite probably some conflicts between Muggles and wizards. Very probably we'd have a lot of wizards in the various governments in different nations. There would also be many more magical schools.

There'd be no way for Harry to grow up not knowing he was a wizard... in fact, there'd be no way for Harry to grow up apart from the wizards, unless they changed his name and appearance for some reason.

** You should honestly check out Mahouka Kokukou no Rettosei (The Irregular at Magic High School). It's a light novel series that has been adopted as a manga and anime. It's basically set in the end of this century and the world is now a society where Magicians are treated as weapons.

This information is if you don't know about this series.
