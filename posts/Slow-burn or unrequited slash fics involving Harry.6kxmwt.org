In a masochistic mood. I would prefer the story not to include Draco, and definitely Snape. But if there's an amazing fic with the former, I'll give it a go. Thanks in advance!


** That's tricky because Harry almost always "gets the guy" so to speak in fanfic. But here's a couple that might fit the bill.

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=11240][Becoming Neville]] - make sure to use this link bc the ffn version is no slash. This is a Neville coming of age, over the summer after 5th year when he lives at Grimmuald place with Harry and Remus. Even though it is AU, the way it is written and the plot feels so much like canon. You will fall in love with this Neville - he is so perfectly written. A definite must-read! There's a quick one-shot sequel here by another author - [[http://emmagrant01.livejournal.com/116876.html]]

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/322299][In Pieces]] - I was surprised at how much I liked this fic. In this, Harry is the DADA professor at hogwarts and Draco is a ghost who won't leave him alone. The premise sounds corny. But the writing is GREAT and because there's no clear way to bring Draco to life, it's a really tragic story in the way that few HP/DMs are.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594][Temptation on the Warfront]] - another Drarry but iirc it's a really slow burn. The AU was very similar to canon (which was cool) but different enough to keep you on your toes. Harry and Dracos slow angsty buildup was also great and pretty believable.
