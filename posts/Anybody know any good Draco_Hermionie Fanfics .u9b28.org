My VERY picky friend has been looking forever, and cant seem to find anything that she hasn't read yet. I suggested that she should come here to ask, but she doesn't want to for some reason. So I did for her.

Edit: Yeah, I realized that I spelled Hermione wrong. Sorry!

***** I felt as if I had a love/hate relationship with theo. I loved him because of his connection with Hermione, but at the same time, I hated how he could be so confusing! So he would drive me crazy but with him being a legimens... /wink wink/ :)
