Basically, I want to know if there are any fics out there where Harry himself either becomes a Dark Lord or just gathers followers of his own, and goes to war against Voldemort and potentially the order as well. Maybe a panicked Dumbledore releases Grindelwald in order to help him but he gathers his own followers again.

I just sort of want a war with multiple factions vying for control (sort of like Game of Thrones). Id like if Harry was paired with someone but I really don't care who (just no slash for Harry, don't care about any other character relationships).

If anyone knows any stories even slightly like this please link them in the comments. Thanks.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry and a war hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** I read the Harem War a while ago. I like Vance McGill's version better than the original, but I wish it had been finished. It had some interesting ideas. If I remember correctly they made Ron out to be really really stupid though... not that I mind a little Ron bashing once and a while, but the trope is a little over done.
