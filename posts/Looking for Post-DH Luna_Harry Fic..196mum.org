Anyone know any good ones? I've read this one where Luna and Harry had an affair but I think the author took it down. Shame because it was quite good.


** Are you thinking of "Quixotic"?

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6862426/1/][This one]] is brilliant.

It's set a few years after DH. Harry and Ginny's marriage didn't work out so well, and they split up before James was born. At the same time, Harry comes to realize his feelings for Luna.

It's set five years after the war, but as Harry is looking back on his life, most of the story takes place in the years in between.

** This is a one-shot, but there's one called Family Reunion by JJ Rust (FF.net) that's really great.
