  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

** /Albus Potter and the Year of the Badger/, linkffn(4256837), is the best one I've seen. It covers Albus's first year with plenty of well-rounded new characters and the start of a new dark lord arc. It introduces quite a few new aspects of magic, but it still feels a lot like canon Harry Potter. Sadly, the sequel is abandoned.

  A review for my concluded drabble series 'Dumbledore Is An Idiot' promptly led to even more ultra-short AU crackfic in the wizarding world a generation after the Harry Potter novels, as presented here.

** If youre cool with slash, I liked [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4605858/chapters/10496574][Summer Boys]]. In this fic, Scorpius and Lily are best friends and scorpius stays at the potters summer house the summer after 7th year. He drunkenly hooks up with Albus and both try to decide if they want more than sex. Great writing and a nice fic. Not too plotty. linkao3(4605858).

Also [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/115114/chapters/160781][Irradiance]] was really good but depressing. linkao3(115114)
