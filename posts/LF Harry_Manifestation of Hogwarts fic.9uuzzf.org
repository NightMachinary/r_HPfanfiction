** There's one, the title is escaping me right now, where Harry is deeply into anime and manages to wake up an avatar of Hogwarts With A Shard of the Philosopher's Stone in the room of requirement. But because the Avatar is taken from Harry subconscious she's a loli or or little sister trope I can't remember which.

***** It's good but in the genre of crack I still believe that linkffn(7848660) is better and even less appreciated.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.
