No slash please; just friendship between these two guys! Any time period, setting, AU, etc is fine. I just wanna read nice stories about them overcoming a school grudge (or not having one in the first place).

(This request is personal, this time.)

I absolutely love the story. No slashes or romances, just pure chance of Draco and Harry becoming friends. (I have nothing against slashes or romances, I just want something that shows character growth.) The writing from what I can read is pretty good in my opinion as well. Not too difficult to interpret but not childish either.

Anyways, this is a what-if story where Draco finds Sirius' diary and he starts to question pureblood life. Everything is cannon until the beginning of the summer before their 3rd Year.

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.

Harry & Draco friendship is developed nicely. And one of my favorite series overall.

  Nearly two and a half years had passed since Kreacher had woken up to find Harry Potter asleep on his kitchen floor, and Grimmauld Place had changed dramatically since then. Sequel to "Innocent".

  Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy, even among wizards. The most noteworthy thing about him, however, was his talent for getting himself into trouble, which surpassed even that of his godfather. Sequel to "Innocent" and "Initiate".

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".
