Since there are so many prompts that come and go, never seen again, I thought I might be able to give hope to those that come up with these fun ideas.

This [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/h7liw0/on_his_nocturnal_wanderings_in_first_year_harry/][prompt]] was from quite a while ago; I really loved it, but life + my 'main' fic got in the way. Happy to report that the first chapter of my new story, "It Was Written in the Stars" is now live on FFN. Many thanks to [[https://www.reddit.com/user/ShredofInsanity/][u/ShredofInsanity]] for the original prompt. My story is H/LL.
