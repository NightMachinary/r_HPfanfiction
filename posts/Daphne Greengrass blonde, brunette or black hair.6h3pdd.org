** I see her as blond-haired blue-eyed. I have no idea why. Maybe because of the Ice Princess cliche.

**** Oh yes, that's actually one of her more memorable characterization for me too. I used to see her as Blonde with blue eyes with a typical aristocratic composure and slightly frosty attitude, but since that story I have essentially two version of her in my head.

As long as she's sharp as a knife one way or the other it works for me.

***** It's possible though. There's this thing which I can't remember the name of, like "super-impulses". Certain characteristics in animals are designed to evoke a certain reaction, but taken to their extremes. dilated pupils are attractive, or a certain hip-to waist ratio is arousing. You can basically exploit this part of the human psyche to get "supernatural" reactions by exaggerating these characteristics.

[[https://gfycat.com/ScaryWiltedCats][Just look at this shit]] for example, her face is almost supernaturally geared towards evoking a certain reaction, especially in combination with her expressions. Another (maybe slightly disturbing) example that comes to mind is this Valeria Lukyanova chick who does everything in her power to look like a barby, also an unnatural idealization of certain characteristics.

So, now the only challenge that remains is to find a girl that has Fleur's characteristics, i.e. long blonde hair, blue eyes and the kind of effortless beauty that makes you feel like all the other women are just doing something fundamentally wrong somehow.

**** You cannot prove she's not, that her Magical family didn't, say, escape the Trail of Tears by emigrating to the UK.

She's a non-entity in the books, mentioned all of once, with no detail given beyond her house affiliation. Literally everything else about her is fanon.

But hey, keep up with the "courageous" downvoting. Because Ice Princess nonsense is /so/ much more compelling.

***** Chill. The point of fanon is that if you want, she could be of Native American descent. My only canon based concern with that is actual nobles in our history weren't very welcoming of Native Americans. Why would their magical variants be any better? Though once again, fanon, make her a time travelling monkey in line for the British throne if you want, it doesn't matter.

Also, you're probably getting downvoted because you state it as fact that the hair is because of Native American descent. Like you said, we know nothing about her and this is reddit, either conform or be downvoted /s.

******* Fans be crazy. There are many places where standing out is not viable and fandoms tend to be one of those places. Especially HP fanfics, people read what they want, they like it and the characters get set personalities in their minds.

It happened to me, when I first got into fanfic, it was Harry and Hermione all the way and everything else was sacrilege but as I read more, I realised in the end, it's a story, people have different opinions and that going out of my comfort zone is awesome.

Let the downvotes flow, they are just fake internet points after all.
