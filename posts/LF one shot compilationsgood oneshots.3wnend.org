I'll read whatever you post. By one shot compilations I'm referring to something similar to Odd ideas.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

** Dunno about oneshot compilations, but here are some oneshots that I've enjoyed the most:

Of course, you should have read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize by Lady Altair]] already. If not, that's probably the first one you should read.

Other than that, here's a list of well-written, enjoyable oneshots:
