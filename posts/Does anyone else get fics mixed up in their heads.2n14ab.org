I mean consistently:

I keep seeing adoptions of Silver Aegis's New Life, and excitedly thinking that there's another incarnation of Silver Fawkes' Yet Another Universe...

I know its because I they both cover dimension travel and have an author with Silver in the name... but I'm like Charlie Brown and that GD football. My brain, it refuses to cooperate.


** All. The. Freakin. Time.

I have completed reading a bit over 100 fics and another 60 or so that are incomplete (whether story isn't complete or I quit reading before end). I also don't have a terribly great memory, so I get the details mixed up all the damned time.

I realize a lot of you have probably read more fics but I've only been at it for about six months.

*** I have downed about the same amount the past three weeks. Seriously just binge read probably 5 million words or more. At this point the whole HP universe is a fluid, I might just have to write my own piece to settle it down.

** Romances are the worst in this way. I have read maybe 20 Rose/Scorpius fics and Favorited maybe 5 or so. They're not great stories, but they're nice for a quick romance read. So there's nothing too memorable to set them apart but there are a few smaller things. No way to tell which is which at all so I just don't reread them.

** I used to get The Merging and The Legacy mixed up. The were published around the same time, both updated regularly and both featured a Harry learning occlumency over the summer. They also both featured Harry's horcrux as a prominent plot point.

Later on they diverged, but in the first 10 chapters or so I kept getting confused as to which occlumency belonged to which fic.

*** Confusing fanfiction for canon? That's not a mix up, that's an /advanced/ mix up. Small details like terminology (wards for example) that some might claim are not canon (and they can go fuck their technically correct--in that the word itself doesn't appear but magic that in any other fantasy would be called wards does--selves) are fine but mixing up whole major plot elements like the entire economy (and again, those who claim that's not canon either can piss up a rope because those who control the gold control the economy, period) literally collapsing into the ground is not something so easily mixed up. Maybe thinking that some background character headcanon is canon would be alright in that it isn't explicitly said not to be true, but all of gringotts sinking into the ground? What?

Have you had any other equally hilarious mix ups?

**** Just as a little tidbit of information. The term ward in reference to a magical protection is actually a /very/ recent usage of the word, largely from the last two decades or so. In the past an object might have warded off evil, but it wasn't in and of itself a ward.

This all comes together to mean that people in the HP universe would have almost certainly never said ward, it being a recently developed muggle term.

***** Earliest reference to wards as a type of protective spell that I recall is the Advanced D&D spells 'Guards and Wards' and 'Glyph of Warding' (published c.1978).

Where the designers drew their inspiration may have come from classic fantasy fiction of one sort or another (Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser; Elric of Melnibone; Chronicles of Amber), but the term comes from normal English- 'you stoke the fire to ward off a chill'. It's also the root word for Warden, an official who keeps the borders intact.
