Hagrid knew Riddle in school, is extremely useful in battle, and if he didn't know about the Horcruxes then at least he had a pretty strong inkling ("I don't think he 'ad enough human left in 'im t'die"). He seems like an ideal choice for the Trio to take with them on the Horcrux Hunt, stealth aside. Are there any fics where this is the case?

***** Well, you could use a Shrinking Charm on Hagrid.

Or maybe you could bypass the whole cloak thing and have Hermione cast a /Fidelius/ on "Hagrid is helping Harry, Ron and Hermione look for Horcruxes".

******* We once had a thread about Fidelius abuse, and we concluded that a good limitation to put on the spell would be to have it be exponentially more difficult to cast with how many people other than the Secret-Keeper knew the Secret. So it'd be easy to Fidelius something already unexpected (e.g. Hagrid helping with the Hunt), harder to Fidelius something a few people already know (e.g. Grimmauld Place), and damn near impossible to Fidelius something like "the sky is blue".

********** Well, technically the fidelius for the Order Headquarters covers the address or where the house physically is so it makes sense that the house becomes totally invisible. It seems that the fidelius only covered the address of the headquarters, and the “The Order of the Phoenix's Headquarters” part of the secret is just there as a label of what is being hidden. By Fideliusing Hagrid that way, only the fact that Hagrid is helping the trio. I'm not even sure if you can actually Fidelius Hagrid that way, considering that would mean that the Fidelius is constantly moving and automatically changing the location it's protecting

I still maintain that shrinking Hagrid is best.

**** I doubt the maion problem would be with (physically) hiding him. He would just accidentally tell everyone that he is going to hunt Horcruxes, where and how he is going to do it and who's helping him.

The only safe way to take him would be to not tell him about it beforehand and basically kidnap him. I'd still be constantly worried that he'd take a stroll into a pub at any point.
