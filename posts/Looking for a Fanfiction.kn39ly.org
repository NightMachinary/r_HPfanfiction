So I'm looking for one fanfiction I've read, but I can't find it anymore.

Basically, Harry is a genius and is the CEO of a tech company, he has an AI and finds out about the wizarding world. He finds out he has a sister and she and Ginny go with harry back to his company and he builds a bunch of techs that blocks magic.

I'm basically trying to find something like that.

Thanks.
