Seriously, she died when she was halfway through her magical schooling. Even if she can't use a wand anymore, why not study the theory stuff? What's the point of having so many ghosts in a school if they aren't there to learn, or teach?


** And why would they learn? It's not like that can do anything with it.

Plus, they don't have where to store said knowledge, though that doesn't explain how they retain memories.

*** If ghosts don't have any brains, how can they recognise, speak to and respond to students?

If they're only made of magic or whatnot, and don't physically exist, how do they reflect light and emit sound?

Plot twist; all the ghosts in Hogwarts are actually holographic/audio projections from a magic-computer hidden in the basement. Other places have such ghost projectors but Hogwarts has the best and thus gets the reputation of 'most haunted place'.

**** Muggles can't see or hear ghosts, so they don't reflect light or speak through vibration of the air like normal people.

Or maybe they have a some kind of selective invisibility/silence field, but that sounds weird

** Ghosts aren't supposed to be able to learn new things according to Rowling. This doesn't completely make sense in canon since they're shown to be able to remember students names. Maybe they forget you very easily once you've left school? Like an ai with limited memory space?

It does suggest that they will have to replace Binns eventually if he can't teach anything that's happened after his death.

*** If they can't learn new things, why can the Fat Friar, Grey Lady and Bloody Baron speak modern English at all?

...Actually, there's plot potential in there...imagine a magical scientist who died and came back as a ghost, obsessed with continuing his research.

Lacking the physical faculties and memory to accomplish things on his own, he recruits apprentices to conduct experiments and keep notes, and to remind him whenever his own memory fails.

Slowly, over time, learning and relearning things, they discover a new and powerful kind of magic; one that can 'edit' ghosts, changing and augmenting the information they know, the languages they can speak, finally giving people who come back as ghosts the ability to learn and grow.

** I'm of the opinion that given ghosts are just a sort of imprint left behind, rather than an actual soul, they're actually just an imprint of what the person was like when they died. Hence the Bloody Baron was morbid, still repenting a thousand years after he died. The Grey Lady was cold and angry. Myrtle was left in a highly emotional state, and in the height of pubescent woes as well.

They were probably all quite different people when alive.

Binns died naturally while no doubt thinking about teaching. Fat Friar and Sir Nick were both executed - they had time to prepare themselves for death, and although Nick was obviously afraid to pass on, he must've been at peace with dying. Otherwise he'd have been a screaming shrieking ghost.

** A bigger question is, why WOULD she study the theory stuff? It's not like she could use it for anything. She can't grow up, she can't get a job, she can't really do much of anything. The only reason would be for the sake of intellectual curiosity, but Myrtle does not strike me as the sort to want to learn something just for the satisfaction of having learned it.

As for the point of having ghosts around... well, if you look at it from a purely practical viewpoint, there's no point at all. But ghosts generally don't haunt places because it's USEFUL; they do it because they have some unfinished business or can't let go of something connected to their lives (or in HP lore, because they're too afraid to die).
