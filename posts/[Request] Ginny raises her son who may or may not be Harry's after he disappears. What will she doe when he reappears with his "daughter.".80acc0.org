I can't remember the name of this fic. Ginny raises her son who may or may not be Harry's after he disappears. What will she doe when he reappears with his "daughter." Ginny is raising her son in Ireland. Harry has disappeared and no one knows where. Harry finally returns, but he's on the run. He drops off a girl who calls him daddy and asks Ginny to watch her while he runs off. Harry's been searching for someone in America.

It has a frozen reference, which the author admits was an anachronism.

** You are not using the request tag right. This is supposed to be a "LF (Looking For)" tag. Request is a request for an idea for a story. LF is looking for a specific story that already exists. Okay? :)

**** No, (s)he just worded things badly.

LF tag is for finding a specific fic

Request is for "any fics that fulfill this vague criteria"

***** Since when? I've been around here for years and have never seen that distinction... LF/Request have always been used interchangeably, unless I'm having a stroke right now.

*** "...mentioning "LF" or "Looking for" anywhere in the title will automatically mark it as a request."

This implies that all I needed was a request tag and that if I didn't tag it myself putting LF would do it for me. Sorry for the misunderstanding. But I got my fic anyway.
