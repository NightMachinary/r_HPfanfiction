life on the road, or wandering the wasteland, trying to survive, the disaster sucks, it's true. but, as usual, the real danger is the other survivors.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** I have been thinking about writing a story like this someday. Like some dark witch manipulates muggles into nuking the world into a new ice age, and then the story would pick up a few hundred years later where everyone has outposts and towns they're living in, and they're all still hiding from her because she's immortal and she made her own new kingdom atop the old world, and MAYBE some aspect about where she's the only one alive who actually remembers anything from before.

*** Whom the Gods Would Destroy started out excellent. Then, when Charlie and Hermione reached Hogwarts, the whole thing with Lucius Malfoy was just ridiculous. Not to mention that Hermione was way too OOC with him. I mean, c'mon, she wouldn't ever kiss him once let alone 3 (or was it 2) damn times! I couldn't finish the story after reading two-thirds of it. I skipped to the last chapter, skimmed it, and closed it. I've never looked back. Sorry but I wouldn't recommend this.

**** Have to agree with this assessment. It had a good premise, but it read like something written by someone who was more familiar with romance than with anything else. The main characters (Hermione and Charlie) came across as perfect and overpowered at the expense of other characters and undermined a story which could have been really good.

  The end of the world has come. Millions dead, magic waning, Hermione Granger and Charlie Weasley are the last people left in Britain---left to pick up the pieces of their once great civilisation. Why were they spared? Who is responsible for the death of a nation? These are the mysteries left as a legacy for two lost and lonely people. DH-EWE, character death, non-canon elements

  War... War never changes. In the year 2076, Europe is consumed in war. Muggle Britain stands mostly intact, but it will not remain so for long.

Encountering Rick Grimes and his rag-tag family, Harry and his portkey lost friends are left wondering if this is the end of their troubles in a world infested with the undead, or the beginning of them.
