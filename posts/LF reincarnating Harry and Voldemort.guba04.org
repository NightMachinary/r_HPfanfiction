:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello all, I am tryna find a fic that had both Harry and Voldemort being reincarnations of an endless battle between the good and evil sides of the universe. I know it's not much to go on but it was super good when I read it years ago and want to find it again. Thanks for the help in advance!


** I know this one, I think, its the one where Hermione was in an accident with the veil, I think and ended up in the far post-apocalyptic future where (future) Harry happened to stumble across her at a temporal rift. We learn through the story that Harry and Moldy Shorts have been going at it through all time and such. Also get to meet a halfway decent Malfoy too.

Can't remember the name though, sorry dude

  Harry Potter has been reincarnated more times than he can count, always to stop a mad man. Now, the world has been ravaged by nuclear war, and nothing will ever be as it once was.
