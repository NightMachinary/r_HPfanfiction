I've been trying to find a next generation one I found last year. It takes place right after the war and involves Harry, Ron, and Hermione going back for their seventh year. Harry and Ginny also help raise Teddy. Then there is a series about their children. Any clue what the title is? Or who wrote it?


** Could it be little0bird's post Hogwarts fic?
