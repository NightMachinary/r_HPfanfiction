Crouch Imperiuses a muggleborn to put the name, but he accidentally drops one of his books. The goblet chooses the most capable character in the book, and after failing to locate him, pulls him from his universe to compete. Bonus points if the character has no idea of what he is doing.

***** But Goku's name has to be written for the goblet to recognize him, so it pulls the word ‘turtle' off of his gi and summons Roshi instead.

So Roshi ends up in a fanon universe where harems are a dime a dozen, ancient and powerful bearded guys are revered as gods, and the most dangerous villain in history has less magical power than his older sister. That's basically a better afterlife than otherworld, for him.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

** they drop "the lost hero" by Rick Riordan Percy Jackson is the chosen one (C'mon Jason, you know you had no chance at this)

He appears with a "WHAT THE HELL HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE ALL OF THIS CRAP IN JUST ONE LIFETIME, DAMN ZEUS sorry uncle" and then accepts that he'll need to go through this to get back to his normal life (not that it is very normal, but anyway)

first task: steal egg from dragon

Now, this guy has experience with dragons. They have one at the camp. Dragon breathe fire, Percy does his water thing and voilà, no fire this time big dragon. Then he could either make the water movement bring the egg to him or he could go there and pick the damn egg. He's a trained hero.

He has an egg, he'd have to take a shower after first task, he still has the egg "why not put it under water". Even if he had a seaweed brain moment the second task would be the easiest to him.

second task: go into lake, rescue someone important

it's underwater, duh. He just shows up. Cedric and Fleur do the bubble head thing and Percy is like "Whoaah, that's impressive". Harry eats something gross. "Eww, but it seems to work". Then Krum turns half shark and Percy loses his shit like "WTF IS THIS GUY DOING". Then it's his turn and he just walks into water, everyone is like "omg, is this guy dumb, he can't breathe under water" BUT HE CAN. And not just that, he can talk to things that live under water too so you bet he could speak to the merpeople, that would maintain the mystery and say after one hour the hostages are gone. Percy would TOTALLY fall for that.

Anyway, he can move fast, probably wouldn't get lost. I bet he would convince the giant squid to lend him an arm. Or all of them. It's been 10 minutes since the second task started. There emerges Percy, above Giant Squid's head, the squid having one hostage on each arm. Now the squid gently puts them all on the platform, gives Percy a high five, waves goodbye and leaves.

I don't remember how the point system worked, but I'm sure Percy got all of them. Except from Karkaroff, he was a bit of a jerk. Other champions get low grades, cause Percy just rescued all the hostages.

Third task: get to the center of the labyrinth

"AGAIN A FUCKING LABYRINTH? I HATE LABYRINTHS" he'd shout to the skies. But this labyrinth isn't as difficult as Daedalus' one. He'd probably have trouble with incantations, but I assume he'd deal with that, the monsters would be no problem cause of Anaklusmus (Celestial Bronze) and he'd already faced a sphinx.

He'd make it to the centre before Cedric and Harry, grab the cup, go to the cemetery and "is this another villain trying to resuscitate? I can't take this shit anymore" incapacitate wormtail, kill voldy (or whatever he is before the ritual). Go back to Hogwarts and just say "you're welcome everyone, I'll be returning to Manhattan, thank you and bye"

He obviously didn't know about horcruxes and all, but hey, it's not his fucking problem, he has giant ones on his world too.
