:END:
Hey all, looking for a fic I read awhile back. I don't remember a lot about it. I do know that Harry was close to Draco, Luna, and Neville (or maybe it was Blaise?) I think. They all played an instrument of some kind. Draco played piano. Hagrid made Harry a flute. I think there may have been a threesome/foursome situation, definitely slash though. Harry made instruments that were enchanted and made people feel things.
