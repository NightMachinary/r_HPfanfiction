I have been reading crackfics these past few days, and have been laughing so much. There's one where Harry goes to Gringotts and is just like "How do I own Azkaban?" and it's just a parody. So good.

I really want some sassy or sarcastic Harry fics now. I mean, he occasionally shows his mean streak, which are treasured moments for me, but the rest of the time, he just is loyal, kind, etc. I feel like he needs to show more of the mean streak. Taunting Voldyshorts, etc.

In case anybody needs a recommendation for a Smart-alec Harry fic, I found this abandoned one which I loved :Oh, you didn't know? Yeah he's awesome. This is on Fanfiction.com

I've literally been suggesting it everywhere. It's so hilarious, plus it includes a Harry that's good at dancing, and apparently, sewing clothes.

My requirements are Harry-centric, parody, humorous, or crackfic, and no, or not too much, Hermione. Also, longer than 5 chapters! Thank you all!


** I think most fanfic authors forget how sassy Harry is. I did a reread recently and died when Harry almost woke Dudley up at midnight just to tell him it was Harry's birthday.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the What If Scenarios)

It's hysterical and well written, basically going through the books starting from chapter 1 and asking "What if >insert twist or something absurd<" for various scenes. And moving forward, those small changes are kept. Harry is hilarious and sassy in these. I made the mistake of starting it while healing from having broken my ribs. It was totally worth it though.

I actually ended up reading it all through Prisoner of Azkaban out loud to my kids at bedtime, editing for spoilers. It had them rolling on the floor laughing.

  What if all of Harry's fame immediately went to his head as a child? What if the Malfoys couldn't tell the difference between a smartphone and magic? What if Severus Snape appeared cruel and scheming, but somehow believed he was helping Harry out?

** Linking the fic mentioned in the OP:

linkffn(8525320)

My own recommendation: linkffn(13460508) Harry Potter, Master of Malicious Compliance. In which Harry takes things as literally as he can, on purpose, to screw with people. Then snarks them out when no-one seems to catch on to what he routinely does.

  Remember Goblet of Fire? What would happen if Harry took the filter off his mouth and actually said what he's thinking? Bad things, probably. But it'll be fun as hell. My go at the Intelligent!Harry, Smart alec!Harry situation.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][make a wish]]

Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

And the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3032621/1/The-Hunt-For-Harry-Potter][the hunt for Harry Potter]]
