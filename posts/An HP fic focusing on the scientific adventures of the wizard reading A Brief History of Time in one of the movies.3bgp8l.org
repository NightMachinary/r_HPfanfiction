Title says it all. There's a character that as an easter egg is reading Hawking's Brief History of Time. The first chapter has him having a eureka moment about how to use the Apparate spell in time as well as space. He tells his girlfriend, and the two of them make a police box (Yeah, I know) to travel the galaxy.

In one scene they specifically find out why Patronuses are formed by happy memories - a planet with them has baby patron uses growing, and the babies "smell" like happiness.

They also meet a man on one world that had also figured it out, and had deep magics of his own, and was set up to be a villain.

I can't for the life of me find out where this fic was, the title, or anything, and foolishly didn't save it. But it was an original story that kinda followed the HPMOR sort of science and wizardry.

Anybody ever remember seeing this?

*** Yes! Thank you so much! It was such an interesting concept, and I had trouble finding it. There were tons of little tumblr gifs of that guy, there were several blog posts about it and freaking out about "OMG science and Harry Potter" but never expanding on it.

Thanks! That was driving me nuts. Now I get to see what happens in the story!
