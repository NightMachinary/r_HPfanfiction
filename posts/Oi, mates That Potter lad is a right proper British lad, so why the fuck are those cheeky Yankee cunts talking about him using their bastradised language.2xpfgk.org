** Fair enough on certain things (usually school related in HP, like calling them elementary schools, also "extra credit" school work--whatever that is, we don't have it), but I sometimes feel some people get a little too pedantic about this issue. A lot of American language, slang especially, is being assimilated into British English because we watch American TV and reads American books and talks to Americans on the net. Unless someone is being painfully yankee about something, I'm not that bothered. Even the sweater/jumper issue doesn't bother me, which seems to be a big issue for some people. When I was in primary school during the 90s we had school "sweaters" and for a long time I just thought sweaters were made of cotton and jumpers from wool.

TBH I'd rather read a decently done fic in American English than cringe through someone misusing British English.

I agree with what you said about when you're constantly surronded by a different culture--like in the HP fandom, where the majority of the people are using either American or British English, they begin to blend into your everyday vocabulary.

I prefer it to be as authentically British as possible, of course, since the /Britishness/ is a big part of the atmosphere.

** Speaking for the Yanks, it bothers me as will unless they put it into an AU type story (for your elementary school reference anyway). That being said, some do try and use the British linguistics, but it can be difficult to do some of it right (correct connotation and the like). However, I have spoken to other writers who have tried, got blasted by reviewers for using wrong words or context, and gave up on trying. I do agree that you should write in the way the character and story is framed, but as a reader, constructive criticism to help us out would be welcome.

As I understand it, in Australia it has a friendlier connotation and it seems to me it is somewhat of an insult in Britain (please correct me if i am wrong), but as an American I refuse to use it because it is a derogatory word for a woman.

Those are words I might hear often enough walking down the street and which are only going to draw a scowl of disapproval from mothers (excepting the extremely uptight of course), but cunt isn't so casually tossed about and is likely to draw shocked looks even from more laid back people. It's a word that I associate with extremely unpleasant people (usually rude chavs trying to be "hardcore" or whatever, drunk twats, the kind of blokes that harrass people for no reason except they're bored, and the kind of bitches that think putting down other women makes them better).

** I'm American (even worse, I'm from the Southeast), but I've been a Harry Potter fan since I was 9...and thus aware that there are different ways of speaking English just based on country/region. Grew up on Harry Potter, Doctor Who, Narnia, Lord of the Rings (lovely mix of accents there), and etc. I lived in the UK for a few months when I was 19 (picked up some slang just by being a teen, I also have the British HP copies), and I've lived/traveled all over the US and other English speaking countries since then. I KNOW that I wouldn't understand half of the slang from a proper British teenager...but that's not going to stop me from trying. I get all the obvious ones, but I don't even attempt the spelling/grammar (of British English). In fact, I really only focus hard on dialogue, because the characters might be British...but the author is not. Don't hate me for trying, but I certainly do appreciate the occasional "hey, we say X not Y"...as long as you say it nicely! I think in general, I understand more slang and British-isms than the average fanfiction author, but I think the key is knowing what you DON'T know.

So many of the 'mistakes' are things that can be swapped by using the "swap word" function on word and the equivalent software. Pants, sweater, Mom. Simple things. That alone would be enough. Other things, like the references to the food boxes and milk cartons, are things that a beta reader or British reader could pick up and mention before you even post your story to the wider public.

When I write FF in an American based fandoms, I use the swap a word function to weed out the usual suspects and an American beta reader (who was one of my readers and helped me with some things like the American education system before just checking over my chapters) to help with things that I just wouldn't get otherwise.

** I'm fine with american spellings but if they:

A) include no British terminology regarding education, food, seasons (fall v autumn), clothes (pants v trousers)

B) over do it (like in the title). And oh my god overdoing the accents

C) if they mention only London, hogsmede etc and no other area in the UK (Devon, anywhere in Wales, Lancashire, anywhere in the Midlands)

It just shows lack of research and, as British myself, is completely jarring. So much so that I can't read anymore one I notice it.

*** C) might conceivably be because other locations have no relevance, though. I mean, if your story takes place solely at Hogwarts it might just not be relevant to talk about other places.

** Meh.

Lets see: population usa + canada + australia: 381 million. Population of great britain: 57.1 million. (From wolframalpha).

Its not worth the effort considering a) a non-british author is going to get it wrong anyways, b) Only 1/7th of the readers will know the difference.

This is fanfiction. If you let little things like "elementary school" vs "primary school" kick you out of the story immersion, then you're probably going to have a bad time anyways.

*** Canadian and Australian English are closer to British English than they are to American, which is why the term "British English" is rarely used these days. In most English textbooks you'll find it referred to as "international English".

**** Spelling wise, you are correct. Cultural wise, as a Canadian, I would have to say that Canadians are far closer to American culture than British culture. I'm not sure about Australian culture, but would guess that, due to the amount of "culture" (read: "entertainment") exported by the USA, Australians wouldn't have difficulty with non-British terms.

I would argue that differences in word-choice such as "elementary" vs "primary" are more cultural than spelling ("armor" vs "armour").

***** I dunno, speaking as a Kiwi (New Zealand) our colloquialisms are closer to the English than America, and it seems to be the same for the Aussies. Sure we get Americanism from tv, but we (mostly, I have one annoying friend that after a trip to America everything is Cookies and Ban-aids) don't use them.
