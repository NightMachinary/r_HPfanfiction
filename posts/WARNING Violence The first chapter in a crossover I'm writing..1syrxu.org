Prologue

The black dog called Padfoot ran through the moon-lit forest; looming oak, maple, and holly trees cast gaunt caricatures along the earthen floor. He ran with great haste past the silent sentinels, pink tongue lolling from a slathered, bloody muzzle. The scent of a young fawn filled the beast's nostrils, and his ears pricked up and the dark hackles on his back stood on end. Faster now, Padfoot! Stay the course, the man thought; the beast obeyed. Muscle and sinew worked to breaking as Padfoot pushed himself to run harder, longer. I must reach Godric's Hollow. There is a foul stink to the air, and James and Lily are dead, he swore, and the thought caused his vision to redden and tunnel. A protruding root entered the dog's vision too late, and his front paw caught, twisted, and a sickening crunch filled the dark forest, followed by the agonizing screams of Sirius Orion Black, blood-traitor to his Noble and Most Ancient House, lying prostrate on the hard-packed earth, broken and bloody.

Sirius moved slowly to sit upright, and peered at his wrist with disdain. Blood flowed from the wound, staining the skin scarlet; a stark contrast to the white bone which gleamed like pearl in the moonlight. Sirius took his broken wrist delicately with his other hand. Pain shot up his arm, and Sirius wailed oaths and swears, and beat the ground with his feet. Sirius reached into his pocket and produced his wand. Placing the tip on his mangled wrist, Sirius invoked the incantation, “Ferula!” The body of the broken wizard wracked with convulsions as the bones in his wrist moved and relocated themselves. Jagged, torn skin knitted itself together and soft, white bandages which came from nowhere wrapped around Sirius' s wrist.

Despite the spell, his wrist was still very weak; the charms splinting and binding the broken wrist and mending the skin, but shattered bones take time to heal. Padfoot would be of no use to anyone this night. Sirius attempted to move his wrist, but the pain was too great, so, after carefully removing his jacket, ripped the garment into strips and quickly fashioned a sling before standing to take in the surroundings. He cursed his human eyes for their inability to see in through the creeping dark, but he could no longer run freely on four legs. The wind blew through the trees, and Sirius thought the chittering of the leaves sounded like Nature's soft laughter, mocking his dead friends, the broken wrist, and his motorcycle which had simply disappeared. "It must be at least ten miles to Godric's Hollow, and Albus said apparating is too dangerous. I can't run there on two legs. Bugger the old man. Harry must be made safe."

He pictured his best friend's home and felt space itself bend and fold around him, and suddenly Sirius was standing in front of the house, and at once he was sick. There was no mistaking the odor of ozone and sulfur the came with the use of dark magic. He pulled his wand from pocket, and the wood felt very heavy in his hand and he crept toward the entrance. The door had been blown off the hinges so only a black hole remained. Somehow, to Sirius, it appeared darker inside the house. The wizard squared his shoulders, aimed his wand, and broke the surface of the darkness.

Inside the house, Sirius could smell pine needles, birch wood, and sickly-sweet flowers mixed with the metallic odor of blood. "Is anyone there?," Sirius whispered. A creak in the floor made Sirius start, when a black-clawed hand covered his mouth and pulled him into a death embrace. He felt cold, jagged glass at his throat and the chittering of the leaves in the trees when suddenly, "Avada Kedavra!" A black blade flashed in Sirius's peripheral vision and first his eye felt cold, then his gaze reddened, and the slight weight of his attacker fell away.

"Such a little thing", Sirius thought as his eyes pierced the unmoving mass on the floor. His attacker had nut-brown skin dappled here and there with white spots, like that of a deer, on which a cuirass made of bark hung loosely. The creature had four-fingers, each of which was tipped with a glistening black talon. Sirius also took note of large, out-turned ears and great, open eyes with yellow pupils like a cat's, vertically slit and cold, calculating, "intelligent", Sirius finished. An obsidian dagger was clutched in one taloned hand, with runes unknown to Sirius carved on blade and hilt.

Sirius put his fingers to his brow and they came away red. The wizard cursed silently and turned to face his savior. Before him stood a slight, dark figure, with the gaunt, sallow face and greasy black hair of Severus Snape.

"Thank you, Sni- Severus. You saved my life," Sirius said, and met the other man's eyes, and saw not anger from Sirius's half-use of Snape's boyhood nickname, but an empty sorrow.

“There's no crying,” Snape's voice broke on the last word; letting it hang in the air. Realization broke on Sirius's face, and he sprinted up the stairs, ignoring the pain coursing through his body from long miles on four legs. At the top of the stairs, at the end of the hallway, lay his best friend and brother, James, eyes open and staring at nothing. There was silence coming from the open doorway near James's body, and crossing the threshold, Sirius, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, collapsed to his knees, and tears came streaming down his blood-stained face.


** I'd say there's a bit too much description, and that it gets in the way of the story. The reader can imagine most things for themselves and doesn't need to be told how everything looks and smells.

*** The ozone smell is my interpretation through Sirius's altered anatomy from being an animagus, which I believe wasn't addressed in the books. I could definitely be wrong, though. And yes, it is indeed an ice and fire crossover, but not only hp and asoiaf.

** Fanfiction =/= Cannon

The amount of description doesn't detract from the story at all: same with the smell. You're setting the stage for your story, the one that you are making even if you are borrowing pieces from someone else's story.

Also remember this is first draft stuff, there will be changes to the wording to get things inline by the end of it all.

** Not bad, but there are a few things:

- Why is Sirius running from such a long distance? Why not apparate as closely as possible and run the rest of the (presumably short) distance?

  If Sirius does break his wrist, I would think he could conjure himself a sling instead of having to make one from his clothing, or at least use magic to transform his jacket into a sling.

- I agree with another commenter. Use less detail in your description, especially of the creature.

- Why would someone whisper "Is anyone there?". It isn't smart to give yourself away if you suspect an enemy, and even if you do want someone to answer, you would want it the question heard---you would probably shout, not whisper.

- I would not refer to Severus as a "figure". I think I would also leave out the nickname. Even though Sirius may call him "Snivelus" to his face, I think Sirius associates the man with the name "Severus" in his head (my interpretation of the character), and circumstance would not have him using a derogatory nickname. Maybe:

  Sirius turned to face his savior---a tall, gaunt man with a large hooked nose.

  "Severus?" Sirius asked. "You..." he took a moment to process. "You've just saved my life."

- Silence is not a thing that travels. Silence does not come through a doorway. "No sound traveled through the empty doorway."

*** First off, I'd like to thank you for your time and for your comments and criticism. Sirius not originally apparating to Godric's Hollow has been up for debate with my best friend and my fiance, who both share your opinion. In the final draft, that will definitely be changed. I don't like the idea of magic without cost, so after his healing spell, he's very tired, unable to use the energy to transfigure his coat, unlike apparating, which I have been told is as easy as visualizing the place you wish to go. How would you change my description of the creature? I agree with your comment about "is anyone there?" I also enjoy your reworking of the interaction with Snape. The idea of silence and darkness as physical "things" will come into play down the line in the story.

#+begin_quote
  The black dog called Padfoot ran through the moon-lit forest; looming oak, maple, and holly trees cast gaunt caricatures along the earthen floor.

Say "The dog ran, the word PADFOOT in raised stitching on his collar. Its black coat flickered as it passed through shadows cast by looming (xyz)trees

Though since he might not have a collar, you could cut the name out entirely. Act as tho the reader is peering through a window,describe what they're seeing, not what they should know.
