I haven't seen any HP/Fate crossovers before, but instead of digging around looking for gold amidst trash, I figured I'd ask for any recommendations y'all might have.

Also, thinking up the post's title got me thinking of an idea:

Voldemort, seeing his defeat draw near, makes a pact with either Gaia or the Grail in a last ditch bid for immortality. Becoming some foreign bint's slave in a small scale war game wasn't what he wanted.
