I would love to see if there's any new stories where someone makes sure that all the Death Eaters from the first war get properly punished for their actions and insures that they can't get away with the Impervius defense.


** Not new, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][Anything but Slytherin]], linkffn(4269983), should qualify.

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.
