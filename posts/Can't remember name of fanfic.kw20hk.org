I need some help finding a fanfic but I can't remember the name. The fanfic is about harry leaving hogwarts and going to Italy I think and he trains with vampires and uses time turners to go back a lot so not a lot of time passes. Then sometime later in the book he is training with elves but here they have some kind of bubble which makes time go slower inside so can spend more time in there but not a lot of time passes outside. There is a lot of sword fighting too.

Pls help me find it, please and thank you!!
