To expand on the title, I'm curious if there's a story (or stories out there) where Dumbledore and Harry go on adventures together (either in the multiverse or in the plain ol' verse), with Harry being the dumb kid who barely gets anything right, and Dumbledore is the definitely insane, overly zany, sociopathic alcoholic with drug problems (lemon drops in this case would be crack rocks or something), who is smarter than literally everyone. In other words, canon Voldemort would stand no chance against this guy. Obviously, this story would be humorous--perhaps bordering on crackfic.


** Here's a quick little something I whipped up, LF for something like this (please excuse any grammar or other mistakes):

"So, you see my boy, I did it all for the greater good,” Professor Dumbledore said, a slight twinkle in his eyes as he drawled out in his antique, kindly old accent.

Harry, of course, had a hard time understanding why Dumbledore had taken literally every last galleon he owned, and how giving it all to the Weasleys was part of the greater good. Ever since Voldemort's return this past summer, he felt like his whole world was collapsing in around him---and no one was telling him the truth about anything! When he finally went out to get answers himself, he learned the horrible truth: that Dumbledore had made him poorest student at Hogwarts.

But he couldn't grow despondent. Perhaps the Professor was right, after all. The Ministry were the true villains of the present, denying Voldemort's return while simultaneously putting a toad in charge of overseeing Hogwarts. They nearly expelled him after a dementor tried to suck his soul out. To make matters worse, they were forcing him to marry Daphne Greengrass, or Milicent Buttstrode, or Tracy Davis, or any other number of women Harry was pretty sure didn't actually exist, all part of a ‘marriage law' which he had never heard of until this summer and was pretty sure came out of nowhere.

“I think I understand,” Harry said. “You took all of my money, to defeat Voldemort.”

Dumbledore's eye twinkled at that. “Ahh, my boy, I did it for the greater good.”

“You already said that.”

“Mmm yes, the greater good.”

“Which is to defeat Voldemort?”

“Mmm,” Dumbledore said, before reaching into his pockets and pulling out a little yellow candy. “Lemon drop?”

As Harry reached out to grab the candy, a greyish-black streak of light hit the Professor square in the chest. Dumbledore, his hand still outstretched, carrying the little lemon drop immediately started to age more---his wrinkles became more pronounced, his hair grew out, his teeth fell out. Harry watched in horror as the Professor's eyes bulged out and disintegrated, followed quickly by the remainder of his skin. Now a skeleton, the once mighty wizard started to crumble into dust and ashes, floating away with the slightest breeze.

Harry couldn't help but inhale some of Dumbledore; he had only just realized his mouth had been open the whole time. His first thought went to Voldemort, that he had finally quashed his old nemesis. But then, he considered the Ministry, and how much they hated Dumbledore. He looked behind slowly, towards the door leading up to Dumbledore's office. Standing in the doorway was Dumbledore himself, albeit a Dumbledore with a shorter beard and crazier hair and no glasses. Harry looked back at the now naked robes that once contained the former Professor. Yep, it was still there.

“What?” Harry asked as his mind raced into a million pieces.

The other Dumbledore burped, walking past him as he did, before reaching down and grabbing the lemon drop originally offered to Harry. With a swish of his wand, the other Dumbledore vanished the original Dumbledore, and with that job done, to a swig out of a flask of what appeared to be a bottle of skelegrow. With another burp, he turned back to Harry.

“Who are you?” Harry asked.

“Geez Harry,” he said, burping out the word Harry. “I knew you weren't the brightest kid in school, but I thought you were smarter than that.”

“You're Dumbledore?” Harry asked.

“Duh, who else would I be?” Harry's mind raced to Voldemort. The new Dumbledore bit into the lemon drop he reclaimed from his other deceased self, before spitting it out. “Actual candy. Can, can you believe that old codger, Harry? Here Harry, try this.” Dumbledore reached into his pockets, pulled out a plastic baggy, and retracted a single yellow rock.

“Wha, what is this?” Harry asked as he bit cautiously into the odd-looking lemon drop.

“It's Goblin crack,” Dumbledore said. “Let this be a lesson to you kid. Don't---” he stopped to burp, “accept candy from old men.”

“Crack, you mean like drugs?” Harry asked as his eyes widened and he felt a slight tingling in his extremities.

“Keep up, Harry,” Dumbledore said, taking a handful of the rocks and shoving them down his own gullet. “Yes, drugs.”

“Oh man, Professor, I can't be doing drugs at school.”

Before Dumbledore could respond, Harry noticed he was falling into a world filled with Cho Changs and naked Hermiones. Voldemort was there too, singing about long lost loves and the beauty of the world. Harry fell further, into the wide-open mouth of a hem-hemming Umbridge, inside of which he found Santa's workshop, with the elves replaced by mini-Hagrids. Together, they made beautiful dragon babies and used them to claw out Snape's eyes. Then, they spelled the words out, ‘THE GREATER GOOD', before disintegrating into ash.

“Harry, wake up,” a voice said. Something hit him across the face, and he was suddenly back in Dumbledore's office, lying on the floor in the fetal position. This strange, new Dumbledore was still there, the old Dumbledore lost to memory.

“Wha-what happened?” he asked.

“Goblin crack, Harry,” Dumbledore said. “Looks like it was your first time. You were out for a whole day.”

“A whole day?” Harry asked. “But what about my classes?” If Hermione ever found out about this...

“Kid,” Dumbledore burped. “These classes, school, it's all pointless. Which is why you're going to help me.”

“Help you do what?”

“Everything. I need a new assistant. Last one got squanched up.”

“But what happened to the other Dumbledore? And what about Voldemort? And Hogwarts?” Harry asked, each question raising his own anxiety.

“What Harry, you think that Dumbledorp was the real deal? Harry, that was a parasitic fae that fed off your life forces.”

“Really?” Harry asked. “How'd it get inside the castle?”

“I let it inside, Harry. I needed someone to take my place while I did actually important stuff.”

“Wait, you let that thing inside the castle? What the hell, Professor?”

“Well, first, Harry, I'm not a Professor. Haven't been once since the 40s.” Dumbledore stopped to take another shot of skelegrow. “Second, Harry, I've had several dopplegangers, clones, or alternate reality versions of me take over this headmaster gig for a while now.”

“Wait, so this is the first time I'm meeting you? The real you?”

“Yep, life's a real bitch, isn't it Harry? You thought I was the Yoda to your parents' Obi-Wan, turns out, the Yoda to your parents was actually an intelligent life-sucking force, like my ex-wife.”

“You were married?”

“Three times, though that business with Grindlewald doesn't count. Now, c'mon Harry, we've spent too much time tripping balls. We need to find another replacement me to do this dumb job.”

“But what about Voldemort? And the Ministry?”

“Spoiler alert, Voldemort dies and the Ministry doesn't do jack shit, Harry.”

"How do you know he'll be defeated?” Harry asked.

“Ugh, c'mon Harry, it's the basic arc of storytelling. Bad guy does bad things, good guys do Goblin crack, and eventually, these things sort of sort themselves out.” Dumbledore made a circle with his wand, opening up a clear portal to an entirely different place. “Now, c'mon, my order should be about done.”

  Harry gets summoned by a trans-dimensional police force, known as the Council of Dumbledores. You thought one Dumbledore was hard to deal with; how about a thousand? No pairings.

** While I can't imagine such a fic has already been written, I imagine you'd greatly enjoy the no-fucks-given characterisation of Dumbledore in linkffn(Itachi, is that a baby?). Also Harry's got a few screws loose as well (along with one or two minor homicidal tendencies, but considering who raised him, that's pretty much a best-case scenario).

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
