Could be from old age, a fight against Voldemort, something else entirely.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing)

Would rather not have Weasley Bashing, if at all possible.

  On that dreadful night, Albus Dumbledore is struck down by his friend and fellow staff member, Severus Snape, whilst the Death Eaters watch on in glee and Harry in horror. Seconds after the Curse strikes him, Albus finds himself waking up in the seven year-old body of Harry Potter. Reincarnated as the Boy-Who-Lived he now has to find a way to defeat Voldemort once and for !HP
