:END:
I'm searching for a story that I read a little while ago but forgot to bookmark. In this story, Molly is put on trial for crimes against Harry and during that trial she reveals that she had cheated on Arthur and Percy, Ron, and Ginny have different fathers. Ron's is named as Fudge but I forget the others. Ginny however claims that Arthur is her father no matter what and Percy agrees. Ron says hurtful things and Arthur finds himself unable to find any kindness in his heart and points him to appealing to his real father.

If anyone knows this fix, I would be appreciate being told the title.

Pretty sure this was FF.net but I also use AO3 so I might be wrong.


** Wait what?

Ron Weasley sounds alot better than Ron Fudge

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
