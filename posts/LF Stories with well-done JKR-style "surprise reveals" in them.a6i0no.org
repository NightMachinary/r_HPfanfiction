The first time I read the books, I didn't expect Quirrell to be the bad guy, that Ginny was behind the basilisk, that Sirius Black wasn't a bad guy, and that Moody wasn't really Moody. These surprise reveals, which JKR took care to leave all sorts of clues about throughout each of the books, are probably one of my favorite things about canon.

I've really been in the mood for stories with similar, well thought-out surprises in them, and would appreciate recommendations. The closest I can think of is /The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks/, but I'm sure there must be more. I don't care if the "reveal" is the main point of the story or just an important element in it. Nor do I care at all about pairings. Just a story with a good, well-written, thoughtful surprise.

Any ideas?\\
EDIT: Thank you all for these great suggestions. I'm bummed that I've read most of them already (though maybe others will benefit from these suggestions), but there's a few I've not seen, so thanks!


** linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) is recommended here by a lot of people, but it's the most similar to the JKR books in my opinion.

Only problem is that Taure updates irregularly and has abandoned promising concept fics in the past, so there's no guarantee of its completion.

I apologize that this is the best I can do, but Taure is a frustratingly excellent author. I only wish there was a way to make his stories update themselves.

*** For what it's worth, until November 2018 Victoria Potter was updated fairly regularly at a pace of around 1 chapter a month. Since November I have been having some medical problems with my hands which have resulted in my not really being able to type during my free time. Hopefully these problems will get better.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

*** Taure writes the story as if the reader had no clue about Harry Potter. Which is good for newcomers but tedious if you already know the basics of the worldbuilding because you have read the books a few times and then spent years in the fanfiction community.

***** I'm not saying that he is trash or anything, far from it.

But he even admitted that it is written to be an independent work, not leaning on any canon knowledge the reader might have. Which makes "Victoria Potter" tedious to read IMO. Obviously your mileage may vary, but after a few years with fanfics and a couple of rereads of the books, I simply can't stand the "introduction" parts anymore.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
