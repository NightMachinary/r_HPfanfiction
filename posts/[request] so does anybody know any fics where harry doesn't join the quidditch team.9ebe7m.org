yeah, asking about this. xD anybody got any out there? maybe where he does chess or exploding snap tournaments or something else? or maybe he just likes to study on his own? i don't know, i guess i'm just sick of seeing him freaking do the same quidditch practice malfoy thing and getting on the team and then doing the same quidditch match with quirrell and then more quidditch later and it's all really stupid and dumb. :D

also. yeah. when some fics actually make him do that same quidditch joining thing like in canon but then they don't even bother showing the matches or anything so it's like it doesn't even matter so why bother putting him on it again...that's so dumb and a waste of everyone's time!


** I read a fic where he genuinly sees playing on the team as his punishment which completely bewilders Ron, unfortunately i forgot the title

** Yes, Even I hate Quidditch, especially in 6th Year, I mean, there is a Dark Lord after him, and all he thinks of is ... Quidditch, The moment it should have reached a crescendo, it falls back to .... Quidditch, I think that's why there are so many after OOtP divergent fics, rants aside I can name a few.\\
Seventh Horcrux By: Emerald Ashes linkffn(10677106) in which Voldemort/Harry is afraid of broom itself.\\
Beyond the Pale By: Araceil linkffn(5778267) - WBWL Harry is apathetic to anything, in spite of being an excellent flier, he turns down Flitwick's offer quickly and he also brushes off Malfoy's taunts.

  What if, in fifth year, Harry did just that? An independent Harry story with some OOC, no real bashing, but not a big fan of some of the big players. No pairings. Rating for some curse words. First attempt at publishing on this site... we'll see.

  Fourth year. Living with the Dursleys taught Harry three all important rules. These rules cause an emotionally repressed 11 year old to attend Hogwarts and discover his so called dead family aren't as dead as he believed.
