So I have an idea in my head that Parseltongue can be used as healing, but considering that Voldemort doesn't care about people he would never heal anyone.

But Harry on the other hand finds out that he can heal himself/people better by using his Parseltongue ability. AKA Parseltongue Healing.

I was wondering if this concept has been used before (or something like it) and if it had, if anyone could link me any stories.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not then a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash


** To Shape and Change by Blueowl has parselmagic healing as a major aspect of the plot. It's a fic where Snape comes back in time from a future where things didn't go well in the war (can't remember if the horcrux's were included or not) and mentored Harry to bring about a better future. Both Harry and Snape are the main characters.

*** There were no Horcruxes in that one. It's implied that Voldemort performed a bunch of dark rituals to extend his life and survive bodily death, which only worked once.

**** Yeah, I saw that in the linkffn summary after I posted and remember now. It's been a while since I read the story. I think it works well and keeps it from getting bogged down rehashing too much.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

*** Eh I looked into it, it says a few bad Weasley's in the warnings. How bad is the bashing? I really love the Weasley's and don't particularly like seeing them bashed.

**** It is mostly Ron with some Ginny. The reasons why both Harry and those two act the way they do is nicely handled imo. not just knock Ron for Ron, but rather uses him as a point and foil. Molly and all the rest are treated very well with some looks at the extended Weasley clan later in the story,

***** Mhm, I might end up reading it later, as long as it's not all the Weasley's being bashed, I really love the Weasley's a lot, but yeah I'll likely still read it. Thank you for answering. :)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
