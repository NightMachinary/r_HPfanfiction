It would probably be accurate to say that most cursebreaking adventures take place in Egypt. That makes sense. There's historical justification for elaborate, treasure-filled tombs protected by gruesome curses. Thanks to movies like The Mummy, it's a part of popular culture and thus feels familiar and comfortable to the reader.

But let's say you wanted to be a special snowflake. After all, Egypt, or say El Dorado in South America, are so mainstream. What other less known but interesting locations would you pick?

Yeah, I'm fishing for ideas. I thought about making something up, like let's say an ancient goblin city, but something with a link to real world might work better.


** The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_the_First_Qin_Emperor][Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor]] in China contains a 'palace' hidden at the center of the mound which has never been excavated. That could be a good place for new curse-breaking discoveries. The terracotta warriors have featured in several Hollywood movies, similar to the mummies of Egypt, but a Harry Potter universe take on it might be interesting.

Ireland and Scotland contain many neolithic [[http://www.paleo-camera.com/Megaindex.htm][passage graves]] which were made to only admit sunlight to the end of the passage on specific dates (solstice or equinox). A curse-breaking expedition could discover that a magical gateway hidden in the passage grave only opens for a few minutes while the light touches a specific carving. Perhaps muggle excavations/building destroyed the alignment, thus accidentally sealing the gateway but the curse-breaking expedition restores it. Some of the most well known passage graves are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange][Newgrange]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maeshowe][Maeshowe]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowth][Knowth]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowth][Dowth]].

*** I think some modern myths are also interesting:

- Area 51: could it be a secret base run by both the US military and MACUSA?

- Denver International Airport: another secret magical site? Google for “DIA conspiracy” if you are unfamiliar with it.

- Secret Nazi hideout in Antarctica: or the last refuge of Grindelwald remnants?

- The former USSR had many secret bases and even towns, some of them seemingly abandoned and really creepy: Protvino Scientific Center, Zagorsk-6, Arzamas-16, Sverdlovsk-45, Object 221, Vozrozhdeniya Island...

- The above names are just some of the sites known to the public. What about those that are truly classified and in secret? The collaboration of modern military, intelligence services, and elements of the Magical World could be far more extensive than even before the implementation of the SoS. There was after all great need to protect and defend against weapons of mass destructions.

** Any place related to Paganism, including the Norse stuff. So Scandinavia, Iceland, Greenland, Lithuania and possibly Germany and Canada (Leif Erikson).

You could go for Roman/Byzantine Ruins, which means most of Europe and the Mediterranean. Hellenistic ruins might go from Italy up to the Indus river.

The Kievan Rus would be an interesting avenue because they mix pagan and orthodox elements and eastern European folklore (which is badass and might be the magical world instead of myths). So mostly the European part of Russia and Ukraine.

Possibly the Holy Land if you want to go with "Crusader Artefacts were enchanted items " route. So the holy lance would be magical and the Holy Grail might even be Hufflepuff's cup for all we know.

And lastly, Atlantis/the Aegean Islands. Minoan culture, Santorini, the Minotaur and its maze, stuff like that.

Edit: And let's not forget about the obvious choice, celtic ruins or something from the Arthurian Saga.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** Wikipedia's got a huge list that I used when researching for a fic. It's a good jumping off point with quick little explanations in the right column of what/where the cities are supposed to be. Hope this helps!

** I'd go for the tomb of a wizarding Emperor of China. Unknown to the Muggles as he was written out of history to preserve the Statute of Secrecy.

The Tomb will resemble the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor with rivers of mercury ant Terracotta Warriors. Except of course it will be also warded by ancient and powerful spells, the rivers of mercury will serve a magical purpose and the Terracotta Warriors will be preserved, animated and enchanted with special glyphs that grants them the ability to reform when destroyed after several minutes.

Harry and Co will have to deactivate wards, find and disarm traps. Carefully traverse dark hallways riddled with immortal warriors and and the reward? Who knows? Could be an amazing sword equal in power to the Sword of Gryffindor? Or maybe a staff that amplifies a users spells to the point that it could be used to flatten entire castles? Or how about ancient spells written in ancient chinese on fragments of bone chips held together by string? By unrolling them you form a scroll like shape.

Another idea is Atlantis, hidden from Muggle eyes but protected by long forgotten wards and traps and guarded by a tribe of Merfolk who are actually the cursed citizens of Atlantis.

** Quite a few South American places maybe? Maybe focusing on the Mayans places.
