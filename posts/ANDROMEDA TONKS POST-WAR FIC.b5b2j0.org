A while back I read this fic (pretty sure it was on AO3) and I can't seem to find it.

What I remember about it was:

-post-war

-either Draco or Narcissa (I cant remember who but I think it was Narcissa) had come to live with andromeda while waiting for their trials

-andromeda is very resentful of the Malfoys because they are all alive while she lost her husband and daughter

-eventually either Draco or Narcissa (whoever of the two wasn't living with her originally) also comes to live with her following their trial

-I feel like the fic was around 7k or 9k and was one chapter

-I think it was written in second person

If anyone knows what fic I'm talking about please hit me up. I've tried searching on ao3 but I can't find it

(Sorry if I'm posting this twice I'm not sure if it was my internet or something that's part of the sub that I just don't understand)
