the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, *a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke.*


** I mean, I doubt much would change. Just another inferius in the lake.

*** Just nitpicking: I don't think he is an inferius. For that you need an affirmative magical action, and given Tom has not entered the cave between installing the magic there (and creating all those inferi) and the day before The Battle of Hogwarts, there was nobody to change Regulus body into a one.

**** The point here is that he appears to be one.

The only possible explanation for him being one would have been some sort of enchantment that works over a field, but I consider that incredibly likely to the point of negligibility.

But to Harry, the body would simply have been another inferius.

**** unless being killed by an inferius transfers that power to the corpse.

***** While possible, that kind of detail would surely have been mentioned in-universe, if only to compare Inferi to werewolves.

****** i always assumed that's why the potion made them thirsty. so they'd walk to their own deaths. otherwise he could just have used a poison.

**** Fully agree with this!

Inferi are created through complex necromantic spells, per JKR. Regulus either drowned, or succumbed to wounds inflicted by the inferi, or the potion, but nobody was there to reanimate him.

** Besides, a dead body in water that long? Even in cold water, it would have rotted away to boned by then, unless there were something in the water (unlikely, since the inferi looked to be preserved because of the process to create them).
