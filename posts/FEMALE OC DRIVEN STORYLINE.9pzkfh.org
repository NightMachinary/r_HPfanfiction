Hello! I'm looking for a piece that was several volumes long, but simply can't remember the name of it. The main character was an OC, who lived in North America until her guardian died and she was taken back to Hogwarts with Dumbledore. Even though she is a year younger, the OC is in Harry's year. She makes the golden trio a quartet. I can remember random plot details such as she and Hermione get kidnapped for a bit, OC falls in love with a Hufflepuff student, and is later revealed to the characters as Harry's sister, though it is shown in the opening chapter. I'm not sure which website I read it on, but considering my regular browsing is on fan fiction, this group might be my best bet!
