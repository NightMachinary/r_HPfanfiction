I read The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity, and it makes a lot of sense that the woman who took down Bellatrix Lestrange was a badass duellist in her youth.

I need more of the "NOT MY DAUGHTER YOU BITCH" as compared to "Oh gee... Let me dose my youngest son's best friend with a love potion and get him to marry my daughter. Also, my only other role in the fic is to cook food in which I'll pour said love option"

Any fics in which Harry finds out about her skills, or she displays it more often and is really badass.

  When Molly first met Harry at Kings Cross, she thought he was a boy from an orphanage who discovered he was something more. It was only after her children claimed to have rescued The-Boy-Who-Lived from a locked room and barred windows did Molly find herself standing on the porch of 4 Privet Drive, smiling warmly at a petrified Petunia while offering baked goods.Warnings Tagged & Listed.
