  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. What he finds instead is an alternate universe. Harry is recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe.

** Not as parental figures but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11593337/1/This-Time-The-Potters][This time the Potters]] by Fairywm, post-canon!MoD!Harry goes back in time to save his parents and little Harry. 115k words, complete

You'll need to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11434139/1/A-Brand-New-Start][A Brand New Start]] first though(TTtP is a sequel). 152k words, complete.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] by White Squirrel, Cat!Harry runs away from the Dursleys and is adopted by the Grangers. 697k words, complete(sequel has rare updates).

And I'm sure there are plenty others where Harry is adopted by others(Snape *shudder*) or time travels and lives in a tent(my favorite was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer), or never made it to the Dursleys(like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] by Witowsmp), but I cant think of them.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

** Most fics where Harry was with Dursleys and then ends up with his parents after are usually a Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived fic, with parents and a twin who put no effort into understanding Harry once they realize he isn't a carbon copy of his twin. This leads to him (usually) becoming a Slytherin, widening the gap between Harry and his family. Bashing included sometimes.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
