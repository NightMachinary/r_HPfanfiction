Posting this to this subreddit, because I have more faith in this community being open minded as opposed to [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]].

Let's start straight off the bat with the obvious. Ron and Hermione's fighting is not cute. Small amounts of arguing and bickering are perfectly acceptable and can even enhance a relationship, but frequently giving each other the silent treatment or leaving the other person angry at the world is not grounds for a healthy romantic relationship. If it happened once or twice, it wouldn't be a big deal. But the fact that them falling out becomes almost a casual occurrence is worrying. I remember in one of the later books, there was a line about them refusing to talk to each other and Harry didn't seem alarmed at all, something I find to be a cause for concern. Yes, I know that Hermione enjoys bickering. But I don't believe for a moment that she enjoys consistently falling out with her friends.

The obvious counterargument is that once they're together and have grown up, they wouldn't fight anymore. And sure, that's technically possible; but for that to happen, both people have to show that they've matured to a drastic degree. There is admittedly not much to go on for Ron and Hermione, but in the epilogue, Ron admits to confunding his driving instructor. And then tries to start a rivalry between his and Malfoy's children. Neither of which are the greatest signs of growth. Besides, it's not like Ron and Hermione's patience for each other ever increases throughout any of the later books whatsoever.

Though with that said, if they were together, I don't know what they'd bicker over anyway. Once Harry and the war are out of the equation, what do they have to talk about? They don't have any hobbies or passions in common. Hermione doesn't wanna hear about Quidditch and Ron doesn't wanna hear about the laws she's enforcing or what book she's into. I imagine that when they were alone in Hogwarts, their only subject matter was Harry and homework. And once that's gone, I imagine they'd both find themselves rather bored, assuming they aren't fighting over something.

Another thing to note is that Hermione canonically works at the Ministry. I think we can all agree that Hermione would accomplish incredible feats in her future and chances are Ron would have a hard time not getting jealous of her. I know he appreciates her once in a while, but there are also times like when they get back from apparition class and Ron is annoyed by how good at it she was. There'd be a very blatant balance issue in their relationship that I can't see getting solved easily. But even if Ron wasn't bothered by that at all, it's still almost guaranteed that he would easily get jealous of Hermione or something related to her every once in a while. And Hermione would not have the tolerance for it.

Also, people like to insinuate that Ron makes Hermione laugh and gets her to have fun. But throughout the series, Hermione only laughs at Ron's humour once or twice, three times at the very most. And on the rare occasion that she does laugh, everyone else does as well so it isn't a unique thing between her and Ron. Of course you could say that maybe she always laughs with him when they're alone, but if Rowling was willing to write them falling out so often, then surely she could throw in more moments of them laughing together as well. Fact of the matter is there are significantly more moments of them getting mad at each other.

I think both characters would have ultimately been happier with other people. Though with that said, I can't imagine much of a relationship between Ron and any girl in the series. But if I had to place him with anyone, then it would be someone who would be willing to take care of him without getting annoyed at him and seeing him how he wants to be seen. Out of the women in canon, Lavender fits that description the best. Maybe they could get back together when they're adults.

Idk, if you guys have ideas for better outcomes for both Ron and Hermione, don't hesitate to share them.

TLDR: Fighting isn't cute, Ron's inferiority complex would cause issues, neither characters have much in common.


** I think Rowling was trying to go for a Han/Leia kind of "bickering love" dynamic but they were just too vicious with each other most of the time for it to work.

Having said that, I see Hermione being the cause of more issues in that relationship than Ron.

Eh, I think they'd be fairly equal. As many or more of their canon fights are because of Ron sticking his foot in his mouth or making assumptions that are pretty bad if one thinks about them, as they are caused by Hermione's self-righteousness and uptightness.

** Personally I agree with you. I am someone that bickers/debates for fun, and it's very much not the sort of bickering that Ron/Hermione have. Their bickering is nasty and personal, it has all these undercurrents of things wrong between them. They don't bicker on an equal footing either, Hermione has an always right complex, and Ron has an inferiority complex, and that is just a really bad mix. You can't bicker in a fun way unless you are willing to be wrong half the time, if you aren't, you're just arguing.

Maybe (probably) they grew up and changed, but we have no way of knowing that or if they changed to be compatable because we didn't see it.

As to who they would be better with, the wizarding world is really small, maybe they'd be better off with none of them. For Ron, I don't think lavender is a possibility, it would be like someone who does crystal healing marrying someone who thinks that's rubbish, the respect just won't be there. I honestly think Ron would be best with a muggle, and they'd amaze each other with the wonders of the others world.

Hermione needs someone as intelligent as her, but at a similar stage of emotional maturity. That puts pretty much the entire cast out of the running. If it were the muggle world, she'd go to university and suddenly no longer be the most intelligent person there all the time, which I'd say would mature her, but the wizarding world doesn't seem to have that. Without uni, I'm not sure she would grow up to be a very nice person, but that's probably just me projecting. There a reason I (and a lot of others in this fandom) use Hermione as a self insert in fics. I was exactly her sort of insufferable as a kid.

THIS is why I think they fight so much. If you really pay attention it's usually Hermione who starts fights, who responds "acidly" and "waspishly" to something Ron has said. I think Hermione is frustrated with Ron because he isn't maturing as fast as she would like. While a lot of people like to describe their fighting as unresolved sexual tension, I think of it more as /resentment/ towards the other due to their confusing and potentially unreturned feelings. In addition to maturing and learning how to communicate better, I think that both of them knowing their feelings are returned would limit a lot of their arguments

** Just going to share my personal experience with this.

I think it can really go both ways. In school i was very much like Ron. Have a twin that i was always a bit jealous of (never to the point of abandonment or anything) and i emotionally grew up very late. I also had a friend who was a bit like Hermoine; extremely intelligent, but could be a bit abrasive at times. Had plenty of friends though. Over the years we've had our fair share of fights, dated each other and other people. We've had out low points and high points, but are now very much mellowed out and very much in love.

School is a weird place, and most people grow out of it eventually. I definitely changed a lot through my first relationship, through college, and through working in a professional setting. Ron and Hermoine can definitely work out. Both of them just need a couple extra years apart to really find themselves and grow.

** The one thing that could make the Hermione and Ron relationship somewhat realistic in my books is my own experience in how people mature during the early 20s. Its ridiculous. You'd imagine being done "growing up" with 20, but really, thats the point where the most profound part of growing up starts (or never happens, and those are the worst sort of adults around).

The reason why I ultimately think that the relationship would have a very hard time staying strong is the extreme difference in interests. Their only shared interest is Harry. Everything else is like night and day between the two. Where Ron is excited, Hermione is bored, and vice versa. I agree with people in the comments that there are many types of relationships out there. But in my 28 years of life, I have /never/ seen a happy one in which both don't share interests with each other. Those are the absolute exception, if not downright non-existent. With Harry it would be almost the same, but at least Hermione shares a certain Robin Hood mentality and has self-motivated ideals.

Thats also why I don't write the two together. I'm just not sold on their relationship. Quite frankly, their relationship is the least compelling of the main character relationships for me in the entire series.

*** It's possible to have a healthy relationship without sharing interests if both partners are supportive of the other's interests and make an effort to be involved.

Like the way that Hermione attends quidditch matches even though she doesn't appear to be interested in it, and supports (in her very Hermione way, which is to say in a borderline-criminal rules-are-for-other-people kind of way) Ron's wish to be on the team.

On the other hand, we never see Ron supporting any of her interests. He mocks her about SPEW, complains when she makes then study, whines about her reading and is jealous when she excels at something.

That is not the way you build a healthy relationship.

**** To play off your support point (if a bit tangentially), their interests are so different that what excites and motivates one bores and is forgettable to the other. I think that's a difficult thing to overcome, usually it makes a serious relationship not even on the minds of those dating as opposed to just having a bit of fun before calling it off. As a personal example, most people I know wouldn't have expected me to be engaged to the woman I am currently with because she's into fashion and works as an accountant right now, while I'm a software engineer and do a lot of nerdy math-y things on the side. But we have a lot of the same interests so it made things a lot easier than to build a bridge from nothing to relate to (oddly, we first met by bumping into each other while browsing for manga).

I don't agree. Not at all. Hermione is, for all her brilliance, annoying, its part of her character a big reason she is friends with Ron and Harry is she irritated everyone else. A lot of what makes Ron and Hermione work is they balance each other, together they're better than they could be apart. Hermione is terrible at playing nice with others. She always assumes she's right and isn't good at dealing with people who disagree. Regardless of if she is right or not it would make her a terrible person to work with. Ron acts as a moderating influence. He is far better with people skills from what we see. Compare Ron instantly becoming close with Seamus and Dean in book four to Hermione crying to Hagrid in book three.

They balance each other really well. People become more similar in relationships. The longer Hermione and Ron stay together the more tolerable Hermione becomes and the more focused Ron becomes.

Ron grows up more than any one not called Neville over the series. Initially he hates being the side-kick but as the series grows on he realised that its sucks to be Harry and as his friend he should be there for him. Now, sure in book seven we see him say otherwise but the horcrux made them all say things they regretted. Ron goes on to say he instantly regretted it and didn't really mean in. Its why he comes back. Adult Ron wouldn't be jealous, he'd be proud before cracking a joke about how its all down to him that she'd got this far and without him a troll would have smeared her against a wall.

*** I don't think those examples make sense. Ron was already friends with Dean and Seamus, and himself caused the problem that stopped he and Harry from being friends. Hermione didn't want Harry and Ron to leave in PoA, but her actions caused her to temporarily lose both her best friends. It's not really comparable.

I don't think Ron grows up much in the series until random changes of opinion at the last moment (it's not even defensible to say his view change about house-elves was hamfisted). We never see him acknowledge that Harry has it worse, you can only infer that he should think that. But a large reason he left in DH is because he felt that he himself had it worse because he had more to lose (obviously there's some truth in this). He regretted leaving but as the Horcrux reveals his reasons for leaving did not change. He felt completely inadequate compared to Harry (in terms of what he could do or offer) and thought Hermione was going to pick him instead (to be honest, that part felt kind of pathetic since the two hadn't shared anything particularly intimate outside friend stuff).

So I don't think they really balance at all (and honestly, "balance" is kind of a bad way to go about relationships; compromise is probably a better thing to aim for). Ron's better at making friends than Hermione but also better at irritating people through lack of foresight and having the common cultural conceit (i.e. assuming that everything in society is basically Ok as it is, aside from the death Eater ideology). Hermione is on the other end, she's an activist type and doesn't care if the culture assumes something is ok, she'll fight to change it but as consequence can be over the top in her initial approach. Balance isn't always the answer, because the truth isn't always in the middle of two opposing views. And I don't think the two could compromise in a way that would satisfy them both, they want very different things out of life imo.

Two things. One, we don't much get to see the end result of his character development, but we do get to see his new resolve and confidence in his willingness to lead when he returned. He also didn't run from his emotions, like when explaining the ball of light, or second-guessing himself as he usually does. Ron's characterization and development are very subtle and nuanced and they're easy to overlook, but they're incredibly strong.

Two, his opinions on house elves didn't change. He knows the house elves don't want to be freed and that they take pride in their work, but he never expressed how much he valued them and their safety until the battle. The reason Hermione is so taken with him in that moment is because he puts the house elves first, knowing you shouldn't order them to die for you, even if you have the ability to do so.

He did have it worse. His sister was at Hogwarts, being tortured by the Carrows and his family was at risk were it that he was discovered. But what people don't bring up is that Ron didn't have to be there. Harry was Britain's most wanted and Hermione was muggleborn, thus they had no choice but to go on the run. Ron, however, is a pureblood and could have gotten along just fine at Hogwarts, but he chose to be there for his friends when he had no obligations to be.

He didn't feel inadequate, but he felt like he wasn't contributing due to his injury as well as his lack of knowledge of the task at hand. He spent weeks cooped up in a tent starving with nothing to do but twiddle his thumbs and listen to a radio station listing all of the casualties, strung out thinking he might hear a family member's name. And he didn't think Hermione was going to get with Harry, but it was a fear, as people see Harry as this heroic figure and he feared Hermione would prefer someone like that over him. He feared the girl he loved would do what everyone else had done and overlook him as nothing more than Harry's sidekick. And the locket took that insignificant fear and turned a seed into a gnarled root.

  Hermione is on the other end, she's an activist type and doesn't care if the culture assumes something is ok, she'll fight to change it but as consequence can be over the top in her initial approach. Balance isn't always the answer, because the truth isn't always in the middle of two opposing views.
#+end_quote

Except they're not opposing. It's not like Ron is against the things she's for, but he just doesn't have a dog in the fight. The wizarding world is very conservative and Ron has grown up with "that's the way things are". Not that he's against the change, but it's just a non-issue to him. And Hermione has never taken it personally when Ron and Harry don't wear SPEW badges, so she's fine being the only one advocating something. We also see that her and Ron align in their beliefs, even if Hermione is much more proactive in hers.

That was an explanation given after the fact (as Molly recognized), Ron never once acknowledges Harry thoroughly has life worse than him. He focused on his money, his fame, etc., while tacitly failing to recognize what those came at the expense of (namely, the death of his family). And you're being inconsistent. You're saying Ron knows Harry has it bad because of the bars on his windows and yet you're saying Harry has to explicitly tell him his Muggle relatives are bastards for him to be expected to recognize how badly Harry has things.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I literally said there was obviously truth in saying he had it worse. However, the second bit isn't true. He was perhaps the most obviously anti-Voldemort member of a family of blood traitors.

The Horcrux literally mentions how Ron felt inadequate and of secondary importance to his family and to Hermione as compared to Harry. That's why he says "I get it. You choose him." It was partly a specific fear that she wanted to be with Harry over him, hence the Horcrux kissing scene showing that. As stupid as it objectively was (well ok, it's my opinion but come on).

Ron explicitly sees a lot of the things Hermione is for as being pointless at best. He, like Hagrid, doesn't see anything wrong with house-elf enslavement (until, again, the ridiculous jump at DH's end). I know that's how Ron grew up, I literally said that. But that's the point, it's the antithesis of how Hermione views the morality of an issue (i.e. as distinct from cultural assumptions). "But the slaves like their slavery" will sound ridiculous to anyone as a justification for slavery, but it's not different than Ron's remarks aside from being the honest and direct statement of it. My point wasn't about the SPEW badges (even Harry, who was against house-elf enslavement, didn't want to wear them), it was that they approach and view things in diametrically opposed ways. Aside from opposing pureblood supremacy, I can't find any real similarity of view or mindset.

What Ron would be involved in is undoing pro-pureblood laws. He didn't care about the other changes Hermione was interested in. Hermione was interested in making deep changes to the very assumptions Ron makes about society. She was never content to get a thing and keep it, nor with wealth (well tbf, I'm unsure if Ron just hates being poor or if he wants to have lots of money), and she never cared about being famous nor about Quidditch, Ron never cared about theoretical magic stuff, etc. Ron's lack of development doesn't really leave anything objective for the reader to say they have in common outside there careers either.

There is literally nothing supporting this. Nothing contradicts what she says about them in canon and no one even tries to deny that they are slaves in canon (again, Ron's "but they like it" is the closest), the elves have it worse than slaves in the real world ever did. They could at least technically disobey their masters without an otherworldly force making them hurt themselvs.

Even when things are effed up in a country, most people (especially the young) will usually just take it all in as "that's just how things are, right?" For Ron, he's more than willing to fight the outright evils, but the stuff he never thinks about seem trivial to him even if an objective look makes it clear it shouldn't be that way. That's why his sudden shift near the end of DH always felt forced, because the previous four books had Ron rolling his eyes anytime the subject of freeing house-elves came up ("But they like it, right?"). That's very contrary to Hermione (and to an extent, Harry), who didn't grow up a wizard, and so can see how that arrangement is messed up and is presented as being deeply committed against letting such things stand.

Though Ron bashing tends to be popular, he is the most realistic teenager in the series IMO and showed the best character development. The relationship wouldn't work because Hermione is a difficult character to pair - she has a bit of a superiority complex due to being smarter than most others around her, but she doesn't have the natural social grace that would make her likeable. Other characters that are shown to be academically outstanding and magically powerful - several Weasley brothers, three of the Marauders, Tom Riddle, Dumbledore, etc. - were all also charming and knew how to draw people to them.

** With them fighting, I think the main cause of that was the stress they were both under with Harry. Even though they didn't /always/ fight about Voldemort/Death Eaters/Harry's dangerous missions, the worrying of if he'll pull through, if they'll pull through, and in Ron's case, if his entire family will pull through weighed down on them. Under monumental stress (a life and death scenario in their case), bickering is bound to branch out into other areas of their lives. And, truth be told, best friends bicker. About small stuff, even, that it becomes petty. Of course, I realize not all of Ron and Hermione's arguments stemmed from a "Voldemort-esque" conversation but especially in the fifth book, with Harry and Dumbledore being denounced as a teenager with a hero complex and a crackpot-old fool, Ron and Hermione had a lot to take on at such an early age - most of which many adults never go through in their entire lives. In book six, this was trivial but ever-day-life teenage drama and angst. There were so many instances where I saw the Ron-Hermione-Lavender love triangle play out when I was in high school.

As for Ron confuding the driving instructor, I took it as a misunderstanding of Ron's view of Muggles and the world they operate/live in. You could say that's an example of stunted growth from his point of view but I'll label it under one of his character flaws, of which every character in the story has. Even Hermione, who some on this Reddit would argue has the most flaws. Also, Ron said it was a minor issue as to why he didn't pass his driving test (he forgot to look in the wing mirror). And I don't believe he really intended to start a rivalry between Rose and Scorpius. I think he wanted his daughter to be the best, just like his wife and her mother. And when Ron tells Rose to "beat him [Scorpius] in every test," Hermione reprimands him and he concedes she's right.

#+begin_quote
  "So that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains."

  "Ron, for heaven's sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused. "Don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school!"

  "You're right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, "Don't get /too/ friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood."
#+end_quote

​

As for Ron getting jealous of her, I highly doubt that would happen either. Ron later went to work with George in Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, a highly-successful joke shop. According to Harry Potter Wiki, George and Ron "together were able to successfully turn [Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes] into an even more enormous money spinner." I don't understand why he'd be jealous of Hermione in that regard. Perhaps he'd be bored if she came home and talked about different laws she was pursuing and had high hopes in passing but I don't know if she would walk through the front door of their home, complaining about blocked-house-elf legislation. When I get home from work, I don't even want to talk/think about it after going through an entire day's-worth of it. I just want to relax and clear my head before I have to go back the following morning (unless it's the weekend).

​

I think Ron and Hermione enjoyed each other's company, mainly because they were good friends (and because Harry got so moody, especially in book 5 - which was when Ron and Hermione bickered between each other the most yet still managed to put up a united front when Harry lashed out at them because of it). But you can also have intimate feelings with your significant other without laughing or having fun. It's of a more serious and deepened passion that connects you and someone else. I'm not saying Ron and Hermione had this with each other (they might've) but fun and antics can only last for so long.

​

With that novel out of the way, while I do understand (and even like) Ron and Hermione together to a certain degree, I like to think Harry and Hermione would've worked well together ONLY IN ADULTHOOD! I can't stress that enough. But if that's so, where does that leave Ron? Don't kill me, but I always liked the idea of him and Luna together. But even then, how long could those two last together?

  Snape is just misunderstood
#+end_quote

Well, I tried talking about it in a post about Snape in [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. Basically, what I said was that there were a lot of double standards in how fans (and I mean, people on that sub) responded to the characters - so, for example, Snape is treated as this irredeemable, psychotic and violent creep, while someone like Pettigrew who actually betrayed two of his best friends, sending them to certain death, and sent another to Azkaban based on a wrongful conviction for a crime /he himself/ committed, basically gets a pass and is more or less ignored.

And boy, did people become defensive and angry. It was as if Snape had gone and burnt down their house or something.

This sub, on the other hand, has always allowed a fruitful discussion on contentious topics, even if no one can come to a consensus. Maybe, it's because, if you read fanfiction, you believe in alternate interpretations.

***** Not to take this too off-topic, but I think the Pettigrew thing has more to do with the fact that he's so obviously pathetic and sad. He doesn't even stand up for himself. Snape on the other hand is more self confident and stands up for himself, so that probably invites people to want to argue against him.

Oh and just in case you need ammunition in your Pettigrew arguments: When people or Peter himself claim that he had to give up the Potters because Voldemort would have killed/tortured him, that's a lie. The secret of a Fidelius must be given freely - he was not coerced, as he could not have spoken the secret under duress.

At one point, the mob became so aggressive in their arguments that I was forced to believe that there was something wrong with my character and beliefs because I did not find the Snape-Lily dynamic creepy.

The funny thing though was that it was a quite divisive issue, because I remember the vote count for one of my comments defending Snape kept fluctuating between positive and negative!

Anyway, who cares? People believe what they want to believe.

I also can't believe how much less hate Bellatrix and Pettigrew get, compared to Snape. Because force feeding a toad a potion is the same thing as causing the deaths of your best friends or torturing people insane.

Also many people like to argue that Lily and James died because Snape told Voldemort the prophecy. But who (willingly) told Voldemort that they were in Godric's Hollow? Pettigrew.

We see instances of Snape trying to repair his mistakes; in PoA Pettigrew just whimpered about how scared he was.

Romione shippers usually try to win this argument with a figure of speech "opposites attract" - even though that idiom never really means "entirely opposite", but is usually meant in another way: People who complement each other attract. Problem is, Ron and Hermione aren't actually complementary to each other. It's not like Hermione likes to talk and Ron is a good listener. Or Ron likes to eat and Hermione likes to cook/provide. They both like to talk. They both like to eat (Hermione eats books). They couldn't even find common ground on how to spend a single afternoon together (if they weren't too busy studying or helping Harry).

That's an interesting interpretation. I've always read it as "I have so much shit going on with my head right now I'm just going to say things I don't mean and /slam the door/ and go brood."

That's stupid. Hermione could have just gone to Australia and lived with her parents at any point. Even Harry - to an extent - could have run away from the confrontation, at least for a while (depending on how much you believe in prophecy)

Ron, in fact, has no choice, because he has a huge family of blood traitors, who are most likely unwilling to move to another country and might be tortured or worse under Voldemort's regime. He is also the most reliant on a functioning British Wizarding Society, because he'd be incapable and unwilling to live in secret as a muggle.

Krum is also self-motivated like Hermione. When Hermione needs to spend hours at home studying and working by herself, Krum would be able to leave her be and get on with his own things, without the need to interrupt her. Ron feels like a more high maintenance partner, who needs others around him to feel entertained.

**** Oooh! I have some thoughts on this. I don't have a particular girl per se, but a type of girl who I think would match Ron. If we look at the women Ron has been attracted to before Lavender (who we don't really have a physical description of) Fleur and Madam Rosmerta have both been ultra-feminine women. He also seems to like Hermione's forthrightness, and this is a trait she shares with Fleur. I think a shy, subtle or demure personality would go right over Ron's head, and likely lose his interest quickly.

I think Ron would want a woman with a bit of a sense of adventure, high spirits, a curvaceous body and feminine dress sense. I also picture her as being very forward - she knows what she wants and she goes and gets it. She would make all the moves on Ron, who would be a complete deer in headlights. She might not be a quidditch player but she probably loves to watch the games. I think she'd be outgoing and sociable but probably not ambitious. I doubt she'd be particularly academic, but quite emotionally intelligent, able to read Ron's moods and head off his bad tempers as easily as breathing. I'm quite possibly imagining the British equivalent of a cowgirl or a beer-drinking football fan girl.

I did imagine she would be a bit older than him, with a bit of a history, so she'd be comfortable taking the reins in the courtship. Post-war reunion with Alicia or Katie I could totally see.

** I see where you're coming from with this and would agree if they didn't seem to grow out of it as time went on. For the majority of the books (and the majority of their fighting), they're teenagers. By the time Deathly Hallows is about halfway through they've grown considerably. Ron has become much less selfish and more considerate, and his insecurities, while still there, are no longer crushing everything he does. Similarly, Hermione's need to criticize and correct everything has lessened, and her need to be better than others has grown into a desire to be the best she can, not to be better than everyone around her.

If Hermione and Ron never grew, if they didn't show any signs of maturing, I'd agree with you. The fact that they grow up and balance each other out as they get older makes me feel they're a good fit.

** I do agree that to last long term Ron and Hermione would have to get to a more balanced and peaceful relationship. One without the help of Harry. I can see them both maturing and bonding to the point where that would be the case. But I don't see that happening immediately after the end of series based on their relationship in series. But I felt that way about Harry Ginny too. A part of it is the age and the fact that I've long since graduated from high school and very few people continued to date after graduation. Not to mention that after going through so much trauma getting married and having kids would be a bit stressful( it can be stressful even without the war trauma). I'm honestly suprised there werent more single people and/or childless people in the end. Since romance had so little impact in the series overall and was much more focused on friendship it's kinda annoying to me that the happily ever after was just everyone married with kids.

** I agree with you!

When it comes to Ron/Hermione, I am mostly ambivalent. I don't necessarily /dislike/ them together, and I was fine with them getting together. However, I also never really got emotional or passionate about it, because, like you said, the fighting was concerning to me and there never seemed to be too much chemistry between them.

I won't deny that Hermione started the fights now and then -- but it was Ron's behavior that concerned me most of all. I love Ron Weasley, but some of the things he did to Hermione...if we looked at them on a Everyday Ordinaryman, they would be considered abusive at worst and just really mean at best. Ron was always so willing to let his jealousy and inferiority complex hurt Hermione deeply. When they were 13, I could excuse it away a little bit -- but I can't give as much of an excuse for when he did it at age 16 and 17. Yes, 16-year-olds are not emotionally mature at all...but if I wouldn't accept a 16-year-old boy icing out his female friend for months (simply because she kissed a different boy years ago) in /our world/, then I can't reasonably accept it in fiction either.

I love Ron as a flawed and complex character, and I understand that he was an emotional teenager who inevitably matured a bit at some point as an adult -- but his behavior never ceased seeming childish to me, and almost like toxic masculinity at times. We never got to SEE that emotional maturation. He was pulling the same “let me abandon the people I love because I'm jealous” stunt in book seven that he was in book three. Ron is great as a friend (to Harry; again, not as great of a friend to Hermione), wonderful as part of the iconic trio, and he's integral to the series -- but I think Hermione deserved better than him.

** Yeah, it always seemed to me like they were put together at the end just to make things neat, or bc there isn't much romance at all in the books (which I liked a lot, actually) and Rowling figured she should have at least one big couple. they really have nothing in common beyond shared experiences, and I just can't see Hermione ever being happy w him. she's constantly frustrated by him in canon (his lazy attitude to work, his lack of emotional intelligence, etc) and like you said, I can't see any of those things changing. I mean, he doesn't even like reading. and Hermione's happy with him? Likewise, ron's always annoyed with her personality in the books (sometimes it's fond-annoyed, but they're usually still at odds). I don't think it's a realistic coupling at all.

** I remember reading the books and when Harry was paired with Ginny and Ron was paired with Hermione, my reaction was “Okay.. sure... alright then”.

I mean you can tell that Ron and Hermione are not a good fit, they're paired mainly for the sake of pairing characters and having two known characters as a couple (like by the seventh book, Ron and Hermione have known each other for seven years, so yeah, pair em up!). They do not have plethora of things in common once you remove Harry and studying at Hogwarts. I remember when her cat was accused of eating Scabbers and they stopped talking to each other, it looked like the end of their friendship... Until Hagrid sends a letter saying Buckbeak is to be killed and they reunite - that scene sums up their relationship well. They don't have much in common, they're only together for some reasons which aren't even permanent.

I think, as you said, Ron would be better off with Lavender or Luna, or even Parvati, or someone tolerant(/someone who understands that it's a joke - that is, if he jokes everytime he mentions that) who doesn't start quoting Hogwarts: A History everytime he mentions Apparating in Hogwarts grounds.

And Hermione... I don't know, I think she should spend some time in Muggle world where she doesn't know a lot of things and gets proven wrong sometimes so she starts to understand that it's impossible for her to always be right and should be a bit more open-minded to other people's opinions. Maybe Krum would be a good fit for her?

If you read everything up to the epilogue and can think without the bias of "JK said it, therefore it makes sense" you can easily extrapolate that as adults they don't belong together

*** The epilogue is horrible because it was perfectly in line with JKR's worldview and politics, which is vacuous Blairite liberalism. The forces of evil are defeated, everything is fine, the characters can all settle into their suburban middle-class utopia. It doesn't matter that the Wizarding World is fundamentally broken and horrifying in a hundred ways, that numerous magical creatures are treated like shit, that Hogwarts had a whole generation of schoolchildren whose first year of Hogwarts consisted of constant terror and being Crucio'd every week. Hermione's concern for house elves was, after all, just an an adolescent radical phase, something to laugh over tea and fondly remember, like teenagers wearing Che Guevara t-shirts. Harry was never supposed to believe in anything, fundamentally change anything, just get rid of Riddle and his fellow nuisances so everyone can go back home.

  J.K. Rowling: Hermione began her post-Hogwarts career at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures

  J.K. Rowling: where she was instrumental in greatly improving life for house-elves and their ilk. She then moved (despite her jibe to Scrimgeour) to the Dept. of Magical Law Enforcement

  J.K. Rowling: where she was a progressive voice who ensured the eradication of oppressive, pro-pureblood laws.

the tone is reformist, not abolitionist, nor revolutionary

and harry was never politically minded, hermione was. i don't like that harry became a magic cop, but it is an organic progression for the character, because that's who he basically was during the series: a magic cop/detective.

** I can't disagree with you. I can see them getting together after the war when they have the opportunity for more time together where there isn't any stress (that is, if they didn't have feelings for each other before the war was over), but I find it deeply unrealistic that they get together before any of that happens and then they /stay/ together. My personal opinions of the epilogue aside, that just doesn't make sense to me. Some of the most important growth you do as a person is when you're in your late teens, and they had the war and the sudden lack of open hostility to deal with on top of that. I don't believe for a second that the average person wouldn't have major changes in their relationships over that time, let alone two of the major players in the war.
