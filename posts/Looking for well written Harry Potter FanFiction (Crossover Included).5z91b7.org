Hello, I have come across very few well written and thought out Harry Potter FanFiction, but when I get sucked into one I stay forever. Right now I am reading 3 such FanFictions and I would like to know if you could suggest more. So far I'm into The Arithmancer and Lady Archimedes by White Squirrel, A Third Path to the Future by Vimesenthusiast, and Magical Origins by Sorcerer Ra.

**** it wasn't that good, I mean it was written very well. it just wasn't in-depth enough. And the content moved very quickly with no real insight into the characters and their personalities
