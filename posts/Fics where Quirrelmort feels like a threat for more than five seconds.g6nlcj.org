The first book has to gloss over how creepy he is to keep the villain reveal a mystery, but I feel like a lot of first year fics downplay how messed up it would be to have a teacher obsessed with murdering a student. So I'm looking for fics where Harry or at least the narrative notice that Quirrel is a danger. Some good examples would be fics like linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162][The Devil You Know]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SilchasRuin/pseuds/SilchasRuin][SilchasRuin]]) or linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Carnivorous_Muffin/pseuds/The_Carnivorous_Muffin][The_Carnivorous_Muffin]]).

*** I really want to like this, but there are points in the story where it is completely unbelievable to me that Harry wouldn't either kill himself or have someone kill him in order to prevent disasters from having happened. Someone like Moody should have no trouble with that. I get that letting him do that removes some potential sources for dramatic tension and character development, but not doing it feels like handing core characters the idiot ball.

** There's a fic I cannot for the life of me remember the name of or the considerable bulk of the plot of, but I very vividly recall the first lesson with its Quirrel when he essentially tried to logic them all into anti-Muggle sentiments with shotguns and pointing out they were weaker and thus more vulnerable to death when encountering magical objects to the point even Hermione was going "Well, yes... um..." and it was really interesting to read.

Quirrel there wasn't really all that magically or martially dangerous in the fic, but he actually lived up to the supposed charm of Voldemort and I thought that was cool. :)

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

****** I think it's the author's justification for magic getting weaker - it's an interdict that makes it impossible to write down powerful magic and makes it only possible to learn from one person to the other. IIRC it contains one of the more clever moments - that is, Slytherin creating his basilisk to skirt the interdict (teach everything to the Basilisk, use the basilisk to transfer knowledge.

I don't really know where it ends up - however, I think it falls from the author's own inspiration/fears and desire to have dangerous knowledge restricted to only the scientists able to discover it.

In this case I think it's less old magic always being better, and more that dangerous magic needed to be controlled. IDK, I stopped reading the fic once it pivoted to a bad version of Ender's game.

Personally, I like the interpretation that a lot of older magic would be more powerful, more annoying, more dangerous, and more hidden away in various family libraries and oral traditions.

******* I mean, the fans of HPMOR are the type of utilitarians who not only would be more happy to have their bike stolen if it would give more joy to the ones who stole it, but also the type of people who think that if joy was netpositive they would endorse rape and genocide. They claim that their equations would never lead to genocide for example... but Yudkowski has written positive references to rape in Three Worlds Collide, with both future!humans and an alien race firmly believing its right, and the third race being a culture of "Baby Eaters." None of these are portrayed as actually morally wrong

******** Alright, as a fan of HPMOR I can confidently state that you're talking out your ass. I believe none of those things. Three Worlds Collide had changed fundamentally what sex means to a society, and the author himself said something that amounted to him admitting he didn't execute the idea he was going for with that particularly well. None of the three species are explicitly called morally evil by the text itself because you're supposed to /know/ that eating babies is wrong---the actual content of the story is about how we might have to compromise with positions that are /actually evil/.

Well, there's that, but IMO there's also a strong element of, "While you're busy condemning evil over there, have you considered how your own actions might be judged as evil by someone with a different perspective? Is there perhaps a beam in your own eye?"

I really like HPMoR's exchange between Harry and Hermione when she's upset that he's still friends with Draco.

#+begin_quote
  "There's history books you haven't read," Harry said quietly. "There's books you haven't read yet, Hermione, and they might give you a sense of perspective. A few centuries earlier - I think it was definitely still around in the seventeenth century - it was a popular village entertainment to take a wicker basket, or a bundle, with a dozen live cats in it, and -"

  "Stop," she said.

  "- roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good clean fun. And I'll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning women they thought were witches. Because the way people are built, Hermione, the way people are built to /feel/ inside -" Harry put a hand over his own heart, in the anatomically correct position, then paused and moved his hand up to point toward his head at around the ear level, "- is that they hurt when they see their /friends/ hurting. Someone inside their circle of concern, a member of their own tribe. That feeling has an off-switch, an off-switch labeled 'enemy' or 'foreigner' or sometimes just 'stranger'. That's how people are, if they don't /learn/ otherwise. So, no, it does /not/ indicate that Draco Malfoy was inhuman or even unusually evil, if he grew up believing that it was fun to hurt his enemies -"

  "If you believe that," she said with her voice unsteady, "if you /can/ believe that, then you're evil. People are always responsible for what they do. It doesn't matter what anyone /tells/ you to do, you're the one who does it. Everyone knows that -"

  "/No they don't!/ You grew up in a post-World-War-Two society where 'I vas only followink orders' is something /everyone knows/ the bad guys said. In the fifteenth century they would've called it honourable fealty." Harry's voice was rising. "Do you think you're, you're just /genetically/ better than everyone who lived back then? Like if you'd been transported back to fifteenth-century London as a baby, you'd realize /all on your own/ that burning cats was wrong, witch-burning was wrong, slavery was wrong, that every sentient being ought to be in your circle of concern? Do you think you'd /finish/ realizing all that by the first day you got to Hogwarts? Nobody ever /told/ Draco he was personally responsible for becoming more ethical than the society he grew up in. And /despite that,/ it only took him four months to get to the point where he'd grab a Muggleborn falling off a building." Harry's eyes were as fierce as she'd ever seen him. "I'm not /finished/ corrupting Draco Malfoy, but I think /he's done pretty well so far/."
#+end_quote

Of course, views expressed by Harry are not /necessarily/ the views of the author, but in this case they probably align. However, even if you end up agreeing with Hermione and disagreeing with Harry, it's still a thought-provoking passage. How well do I really understand other people's perspectives and situations?

A piece of fiction that makes you think, laugh, and cry is probably worthwhile reading. HPMoR has a lot of food for thought, a lot of humor, and some very emotionally charged scenes (though whether you actually cry depends on your level of emotional investment in the characters).

********* Compromising with positions that are actually evil IS evil. Ty for the downvote brigade. I used to read HPMOR and all his original fiction, but his "Less Wrong Brights" are a bunch of amoral cowards who blindly follow a cult leader who has managed to con people into giving him money despite them all being "skeptics." I like how you point out that eating babies is obviously wrong... but not that rape is wrong. Oh wow, isn't it shocking and edgy that the women are confused that rape is bad? Yudkowsky and his lot are just a bunch of shallow edge lords, I feel bad that I was caught up in it, and I feel bad for everyone who goes along with him

********** I'm not part of whatever downvote brigade you think is happening, but don't let the fact that all of /two whole people/ disliked your comment distract you from that persecution complex. Compromising with evil is indeed evil, sure. But when refusing to compromise means your entire species is destroyed, what else are you supposed to do? Anyway. Yes, rape is wrong, go put that straw back in the barn. The author of HPMOR and Three Worlds Collide made Draco, a kid raised by, as the text describes him, /magical Darth Vader/, obviously a Nazi stand-in, and the story then goes on to destroy his entire world view. Harry is bloody horrified when he realizes Draco wasn't joking.

********** I upvoted and agreed with you. It's not surprising that this place is AGAIN defending rape. It's home to misogynists who desperately justify harems and objectifying women in general. Objectively wrong acts exist and I hate people who try to say "ITS ALL SUBJECTIVE ITS A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW!!!" No! All anyone has to do is see how you react if it's done to YOU, then you'd understand that it's objectively wrong. They sound like my mother trying to justify all of her abuse to me with "I THOUGHT I WAS SHOWING HER LOVE/TRYING TO TEACH HER LESSONS." Just because you think it's good in your own head doesn't mean from the outside it isn't still bad! Anyone sane and moral can see it.

************ I think s/he was referring to the treatment of rape in Three Worlds Collide, in which a future society has normalised non-consensual sex, and people can no longer understand the centuries-old individuals who remember when it was a crime.

IMO anyone who reads it and decides that the story is endorsing rape, though, has rather missed the point. It's all about how different societies have different values and priorities, how one calls "good" what another calls "evil", and how we respond to those value conflicts. The story doesn't really endorse any particular set of values, it's just a thought experiment for better understanding them. Whether the ending was good or bad depends on your perspective and your own values.

*********** That is very much how several members of the crew of the Impossible Possible World reacted when they learned about the aliens who eat their own live and sentient children. They were outraged, indignant, ready to go to war and eradicate such an obvious evil.

And then they met another species that was horrified and outraged at the fact that humans have not re-engineered themselves to eliminate pain and embarrassment and suffering and dishonesty, that humans allow /their children/ to go through traumatic experiences and just consider it part of growing up, and this species resolves to do whatever it takes to protect the children.

******** Right, wow, yeah, that's a lot. But say you are just someone who stumbled on purely the fic through a link on this very sub. You read it, taking all the "science" as the same sort of technobabble that Star Trek spouts, and Harry as the sort of humorous "child genius" you find in cartoons like "Dexter's Laboratory".

Partway through you start seeing a lot of references on reddit to how awful this fic and this author and these fans are, so you decide not to go to their website.

Viewed purely through the lens of comparison to other crackfics, it's not bad.
