Hi! I'm looking for new stories to read, and I'm wondering what everyone's recommendations would be for fics where a character that's generally not known for their intellect or competence is secretly smart & highly influential.

Anything's welcome, and I've seen some pretty incredible ideas around! (e.g. genius!Crabbe&Goyle, smart Hagrid, super competent Lockhart...) Recommendations, guys?

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

*** Urgh. It sounded a good premise but the way it's executed is really poor.

Hagrid puts on an accent because having a regional accent makes you somehow less intelligent?

*** Wait, is this a 'Hagrid is Voldemort's true archnemesis' fic? I asked for one of those ages ago! ~gets to reading~

Anyway, [[/u/epsi10n][u/epsi10n]] , [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9279255/1/On-An-Island-In-The-Sun][On An Island In The Sun]] has two recurring shadowy figures which are revealed to be Crabbe & Goyle, who are smarter than they look but were tricked into serving the Malfoys with binding oaths.

It's not a major part of the one-shot, though, sorry.

  When Voldemort framed Hagrid, he thought he had found the perfect scapegoat. He never suspected that there might be more to the friendly half-giant than met the eye. Join Hagrid in his quest for vengeance against the Dark Lord. He will hold nothing back until Voldemort is utterly destroyed. A unique perspective on canon as seen through the eyes of a cunning Hagrid.

** I recall a story where either Crabbe or Goyle was snatched away from Draco's influence early on, and ended up taking Arithmancy as an elective and turning out to be pretty good at it. I think it /could/ have been linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) but I could very well be wrong.

**** Seriously, Harry's just an idiot with enough of the facts to crash through just about everything. Literally everyone else (except maybe Hedwig) is a member of the eponymous /Daft Morons./ The author seriously doesn't know how to write a genuinely smart character. Hell, characters forget things they learned three chapters earlier.

That is me. Honestly, Sinyk has a nearly unparalleled grasp of grammar. But for the most part, his storytelling leaves something to be desired. This is my least favorite story of his. The poorly shoved in Harry/Hermione engagement destroyed any hope I had left of this potentially being his best work.
