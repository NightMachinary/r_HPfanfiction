** Immediately, my mind goes to the Supernatural episode; “The Monster At The End Of This Book” which is the exact same premise, except the except the seer---or prophet as he's called in SPN---writes down his visions and publishes them because he thinks that it's all apart of his imagination.

“I'm sitting in a laundry-mat reading about myself sitting in a laundry-mat reading about my self. My head hurts.” Ron ran his hands through his hair and looked up at Harry, who wasn't amused. Harry turned his back on Ron---“Harry turned his back on Ron, his face brooding and pensive'. I mean, I don't know how this guy is doing it, but he's doing it. I can't see your face right now, but those are definitely your brooding and pensive shoulders.”

“There's Ron Girls and there's Harry Girls and---what's a slash-fan?” Hermione suddenly turned red when Harry asked this.

“As in Ron-Slash-Harry... together.” She quietly explained.

“Like ‘together' together?” Hermione nodded, and Harry looked over at Ron, finding the ginger to be mirroring his horrified expression. Wordlessly, they each scooted away from each other, their faces redder than they'd ever been before.
