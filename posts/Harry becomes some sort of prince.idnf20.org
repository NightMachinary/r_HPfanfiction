:END:
So I'm looking for this fanfic I remember reading years ago, but I just can't seem to find it anywhere. Basically, Harry was betrayed by Hermione, so he leaves Hogwarts. When Hermione's dad finds out, he reprimands her for being foolish and blind. It turned out that later, Harry found solace in the royal family and became Prince Hadrian Windsor or something. Not too clear about that. Hermione's dad then explains the background story of Prince Hadrian Windsor. Then the rest I forgot.

If anyone knows the name of the fanfic, please provide the link. I want to reread it badly. Thank you so much.
