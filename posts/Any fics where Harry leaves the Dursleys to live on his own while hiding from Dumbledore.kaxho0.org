** I actually just recommended this to somebody yesterday, odd how it's suddenly coming to mind so readily after years.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations]]) had a similar theme, save that Harry isn't hiding from Dumbledore, but is simply trying not to bother the headmaster what he feels is an unimportant issue: being left behind when the Dursley's moved away before he got back for the summer after fourth year.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

**** I should probably point out that the fic unfortunately died right around the climax, but what's there is solid gold.

****** Well that's awesome. Clearly I need to start talking about fics I loved years ago that died before they were finished more often.

** Hidden Hero: linkffn(3995826)

Harry leaves the Dursleys to live on his own, under the alias of Mark Twist (using magic to disguise himself). He spends his Hogwarts years living as Mark Twist while still getting up to mostly the same shenanigans.

  AU What if Harry knew he was a wizard and about the prophecy before he went to Hogwarts? What if he was kicked out of the Dursleys and decided to attend Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn? Harry Ginny
