Linkffn(Too Young to Die)

I just rediscovered this gem of a fic. It features Harry going into dark magic and necromancy. It has a few rough edges in terms of editing a prose, but I love the plot and characterization of Harry.


** One of my favourite fics ever. Only read it once about 3 months ago so will probably go and read it again, I've been struggling to find something to get stuck into recently

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
