"How dare you side with those slimy snakes over your Gryff friends Harry!"

-Ron Weasley, 90% of HP "Edgy Harry" fics ever probably

â€‹

This is a weird phenomenon. From what I can tell canonically, Ron never outright states a problem with Slytherin. Its been a while since SS, so I don't remember exactly what he said about Slytherins, besides it being unflattering. That has apparently been the basis of years and years of the Ron against Slytherins movement, where he calls them all slimy snakes and despises Slytherins unconditionally. I don't get why, because Harry's always seemed like the person who hates Slytherins more than Ron, and deservedly so. Does anyone else know why it's Ron who is cast as the main hater of the Slytherins?


** I think in part it's because in the movies, Ron is given book!Hagrid's line about bad wizards coming from Slytherin.

Additionally, in fics where Slytherin hatred (justified or not, often the latter) the hatred wants to be established early. Harry and Hermione having grown up in the muggle world makes it less likely that they would come in hating an entire house.

Ron, on the other hand, grows up in the wizarding world knowing about the Hogwarts houses, has older siblings who played on the Gryffindor house team and likely complained about the Slytherin teams winning streak, and has a father who clearly has problems with Lucius. While the issues between Arthur and Lucius have nothing to do with their Hogwarts house and everything to do with their personal values and beliefs, I think some people simplify it to a "the Weasleys hate the Malfoys, the Malfoys were in Slytherin, therefore the Weasleys hatr Slytherins."

** I would guess a large part of it is the movies, but yeah, it's also that Ron is hated by many. I admit, Rowling did use him as the go-to guy for conflict, but other than Malfoy, he didn't show a ton of /hate/ towards Slytherin. He likely distrusted them after a while, but that's it.

The main issue we see pre-Malfoy is him being worried about where he'd be sorted, and it was more 'What would my family think?' than 'Eew, Slytherins are EVIL!'

** The real, writing-mechanics reason:

As the person closest to Harry who was raised in the wizarding world, Ron is who authors have to work with. Whether Harry is getting indoctrinated against Slytherins to overcome it later (Draco redemption fic), or whether he resists that attitude from the beginning (Ron bashing fic), Ron is pretty much the only person the authors can use to get this attitude into the story. Harry just doesn't spend enough time with anybody else who has the background for it---as a Muggle-born, Hermione doesn't start with an anti-Slytherin bias, although she can develop one from negative treatment.

** There is no particular reason, Ron is just hated by a part of the fandom who will take any opportunity to bash him (he doesn't like to spend 12 hours in the library like Hermione so he must be an idiot that kept Harry down and only passed his class because Queen Hermione helped him. . .).

There is also a pretty big overlap between the people that hate Ron and the people the "like" Slytherin, since in both case they usually developped this opinion by watching the movies (movies did Ron dirty while Felton and Rickman became extremely popular).

So any fic that present Slytherin in a good light (like the "Edgy Harry" fics) also happen to have a pretty big chance to bash Ron, which mean Ron must obviously be a bigot that kept Harry from meeting his true friends the Magical Hitler Youth.

*** actually, there is a particular reason: Ron is the most likely character around Harry to do such things thanks to the movies and the fact that Harry doesn't have much interactions beyond Ron and Hermione (except a few lines over the books where he talks like six or seven lines at most to "insert hogwarts student here"

almost forgot to mention Rowling herself establishes Ron (and Harry) as pretty much slackers who study only when they have to, meaning it is VERY LIKELY, if not true, that Hermione is the only reason either pass their classes.

**** I think it bothers me that in the first book skills Harry had seem to have had disappear in later books.

For example he gets told to cook the Dursley's breakfast (so he at least knows a few basics to expand on) but during the horcrux hunt suddenly he doesn't and hermione has to do the cooking (which apparently isn't that great).

Or the sorting hat says he has "...not a bad mind, either...." and before going to Hogwarts he read all his textbooks and found them fascinating. Yeah he's no hermione, but he's not thick either or disinterested in his magical education.

I mean before Snape he was even excited to learn potions!

Also yeah okay Ron probably doesn't apply himself as much as he should but he's not a Troll student either. With a magical upbringing he has an insight to the magical world and their laws that Harry and Hermione just don't.

He is the one that tells them about the laws against owning dragons in Britain, or when harry and himself were being crushed by the devils snare and Hermione is freaking out there's no wood for a fire he is the one who reminds her she's a witch!

Also for someone who is brilliant at chess (even beat McGonagall's chess set) an argument could've been made that he would've made a decent strategist against Death Eaters in the war against Voldemort.

Rowling did our boys dirty by making them seem lazy, but the movies truly ruined Ron Weasley.

#+end_quote

I am constantly amazed that Ron is seen as brilliant at chess because of this. First of all, let's start by saying that Ron is only seen challenging other students---including Harry, whom he taught to play the game. That doesn't mean that he is brilliant at the game in general. I've seen at least one fic that has a character tell Harry that Ron is actually not that great a player, but only plays people he knows he can beat and thus isn't improving his skills (sorry, I don't have a citation for that).

As for McGonagall's chess set, let's start by saying you need to discount Dumbledore's statement that it was the greatest game of chess ever seen at Hogwarts, because unless Dumbledore was being literal in that the chess set was the LARGEST ever used there, there is no basis for comparison. Dumbledore didn't even see the game being played, and thus is clearly using it as an excuse to give points to all three of the students.

Next, the fact that McG made the chess pieces* doesn't mean that she could program them to play a challenging game. Unless she's brilliant at chess---an assertion we have NO basis for---we have no reason to believe that her chess pieces can give anything more than a moderate challenge.

All of which ignores the fact that the giant chess set is not at all an impressive accomplishment. The Engorgement Charm is taught in second year. After that point, any student in the school can enlarge an /already-enchanted/ chess set. If this was, in fact, McGonagall's contribution, it's rather a disappointing one. If Flitwick made, we could at least assume he did his own enchantments.

*The chess game being McGonagall's contribution was an assumption the students---and thus the fans---made. I've seen a very credible argument (Bil, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3957892][End of Year]]) that it was FLITWICK who did the chess set---animated objects (such as tap-dancing pineapples) are, after all, on the Charms test---and that McG transfigured the flying keys. (Even just adding wings to keys is still Transfiguration, not Charms. It would only be Charms if they were normal-looking keys that were flying without wings.) That JKR later stated on Pottermore that it was in fact McGonagall, makes me file this under "dumb things in canon." (Yes, that's an actual list I have.)

Why not? She's one of the most powerful wizards in the series, and skilled in transfiguration. She turns a desk into a pig in canon. There's no reason to think that she couldn't make a magical chess set that plays a serviceable game at minimum.

Secondly, you are missing some aspects that made the chess game as impressive as it was. For one, Ron has to protect four pieces at all cost. He has to protect himself and his friends as well as the king. At the age of eleven, under enormous pressure, under time constraints, and handicapped with Harry and Hermione, it is an impressive game.

******* Being powerful and/or great at transfiguration have absolutely nothing to do with any skill she may or may not have with chess. Turning a desk into a pig and back provides absolutely no credibility to the assertion that she's a brilliant chess player. It doesn't even prove she knows the rules of chess.

Your supporting data is completely specious. That's like saying Lavender is great at chess because of her superb skills at hairstyling.

That is not my point. That fact that McGonagall's section was chess insinuates that she at the very least has an interest in it.

I don't think she necessarily needs to be good at chess to create a chess set that is good. Coders create chess AI that can beat grandmasters. That doesn't mean that the coders themselves are betters chess players. In the end, we do not have any information of how magic works at such a level. I brought up the pig example to show how, at the very least, it is possible to make something that complex.

********** I also fail to see how saying that there's no sign in canon that McGonagall was a chess player can be considered bashing.

She is shown in canon to be very interested in quidditch, which involves riding brooms and chasing small winged objects. That sounds more like the room full of keys to me---which, as I pointed out, actually involves Transfiguration, which enlarging and/or animating chess pieces does not.

************ So it's bashing Ron to question whether he's a prodigy, or just good on a student level? Wow, I've got this bashing thing all wrong.

So, it was an impressive game FOR AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD, as even "the other guy" said. Does that give any basis for saying it's the best game ever played at Hogwarts?

Honestly, if any bashing is to be inferred from my comments, it would be against Dumbledore. Because, as an adult, I abhor that whole "let the Slytherins think they won and then yank the rug out from under their feet" scene. That was an incredibly cruel thing to do, and if anything set Harry and his friends up for more bullying the following year. It's like he hasn't worked in a school full of adolescents for the past 50 years.

And, regardless of how you feel, I am finished with this.

I have admitted I was wrong before.

I have also ducked away in shame.

Sometimes I just get tired of the argument, when neither side is convincing the other.

Sometimes I'm bored with Reddit (or busy with Life) and stay away for several days, and don't wish to take up old threads.

I was about to say I was sorry if that didn't meet your standards, but I am not obligated to do so.
