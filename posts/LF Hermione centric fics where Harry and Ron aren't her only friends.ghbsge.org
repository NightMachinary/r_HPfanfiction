I've recently gotten into Hermione centric fics, and have been trying to find more fics where harry and ron aren't her "Main" friends.

Just a good close relationship with others.

If possible please no fics where she is paired with: Ron Harry Draco Anyone old enough to be a parent (Snape, Sirius, Minerva, etc)

Pairing or not doesn't matter just without those^

She's still friends with Harry but she has a lot of other friends as well

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** The Arithmancer: linkffn(10070079)

She tests into Arithmancy in her first year, and ends up befriending most of that class. There's also some focus on the teachers we never get to see in canon.
