** Nah. Reading wizards use to vanish their shit was infinitely more satisfying than Steve Kloves' characterization, which is superior to everything in A Cursed Child.

I'd rather it all be left alone than to have more character's butchered like Harry and Ron and I damn sure don't want anymore "legitimate" Snape/Hermione wank.

** Her work is the OS for the largest cache of fanfiction in history. Other writers and artists have done exactly what you're talking about - because Rowling didn't put up legal barriers.

So... where have you been? There are fanfic *classics* now.

*** I think they mean professional writers. There might be one or two HP fics out there worth anything. Everything else is some mix of bad tropes that don't make any narrative sense. Not to mention they're all about the main cast. Some thing like the first fantastic beasts movie would be good. New characters, new stories. Stuff like that.

**** Oh, you like playing the role of gatekeeper. AND you're ignorant about the subject in hand. Always a fun mix!
