:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am in search of a specific fic i read about a year ago and i cannot remember the name or many specific details. I have tried asking in three different HP fanfiction groups on FB and no one seems to either know what it is or even heard of it. Its a Severus Snape/ Hermione Granger/ Lucius Malfoy triad time turner type fic. I don't remember if it actually uses a time turner or if its just a time travel one, I remember the guys are in their Seventh year, are already in a relationship, and at the end there is some political stuff about triad rights and whatnot. Please if anyone knows what it is or could give me somewhere i could look i would be very very grateful!
