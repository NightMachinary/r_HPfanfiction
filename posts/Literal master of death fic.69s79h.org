Any fics where harry is literally the master of death?


** I don't know the name of it so I'm going to put the plot here so that if someone else had read it they might know the name. There's one where after the final battle Harry keeps all of the Hallows and makes a golem of himself out of wood and a fake elder wand snapped in half so that he can disappear and people will think he's dead. The cloak fits him like a second skin and he is undetectable when he wears it (which is lot of the time). He is in hiding for years and I believe that he becomes a well known chef. I think Teddy discovers him and I believe that it's a drarry.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

***** It's been a long time since I've read it but I do remember thinking it was all a bit melodramatic. But the premise was interesting.

** linkffn(On a Pale Horse by Hyliian) is probably abandoned, but it fits your description and has some really unique writing that I enjoyed a lot.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** In linkffn(10724291) the Death is personified and addresses Harry as Master, it's also a bit weird and supposedly a Harry/Voldemort romance.

  Cursed against his will, Harry made the best of his life until he found himself, again, wandering in Death's realm. When Death offers him a second chance, a chance to right the wrongs he'd been blind to for too long, he can't possibly refuse.

*** I just read it from your rec, and I actually really enjoyed it. I like reading about a dark Harry if the author doesn't get too graphic or gory, and this one didn't.
