*** The ministry officials' face lit up like a kid at Christmas. He apparated straight to the office to give his superiors the good news. There wouldn't be a muggle in the Ministry after all! He didn't even want the position! This gave Harrys' political enemies the ammunition they needed to strip Vernon, and thus Harry, of the Ministry seat. And so, Harry went on to enter the wizarding world as just himself, and was spared the transfiguration into a stuck-up twat with too many surnames.

** Presumably Vernon maintains a job at Grunnings as some kind of middle manager. I'm not saying that he'd be brilliant at politics but I think he'd be competent enough, and certainly bitter enough, to intentionally vote in ways to ruin Harry's life for no reason other than that he /can/. The Potters historically always voted for one party? Well, Vernons now a straight line party voter for the opposition.

He doesn't know, or even /care/, why cauldron bottom thicknesses matter but if James and Lily Potter would have wanted them to be thin then by god he's voting for an increase. He signs his name with a flourish and every time he thinks about how those freaks upset Petunia on their wedding day.

Lucius Malfoy would ordinarily kill a muggle, for no reason other than /being/ a muggle. But this muggle is so far voting in his favor...? He and Vernon are content to never speak or even acknowledge one another.

*** Love this! And thanks to you I am now imagining Vernon Dursley becoming one of the most well-read people in Wizarding Law and Government? Why? Because Vernon Dursley's got to make sure he screws with Harry every way he can - so he reads up on things like cauldron bottom thickness, international sport events or maybe that rule change in Quidditch (and Quidditch in the first place) just in order to make Harry's life just a bit harder.

He's on the board in book 1.

Of course, by book 2, ten years later, he's trying to make sales without a client entertainment budget, so there was something of a downward trajectory, I suspect. Him or the company, can't tell from the books.

** Vernon walked into the Wizengamot chamber with one thing in mind: to clean up these namby-pamby wizard types.

"I vote to reinstate capital punishment!" he declared, the first moment he was able to speak.

Albus Dumbledore looked down from the Chief Warlock's seat. "Mr Dursley, regrettably the wizarding world has never abolished such punishment. There is nothing to reinstate."

Vernon sat down, the wind temporarily taken from his sails. No matter... a stopped clock was right twice a day. It was inevitable that wizards would get /something/ right.

His next opportunity to speak came five minutes later. "I vote to eradicate income tax!"

Albus Dumbledore sighed. "Mr Dursley, wizards do not pay tax."

Vernon gaped. /No tax?/ He sat down again, his world tumbling down around him. How could /wizards/ get things so right?

It took some time to recover from his shock, but when he did, he took the chance to speak once more:

"I vote to leave the European Union!"

Albus Dumbledore pinched the bridge of his nose. "Mr Dursley, wizarding Britain is not part of the European Union."

Vernon turned to Petunia.

"That's it," he said, his voice firm. "Pet, pack up the house. We're moving to Diagon Alley."

*** Oh, shit! Accepted by the wizards after all, Petunia goes on to become a pure-blood wannabe, glossing over her less-than-pure background and sucking up to any pure-blood that would give her the time of day. Like, Vernon had never had any desire to be anything more than his idea of a proper British man, but Petunia had always had a vaguer longing for "something more," and would be just as happy accepted into the wizarding world as the upper classes of muggle society. She'd jump into it, but the pure-blood bigots would eat her alive. Maybe Harry would have to save her from a Death Eater assassination plot.
