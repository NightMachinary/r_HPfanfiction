While there is a heap of terrible fics to dig through on AO3, from time to time I hit upon a rare gem (or at least a stone that glitters at times).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/689909/chapters/1267386][The Spellmaker by SonnyGietzel]]

#+begin_quote
  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick.

  Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone.

  Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.

  Hogwarts' magic is an odd thing, and will go to surprising lengths to protect the students.

Well written. Harry is sent back in time.

HPXSherlock crossover.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1161859/chapters/2360947][House of Snakes]]

#+begin_quote
  At 30 years old, divorced, and headmaster of Hogwarts, Harry Potter doesn't have the life he'd always dreamed would come after defeating Voldemort. A chance discovery in the Chamber of Secrets allows him an opportunity to go back in time and change some things.

  Wherein Harry raises his younger self, dances the political dance with Death Eaters and a resurrected Tom Marvolo Riddle, and searches for a way to stop the destruction of the magical world.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1561418/chapters/3311486][Hadrian Lecter: Becoming]]

#+begin_quote
  Dr. Hannibal Lecter isn't what he seems. He's a monster wearing a well-tailored person suit. And when he gets his hands on young Harry Potter the wizarding world will never be the same.
#+end_quote

The writing is improving, and it has some unique ideas. Or have you ever read about a Wendigo!Harry before?

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/265344][Fade In (Let Me)]]

#+begin_quote
  Until the night Hermione walked in on them together, Harry and Pansy didn't know what they were missing.
#+end_quote

Well written Harry/Pansy/Hermione smut. 'Nuff said...

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's The Rules]]

#+begin_quote
  There are no rules in a war, Harry knows, when he decides to go back in time to be the father he thinks Tom Riddle should have had. Except that nothing goes quite as planned, and the rules of what's proper and what's not are twisted and tried by Tom, who is ready to do anything to keep Harry by his side.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][Cartographer's Craft]]

#+begin_quote
  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

** Fighting the Green [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1955451]] Harry Potter is a Slytherin. Neville is the Boy Who Lived. Both will have to face Voldemort to survive.

Harry Potter and the Paradox [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2275647]] The reaper, his hallows, and apocalypses, oh my! The end of the wizarding world is nigh! ...Or is it? Harry Potter may be the world's savior yet again! In a desperate struggle to save his godson, Harry fights an uphill battle to reclaim Teddy's body and soul. Travelling through time, defeating old dark lords, meeting a young Tom Riddle, and stopping magical extinction wasn't part of the plan, but Harry's rolling with the punches. He'll do anything to save the son he failed, even if that means hanging with mini Voldemort along the way.

Serpentine [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2175108]] The world in which Harry Potter truly lives is a world of friendship and enemies, danger and safety, truth and lies, and trust and betrayal, all wrapped in a thick black shroud of overwhelming secrecy that is hidden behind the golden Gryffindor persona of 'The Boy Who Lived'. The secrets he doesn't tell could start the beginning of everything he's ever wanted or the end of everything he's never before had. But how will he keep this dangerous secret when it places those he loves in harms way? How will he learn to live in the shadows between the truth and lies when neither is ever clear? How will he choose between two very different sides of everything that he holds dear? He has to decide quickly before he loses everything. But the clock is ticking...and time is running out.

Harry Potter and the Kindling of the Fire [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1535306]] After the end of the World, Harry takes a desparate trip back in time to save the entire planet.

Unraveled [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/325912/chapters/525180]] In PoA, Harry broke a cardinal rule of time travel. As years passed and the consequences of it rippled out from that point, time grew increasingly unstable until, as Harry realized he was facing death, continuity broke and time unraveled around him. Redo. PTSD.

Find me a Find, Catch me a Catch [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1739090]] Ever since Voldemort's near-defeat three years past, Hazel Potter's health has been in steady decline. After much searching she finally discovers a possible cure. It's ... unexpected to say the least. Meanwhile Lucius Malfoy, three years widowed, is searching for a solution to his own problems. Mayhap they can help one another.
