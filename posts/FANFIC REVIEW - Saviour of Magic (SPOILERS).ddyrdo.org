Name: *Saviour of Magic*\\
Author: *Colt01*\\
Site: [[https://fanfiction.net/][Fanfiction.net]]\\
WordCount: 391,006.\\
Pair: Harry and Daphne\\
Genres: Political!Harry, Smart!Harry, Overpowered!Harry

Summary: The first forty chapter of this fanfic are focused on Harry vs Voldemort with a little bit of Manipulative!Dumbledore, while the next twenty chapters are a completely different story with Harry vs the Muggle population. In the story, Harry is ridiculously smart, political savvy and god like powerful.

¿AU or Canon? Again the first 40 chapter loosely follow the cannon, we still have Quirrell, the Chamber of Secrets and Triwizard tournament. After that the story becomes extreme AU with an eventual war between the Magic population and the Muggles and eventually a galactic war between magic and non magical beings.

¿Did you like it? Yes and no. Again, the first forty chapters are really interesting and I enjoyed most of them, of course, you need to agree with the Smart, Overpowered and Politic savvy Harry because he really is the focus point of the story. Yes, Daphne is in the story but mostly as Harry's weakness or soft side. The later chapters were, in my opinion, poorly written and extremely StarWars influenced (the senate scene and galactic war).

Final Note: In this story while not "directly" intended or focused, there is a MAYOR Hermione bashing. After reading this story I can't read a Harry/Hermione Fic anymore.


** I just finished this story recently and yeahhhh. Pretty mixed feelings. I was actually ok with super!Harry and I thought some of the traditions were interesting. But the later part seemed like the author wanted to fit everything in but not spend much time fleshing it out. Elves! Magical paintings! Overpowered everyone! Star wars!

I'm glad I'm not the only person that felt that way.

*** Absolutely! I think if you stop at chapter 40 the Fic is really good, although, if you stop there you might as well read Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord from the same author. It is mostly the same story!
