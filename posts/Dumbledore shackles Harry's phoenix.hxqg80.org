:END:
Looking for a fic where Dumbledore shackles Harry's phoenix with some runes I believe on a piece of paper wrapped around its legs preventing it from flaming, which doesn't allow Harry to move around freely as he is doing.

I think this is a fic where harry is more in control of his life and Dumbledore is trying his best to bring him back under his thumb.

Anyone remember this fic?
