Hey everyone! So I would really like to read a well-written, character-based fanfiction about Tom Riddle's time at Hogwarts. It would preferably include:

- A story that spreads over his years at school

- Canon Compliant

- Includes well-known plot points (such as framing Hagrid for the Chamber, asking Slughorn about Horcruxes, etc.)

- Basically is about him exploring his affinity for dark magic, and his eventual descent into Lord Voldemort

The thing is, I don't really know where to look, so I was wondering if anyone here knew of any fics that they could recommend?

Thank you!


** Very short, but you might enjoy it.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** Check out The Broken Victory, linkffn(505654). The only issue is that it isn't canon compliant with the later books, since it was completed in 2003 before 6 & 7 came out (and was started in 2001, before 5 came out), so I don't think it covers all those stations of canon.

linkffn(5957304), Memories, is written in Slughorn's POV with him reflecting on Tom during his years at Hogwarts, and has a bit of the descent into darkness/framing Hagrid/whatnot.

  {DONE!} What drove Hogwarts' most brilliant student to become its greatest foe? Step into a mind that has failed to see past the darkness, and watch the chilling memories that were poured into Tom Riddle's diary resurface...
