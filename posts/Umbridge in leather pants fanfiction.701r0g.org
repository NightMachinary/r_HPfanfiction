So I've seen lots of fanfiction try to redeem Voldemort, Bellatrix, Greyback etc. I want to read something that redeems or justifies Umbridge through tragic backstory or some other bullshit.

**** That's actually a prank Hermione played on the Twins in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], where she froze their computers with a naked Umbridge screensaver. I laughed so hard.

** It's been ages since I've read it, but I /think/ linkffn(8914586) had an Umbridge who was good, competent, and working with both the ministry and the DMLE to protect the students from Manipulative!Evil!MaliciouslyCompetent!Dumbledore. I dropped it because [[/spoiler][I have a strong personal dislike of protagonists under the effects of memory-altering effects/drugs/mind-control,]] but it was good up until that particular point.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** The real us has an... Interesting take on Umbridge.

Just beware of the first two chapters. They induce squick on the more squeamish readers.

  "That's not the point, Potter!" Ron snapped. "They're married! Why the fuck are you wearing one?"

  This time, Hermione gave him the mentally-challenged glare. "Because he's married too, you bloody idiot! Why the hell else would he wear a wedding ring?"

  "Then why are you wearing one?" Ginny asked, her tone controlled, but everyone in the Great Hall could hear the barely-contained fury in her voice.

  "Because I'm married, Ginevra." Hermione replied, not sparing the tiny redhead a second glance.

  With gritted teeth, Ginny asked the question everyone wanted to know. "And who are you married to, Granger?"

  Hermione looked at Harry. "Is she speaking to me, husband?"

  Nodding slowly, Harry drawled, "I do believe she is, wife. I could be wrong, though. Did your parents come along after all? They're the only Grangers I know. Tucked away at the back, maybe?"
