Saw a post suggesting immortal harry with no relationships post, and thought it limited possible storys too much, and i'm interested in this too. So just immortal harry with anything from relationships to even slash this is for everyone not just me so have at.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

******* Fair enough. I only watched the first movie, and that was when my sister forced me too. I thought 'cool a new take on a vampire, immune too sunlight as well, sounds promising.' I regret that day so, so, so much. Why did they have to sparkle. In what world does a predator who sparkles make sense. Don't even get me started on the cardboard bella who shows no emotions. I'm upset that i even remember that much.

My theory was always that sunlight killed vampires, because something in it basically aged them hundreds of years in seconds without the bonus trait of forever looking young.

  Harry's unspeakably bored, and bored Unspeakables make bad decisions. Like jumping through the Veil of Death, when they're barely even certain it's safe. Now where it goes, on the other hand... That's still a mystery. But hey! Adventure, right?...Right? - Harry steps through the Veil, and into Mass Effect. The Reapers won't know what hit them. MODHarry.

**** No, trust me this is very entertaining, and there is a reason it's over 300k words. I won't spoil it, but there is some dimension travelling, nation building, multiple personality aspects with one of them maybe being THE aspect of death, ducks with vampire teeth, and the best part is it's not a huge jumbled mess. It's actually smooth, and easy to follow along.

What i usually do is read the first 10k words per 100k words of story. So read 30k-37k, and if you don't like it by that point it's not the story for you, but in my humble opinion It's definetly worth a try.
