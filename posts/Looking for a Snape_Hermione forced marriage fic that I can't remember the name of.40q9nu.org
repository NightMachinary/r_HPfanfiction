The fic is on a03 and it is one where Dumbledore forces them to marry but she continues being a student and their marriage is kept a secret. I only read the first few chapters though - ring a bell for anyone?


** That's really common. I think we need more details. Do you remember why Dumbledore forced them to marry?

Also, the first couple of chapters of this type of fic can be pretty generic. I don't suppose there's anything specific you remember?

*** The one scene I remember was after they slept together for the first time and she asked him if she could skip his class the next day and he snapped at her and she stormed out. This was in chapter one or two, very early on. It was also very well written, if that helps jog your memory at all. Keeping my fingers crossed, I know the details I remember are quite shoddy

** Was there an external reason for them being forced to marry, or was it just Manipulative!Dumbledore up to his usual tricks?

*** There was an external reason that I can't remember anymore :( but I believe that the title was only one word, possibly that started with an A? or a P? My memory is fuzzy on that one too ahhhh

** Do you know if it was complete or in progress? Was it explicit with that sex scene you mention? Do you remember ballpark of the word count? I've read a bunch on FFN but that info makes it easier to narrow down.

  Hermione is forced to lead a double life when she agrees to Dumbledore's plan to protect Professor Snape. Follows a (mostly) canonical timeline through books 6 and 7. Warning for student/teacher relationship, though Hermione is of age.

**** Do you remember anything else about the fic? The summary you provided is rather common :/ the few fics that this strikes a chord with are on FFN though. Do you remember how long ago you read it?
