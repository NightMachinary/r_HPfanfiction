I'm looking for a fanfic where muggles and wizards coexist, to me the statue of secrecy just doesn't make that much sense all the time. I'd like to read in the HP universe where muggles know about wizards and how that changes the world. It can be Harry centered or it can be with different characters but set in the same universe! Thank you for any help!


** "This statue is in fact a potent magical device that broadcasts a low-level confounding effect across the entirety of Britain. With it, muggles who witness magical effects will dismiss them and explain them away as something normal, helping to preserve our secrecy."\\
"Brilliant! But...why is it shaped like a statue?"\\
"Because we love puns. Didn't you figure that out after stepping into Diagon Alley?"

** Lazy linkless phone posting ahoy! I may come back and get the bot to do it right once I'm off work if no one else does it first.

Harry Potter and the Iron Lady is about the fall of the Statute of Secrecy, so close-ish to your request.

Love in the Time of the Zombie Apocalypse has the characters dealing with far bigger issues than secrecy and the ensuing fallout of muggles finding out about magic is a big part of the story.

** Well there isn't is there? There is however a statute of secrecy. Perhaps that is what you are looking for? :P /s

** A world with technology similar to what we have now plus a small selection of spells would look very very different. A simple Aguamenti conjures water out of nothing, breaking conservation of mass, momentum and energy. A simple everlasting magic fire breaks conservation of energy. Give engineers a box that breaks any of these laws (doesn't matter how exactly) and they can break a lot of more complicated laws, aecome up with a lot of crazy stuff. A Jupiter in a week spaceship should be on the easy side of things if you can just ignore the tyranny of the Tsiolkovsky equation. Free energy is easy. Cures for most diseases that only the super rich can afford because there's not enough magical creatures for potions ingredients. Time travel? Let's see what happens if we send entangled qubits on a time trip!

*** Well we don't know if conjuring water conjures /new/ water or just summon it from somewhere, or even out of the air in the nearby area.

Everlasting flames...I would assume the yare not actually everlasting or draws power from somewhere, maybe they last for a while to draws power from the sun remotely...then again, that would still let you do the exact same thing, so the point of arguing is mute.
