There's this new feature... And I heard the mods decide if a sub gets a chat room or not. So can we get one? :)


** We already have Discord and IRC. A third chat would seem excessive.

*** Wow. I feel like an idiot. I've been on this sub for far too long and never realized we had a discord. Thanks!

*** Can someone please explain to me what are Discord and IRC.

PS : I use the mobile app.

**** Discord and IRC are, in easy teram, chatrooms of different complexity.

IRC is really simplistic and functions in practically every browser there is with no issues. Discord on the other hand is a complex environment for chatting, with a lot of options to enhance the chat experience of its users. It can also be accessed by the browser, but it only reaches its full potential when used with the App.

*** Yeah, but this is directly on reddit. Less friction. Practically zero. No one needs to install any apps, or find out the name of a group, just the mods setting it on the sub, and us using it.

EDIT: I also just have to ask, what does excessive mean in this context? How does this bother you in any way, shape or form, if it were to be implemented?

**** The point is that it's not needed, and it's a bit weird to have two different chatrooms. It's confusing for new people and you spread out conversation instead of having it in one designated room. Just click the IRC/discord link in the sidebar, it's no hassle.

***** No, that doesn't make sense. This is integrated into the site. Besides, let people go wherever they want.

****** The thing is it'd be a bit redundant to have multiple chatrooms. IRC and Discord are both perfectly usable in web browsers. Opening a tab for IRC and Discord should take the exact same effort as it takes to open a Reddit chat tab.

******* No, that's not true if you don't have IRC and Discord to begin with.

You're just resistant to change. Honestly, very dissapointing.

********* Still more to do than on reddit chat.

Just, please, I got the fact that you're resistant to change. No need to have this conversation anymore.

********** Why don't you want to make an account? Takes like one minute. I think you can use discord without an account too tbh. Too resistant to change I guess. Smh. Might as well not even talk with someone who doesn't like change.
