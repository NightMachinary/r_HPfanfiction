** For me when you double tap the screen to hi out of full screen mode there is a sound symbol on the bottom right. When you click in it, youbare asked to select a paragraph which it then reads aloud to you.

I don't use it because I hate the voice but that's how it is on my iphone

** There is headphones icon at the top of the screen when you open a fic (in Android). Tap this icon and it starts to read out the page for you.
