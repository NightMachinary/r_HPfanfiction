So, I want to include new cultures and different kinds of magic all over the world. The thing is, I'm kind of stuck. I've read through Pottermore and I have included some of the details. But I was more thinking along the lines of ‘Young Adventure's Club.' If you didn't read it, well the story goes about the man trio and a few others traveling through time exploring new concepts of magic before the final battle. ( I highly recommend this if you you're open to reading SSHG time turner things. Dw, they are the same age)

There is so much to be explored outside of what we have seen. What are some kind of ideas that you've come up with? It doesn't have to be just another country, but just something in general!

And, please let me know if it is possible for me to use this in my fic! I'll credit you properly!


** If you want ideas, I really recommend linkffn(Accidental Animagus) and especially it's sequels. White Squirrel does some fantastic world-building of an international community. If that's too much of a read, I think the interlude piece would probably be decent as a stand-alone and get the point across well

** The statute of secrecy has existed in Europe since the 1690s, which means since at least then, the muggle and wizarding worlds were separate. IMO in order for the statute to be enforceable, they mush have been at least mostly separated for a generation or more prior.

While some events, like the world wars probably did get noticed across the divide, JKR presents it as the two worlds having mostly nothing to do with each other. Therefore, the political and cultural landscape will be completely different to ours. With the exception of very major natural barriers like the sea, there is little reason for countries and borders to match up.

Magical colonialism just doesn't make sense for me. Magical Europeans just don't have the numbers, comparative advantage or the population pressures to mass emigrate and colonise other parts of the world. This could mean that the magical cultures of, for example China or Central America, could have mostly resisted the cultural shifts that the mundane populations have experienced over the last few hundred years, or perhaps they had different ones of their own. This could mean that it is even harder for muggleborns to fit in than it is in Britain. Just be careful to do enough research that you don't just make offensive stereotypes.

** Hi there! I've written a lot about my own [[https://harrypotterfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Argentinian_Council_of_Magic_(Vincent_Mackay][nation]]) (The Argentinian Council of Magic) and region as I conceptualize it within the Wizarding World, feel free to use it! And yes a little of credit would be nice.
