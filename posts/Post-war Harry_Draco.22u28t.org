** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4842696/1/Reparations][Reparations]] and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5047623/1/Foundations][Foundations]]. They were the first Drarry fics I read, and still one of my favorites. It takes place post-war with Harry as a trainee healer and he ends up having to work with Draco.

** Not sure if self-submissions are allowed, but you may be interested in my stories [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6087977/1/Joint-Custody][Joint Custody]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7210757/1/The-Fine-Print][The Fine Print]] which takes place after the war and focuses on Draco finding his way to redemption, Harry dealing with the aftermath of the war, and how it all started with a dog named Albus.

(Does deal with H/D slash, sex is alluded, but no explicit scenes are in it.)

** If you search on FanFiction.net you can categorize the era you'd like, generally if you choose Post-Hogwarts it will be Post-War.
