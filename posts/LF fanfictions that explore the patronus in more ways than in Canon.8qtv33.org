I feel it could be fun to know what more a patronus could do. For example they ward off dementors and lethifolds, and they can be used for communication.

But I feel there could be other functions to it and I was wondering if there are fanfictions that deal with that? It doesn't have to be a central plot point.


** Just a distracting thought about the form of Patronus charms:

The incantation is sometimes translated as 'I await a protector', so the animal that appears isn't a representation of the wizard's inner self or based on the memory used. It should be the animal that best represents the person whom they trust the most, or who symbolizes protection to them.

For Tonks, hers used to be a jackrabbit (probably her dad) but became a wolf after she fell in love with Remus. Sounds like an untold story there. Snape even taunts her about it representing Remus and how weak it seemed.

Harry's patronus being a stag makes some sense since he feels protected by his Father's legacy, the Cloak of Invisibility. Then again, the stag may have originally represented Albus in the way it is restrained but powerful yet essentially non-threatening (being an herbivore). Snape's doe is an obvious representation of Lily, but that doesn't mean that she would be a doe animagus; it's his deep-down understanding that Lily belonged with James, even though she also cared for him.

*** Thank you! I've always thought of it this way (which is why imo Hermione's and ron's better represent each other rather than themselves. She is so totally a terrier) I'd really like to see somebody make harry a horse animagus, bc of Ginny's patronus. It also has always struck me as incredibly sad that Harry's is a stag, since I always saw it as he hasn't viewed anyone as a protector since his father died. I like your interpretation better, it's less depressing.

I think I read a good!Dursleys fic once in which Harry's patronus had changed to be a bear, representing vernon, since that relationship was much better than in canon. Don't think I could find it again, though.

** Lets see:

- linkffn(A Champion's New Hope) has Harry realizing a certain mindset can make the Patroni lethal to dementors and uses it.
- linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) a Patronus can ward of the Fae peoples, and Voldemort creates a ritual to summon Harry's patronus himself to locate the boy.
- linkffn(Harry Potter & the Lords of Immortality) has the Order develop a modified charm, the Telus Charm, that creates a weapon unique to the caster that can harm or kill dementors.
- linkffn(Taking Control) the Patronus takes its form based on what the user first thought of to draw out their happy thoughts (e.g. Harry thought of his father).

** Heh, I actually have a headcanon about this that I was planning to include in a fic but never really got around to writing it. Hope it's not too off topic, but...

The basic idea is that the Unforgivable Curses are impossible to block because of the intent in those spells- at the very least, for the Cruciatus and Killing Curses, you need extreme malicious intent. You need to /want/ to hurt them or kill them. (The fact that Harry used the Imperius without malicious intent may indicate that it's separate.)

So, normal Shield charms are broken by the sheer magical intent. To block those charms, you would need a protective charm with /positive/ magical intent. And the Patronus is all about positive intent, about happy, loving, memories. So in theory, perhaps the only way to block an Unforgivable is to modify the Patronus charm to make a shield.
