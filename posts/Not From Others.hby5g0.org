Linkffn(Not From Others) So I know everyone and their mum has read this and loved this, but just in case there are some people who haven't experienced this absolute masterpiece, I thought I'd recommend it on here. And if anyone can recommend similar fics I would greatly appreciate it. It follows Ginny I'm deathly hallows but the thing I like about it is the fact that lots of characters that Harry doesn't really pay much attention to get amazing development and character moments. Like Colin creevey, Luna, Neville, Seamus and lots of the Weasley family too. I couldn't recommend it enough please read it


** Thank you so much, what a lovely thread to stumble across ðŸ¥°

I would also recommend linkffn(A Call To Arms by MyDearProfessorMcGonagall) and linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince)

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** The Changeling by Annerb comes to mind. It describes book 7 from Ginny's perspective extensively, and focuses heavily on character development of both main and minor characters. Also Ginny is Slytherin, which gives it another dimension.

I recommend it without reservations. There are also three sequels (Armistice Series) focusing on the years after the battle.

*** If you like to read more about the minor characters, I would also recommend everything by Northumbrian. His post Hogwarts stories are headcannon for me and feature the Creeveys, Lavender Brown and many others. The best one to start with is linkao3(Tales of the Battle)

***** I'm on Chapter 5 of the third part at the moment. I don't like them quite so much, I prefered when it was all Ginny's POV, but I'll definitely finish. I never cared much about her character before, but this has changed my mind. I've even started to incorporate her into my own fic more.

** Flo is the writer who got me into FF (specifically with Not From Others) and has written some of the best stuff I've read. Incredibly talented writer and (I feel like I can speak with some authority here) a very kind reviewer.

We truly don't deserve her.
