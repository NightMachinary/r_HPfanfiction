** Well, there's a post-war fic called linkffn(Unspeakable Beauty) where she, obviously from the tittle, becomes an Unspeakable 4 years after the war, and her personality is somewhat different, because of both the war and the fact that she "lost" her father, which was the link for her to those "animals". Quite sweet story, unfortunately, its abandoned.

***** JKR apparently had the final epilogue already written out by the end of CoS (maybe even by the end of PS/SS), although I could have /sworn/ Luna was being set up as Harry's future girlfriend/wife when I read OotP for the first time. For starters, her name was "Lovegood", and names in HP are usually a pretty good indicator of what role a character is going to play - but also, she was depicted as staring at Harry very intently, and there was a sort of unruliness and social awkwardness about her that seemed to fit with the neglected Harry we'd first been introduced to back in PS/SS.

I think that might be the problem with already being determined as to how you want to end a story: you don't anticipate what other characters you might develop later, who could possibly change how well your original plan looked. I'd like to at least know if JKR ever considered changing her ending once she'd created Luna and seen how well she and Harry complemented each other. I'd also like to know if she ever bothered writing (or at least drafting) an alternate "Harry-and-Luna" epilogue.

***** Tbh, it's so easy to subscribe to that theory. Every moment Harry and Luna share in OoTP feels really sweet and honest.

I think one the biggest problems people have with canon Harry/Ginny is the suddenness of it. It hardly feels earned to me. Compared to the subtle way Luna kind of worms into Harry's heart, Harry/Ginny seems rather shallow in comparison.

I mean, Luna and Harry's relationship changes so much over the course of book 5. There's a lot of real growth for both characters and you can see that just from reading their interactions.

I actually remember tearing up reading some of their moments in Deathly Hallows back in 2007, the mural on the ceiling, the patronus, the casual slipping of her name when Harry thinks about the people he loves...

Goddamn those lovely weirdos in the Hogwarts express, man.

****** I love Ginny. She's a feisty badass. But that's not what Harry needs in a partner (although it's a nice quality to have in an adopted younger sister). He's already feisty on his own and doesn't need more fire. What he needs instead is someone calm and airy, someone who can just walk in the room and soothe him before she even opens her mouth to say anything because she already understands what he needs (and he knows she does). Look at Luna's very last appearance in the series: she creates a distraction so Harry can get away and have some peace and quiet.

Now imagine her doing something similar later on, after they're married: they go over to The Burrow to visit the Weasleys and some reporters show up at the door trying to get an interview with Harry. Arthur asks Harry if he'd like to use the Floo to escape, and Harry glances over at Luna, who just gives him this look of "I've got this." Then, while he escapes, she goes to speak with the reporters and completely disarms them by asking them questions about when they're going to cover various conspiracy theories from /The Quibbler/.

** My picks for "Most Authentic Versions of Luna":

- The works of BrokenWingsHealed, beginning with "A Boy, A Girl, An Owl, and A Train Compartment".
- Some oldies but goodies: the works of Michelle-31A. I'm enclosing one of her funniest shorts, but I would certainly encourage you to dig further.
- "Tomorrowland" by winterfool (alias lavellenchanted on tumblr): possibly the best Harry/Luna story in existence, and the author is an incredibly sweet person who frequently responds to writing prompts on tumblr (but is currently on a bit of a backlog).
- "Crescent Moons" by demigoddesses. This is a sweet little piece of fluff.
- And if you'd like some good erotica (H/L are adults in all these stories), I think "In Spite of Nargles" and "A Life Very Much Less Than Ordinary" are probably the two best ones out there, as well as MayorHaggar's recent "We Wish You..." series.
