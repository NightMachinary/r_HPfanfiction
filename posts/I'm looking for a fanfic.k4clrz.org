:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for this fanfic where Harry reincarnated back to his baby past self. And he stopped his parents death and also got a little sister while growing up. I forgot the details but I also remember one chapter where Harry asks Remus to go to Diagon Alley with him because his parents won't allow him to go outside because of his fans. And when he went to the bookstore he met one of the Weasley brothers (I think it was Charlie or Bill).

I don't know if this is part of the fanfic, but I also remember a chapter where they are celebrating Christmas and Harry received a gift from one of his fans and inside it is a naked little girl.

Not only that but I also remember a chapter where Harry sent letter to the Headmaster and Headmistress of Durmstrang and Beauxbatons for school recommendations.

I think this fanfic was also a slash? I'm not sure but if anyone knows what the title and author of this fanfic is, please tell me! Thank you!


** Kiera27 I think is the author of that one?
