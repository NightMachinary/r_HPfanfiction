I personally would choose Hermione, since she survived the torture at Malfoy Manor without going insane, but go crazy with this one!


** Tonks. I can totally see her having a shitload of fun playing superhero

** I'm playing with one where rather than Kyle Raynor getting the final ring from Ganthet after the whole 'Hal Jordan destroys the Central Power Battery' story line, he gives it to Luna Lovegood... who promptly decides that she wants to form her own corps with a ring from each of the corps for the Ministry 6.

She has green

Hermione gets Indigo for Compassion

Neville gets the Red for Rage (because you know, that kid has a whole lot of stored up rage.)

Ginny gets Yellow for Fear (after what Tom in the Diary did to her, she understands fear)

Harry gets Violet for Love... For the uniform is no other reason

And Ron gets Orange for Avarice. Ron understands avarice.

​

Here's Luna's exchange with Larfleeze when she is trying to get an Orange ring:

​

"NO!" I screamed. After most of a day spent trying and failing to kill the intruder, I was becoming most shrill.

"Please?" the female asked, cloaked in its vile green light.

"NO!" I reiterate safely within MY own orange glow. "It is MINE! All of it is MINE! Not yours, MINE!"

The female extended its lower lip in a manner that my ring says suggests disappointment. "But I need it. Pretty please?"

"You have a ring," I snarled. A nasty */green/* ring. "You can't have one of MINE."

"It's not for me," it lied. Like anyone wouldn't want one of MY wonderful rings. "It's for a friend, one who understands avarice. Having one of your rings would allow him to use his understanding to find his true strength."

"The Guardians are using liars now?" I demanded.

"There are no Guardians any longer," it explained. "Well, there was one, a small blue fellow who gave me my ring, but he's gone away." It gestured toward its neck where the evil green stone of willpower rested. "It used to be a ring, but I decided that rings were so last year, so I improved it. What do you think?"

I turned away from the annoying alien. If I couldn't kill it, I would ignore it. The female started orbiting me slowly. "Please? I'll be your best friend!"

"NO!" I paused. "What do you mean there are no Guardians any longer?"

"They're gone," it said simply, before pausing, and gesturing again to its throat, "or they're sick or something. The blue fellow said that he was the only one and that this was the only remaining ring."

"The Green Lanterns are gone?" I asked in wonder.

"Well, no," it interrupted. "After all, I'm still here. Can I please have one of your rings? I'll make sure my friend takes good care of it."

"No! MINE!" I screamed. Why was this entity so hard to convince? For that matter, why was it so hard to kill?

"Ah," it whined, "please?"

"NO!"

"Well, can I borrow it?" it asked, fluttering its eyelids at me. What was that even supposed to mean?

"Borrow?" I responded. "What does 'borrow' mean?"

"It means you let me take the ring, and when I'm done with it, I bring it back."

"Let you take one of MY rings? Have you not been listening to me? MINE!"

"Well, what if I rent one from you?"

"Rent?"

"You let me take a ring, and I pay you a tribute for each time-period I keep it."

That was a concept I'd never encountered before. This odd entity had setup a conflict in MY system of avarice. The Ring was MINE, but I wanted the tribute. And I would get the ring back.

But it was MINE.

But the tribute would be new possessions that I didn't already have. It would become MINE.

"What would the tribute be?" I asked slyly.

"On my way here, I discovered many planets with gemstones and rare metals for the taking," it responded. "Might I offer a cubic meter of treasure for each orbit of your world around its star?"

There was a slight pause while MY ring translated the female's barbaric units of measure into something real.

I will simply send MY Lanterns out to harvest the gems and metals for me!"

"If you trust them..." the female moved her shoulders upward in what my ring informed me to be a culturally significant gesture.

But it was correct. I couldn't trust MY construct Lanterns. New plan. "I will go and gather the treasure Myself," I announced. That was a foolproof plan.

"And leave all of your current treasures unguarded?" It asked.

"MY Construct Corps will protect it!"

"They will?" the female asked. "They couldn't even keep me out."

It was right. All that treasure, beyond MY reach. I couldn't rely on the constructs to gather it; I couldn't rely on them to protect MY treasure so that I could leave. This was agony.

The hunger burned in me. I wanted; I needed the treasure.

"I agree to your rental," I ground out through clenched teeth. "But the tribute will be TWO cubic meters of treasure per orbit."

"Agreed," the female said, showing her teeth. From her subspace storage, she produced four cubic meters of gems and metals. "Two orbits, in advance."

So much treasure and it was MINE! And now the entity would be gone.

"Now, I understand this ring will require a personal power battery..."

I felt as if I would pull my fur from my body as she began her negotiations.

*** Orange Light is top tier. If he could find stability in his friends and family, and come to accept his avarice, Ron going all enlightened orange a'la Paragon!Paul from With This Ring would be /way/ too OP.

**** The real problem with the story will be coming up with a threat, because Tom and his boys won't be one.

And Tom won't be getting a ring. He's going to be a target when the new Ring bearers go out adventuring the very first time.

I'm picturing something like this:

"What are you wearing, Potter?"

"It's the uniform of my Corps, Tom." A green/Sapphire/Indigo shield forms between Harry, Luna and Hermione and Tom's troops. "You don't need to worry about me, I'm just here to tell you that I forgive you."

In the distance, a low drone can be heard. mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine.

"You forgive me, Potter?" Voldemort sneered. "Do you actually think your forgiveness will save you and your little friends?"

mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine. The drone was getting more distinct and closer.

"Don't flatter yourself, Tom, any one of us could destroy you all."

"I wouldn't destroy him, Harry," Hermione disagreed. "I'd recruit him into the Indigo tribe."

"I wouldn't mind destroying all the Death Eaters," Luna disagreed. "Their actions have severely cut into the Quibbler's subscriber base."

"That may well be, but you both know that we can't,": Harry said gently. "The others called 'dibs'."

mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine. the drone seemed to be almost on top of them. Several Death Eaters were looking around for the source.

"Dibs?" Voldemort asked. "What do you mean by that?"

"Well, you and your friends have made some people very angry," Harry explained. "Even some who don't need the anger, but they have it anyway."

mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine.

"People fear me, Potter, I don't make them angry."

"You'd be surprised. Goodbye Tom."

"MINE!" Ron Weasley screamed as he and his orange shield landed on top of Voldemort at the speed of sound, ending the Dark Lord quite convincingly. "For my father!"

An incoherent scream of rage pulled the Death Eater's attention away from the Red-Head sheathed in orange light to a young man covered in red flame as he thrashed his way through the crowd on his unstoppable drive to the Lestrange family.

The surviving Death Eaters fled the scene lead by the Malfoys. The crowd ran full on into the yellow shield that suddenly appeared in front of them.

"Oh, hello Lucius," Ginny Weasley said with an evil grin. "I've never had the chance to thank you for the diary you gifted to me."
