Read a courting fic once, it was Harry/Draco but slow build with this whole courting process with a shit ton of others suiters. One of the things I loved about it was Harry basically tell people to fuck off. I remember Dumbledore and McGonagall didn't like it and kept trying to interfere. Like Harry didn't have to do school stuff if he was doing courting stuff and McGonagall tried giving him detention but couldn't, cause wizarding law said so. I love Harry sticking up for himself and learning magic, traditions, whatever. Read a different one where he was self studying DADA and Dumbledore kept trying to get him back in class but couldn't cause it was allowed.

Even though I'm using this as an example fics don't have to be courting. I want fics where Harry starts doing things onw his own to make his life better. Could be learning new things, practice magic, making different friends whatever, and Professors/Dumbledore can't stop it cause by dome random ass law he's allowed.

I know a lot of Indy/Smart Harry/Slytherin Harry fics have this and that's great but I want recommendation of your guys favorites. Slash preferred and please no female Harry

It's a work in progress, but it's been updated recently. I think it is something you'd like.

Harry has red hair and that prompts him to think of his mother as his role model, and not his father. This might be the most Slytherin-like Gryffindor Harry I've ever read, and it's all for the sake of his friendship with Draco.

It's marked as slash too, but it's not going to happen very soon from the looks of things.

Still, a very entertaining read for the way Harry tries to better himself without deviating too much from the capabilities of young child.

  Around the time most young children's do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence. So instead of seeing a scruffy, most-likely-a-muggleborn boy standing beside him in Madam Malkin's before their first year, Draco only has eyes for the scarlet haired, green-eyed creature who just walked into his life and instead of an enemy, he finds a reason to be better than he'd been raised to be. Not that Harry will ever notice, given he's trying to simply survive at Hogwarts.And Severus might not make it to see these boys graduate when his heart kept giving out seeing his very-Slytherin godson repeat his own history and go chasing after a green-eyed, red-haired Gryffindor. Turns out the Malfoys aren't that bad and Dumbledore definitely is. Remus is at his wit's end and Sirius gets a chance to actually live up to his title as Harry's dogfather. Tom Riddle is not prepared for any of this.

*** The courting one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4228464/1/Desperate-Measures]] but I can't remember the self study. I'm pretty sure it was a Slytherin Harry, bad Dumbledore, slash relationship. Probably on AO3. If I remember ill post it.

**** I don't want to be a bother, but do you remember the other fic where Harry did self-study for Defence and Dumbledore kept trying to get him into class? If you don't know, you mentioned that it was most likely on Ao3, and I'm wondering if you know what tags the fic had and what relationship it was.

Thanks!

***** I honestly can't remember. I'm pretty sure he was in Slytherin and hated Lockhart so he started skipping and studying on his own. I'm thinking tag wise its probably Slytherin harry. Manipulative Dumbledore. Abuse (Dursleys) Maybe Mentor Snape? and good Slytherins ( I think he was friends with Theo). I think it was an independent or smart harry. I know he was abused and that's why he was quieter and not mean but colder? but i don't know if any of that was tagged. Sorry.

While this isn't the one I'm think of (that one had no time travel.)\\
Let's Try Again by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/DayDreamer315/pseuds/DayDreamer315][DayDreamer315]], has a lot of the stuff I mention in my post. Including self studying. Though its a Harry/Fred/George and super fucking long like 600k words. It's one of my favs.
