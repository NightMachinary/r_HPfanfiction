So, I'm looking for fics about characters writing, either journalist-wise like Poison Pen [Link below] or novel-writer-wise like Amalgum [Link below]. I don't mind how big a part of the story it is (the novel-writing bits of Amalgum are more secondary events than actually part of the main plot, for instance, while Poison Pen is mainly about journalistic efforts. Basically, I just wanna read about people writing things. I remember one Slytherin!Harry-Voldemort fic where Harry (as a Hogwarts student) wrote lots of meandering philosophy-wank about various things as well, which much impressed Monsieur Voldemort, but I can't remember the name of that fic.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** This is a pretty good journalistic one and is abandoned very early. So if you wanna give it a try..

*** At least his fake name isn't Hadrian. :D

The first chapter looks good. Even if it is short, at least what's there'll be interesting. So, thanks for the rec! :)

  Harry, much more cynical and worn from 5th year, wants to be heard without discrimination. He wants to learn how to deal with Voldemort on his own, being the best that he can be without conforming society's mold for him. Enter the writer, Harrison Evans

** This is more crack than anything else, but it fits the bill. As per Luna's advice, Harry breaks into investigative reporting and starts a weekly newspaper where he belittles Voldemort on all things relative to being a Dark Lord. linkffn(Weekly Voldie by MirrorShard)

  OotP!AU: Harry needs a hobby. Luna offers to show him the ropes in investigative journalism. Now all he needs is a topic he knows well and has a lot to say about... --- In other words: Luna Lovegood is Luna Lovegood, Harry is done with the Wizarding World, Ron is along for the ride and Hermione really doesn't have time to stop Harry from becoming a Dark Lord. Crack with a little plot

** I think the fic you're referring to, with Harry impressing Voldemort via philosophical ramblings, is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865][Again and Again]] by Athey.

*** Yeah, looks like it is, thanks! I forgot just how cringingly used those Machiavelli quotes are. Definitely a full blown 'special, arrogant, political-genius eleven-year old fic', even if it does do 'special, arrogant, political-genius eleven-year old' in an semi-interesting way. :D
