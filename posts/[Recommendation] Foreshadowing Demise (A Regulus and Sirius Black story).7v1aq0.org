[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045677/1/Foreshadowing-Demise][Foreshadowing Demise]] by Shadowmistress13 is by far one of the most stressful read I had ever came across. Every scene adds another piece to the puzzle and every scene builds up the story. I especially love how every character is not exactly black or white, just a whole rainbow full of colors. The story could make you feel amuse to downright tears and every other emotions in between. I just highly recommend this fic.

The downside to this fic is the fact updates are not frequent, however, with the way the story is written, I say it is worth the wait. Plus the author is very persistent when saying that they are not abandoning the story. It updated recently, and I'm content to say that this is one of my top favorite Regulus and Sirius Black fic.

A basic detail I will give is the fact Sirius time traveled back to the Marauders' Era. On the other hand, it is not a typical time travel fic from my experience in reading time travel stories. It mainly focus on character building and relationships.

  Sirius never stopped to think that his brother may not have joined the Death Eaters of his own free will. Or just how thorough a tragedy his death was. Oh the secrets a diary reveals and the unique opportunities a deadly veil offers.
