***** Kinda, I think it's not so much that Harry will necessarily do it, but that it will happen when the terms and conditions are fulfilled, which is why he switches favorites in second year. But yeah, it was at first completely unexplained, and also completely over the top and ridiculous before he edited it to calm James down more. Regardless, his James bashing is over the top enough to almost need a curse to explain it further.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** It's one of the plot holes in JK's writing. When people connected the dots between harry being a horcrux and a horcrux's properties. JK later tried to justify by saying that harry wasn't a true horcrux. There are many such plot holes which were later discovered by fan theories like why didn't Fred and George not notice Pettigrew un the marauder's map.

Its well within the realm of suspense of disbelief that his own just doesn't work that way, or that horcrux in living hosts have other effects.

The "Twins never notice Pettigrew" thing is more of a plothole, as it becomes quite a bit of writing gymnastics to explain away why they never wondered who was sleeping in their +Number 1 Target's+ brother's bed with him.

They actually ignored Ron most of the time, I really don't see them taking much time to check if he's in bed or not....if I were up to mischief at night, I'd be checking prefects, not whether my little brother was in bed or not! Hogwarts is a huge castle, and unless they were looking for Harry, I doubt they'd specifically go to that one dormitory.

And lets not forget, they were unobservent enough that they actually thought Ginny was upset about Mrs Norris, because she loved cats. We never see the slightest indication that she's so fond of cats that she'd like Mrs Norris, whom everyone hated, including Hagrid.

*** I'm pretty sure it's canon that enchanting living beings is quite a bit different and much harder than just enchanting an object. It's not unreasonable to assume that by a similar mechanic a horcrux can't make a person invulnerable in the same way it can make an object.

The horcrux's soul fragment might also simply be sealed inside Harry's own soul and thus unable to interact with the outside world directly.
