Anyone got a good fanfic with major or a lot of character death. Would also like romance with a preferred shipping on Harry/fleur, if not that's fine too

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Harry accidentally exposes the magical world to muggles, and things get out of hand pretty quickly. Because when Voldemort is in charge of Al-Qaeda and North Korea and figures out that you can just duplicate fissile material with magic to make as many nukes as you want, you can't expect it to be resolved without a few cities nuked and a few million people dead.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

Harry dies in chapter 1, and returns to the day before. Other characters die just as easily but don't return. Voldemort is truly competent and scary in this one, Harry's death counter is in the double digits pretty quickly.

  First in the Lion's Trilogy. Daphne likes Harry, and decides she wants to get to know him. Harry is receptive to her advances. Little do they know of how their blossoming relationship will change the course of fate.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.
