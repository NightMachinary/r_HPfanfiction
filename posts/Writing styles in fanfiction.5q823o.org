I started rereading the Harry Potter series recently to refresh my canon knowledge and separate it from fanon knowledge, and I notice a big difference between JK's writing style and pretty much every fic I've read.

I know that this is mostly because the HP books are first and foremost children's books, and most people who read fanfic are not children as far as I can tell, but I find it strange that of all the fics that I've read, not a single one attempts to emulate her writing style. Everything else has been copied over by one fic or another, like Harry's sarcasm, or insane worldbuilding.

It's just odd that one of the main things that made the original series so good, that sense of wonder and the amazing humor within JK's writing, is never used by fanfic authors.

What do you guys think? Should more people try to incorporate parts of the original writing style? Would a story written like the original even become popular, as the fanfic community has evolved to be different to the regular fandom?


** Before subscribing to [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], I was largely oblivious to how vast the ratio of (in the HP fandom) non fic-readers: fic-readers was in recent times. Many frown upon fanfiction on principle, even after Rowling's repeated (however conditional) endorsements of derivative works.

But in the grand scheme of things, it makes a lot of sense.

The pool of *well-known* authors who can hold a candle to her literary prowess within the fandom is, to be a touch blunt, vanishingly small. Make what you will of her writing skills (I think she's great, personally), but it's not uncommon to fall short of the standard set by her works.

Moreover, the handful of authors who approach, meet or exceed her skill level are - by the nature of the beast - already competing at a disadvantage, and I specify "competing" because potential readers are asked to make a choice: spending their time on the novels/companion books/movies/Pottermore or reading non-canon, unaccredited content which is potentially poorly-edited, incomplete and/or even more bloated than twenty sittings of OoTP (or the Yates films in general).

With all of this considered, I don't think that stylistically emulating Rowling (no matter how much I admire her) is the only, or even arguably /a/ constructive approach to amassing a larger readership.

This post actually spurred me to reconsider my favourites list. linkffn(Hallowed) is on it. linkffn(Lesser Evils) is on it. linkffn(We All Fall After The Yule Ball) is on it. linkffn(Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake) is on it. These four fics are all well-written, but share little in common beyond that. They each, however, managed to pique my curiosity (and subsequently my attention, /haw haw/) in a fashion that I believed only canon could. The authors don't imitate her sentence structure, but thematically, their retellings are faithful to the spirit of the franchise.

And with all of /that/ said and done? Each one of the following fics - Harry Crow, Faery Heroes, Partially Kissed Hero and HPMoR - boasts more reviews/favourites/follows than all four of those quality works put together. In conclusion, I'm not sure that playing faithful to the themes and tenor of the original series would play as large a role as one might hope.

** I write canon compliant stuff and do try to emulate her writing style when it seems appropriate, but at the end of the day my style is my own. I think forcing a style that isn't natural to you is a quick route to poor writing.

*** I think it's difficult to emulate. Sarcasm (and/or the "bantz") is something the british /invented/. In many other countries being sarcastic with someone who isn't a very close friend is viewed as extremely disrespectful and inappropriate. Britain has a lot more tolerance for this kind of thing - it even celebrates it, if the comedy shows I've watched are any close to reality.

**** I suppose we celebrate it as much as any culture embraces its shortcomings. We're not universally dry and gloomy, but many of our everyday interactions are imbued with a sardonic tint of sorts.

Replying to a greeting, for example? Most English-speakers would reply "Fine!" or "Great!" to the question, "How are you?" A lot of British English speakers, however, would reply "Not bad", "All right" or "Could be worse". Understating is key, lol.

** If someone is writing a story that has a lot in common with the original tone of the series, then imitating Rowling's style would be an easier task.

But if you're going for any /other/ sort of story, it might not work. I can't imagine, say, a tragedy/angst fic retaining JKR's overall "feel" without there being a horrible mismatch between genre and style.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Fan fics are a great opportunity for stylistic explorations, so it's not necessary, at least not for /Harry Potter/ fics. (It might be harder to get away with in a smaller or more particular fandom.) And if your writing is decent enough, people will like it anyway.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

There's no real metric for popularity. What might be in vogue one day could be unfashionable the next. The most important things as far as fan fiction go are consistency: of updates, quality, and writing style.

*** Exactly this! I would not see stories such as linkffn(On A Pale Horse) or linkffn(The Nightmare Man) or even linkffn(That Which Holds The Image) imitating the slightly carefree and relatively light writing style. It needs something heavier.

** I do think the humour used is a lot to do with it. Of course there are plenty of crack fics and parodies which are intended to be funny (with varying degrees of success) and I've enjoyed some, but they are usually pretty heavy-handed and lacking in subtlety. But most more 'serious' stories seem to plod along without any hint of Rowling's whimsical humour. A lot of fics are unrequited angst which can get wearing quite quickly, and I have to say romances seem to be the worst offenders.
