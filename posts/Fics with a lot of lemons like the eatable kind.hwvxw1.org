** Will your post get flagged by the bot if I say the word smut?

(Also interested in if there are any fics that just have lemons. Not “lemons”. Lemons.)

*** linkffn(13388022) has a small subplot about how a combination of sweet, sour, and color yellow alleviates the pain associated with a certain magical skill, which is why Dumbledore has grown to like lemon candy so much. Accordingly, there's a short scene involving lemonade and lemon sherbets.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
