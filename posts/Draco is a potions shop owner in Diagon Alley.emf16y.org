:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Can anyone help me find this fic? Draco is a shop owner in Diagon Alley and find himself waking up in the middle of random forests. I believe that in the middle of the night he was turning into this sort of beast. Another aspect of the fic that I remember is that he and Harry work on finding out what is happening and eventually get together. If anyone can help me I would be so grateful, thank you very much.
