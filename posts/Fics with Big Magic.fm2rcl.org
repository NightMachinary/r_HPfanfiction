I'm looking for fics with Big Magical Acts, like splitting the lake in Always Read the Fine Print [[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118965/1/Always-Read-the-Fine-Print]]], killing the Dragon with a lightning storm in The Life He Leads [[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13082443/1/The-Life-He-Leads]]]. Just big, impressive magic that the world is amazed by. They don't have to be in the Tournament, or be around manipulating nature, despite both examples I gave being there, they're just convenient for making massive magic happen and appear big and flashy - that is always easier with an audience, after all. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** Harry breaks a mountain in this, among many other high power acts. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm]]

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

**** Creates a golem to fight the dragon and then binds it with some sort of esoteric earth magic which creates giant roots... summons some sort of giant water serpent in the lake... There's some other stuff I can't remember. He's helped along by Dumbledore who, if I remember right, does some pretty cool stuff as well
