  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) is quite distinctly /not/ a romance, and largely revolves around Harry learning the dark arts and teaching them to his friends.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Made of Common Clay ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11699844/chapters/26343573]]) by Lomonaaeren is an excellent Dark Arts fic, with no pairing for Harry. Multi-chapter, Trio, it's a really good fic. Harry throws down on the purebloods! The magic is amazing! I highly recommend this fic. Completed September 2019.

** If you can get into FemHarry fics I recommend linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) and it's sequels.

That being said, be forewarned that there is some fucked up subject matter in these stories. The worst of it happens in the first five chapters. If you can get beyond those you can get through the whole series.

The best parts are the series are the dark magic voodoo rituals and there are some truly awesome displays of magic in each story's climax.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

** If you want to shove razor blades made of 100% edge directly into your eye sockets, you could try "Harry the Blood Demon" by my younger, moodier self. It is garbage, but everyone whose ever reviewed it seems to think it's decent despite my own opinion of my works. I have no idea why it did as well as it did, and I have no plans to continue it, but if you've got an afternoon and want to read some hot garbage...

  There is a lot more to magic than simply waving a wand and saying a spell, something Harry Potter knows all too well. After all, when a mere mouth full of someone else's blood can drastically alter your life, learning magic's secrets is a must. (Amoral!Monstrous!Ravenclaw!Harry. No bashing, no romance.)
