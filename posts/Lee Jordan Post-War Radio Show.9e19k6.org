I'm looking for this fic I read over a year ago that was a series of interviews Lee Jordan holds after the war to interview the various heroes. My favorite chapter was when he interviews Oliver Wood who goes on a rant about how if Voldemort liked Quidditch there never would've been a war (or something to that hilarious effect). Some of the interviews are sad, some funny. The final interview is with Harry. I definitely read it on FFN, but it's not under a tag with Lee Jordan so far as I've been able to find.


** Why do I always find things 5 minutes after I post them? After remembering the Oliver Wood interview I found it through a google search.

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts, there are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.

** Thanks for linking after you found it, it looks very interesting.

I know it's not the one you were looking for but I found this post war, Lee Jordan interviews Justin Finch-Fletchley, story to be really interesting.

  Ten years after the defeat of Voldemort, Lee Jordan asks what life was like during the Death-Eaters' reign for the Muggleborn son of a prominent Tory family, and what he learned as a member of the commission which investigated how they came to power.
