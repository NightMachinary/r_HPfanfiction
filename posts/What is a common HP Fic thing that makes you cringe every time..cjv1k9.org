Sirius/Remus calling Harry 'Pup' or 'Prongslet'. /Shudders./ Prongs Jr. is somewhat okay, I guess...

Harry demanding and gets mad if he doesn't get called Harold, or Harrison, or Hardwin, or Henry, or you get the idea.

Harry beating the shit out of Malfoy on the train. Hexing is fine, but I'm talking brutally beating. I mean Malfoy's a dick but he's 11, come on...


** Snape is Draco's godfather - as though howling snobs like the Malfoys would have a half-blood in that post.

Evil Jealous Ron who is a dick from day one and never learns table manners.

If only Harry had shaken Draco's hand, then they could have been best buds.

All the goblins love Harry because he recognises Griphook

**** Snape takes an Unbreakable Oath to protect Draco in the middle of a war in which he's playing double agent, before he arranges with Dumbledore to assist in his suicide. I'm sure there must be some kind of attachment there, even if it wasn't that of a godfather.

**** I mean, it's just a shorter version of her name. A lot of nicknames are shorter versions of people's names (such as Rob/Bob for Robert, Bill for William, etc.). I don't mind that one, it makes more sense than Mia and sounds better than Herms or Hermie.

Also, nickname's don't have to be serious. For example, everyone called me faggot in high school. I was pretty popular.

they walked out into the forest and Hagrid was like "All right, 'arry, squat up against that tree there and pump out a big mud pie for me. I'm hungry!" and then Harry did so and he took a big shit on the ground and Hagrid ate it.
