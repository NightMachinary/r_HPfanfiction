** Dumbledore in canon kind of implies Harry was part of the trap. "You did do the thing properly, didn't you" Also the mirror of erised. That being said, this is a hilarious prompt, and I hope someone gets Harry to open up why he doesn't trust adults.

** Harry uses burn on Quirrel, it's super effective!

That was definitely planned. Hagrid dropped just the right hints to get the trio to figure out what they were supposed to do. The protections were custom made for them. Flying keys for the star seeker, chess for the chess master and a logic puzzle for the clever girl. Although the devil's snare indicates that Neville was supposed to be part of the team. It's all a really convoluted Dumbledore plan to get Harry to meet Voldemort while Voldemort is too weak to endanger Harry so that Harry will be better prepared for the prophecy.

*** Maybe, but I like the idea of Harry and Co blundering in under the belief that they're the only ones who can protect the Stone and prevent Snape (who they suspected was after it at the time) from giving it to Voldemort. As they were wrong about Snape being after the Stone, who's to say they weren't wrong about needing to go after it at all?

Edit: And as to the ease of the defenses, that could've been a deception to lull Quirrel and Voldemort into thinking that the Stone was easier to get at than it really was.

Edit 2: But if I'm being honest, I just want Albus to verbally shit on Harry for being a reckless little busybody.

**** It's unfortunate Dumbledore told a school full of hundreds of teenagers that the third floor was out of bounds. Because teenagers care about out of bounds.

It's unfortunate the door was only locked with a spell a first year could get through. Where was the age line?

Why give Hagrid the secret? Why have enough potion for multiple people to go through the fire, instead of it all being poison? Why have a plant that's afraid of light as the second trap, instead of just having full grown Mandrakes? Why put the actual key in the room with all the other keys, instead of just having a bunch of keys?

Because Dumbledore wanted Harry and co. to go through the traps, like he implied when talking to Harry in the infirmary.

** Makes sense in a way... The mirror is meant to ensnare and He couldn't have gotten the stone out. assuming there was a trap in that room.. but the fact that Harry is there could mean he can't activate whatever trap that is.
