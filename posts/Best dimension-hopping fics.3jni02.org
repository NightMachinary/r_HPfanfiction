Looking for recs. A couple of mine: Linkffn (stages of hope): in which harry, hermione, neville and luna are the last of the resistance, trying to finish up the horcrux hunt of book 7, when they are swept into a world where the key changes are that: Sirius was in slytherin and made friends with Snape, who consequently never joined the death eaters Lily married remus and harry was never born, leaving neville as the BHL. Not particularly long but thoroughly enjoyable.

Linkffn (world in pieces): in which our harry, immediately following the final battle in DH, is abducted into a parallel dimension by an Order of the phoenix whose BHL died, so they took another. And another. Ours is the fourth, and not happy at all about their actions or their justifications. Satisfying ending.


** linkffn(C'est La Vie)

linkffn(I'm Still Here)

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero)

linkffn(The Rise of the House of Potter)

linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story)

linkffn(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen)

--------------

These aren't in any specific order. C'est La Vie is one of my favorite fics, Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen has an amazing premise I wish people would steal and build on.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another!

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

There's a list of my favorites, I hope you enjoy them as much as I did. Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is incredible and a good place to start if you haven't read it already. The Prince of Slytherin is a more recent fic that updates very regularly. There are two stories here by Newcomb, both are incredible. The Lesser Sadness is pretty slow updating but definitely worth the wait. If you have any questions just let me know.

Trying to figure out spoiler tag for this sub, one sec.

I'm gonna put a basic summary in a spoiler just in case. [[/s][spoiler]]

That's basically the first story. I'd have to actually reread the whole thing to give a better rundown, I just clicked around to get the basic timeline in order. The development and awareness of the powers and other planes/dimensions, the hopping I think actually happens in one of the sequels, but it all builds. Character development, including OCs which are rather important, it builds the politics and culture of the UK Wizarding world, and gives people a chance to relearn what it's like to live without the looming fear of a 'dark lord' but also showcases many of the prejudices people hold regardless.

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards, and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry just really doesn't want in.

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** I am surprised that no one has recommended "A Stranger in an Unholy Land". In my (admittedly biased) opinion, it's the best dimension hopping fic in HP fandom.The character building is not of the highest quality but the plot development is first rate . Well worth the read.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land]])

The sequel "A Stranger in the Promised Land" is also pretty good but suffers from the minor hurdle that it hasn't been updated past the fourth chapter in over seven years. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3592984/1/A-Stranger-in-the-Promised-Land]]).

Don't worry though. Unholy Land stands on its own and you can enjoy it. (PS: There's a link for "A Stranger in the Promised Land" which contains seven completed chapters(450 odd pages). If anyone's interested and wants to get frustrated at the end of chapter 7, I'll post the link).
