I don't want to review this story, and especially don't want to post any spoilers, but I went into this with such high expectations because I see it recommended constantly. Like every request thread.

And the quality is better than average, the writing is better than average, the OCs are good, but.....I came to absolutely detest Hermione. As in, it's making me angry to read subsequent chapters because I dislike her character that much. I feel like everyone's characterization is off a bit, but hey, AU, that's the name of the game.

But I just hated Hermione's character. She's got Mary-Sue skills, with a Malfoy attitude, and gets off on humiliating the person she lied her way into sleeping with. She's absolutely in love with her appearance while trashing anyone else who is. She treats everyone like she doesn't need them because she's so much better than them, then can't understand why people thinks they're not necessary.

And the view of magic is probably completely canon, based on what I've heard about that, but it's also complete nonsense and totally immersion breaking to me. (Both canon and this story.) But that's another conversation....

Anyone else really struggle with this one? It's a well done story, just definitely not for me.

What is the alternative? A chapter devoted to IQ testing? That trope is just like that because "Hermione Granger, Top of the School" reads better than "Hermione Granger, proven to be in the 96th percentile by the 1996 O.W.L. Examiners"

My main problem with Lady Thief was (and I am quoting myself here)

#+begin_quote
  Patron was a favorite for me, but the main draw for me was the worldbuilding (and the premise). When I tried to read Lady Thief any worldbuilding that starfox reused from Patron just felt like contrivances for why Hermione couldn't just leave.
#+end_quote

See, this is where we differ a bit, I like ultra smart Hermione. Now I have read one or two where I thought she was a bit much, (A story where literally everyone in the school likes her comes to mind), but for the most part I like fanon Hermione. However I do have a problem when characters get an appearance boost. In essence I love Ultra-smart Hermione, but do have issues with Goddess level Attractive Hermione.

I have trouble reading some stories because their sentence flow just breaks my concentration, so probably haven't read the worst of super-sue Hermione fics.

I am sorry, but this is probably something that we will never entirely see eye to eye on. I very much like Fanon Hermione, and you heavily dislike Fanon Hermione. Different strokes for different folks and all that. I don't think either of us is going to be able to change the others mind on this.

****** I consider Hermione ruthless, but most cunning? I don't think I used that description much if at all. In Lady Thief, Hermione is mentioned once as "described by many students as cunning" in a slandering news article (in second year, and patently false), and twice the thieves as a whole are called cunning - after escaping the Aurors.

In Divided and Entwined, Hermione is mentioned once as being seen as rutless and cunning, towards the end of the story, after the whole civil war and following struggles were almost over and she certainly had earned that reputation.

In Patron, she's called ruthless about three times, and never cunning.

All three stories together are about 1,8M words long - so, "those statements" are exceedingly rare. The most ruthless and cunning character in my stories is almost always Dumbledore anyway.

******* I should have specified a bit; while I have started reading Divided and Entwined as well as Patron, I have only finished The Marriage Law Revolution, The Dark Lord never dies and Lady Thief.\\
„Ruthless“ just really fell into my eye because I finished The Marriage Law Revolution last. For me it is kinda symbolic of your stories that Hermione has something going for her that is described as: „the most ...“.\\
I like your stories and they are propably in the top 5% of Harry Potter Fanfiction (and your short one Democracy is one of my personal favorites), but at times I got the feeling that Hermione was „the most ...“ in something, because the challengers weren't really on the same level or everything went a little too well.

I hope that made a bit of sense and it came through that I still appreciate you writing.

Edit.: Your Dumbledore in the Dark Lord Never died was indeed ruthless, but still well portrayed as a human. Never forgot that one.

The main problem is that I tried to characterise the characters according to their actions and inactions in canon - and, seeing how JKR never cared about consistent characterisation but only about her plot, that doesn't work. In my other stories, I said "fuck canon" and let the characters act like they would, not how the canon plot dictated. So, less rants, more politics and more AU in the war.

***** Lady Thief doesn't reuse worldbuilding from Patron. Both reuse worldbuilding from Marriage Law Revolution.

I actually quite like that a lot of rough worldbuilding for the magical geopolitical landscape is common across all Starfox fics with different details, it means that there's a very developed world that I'm somewhat familiar with from chapter 1 without having to read through massive infodumps. It's almost a bit like the MCU.

** Honestly, I found Harry and Ron way more frustrating. They bitch and moan the entire fic about how useless the rest of the Aurors are, but they're incredibly entitled and would frankly be a nightmare to work with. We don't really see their detective skills at work, if they have any (it's implied that Moody taught them a ton about combat and constant paranoia, not proper police procedure), so I came away feeling that they were justified in their confidence in their fighting abilities, but could have been humble and realized that there's still a lot for them to learn to become good Aurors, not just fighters. Instead we just got one-sided arguments and strawmen (their opponents in the ELITE department of the DMLE were one-dimensional). I think I would have preferred an entire fic just about their story, where everyone could have been more fleshed out, hereos and villains both, instead of being the B Plot

And even if they really were God's gift to Aurors due to Moody's teaching, they still acted like entitled dicks. Part of being an adult is realizing you can't do everything yourself or control everything, that you have to work as part of a team, and an essential part of that is a bare minimum of politeness. I've been fortunate to only encounter one or two brilliant assholes in my career and no one WANTED to work with them, they just had to when there's no other option (Moody).

All that being said, I still finished the fic and enjoyed it, just got frustrated every time they complained about how they were being treated.

** Most of the characters in this story have flaws, and that's actually one of the things I find good about it.

There are far too many stories where perfect Harry and perfect Hermione sail through life without a care (see, for instance, most robst stuff). Here, we stand outside the characters' lives and get to see that they're both hypocrites and both flawed. As both main characters become more skilled in their respective fields they become more removed from what would normally be considered good behaviour. Harry (and Ron) reach a point where they pretty much ignore their chain of command because they know they're the best, and as Hermione's skills as a thief and an animagus increase she gains traits that would have been anathema to her at the start.

The fact that the characters grow and change as the story progresses sets it apart from a lot of other stories, where we end up with the exact two same characters but up-skilled a bit. Personally I think it's a top story.

** A number of readers felt the same, so you're not alone. Of course, a number of readers felt the opposite, and couldn't stomach Harry. This Hermione is very focused on her appearance - that's the influence of her animagus transformation; she really didn't control the psychological effects of having a spirit animals as well as she thought. And Cats do spend a lot of time grooming themselves.

But, honestly, I think there's a lot of bias at work here. Case in point: You call out Hermione as having "Mary Sue" skills - but Harry is in the exact same position: Both of them were trained by the best in their respective fields, and both were the best left in Britain in their fields after their mentors got cursed/retired. Yet you dont seem to have issues with Harry's skills. Nor with Harry keeping secrets such as what exactly he did to defeat Voldemort with Dumbledore, and deciding that he knows best and so forcing Hermione to train in Defence. Not to mention his hypocrisy in profiting from nepotism to get away with breaking the rules, yet condemning others for the same thing.

Neither are flawless or perfect, yet, overall, their hearts are in the right place, and they have to confront their flaws and get (mostly) over it.

Like make it a real conflict. Let Harry break it off with Hermione and try to change politics on his own accord. Let Hermione learn some humility and that her thievery and lies actually cost her something like she mentions all the time in the story.\\
If you have done that and developed their characters a bit further from there the reunion would have been even more impactful.

**** That wouldn't have worked in my opinion. If Sirius couldn't change the Wizengamot without stooping to robbing his opponents blind so they'd lose the means to buy votes and influence, why would Harry (with much less money and experience) have any success? And how would he have managed to achieve anything in politics without help from Sirius in the first place, which would pretty much devalue what he was trying to prove, namely that his way was working? Not to mention that Harry isn't exactly a born politician to begin with. That's why he tried to reform the Ministry as an Auror enforcing the law in the first place - only to fail because the entire system was rigged and rotten to the core.

And Harry did realise that after the confrontation with Sirius and Hermione. He's not stupid, after all, and he experienced the nepotism in the story multiple times.

The conflict was mostly about egos at that point - Harry didn't like being proven wrong and having been kept in the dark. It wasn't about convictions, but emotions.

******* Funnily enough I just noticed that I am actually arguing with the author of the story. Kinda surprised me.

Just to preface it, feelings are subjective and it is not like the handling of the reveal is not a possibility how you have done it, but it always felt to me like it did not get the explosion it deserved.

Harry in your story is righteous and driven by the vision of a better world, one he wants to achieve by changing it from within and being an example. Contradicting that is his usage of blood magic to beat Voldemort with Dumbledore. He admits the potential evil, but recognizes the need of it. While that might make him more understanding of what Hermione and Sirius did and a feasible way to resolve the conflict it feels kinda lacking.

After all two of the people dearest to him he trusted and cherished basically engaged in a way of life he tried to terminate. It was also done in a way by them that made them confront him in his line of duty unlike his secret during the war against Voldemort. It would also hollows out past engagements with them; he trying to lead by example with just motives that get supported by Sirius and Hermione. The duplicity is unreal. That is emotional and ideological betrayal in its purest form.

That is at least how I understood and how I pictured it. And then one of the reasons why Harry is presented as angry is his jealousy? That felt kinda lacking to me after the afore described picture built itself in my head. That is not your fault and my head might have overdone it.

******** Well, as I see it, Harry had to realise that he was being a hypocrite - just as he broke the law by learning blood magic on the order of Dumbledore to defeat Voldemort, Sirius and Hermione broke the law to defeat Malfoy (and were used as thieves before by Dumbledore.) Not to mention that, should Harry's use of blood magic get revealed, Sirius's political influence would have been shredded by association. So, it's really not as if Harry's the poor victim there, betrayed by everyone he holds dear, even if he portrays it as that at first. He broke the law for a good cause, and so did Sirius and Hermione. He didn't tell them, they didn't tell him.

He certainly feels betrayed - but that's mainly his ego talking and not accepting that he did the same to them. The real issue is that they made him look foolish when they escaped the Aurors.

********* As I said, good points. After all the solution in the story is indeed feasible. Though it can be debated, if a one-time breach of a law to end a great evil and keeping it a secret as of what means were used is comparable to the continued breach of laws even after the situation at hand was resolved and the lies are continued.

I think that it stands out of question, that both parties should have talked closely after the war about what they have done and what they want to do in the future. Harry's secret does not really impact a betterment of the world, though Hermiones and Sirius way of doing things directly collide with Harry's Methods and aims.

All in all I believe that both secrets were equal after the war in there meaning, but Harry's lost more and more relevancy as time went on. Hermione‘s and Sirius‘ Secret carried on though and was a significant influence in shaping their behavior towards him. This creates an asymmetry between the two things. Harry's behavior was unimpacted by his secret while Hermione and Sirius were continuously dishonest with Harry.

I hope I am making some sense here.

Further, Hermione wanted to tell Harry the truth anyway - Sirius forbade that in the (misguided) belief that Harry would be happier as an Auror (and what Harry wanted, Harry got, in Sirius's book). And as I said - Harry's secret, if revealed would have affected them severly, so the asymmetry wasn't that prominent.

It's really a question of bias, IMHO - those who like Harry tend to take his side, others Hermione's. Even if they do the same thing.

*** I actually really didn't care much for Harry in this one either, or Sirius for that matter, but it felt like a Hermione-centric story, so that's where I tended to struggle the most. Harry and Sirius are both pretty obnoxious in their own ways, and arrogant to boot.

Like I said, it's a good quality, well done story, and the characterizations are well done and consistent. I just don't like the people....which is kind of complimentary to the writing, really. I feel they're real enough to be bothered by them, and enough so that I'm venting on Reddit.

As far as Harry's skills go, him and Ron are on equal footing, do well in the first couple of fights, then get embarrassed by everyone the rest of the story while whining that nobody listens to them. I'd argue that's not putting him/them Gary-Stu levels of competence, or anywhere near the same level as Hermione towards the end of the story.

*** "Being competent isn't the same as being a Mary-Sue. She does not have things implausibly go her way..." Agreed, and agreed. But I think she is portrayed light-years better than competent, and that things always go her way because of it.

"There are 0 similarities to Malfoy, I can't really address this one because I don't have any idea what you're talking about." Arrogance, pure and simple. Her animagus form is a cat, and that affects her personality hugely.

"She's not humiliating Harry, she respects him and feels competitive spirit with him in the game of cops and robbers. Relishing her victories is different from putting him down." Tell that to everyone who constantly ridicules Harry and Ron for continually getting beat by her. She's happy for making him look so bad he might have to quit or get fired. (And he's supposedly the best Auror since Moody, who also got beat by her.)

"She did not lie her way into sleeping with him and felt awful about the lying she had to do to protect people besides herself." If she had been honest at any point during the story up until that point the relationship never would have happened. But it's OK because she lies constantly to absolutely everyone because she's smarter than them and knows better. But it's OK because she tells herself she's lying to 'protect' them, when she's really lying to protect herself. That right there is an arrogant, selfish person justifying behavior they know is wrong. She knows what she is doing will seriously hurt people who care about her, and she does it anyway, while not giving anyone else any input, or the chance to make a decision.

Every character in this story is flawed, which is a good thing. All good characters are. I just personally struggle with this one in particular in this story, because they're the same personality traits I have a hard time with in real life. And maybe it's because that's the type of behavior I often struggle with.
