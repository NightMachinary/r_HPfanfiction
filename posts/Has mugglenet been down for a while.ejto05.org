I probably haven't been on it in a year plus, but I was surprised to be met with an error/we're moving message when I tried to check something on it earlier.

It'd be a real shame to lose that site as it was literally one of the first places that brought me to a wider fan/fandom community. Anyone know anything more about its longterm status?


** I tried to contact them a couple of weeks ago about deleting an old account, and got stuck in a loop of errors/contact this email instead/this email is no longer functional, etc. I started to wonder if there were any admins left.
