I've read a fanfiction in which young Sirius Black struggles not to be a blood supremacist asshole while in Gryffindor, and deals with not going crazy like the rest of his family-- does anyone know the name of this fanfic? I can't find it anymore. Thanks!


** This sounds so familiar, but there's probably more than one out there. Was it Wolfstar?
