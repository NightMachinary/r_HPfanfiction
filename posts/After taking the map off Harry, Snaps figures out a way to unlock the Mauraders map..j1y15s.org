This means that Snape ends up stopping most of the things that happen within the series. E.g. Wormtail, stopping Weasley pranks, stopping Ginny Weasley, finding Barty.

Unfortunately, Reddit won't let me change Snaps to Snape.


** lmao snaps. but what is snape stopping with Ginny if he's taken the map from Harry? Wouldn't he have had to take it from the twins to stop something that happened in Harry's second year?

I like the premise though

** Snape doesn't have the imagination do open the map since he's a twat, dick and incel.

** In the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][Welcome to Hogwarts 1949]], Snape doesn't unlock the secrets of the Marauder's map, Harry does. If you want to see Harry's slow descent into darkness, this fic is for you. 100k+. No romance. HIGHLY recommend.
