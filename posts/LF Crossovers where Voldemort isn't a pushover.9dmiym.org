A lot of crossovers tend to follow the same basic pattern: Harry gets some new cool power, goes to Hogwarts and dominates everybody because of said power, and when Voldemort comes around he gets casually curbstomped to make way for a new villain. Can I get some crossovers where Voldemort maintains his status of being really damn powerful and scary despite whatever power Harry gains?


** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade; The Denarian Knight; The Denarian Lord) Voldemort is still scary, it anything he's even more terrifiying.

*** I've never understood SW/HP crossovers. It's usually contains the force users dominating hp wizards, which I think is a bit ridiculous. Have anyone looked at what Dumbledore did in that movie scene, with the a literal firestorm inside the cave?

The best any sith had done in the movies was make lighting that could probebly be blocked by a freaking protego spell.

**** In this story it's treated as Jedi can use magic, young Wizards can use the Force, but older Wizards can't use the Force because they're too used to wand magic.

Related to your concern, but unrelated to OP's request, Havoc Side of the Force has magic and the Force be in roughly equal terms, with each having pros and cons.

****** Maybe? It would have been in the first one, which I read long ago. It does mention that Earth is bathed in the Force, where Wizards out number Force users by orders of magnitude, even before the Purge at the end of episode 3. I think wands where mentioned as possible reasons as well. But like I said, been a while.

******** No, but he's not a goody two shoes either. He's pulled from the wreckage of Potter Cottage by a former Dark Lady of the Sith who is trying to turn over a new leaf. If anything he's grey. Dumbledore is written as manipulative though. Not quite as bad as some characterization I've seen, but he definitely thinks he knows best, and tries to manipulate things accordingly.

(ex: prophecy indicates that Harry will bring an end to Light and Dark, and so Dumbledore tries to sperate him from his adoptive mother, who he views as a corrupting influence)

  Sequel to Freeing death. It's been two mouths since Harry was dragged into Tartarus, and his friends finally get the okay to find him, because Hera has walked out on Olympus, and won't return into Harry is saved. They only have six days any longer than that Harry will be dead, and if that happens Hera has vowed to destroy the camp.
