Probably means it was being written in about 2003 or 2004.

It stars off with Harry in some kind of mental institution for beating Hermione (under the illusion that she was someone else); first half/two-thirds of the story is then told in flashbacks, before it transpires that his (female) therapist is actually the villain-in-disguise, and it all gets a little peculiar - I recall something to do with another world? It's possible Harry has a wife and daughter, and the only other thing I can remember is that there's a lot of emphasis on Harry smoking whilst institutionalised, and that he can light his cigarettes wandlessly.

Any help would be gratefully appreciated! Just a bit of nostalgia really.


** I'm pretty sure that it's The Human Condition by C.K. Talons [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1312532/1/The-Human-Condition]]

*** That's exactly it - thank you so much! This story very briefly made me a very nerdy kind of popular at my school (internet starved town); I would print it out and hand around the new chapters.
