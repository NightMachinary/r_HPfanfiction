When you shrink a object in the wizarding world, does the excess air flood out rapidly? And if so, the lack of air would stop a fire. So in the ministry, fire suppression runes could happen by rapidly shrinking rooms or cubicles instead of flooding the area with water.


** Depends. If everything else shrinks, wouldn't the fire as well? The Shrinking Charm seems to work on a conceptual level, so I imagine fire might shrink with it.

**** True. But I imagine a spell that simply makes fire impossible would be simpler. We know there are spells to stop other spells, and even one to make all but a certain kind of water disappear. Why not something that makes it literally impossible for fires to start?

***** I imagine the arithimacy behind that would be horrible. What is the spell trying to stop exactly? Heat rising to a certain temperature? Room reaching a level of dryness? A spell like that would have to have exceptions to certain artifacts that would trigger the suppression system.

****** Arithmancy doesn't play a role in spell casting. That's fanon. And the spell can simply be "No Fires Allowed" and that's it. You're looking at it too scientifically. Magic doesn't need to be concerned with any of that. Like the Shrinking Charm, it can work on a conceptual level.

****** You'd need a spell to automatically vanish unconstrained phlogiston and apply a cooling effect - specifying the cold humours of earth and water specifically - to all matter within the spell's effect that is actively dephlogisticating.

(When you're dealing with magic, of course, the humours, phlogiston and luminiferous aether are all real things, and their discrediting as scientific theories are all solid successes of the Obliviators.)

** Runes aren't magic in Harry Potter. You're also thinking wrongly, there is no reason to believe magical fire needs air to burn. Therefore if you're going to use magic to stop fire you'll be acting upon the fire itself not the fuel as we muggles do.

**** Doesn't have to. By keeping the pressure same, you ensure a vakuum doesn't happen and by making sure the entire process takes less than a minute between sucking out the air and replacing it, whoever inside has to suffer lack of oxygen for a short while.

****** Magic? Or fill the room with inflammable air? A heat based statis charm that is cast on everywhere but the fire? A carbon based statis charm? Or a bubblehead charm cast according to body-heat?

When you think about it, a lot of things can work and I like to think wizards are capable of creative thinking and trial runs.

** I think it would work, but maybe not in the best way.

Fire needs three things to keep burning: oxygen, fuel, and heat.

Water stops fire from burning by cooling it off and separating it from the air supply. Most fire extinguishers work purely by creating a barrier between the oxygen and the fuel.

Shrinking a room would reduce the quantity of oxygen available, so on that front it would help. However, what oxygen is still there would still be in contact with whatever is burning so it would continue to burn until the O2 ran out.

The real challenge here is what happens to the heat when the room shrinks? There's a bunch of thermal energy in there, and that energy has to go somewhere. If it can just be done away with via magic, then they should do that instead of shrinking the room. No heat, no fire. If the heat cannot be removed via magic, then shrinking the room would just concentrate that heat into a smaller space, potentially causing much worse damage to the contents. Fire is not the only way to destroy things with heat.

Overthinking magic is kind of my jam...

** I think the simpler path would be to apply some sort of magic to the surfaces in the room that basically stops combustion. That handles normal fires. Magical fires, you might prevent those from igniting the surface with the equivalent of a shield of some sort. If they cast fiendfyre or the equivalent, then you'd want magic that gets everyone the FUCK out of that room because they're screwed if they stay.

If you evacuate the air, or at least the oxygen, then having something that casts a quick bubble-head charm on the room's occupants wouldn't be a bad idea. You might not even need to evacuate the air, if an area transfiguration can swap out the oxygen for something inert - and then back again afters.
