  Hope Potter was everything Albus Dumbledore feared; a girl just as clever, just as dangerous as Tom Riddle had been. Their physical similarities and likeness blinded him to the truth. That Hope wasn't afraid of befriending a Muggleborn Gryffindor or an airy Ravenclaw or even a Slytherin with pro-grey leanings. That Hope Potter was an unpredictable pawn on his chessboard. FemHarry

****** Decent odds that it's Harry/George, because her other fem!Harry story Linkffn(Looking Beyond by shini-amaryllis) that has the same Greek influences is that ship.

My understanding is they're based off of the same worldbuilding/etc but Serpent Tongue is a Slytherin!Harry and Looking Beyond is a Gryffindor!Harry. There's more to it than that for sure, but to be intentionally reductionist that's a major difference that might affect peoples' interest in the two fics.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived.(Greek Myths Abound) Fem!Harry

** Linkffn(Looking Beyond by shini-amaryllis)

Shini's other story Serpent Tongue was linked by someone else, they're both good fics, but while LB is completed, ST isn't. Both have heavy Greek myth influences.
