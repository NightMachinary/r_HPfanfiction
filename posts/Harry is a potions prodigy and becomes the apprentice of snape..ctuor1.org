:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Things i remember:

- In order to gain a journeyman or mastery, he has to invent three potions.

- Him and snape go to potions conventions together overseas, in which harry presents his potions discoveries

- One of his inventions is some kind of instant apparation potion that allows anyone to apparate instantly by throwing the potion to the ground. His intention was for people who couldnt apparate (squibs etc) to be able to like others

- Generally theres a greater emphasis on a wider potions community/association that gathers in a convention often in different countries.

-I have an inkling this fic might be a WBWL as i remember the fact that harry potter becoming the youngest potions inventor? prodigy to be such a scandalous achievement, with his name becoming so renowned.

Thank you!

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
