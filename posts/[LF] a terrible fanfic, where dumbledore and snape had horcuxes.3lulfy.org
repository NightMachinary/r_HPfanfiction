/sigh/

OKAY LOOK. It was horribly written, cliched, and just...ugh.

But I have to find it again. I HAVE TO. Here's the rest of what I remember:

-Independent Harry, possibly with dimensional trunk. Don't remember if it was H/HR with weasley bashing or not. Possibly. - there was a scene with a magical shredding spell at the bottom of stairs and both dumbledore and snape fall into it - everytime they died - and they died a LOT they would come back via horcux, then make a new one.

Any help here? I feel shame for even asking!

*** I was going to suggest this, even though this event in particularly doesn'tring any bells. It gets so out of control near the end I don't even know where my suspension of disbelief landed after i tossed it out the window halfway through.

**** Found it, it's in chapter 34. This is indeed the fic I was looking for. I read fast, but looking at the word count...I don't wanna anymore :(

***** It gets absolutely batshit near the end. Honestly, it's worth reading all the way through at least once just for the absurdity. Though that's your call and I agree it's a bit wordy to get through in one sitting.

Maybe give it a break for a few days/weeks and come back to it if you'd like?

****** I'm at page 366/1205, or at chapter 31.

I am regretting my decision but I MUST PUSH THROUGH. Oh god what have I done to myself. This is ridiculous. This is horrible.

I haven't even reached the worst parts....Just reached the part where they blow up the Daily Prophet/send out the newspaper. Oh god, I've got so much to go. Even at my reading speed...Ugh.

****** oh my fucking god. So I FINALLY finished it - and that's after taking a day and a half off because my brain couldn't handle it.

Like, the first 50 chapters...they all had at least a small nugget of logic/truth/whatever in them, like 'why DIDNT canon do it this way?!' but after that? Ridiculous. Absolutely.

my god, the last few chapters. Damn. Whatshisname is a sexist, racist, war mongering, homophobic sociopathic MORON. Ugh. I can't believe I read all of that. Was it worth it? My brain doesn't know anymore...

******* The brightside is that you can now never have to touch it again, and laugh with the rest of us at its pure absurdity.

You also now have the right to use the 'on a scale one 1 to PKH, how utterly ridiculous is the fucking fic'. So that's a nice perk all things considered. It's a useful scale, to be sure.

*** I'm skimming through it now. I do believe you are right. Oh god, 500k words? I read incredibly fast but...argh.

Sad thing is I actually kinda liked Harry Crow in a guilty pleasure way. IDK about this one though. But.. I think I'm going to power through it. God help my poor soul....especially if I end up liking it like a trash romance novel.

YES IT IS FOUND THE SCENE IN CHAPTER 34 FUCK

Don't feel guilty about liking /anyone's/ work. We don't all have the exact same tastes in what we read, and that's a good thing.

****** Exactly. Too many people mistake their own taste for objectiveness.

Plus Robst got one important quality that sets him apart from many, many other authors and which many of his critics do not seem to value at all: He generally updates very regularly and finishes his stories.
