As the titel suggests i'm craving some Tonks. Preferably darker femslash, because i've read a few fics where she comes of as a doofus, which is not my cup of tea.

No abandoned fics or oneshots please!


** linkffn(to reach without) has a bad ass but not really dark tonks. Like she's one of the most dangerous people in the country as an auror which are kinda like special forces in the fic.

linkffn(princess of the blacks) has a non doofus tonks.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry
