Authors who post to multiple fics at the same time: what's your strategy for this? What type of update schedule do you maintain? Would you suggest just posting to one fic at a time?


** Schedule? That sounds so... organized.

I just post an update to whatever whenever I happen to have written it. (I've held myself to schedules before and they tend to end up stressing me out.)

** I have been posting two fics simultaneously for a few weeks. One has been posted at two chapters a week and the other once a week. I've been doing it this way because they are part of a series and the events in the last chaper of one are significant to a chapter in the other so I want to post both of them on the same day. (Though frankly the chance of anyone reading both is astronomically small.)

​

Of course they are both already written. I'm in awe of people who can write and post as they go and still have a well-paced, coherent story.

** My schedule is 'post something each week, and don't leave any stories untouched for too many months in a row.' For my first two years writing fanfiction I had a project I updated every ten days, but that is now finished and I don't want to use such a strict schedule again for a while. I'm a discovery writer, and it makes me feel restricted too much when limited to a particular story to update.

​

I work on around a half dozen fics at a time - it would be more, but I try to keep the number down to five if possible. At present, I have three primary projects I aim to update each at least once a month, preferably twice monthly now that my schedule isn't dominated by my first fic, a handful of secondary projects which I update when inspired or when I remember they exist and feel it's been too long, plus two or three shorter ones that I'm really not focusing on but am thinking about.

​

I tried stricter scheduled updates for a while, but it ended up stressing me out too much. I write better when I have loose guidelines and limited restrictions. "Write a chapter of anything, sometime this week" is attainable and much less stressful, while still providing the necessary forward impetus to overcome my perfectionism and make me actually post something.
