** Yes. However, I don't read stories until complete (unless by accident and get hooked) as I struggle to remember where it is up to.

*** I'm the exact same way but I ran out of stuff to read. You might have to be patient though this is my first writing.

**** All good. Make sure you plan the story first. Most fics get abandoned due to the writers not knowing where the story is going. Good luck!

** The problem with Quidditch fics is that they're Quidditch fics. They tend to be suuuuuuuper boring as most authors don't have the whimsical flair that JKR had when writing those scenes. The action itself tends to be boring, and the goings-on surrounding the game (such as trades, sponsors, practice camp, etc) usually falls flat.

For example, take a look at Vitam Paramus. The story is like 25 chapters long, and pretty much nothing happened into the story until the author decided to add an epilogue a few years after the story had been marked as complete. Just tons and tons of Quidditch filler with no meaningful character interactions. And that's pretty much the best long Quidditch fic.

**** I'd just like to add that i really, really liked Vitam Paramus. I think the tone you set fit very well with the tragedy at the beginning. It was all very depressing, not in the 'sad' sense but in the way that you could kind of feel what Gabby was feeling, just some kind of emptiness that she didn't really know how to fill-

I don't think I'm explaining this very well but suffice it to say that i love your writing and you're awesome!

** The good ones only use quidditch as a catalyst for the actual plot, or use it to promote character development. The actual games are not the crux of the story.

*** Excellent point. And honestly part of that is because of Quidditch itself. There's only so many ways you can say "Harry catches the snitch" or "Harry doesn't catch the snitch".
