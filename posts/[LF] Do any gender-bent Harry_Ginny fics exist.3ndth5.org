I happened across some fanart depicting girl!Harry and boy!Ginny being cute together and thought a fanfiction of that would be fun. I know Harry/Ginny is pretty popular on this sub (I admit it's not really my thing though) so I'm wondering if anyone has ever come across something like this.

Alternatively, I'd also be interested in any fics with Hermione/Ron as the focus. Thanks!


** Well, there are several smut fics involving them using polyjuice to take each other's form: linkffn(Harry, Ginny and Polyjuice Potion) linkffn(Polyjuice, Memory Charms, and More)

  Harry has a brilliant idea! He loves Ginny and knows her inside and out. But, he wants to REALLY know what it feels like to be her - just for a little while. Will Ginny consent to his little experiment?

*** [[https://www.pinterest.com/pin/341429215472627919/][Here]] it is. Took me forever to find it again. It's just a little sketch but I thought the idea was cute. I couldn't find this piece on the artist's deviantart but she has a really good gender swapped Neville and Luna on there. Her page is maaria.deviantart.com if you wanna look more of her stuff.
