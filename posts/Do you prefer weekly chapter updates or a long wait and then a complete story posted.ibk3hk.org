** Prince of Slytherin does update by chapter - book 3 was just finished and book 4 will start soon.

Generally, I prefer to read the complete thing, but I have a few stories on follow that I read as WiPs. I usually reread them once they're done.

** I like fics that are published in full, though I understand why authors choose to publish in parts. Not only do they often not have the time to write in full, but updating over time seems to generate more views simply because of the sorting mechanism of fanfiction sites.

** I prefer fics that update weekly, but anything longer than that I find I have trouble remembering what happened, so in those cases (aka most of them) I prefer the entire fic to be dropped at once.

The ideal situation, IMO, is when the author posts weekly, but has already finished the fic in full, and has announced that, so you don't have to worry about delays.

*** I also find that fics that are finished and post a chapter weekly have less of a ‚Äúmeander towards the climax‚Äù problem that a lot of longer fics end up with.

** I have no preference as to how a story is posted. Whichever way best enables the writer to continue writing and feel positive about the story, I suppose. As a writer, I'm very much post-as-I-go, and the actual posting of a thing is a strong motivator for continuing. I know another writer who can't post until it's complete. So, really, whatever works for the given author is what I prefer, since happy authors are more likely to write well than discouraged ones.

As a reader, I read it all at once up to where it's current, then leave for a few years and check back to see if it's finished yet, re-read up to the present, repeat. I don't have a good enough memory to follow a story week-to-week, let alone if it updates monthly or something.

** I'd rather read a finished story and in any case, wouldn't want to expect an author to follow a weekly or other schedule, since they have their own stuff happening in their lives. It's fine that they post when they feel like it. It also seems to me that installment-published stories tend to not get updated after the last part is posted. This is unfortunate since lots of them could use a deep editing pass after all the chapters are written. So the end result reads like a first draft. It's ok, it's fanfic and I'm used to that, but it's an area where pro fic (not counting JKR after around volume 3 of the HP series, by which time she had grown stronger than her editors and could publish her books with all the loose ends dangling out) has an advantage over fanfic.

That all said, one reason I keep checking back here is there's a story in progress for which I'm eagerly awaiting updates ;).

** I usually read stories when they are complete but I need someone to either recommend them to me or having some prequel because otherwise I have no way of knowing whether they are good or a waste of time.

** I prefer in full because it's much easier for me to really get into it. I try to find fics that are completed only but honestly there are some really good ones that will never be finished or the author simply is unreliable about posting....I save those and then re-read them like a year later haha because I can't remember anything about the plot by the time they do post again.

** Hi!!! I don't have an answer to your question but I had never read these, and I just wanted to say I LOVE THEM. I started a little bit of both and I just wanted to thank you for bringing them to my attention!

** I never read a WIP (or anything that isn't already marked complete) except occasionally by accident because A) I usually knock out a book every night, unless it's exceptionally long or I'm exceptionally tired (30k-150k) and B) I have zero confidence that a WIP will actually be completed, and I hate an unfinished story. Even if they say it's already finished and they're publishing it a bit at a time, they still get abandoned sometimes.

I favorite anything I might like to read again, or that I would recommend to a friend, and leave reviews for the ones that were exceptional, even though they were often published years and years ago, but I know it's the WIP readers that really keep the writers going, so many thanks to all of you with more patience than me ü•∞

Edit: In daylight, brain at normal capacity hours, I realized I sound like an ass with my "I read 150k words every night" bit. I'm not an ass, I just have chronic insomnia, no money or desire to read anything but free HP fanfic, and no talent or motivation to write my own. I rely on you guys to keep me from going insane; you're my heroes ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üéâ

**** Unfinished sequels to really excellent books are the bane of my existence üòÖ My one that got away though, the one that I update a review about once a year, is a Hobbit fic that's an unfinished companion fic to one that thankfully /is/ finished. The unfinished version from a different character's POV is about 100 times better though. I still check about once month for an update üò¢

** Well, I definitely like fics that are split into chapters far more than 50k+ word fics all shoved into a single chapter. Sure, I'm going to read them all in one sitting either way, but the chapter breaks help refresh things emotionally and reduce the fear of completely losing my place in the fic thanks to a wayward flick or dropped phone lmao.

In terms of release schedules? Hmm... I'm not sure. Generally, I don't really read ongoing fics. I'm more of a binge reader, and it can be difficult for me to keep up with multiple fics updating over time. I'm also pretty wary of incomplete fics that the author may end up dropping in the future.

At the end of the day, though, I feel like authors have their reasons for releasing fics over time. I feel like the authors who have the entire story complete by the time they post the first chapter are a small percentage of authors. Many only have part of the story written. So, while they are far enough ahead to guarantee weekly updates, they don't have a complete story to post.
