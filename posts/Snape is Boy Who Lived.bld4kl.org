I just had a dream that Harry somehow got the Daily Prophet to publish an article saying that, there was a mistake, it was actually Snape who vanquished Voldermort and he was the real Boy-Who-Lived.

And Harry got it published while he was at Hogwarts, so when he went down to breakfast everyone immediately ignored him and as soon as they saw Snape started going "It's him! Its the Boy-Who-Lived!"

I was deeply disappointed when I woke up to find that that wasn't the fic I was reading before I feel asleep. Is there an actual story like that?

(Edit: spelling.)


** Vanquishing Voldemort and being the Boy Who Lived are technically separate things. Harry is the BWL because he took a killing curse to the face and lived.

*** There are a fic or two where the prophecy is about 3 different people. The one with the power to vanquish the dark lord, the one marked as equal and the one with the power he knows not. Or something like that.\\
Is an amusing take on the prophecy.

*** Yes that's true.

Maybe Harry spun a story about how Snape's mother died to protect him from Voldermort.

I mean.. the timeline's kinda vague isn't it? Maybe when he was just rising into power he crossed paths with her in some foul chance and she died from it? Snape would have just about to start school or starting when Voldermort started his stuff yeah?

Which leads to a whole lot more questions but, what if?

*** I think it was because I had a finished reading a very silly fic and started in on a very serious one.

I feel like I've seen something like that before out there, but not very much.

** That would be very vicious of Harry, then, wouldn't it? The greasy bat would die of annoyance.

*** I think in the dream it was during Rita's interview, and Harry said something like, "Wait what do you mean 'Boy-Who-Lived'? Snape's the real Boy-Who-Lived!" And they just ran with it.

***** I guess maybe Voldermort took one look at him and just shriveled up and died?

I don't understand it myself honestly.

Probably would be better for them to call him "The Vanquisher Of He Who Must Not Be Named" or something.

** As long as it isn't true, that would take a lot of the hilarity out of it. Make him and Dumbledore keep denying it and saying Harry was the boy who lived.

*** I think it'd be funny if it wasn't true, but then, it was.

Like, Harry came up with this on the spot to get people to leave him alone, but, turns out it has some truth to it!

Harry says that Snape defeated Voldermort with "the Power of Love". Turns out it's got some merit because there was an incident in an alleyway one day and, in the short of it, Snape's mom died and protected him.

It just took almost twenty years for it to be effective..

(Yeah I don't think I'm going to read this fic ever lol.)
