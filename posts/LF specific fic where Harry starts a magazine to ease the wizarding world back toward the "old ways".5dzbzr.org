I remember they had a little spell section that really taught elemental manipulation or something. Thank you!


** I believe it's /The Rise of Dark Lord/ by Little.Miss.Xanda. Great fic.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

**** By chapter 22? I don't believe there is slash, though it's heading in that direction.

When I encounter a slash scene, I just skip it. If I just didn't read slash, then I'd have never read quite a few of my favorite fics.
