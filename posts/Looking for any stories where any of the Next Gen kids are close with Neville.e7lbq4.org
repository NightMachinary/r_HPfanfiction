Not in a sexual way or anything, but ask for advice, go to him when they're fighting with their siblings and/or parents, et cetra.

Doesn't have to be the main part of the story, but any part is fine like that.

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash


** Didn't he have kids named after Alice and Augusta? Maybe there could be a To Kill A Mockingbird type story or something.

Edit: Turns out he didn't have kids, but it's still a possibility. He could act godfatherly to Albus though.

*** Don't think Neville and Hanna had children. If they did, it was never mentioned

**** /furrows eyebrows/

/checks Neville's family on the Wiki/

/reads “no kids”/

Oh... That's new, me mixing up canon and fanon. No, Neville didn't have kids in canon.

***** Which is why it's head cannon for me that Neville appreciates the Potter and Weasley family. Also Ginny's line to James "Give Neville our love". Kind of indicates that they are a close bunch with him...

Neville might be the most popular character in the series to get barely any fanfic recognition and even if he's got a fic, it's either extremely short or completely ridiculous.

****** Oh damn, you're right. He doesn't get many fics. Now I really want to read a Neville Peggy Sue.

** This story has Neville being a good teacher. It has a bit of next gen on it, but not very deeply, being a short story.
