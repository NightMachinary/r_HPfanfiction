:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi all, trying to find a fic I read as a teen. It was orginally on HPPF, and was the most read fic at the time.

It was quite an emotional, and interesting look at the Marauders school years, and post hogwarts lives.

I remember it had a gut punch ending. The OP was a muggleborn ravenclaw?

Please help me! :)


** I'm fairly certain you mean OC (own character) not OP. Just clarifying for anyone like me, who gets confused.

** Any other information? I've read a heap of Sirius/OC stories so I can have a look if you want.

Was it on FanFiction.net?
