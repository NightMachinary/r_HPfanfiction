** She learns tact and how to empathize with others. Also, that actions have consequences.

Ron's pet attacked by mine, deal with it.

Harry is dealing with his most hated teacher at night attacking his mind, stop putting the blame on him.

Book 6 should have had Ron reject her for attacking him.

Book 7 should have had her be more accepting of other's theories.

I wouldn't have minding her accepting she can't be the absolute best as a side arc. It would also tie into a bit more competent Harry.

Rowling thought about adding an intellectual equal to Hermione as a Weasley cousin. I think that would have been a fantastic idea for someone opposing her proving her wrong or showing her up.

  She learns tact and how to empathize with others.
#+end_quote

The problem with Hermione is that her entire character revolves around being the deliverer of exposition. She has to be right in order to move the plot along and help Harry solve the mystery of the year. For her character to learn humility and empathy, Hermione would have to make a huge and destructive mistake, because just being /told/ that she's rude and pushy wouldn't teach her anything. And a plot-derailing mistake would never happen because JKR had that "All Was Well" ending planned from the start, and Hermione was always her self-insert, wish-fulfillment character.

So what we're left with is a Hermione who is only willing to learn something from other people if she's aware of what she lacks, and since she's not a self-reflective character, there's not much that she actually thinks she lacks. With school and books, she pays attention because she wants knowledge. With letting Harry teach DADA with Dumbledore's Army, it's because Harry has the hands on experience.

  "Harry," she said timidly, "don't you see? This... this is exactly why we need you... we need to know what it's r-really like... facing him... facing V-Voldemort."
#+end_quote

Things that she actually lacks, eg. Divinating abilities, femininity, likeability, and open-mindedness are traits she rationalizes as unimportant. And her lack of them are only ever tangentially important to the main plot of the books, like the completely irrelevant SPEW subplot.

It's fine to not fit the stereotype of 'femininity' even if you're female. *cue gasps.*

It's not OK to look down on others for expressing traits typically associated with the stereotype of femininity, but saying that she lacks an important trait because she's not 'feminine' is ridiculous.

***** Yeah, they probably mean something like acceptance of femininity.

Hermione is very, very judgemental. She is the [[/r/notliketheothergirls]] type that considers herself better than her peers because she is not into makeup and gossip. That is actually a good reason to knock her down.

I don't think she should be more feminine. She should be who she wants to be. But she should be able to see that her way is not the only way to have a fullfilling life.

***** I make no personal judgement in whether feminity is important or unimportant. Frankly, out of all those traits, I think Divination ability is overrated since HP universe seers have a habit of giving self fulfilling prophecies in the form of ambiguously worded poems.

I'm saying that /Hermione/ judges femininity as unimportant, and to a certain extent, treats other characters poorly because she perceives them as having an excessive amount of this trait. It's not a flaw to /lack feminity/, it's a flaw to act on the perception that feminity is synonymous with superficial vanity.

If I believed espousing conventional displays of feminity was the sign of being a good or worthy person, then I would like Umbridge as a character, which I don't.

If there's a better word to call that than "femininity", feel free to enlighten me.

  It was breakfast time, two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.

  "Not really," said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. "I've never really liked horses."

Hermione's in a pretty awkward spot as far as femininity goes because we don't get to see that part of her often due to the fact that basically everyone she interacts with often is a dude. Ron's a dude. Harry's a dude. Ginny's a dude. Neville's a dude. Dude stuff is gonna happen on-screen.

  Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff house Quidditch team at Hogwarts.

  Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair and grey eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum.

  He had been starting to quite like Cedric---prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone's favourite champion.

  There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognised at once: tall, pale, dark-haired and handsome---the teenage Voldemort.

  Half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognised Riddle at once. His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys.

  The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognising as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him: he looked more handsome than ever.

*** Yes absolutely. The weird thing about Hermione she has the perfect set up for an arc. Shes not good at empathy.

You see her be cold and callous not intentionally but still it hurts others. Shes not the only one but others like say Ron face consequences and are held responsible by the narrative in a way Hermione never is. So they get to grow as characters in a way Hermione doesn't.

Mainly because even though she may be jealous or cold but she's usually right or her heart was in the right place.

Like when she tells Harry to stop using the book in half blood prince and something fucked up about it or the spells are suspicious. Its because the book is smarter than her. Shes mad that Harry is getting better scores. Shes right he shouldnt use the spells but she never has to face consequences for her jealousy so never has to deal with the fact that shes not always going to be the smartest and thats ok.

Or for example When she in the third book tells Mcgonnigal about the firebolt because shes concerned it was sent by Sirius Black. But she doesnt voice that concern till after she tattles. Yes her concern is valid and important. But so is trust and communication. And even if she is right about Sirius sending it this is a betrayal of that trust which is necessary for relationships all relationships. And while sometimes its time to intervene to help your friend sometimes they need to exercise their own autonomy even if you want them to do something else. And thats a lesson that now wasnt learnt and I dont think ever is. Rinse and repeat forever. Esentially by making her in the right or never facing real consequences for being wrong its not that she doesnt get a better arc its that she doesnt get an arc at all.

What Harry did was no different than a high school kid buying a study book for AP tests. I disagree about the spells though, considering she backtracked and used them too. Muffliato was useful as was sectumsempra and Levicorpus. Harry should have learned the effects though.

Book 3, she would have been right if she even mentioned her concerns with the broom. She just vaguely shrieked about it, and Harry left it.

I wish her character had to respond to people better, because the way she is, she ends up being a slightly benevolent Umbridge.

***** Oh true good point about helping Ron and the spells. But even if she was wrong the narrative still holds her not responsible its just never a big deal when shes the one whose in the wrong according to the narrative.

In the 3rd book for example she does face consequences after that and the scabbers thing Harry and Ron stop speaking to her and shes miserable. But the message is they are being dicks by not going back to their friend over a broom and a rat. The rat part is really weird coming from Hagrid who cares deeply for like animals and saving Buckbeak from being executed is a big deal in this book.

If i remember correctly Hermione does applogize about Scabbers but its like when Hagrid points out they are being dicks so its not really the same as saying im sorry when the narrative is making the issue a big deal. Having a pet thats been with you for years pass away even if you werent always the most fond of them hurts. Ya the rat is Pettigrew but they dont know that then.

And Hermione being insensitive about it that and tattling without even attempting to talk about the broom is a big deal. Not because the broom is important but because thats kinda troubling behavior. I know whats best for you so why even bother to have the conversation. But the behavior is handwaved and made all about the broom. They point out at the end that she was wrong about it being dangerous. But the whole you just tattled before even trying to talk about it is never brought up.

Im not saying Harry and Ron were right here but they werent the only ones who screwed up. And their flaws were called out while hers werent and she just got to be the victim.

You have a very militant view of how the books should have gone.

I don't see much wrong with Ron's character. He's a bit of a dick, but book 7 had him influenced by a horcrux (the thing that possessed a girl for a year), though book 4 was on him. His treatment towards Harry isn't up for debate for a relationship between Ron and Hermione. It's Hermione's and Ron's treatment of each other.

Edit: I do agree with her on House-elves, but figure she went about it wrong. Rather than trying to free them, causing them distress, she could have espoused the benefits of freedom and listened to them. They require clothing to free. That actually sounds like something sinister is at play for them.

***** I'm not wading in on the Hermione stuff except to say that, as many problems as I have with her, I have even more with Ron. Ron is crass, bad-tempered and abandons his friends twice in life-or-death scenarios. We can talk about the Horcrux affecting him all we want, but the fact remains that Hermione didn't run out despite its effect. If Ron is just weak-minded, that's something else, but him running away is not out of character irregardless. Throw in his jealous streak, bigotry and misogyny, and he really is outed a hateful bellend in my mind.

Edit:

Bigotry - He is anti-Slytherin to the extent that he lumps everybody into the category of being evil scum. That is bigotry. Slytherin does not mean "Junior Death Eater." Snape fans will attest to this. And the dozens of children in the house are hardly evil, especially the eleven and twelve year olds. If they were, the house would never have been allowed to continue.

Misogyny - He is misogynistic insofar that he treats Hermione like shit in year four for not giving him what he wants, even remarking that she should go out with either him or Harry because "...you're a girl." I might dislike feminism, but that is quite sexist. It gets worse when he decides to use Lavender in order to get back at her for not paying attention to him in year six. Let's also remember that he is embarrassingly overprotective of a sister a solitary year his junior out of embarrassment that she has more romantic experience. And let's not forget the drooling over his sister-in-law, long after the effects stop working on others. And the constant demeaning attitude towards Hermione for being a woman. And the slut-shaming of Ginny.

Honestly, folks, it's all there in dribs and drabs. Just pay attention.

***************** I don't care that he's dumb at age eleven. He's dumb throughout all seven books (objectively speaking, Ron is a dumb character. His grades reflect this.) and never grows out of his anger issues, jealousy issues or overprotective issues towards his sister. And I'm not getting into the issues of bigotry again. Ultimately, he's a man-child of the highest order, so his laughable behaviour in the later books, including the final one, is proof that he doesn't grow throughout the series. Hermione has no arc, Ron has no arc and even Harry has no arc. It's poor writing, but for Ron it's also an excuse to not make him grow out of the puerility that encapsulates him early-on.

‚Äã

Nobody said that he should have known there would be a troll there. His words were deliberately hurtful and they resulted in her vulnerable position. He is culpable for that much, even if he didn't force her to flee into the bathroom personally or sic the troll on her.

Talking about people you dislike is one thing. Everybody does it. Being outright nasty, ignorant and downright abusive to a person's face is quite another.

He didn't grow out of it. That's the problem with his character "arc".

Being a reasonable amount of protective towards a sister doesn't give him permission to slut-shame her for kissing her boyfriend. He's a misogynist and I have yet to see any evidence to the contrary.

I never claimed that Harry was overly-intelligent either. He was allowed to join the Aurors because he was good at fighting and killed Voldemort, not because of his grades. With regards to raw intelligence, both of them are quite stupid. They rely on Hermione for smarts throughout all seven books because she has many and they have far fewer.

  As to the first point: an eleven year old is abused and you want to victim-blame? Yikes.
#+end_quote

Over-use and frankly incorrect use of incredibly loaded terms that have very serious very real meanings like "abuse" and "bullying". Yikes.

Bullying involves a pattern of behaviour and a real or perceived power imbalance, both things absent in this scenario between Ron and Hermione. This was a throwaway comment, and not intended for Hermione to hear. Ron certainly didn't engage in a campagin of insulting Hermione and using slurs against her the way Malfoy elected to. Hermione certainly doesn't acknowledge any real or perceived power imbalance between herself and Ron, and never acts as such throughout canon. Your labelling Ron as a bully is delusional.

This is also not "abuse". Ron did not direct his words at Hermione, did not intend for her to hear, and did not otherwise confront or injure her in any way. They are not in any sort of relationship that would imply he had a duty to care for her in any way beyond that of a fellow student. Again, you calling this abuse is delusional.

Draco Malfoy is quite abusive towards Hermione and attempts to bully her multiple times throughout canon. Yet there's so much delusional smutty Dramione fics crowding the web. Meanwhile Ron, who actually cares about Hermione and whom Hermione actually goes on to marry and have children with, is cast in so many fics as this abusive, misogynist, asshole who ought to just kill himself to make everyone happy. I especially like the common fanon assumption that he beats Hermione, in spite of the fact that canonically Hermione is the one who's hit Ron, and not vice versa. People are bringing traits and actions to Ron's character that's simply not there in canon. Could it be classism in action? Probably.

************* It has nothing to do with classism in this particular case, regardless of what is written in fanfiction. It has to do with stomping out bullying. You can argue that the term is not relevant until the cows come home if you wish, but verbally mocking someone is classed as bullying within the education system and in places of work in my country, which is in a western democracy. Furthermore, mocking someone behind their back is also tantamount to verbal abuse, given that it can needlessly impact their reputation and status in the minds of other people.

You don't have to like it, but even if you do not, the facts don't care about feelings, as annoying as Shapiro nominally is. People also like to forgive the Dursleys, including Rowling, despite the fact that Petunia could and should have been arrested for assault with a deadly weapon for swinging a frying pan at Harry's head, if not attempted murder. At the end of the day, most of the characters who do wrong in this series are forgiven out of hand, including Ron and Hermione themselves.

Point is: I'm not about to excuse Ron's character and actions because some people are triggered by me pointing out that he is not a nice person in canon. Pulling on rose-tinted glasses is not my shtick. If someone tries to sell me a bucket of shit, I'm going to call them on it.

Once again you've demonstrated a lack of reading comprehension, logical thinking and general common sense. Nowhere did I address Ron's "slutshaming" which is really such a feminism 101 reading of the situation. If that's your sophomoric interpretation then so be it.

Stockholm syndrome is a condition which causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors during captivity. These alliances result from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time together, but they are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. The FBI's Hostage Barricade Database System and Law Enforcement Bulletin indicate that roughly 8% of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.This term was first used by the media in 1973 when four hostages were taken during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden. The hostages defended their captors after being released and would not agree to testify in court against them.

** I would have liked to see an Arc where she truly confront her shortcomings, I think that the narration is truly too "nice" to her:

- In 3rd year, she was way too callous. I don't care that you think Trewalney is a fraud, if you classmate just lost her pet, you comfort her, you don't try to make a point about how the Divination teacher didn't "called it". Same point for her disput with Ron. "You just found Scabber so I was right about Crookshanks and I deserve an apology". Girl, your cat tried to attack the rate several time, and later Ron found this cat in his dorm, while his rat dissapeared and there was blood and /claw marks/ and his bed. No matter what happened later, the fact that she refused to even consider her cat may be responsible at that time show she was more worried about being right than conforting her friend who just lost his cat.
- In 5th year, she is really not nice to Luna. I know Luna is the magical equivalent of conspiracy theorist, and that some of them are truly impossible to believe. But one of their school book is full of creature that she was convinced "didn't exist" barely 5 years ago, could she not at least keep an open mind long enough to do some true ressearch. Worst is that she was convinced "nothing pulled the carriage" when it was later proved Thesrals existed.
- Her crise of jealousy in 6th year, Ron may have been extremely jealous in 4th year, but at least he sticked to words and never "attacked" her.

‚Äã

In both case, Hermione is "wrong", but the narration just forget about it. Scabbers reappear and she is instantly forgiven, worse it's Ron who has to make an apology. Hagrid prove Luna was right for at least one thing but the plot never talk about it again. Ron almost die, and everything return to normal between them once he is out of the infirmary.

Considering how Ron is treated after his own faillures (the whole apology thing in 4th year, and his return in 7th year), I would have liked Hermione to also have to earn some forgiveness, or at the very least just apologise for her previous actions.

‚Äã

And who know, if Hermione was forced to face consequences after her faillures, maybe some fan would not have forgotten she also had some and strop to treat her as "the perfect friend" in fanfics while bashing Ron.

I mean imagine that the Triwizard was more varied, to the point where one of the schools was from South America. They use ____ potion, but their ingredients and their brewing method are different due to what they have or don't have. Or because they were told, "this way is more efficient."

I remember a line in a fic that went something like "Ten good potions beats one perfect potion all the time." I imagine the academic in her having a huge issue with that.

** Disclaimer: I really like Hermione's arc already.

I feel like some combination of Ron, Ginny and Luna teaching her how to make friends and the result being that she gets on better with Lavender, Parvati and the other girls in her year would have been a nice addition though.

The ingredients were there - a muggleborn girl knows nothing about the world at first & rubs her roommates up the wrong way, but later over a period of years makes her first friends (Harry & Ron), gets brought into a wizarding family & is able to learn basics from all the Weasleys, later develops an unexpected mutually beneficial friendship with gregarious Ginny who proves that she can have female friends and have common interests/values unexpectedly with others she pre-judged, and finally is able to after a struggle even get on with Luna. Having embraced her femininity more - which canon!Hermione zigzags on imo - and made very unexpected friends, Lavender & Parvati are a breeze and Hermione discovers that their status as witches & colleagues makes them more than the mean girls who used to bully her - they're all Gryffindors after all!

Tbh I feel that this could have slotted into canon but I suspect JKR was careful to not allot Hermione and her life too much attention until it was too late, given that her editor had mandated other changes to make sure the books appealed primarily to the assumed main target audience of boys.

** Ah, yes. If you want a good character development for Hermione, look no further than Philosopher Stone itself.

Starting off as a person with poor social skills with her main priority being academic pursuits. She isn't here to make friends or have fun. She thinks she's going to Hogwarts to learn everything.\\
But she's shown the error of her ways in Halloween when it is not the "Got Leviosa on the first try" that saved her from the troll. It was two fellow classmate's concern for her. So, she changes. She decides to show the same concern for those two in return, in some extreme ways too, such as setting Snape on fire to save Harry.\\
Then finally before Harry confronts Voldemort, she admits out loud, "/Books/! And cleverness! There are more important things - /friendship/ and bravery".

But as many would know, Canon derails a lot of these beats where Hermione takes the new firebolt away from Harry, then the "Sneak" thing in OotP, canaries in HBP and the worst thing is they were justified plot-wise and she was right in the end.

So, yeah. A character arc about where she learns to be more empathetic and respects others would be a cool arc to see.

** The narrative is much too biased towards her. Somehow, when she does something questionable or wrong, we're led to give her the benefit of the doubt at best, or at worst it's a flat out rationalization of her actions. This stands in contrast to Ron.

For example: with the Lavender/Ron/Hermione situation, we have a comment from Luna about how Ron can be "unkind" despite the fact that Hermione /physically attacked Ron/. Never mind the fact that Hermione was much harsher to Luna than Ron was, back in /OotP/. That somehow because it was "in response" to Ron, it makes it OK or at the least understandable for her to act out like that. Did we ever get a rationalization about Ron's jealous reaction to Hermione and Krum? Absolutely not. Despite, of course, Ron never attacking Hermione and still remaining friends the next week.

** As someone else down the thread said, I think there was a character arc for her in PS. What I am curious about is how much have her parents not been able to guide her during the years because she does not tell them about the things that go on. 11/12 is sort of that transition time in identity formation when you no longer take your parent's view without question, but some studies show that one of the best ways to pas on belief systems is two-way conversations about things between parent and child. This is an assumption, but I think a valid one. Also if Ron had a little more confidence in himself would he be more of a foil for her. I'm sort of thinking out loud and how this would affect the AU that I am planning. Very interesting discussion OP.

If you can make Polijuice at 13, Veritasserum shouldn't be that difficult by 17. Dose Malfoy, grill him for information, get that confession for attempted murder, war crimes, treason and whatever else you can throw at him and then dispose of the body. Or, at the very least, do a Lockhart.

Proceed accordingly during the Horcrux hunt. Making no progress? Well, there are still Death Eaters and snatchers to hunt down. Snatchers/other death squads are also around in case no Death Eaters can be found. Then have her clean up after the war. All Death Eaters get life in prison at the very least. No exceptions.

** I think all the comments here are great, but sometimes trying to recreate the Canon in fic during their school years can be pretty futile. They were 11 to 17. Trying to force a more mature stance on children almost always results in something to me that feels like !overpowered.

It's realistic that none of them are particularly self reflective. Spats of jealousy and possiveness are oh so common in first relationships. As is thinking you know everything about everything. Children have a tendency to see adults as neutered characters with very flat reasoning and no personal interests outside their defined role in the child's life. Dumbledore is good, therefore instructing harry to learn from snape is good. Snape is a teacher, therefore, his teaching methods are for best effect. Also, hermione derives her own authority from the approval of her teachers and their acknowledgment of her brilliance. Disagreeing with authority figures just undermines her own belief in her own infallibility. And intelligent children get very used to being the smartest person in the room (a big fish in a small pond, so to speak). It takes some hard knocks in the real world to get over that.

It's also common that violence perpetrated by women is perceived on either end of an extreme spectrum. Attacking Ron with magic is seen as relatively harmless, while Ron attacking her would be seen as an extreme moral failing. I think half the reason that Bellatrix is seen as such a terrifying figure is that she was a female prone to terrible violence. The casual references to rape and kidnapping from the snatchers is almost ludicrously down played, while Bella's "enhanced" interrogation is the epitome of horror. Even in our times, women are far less likely to be tried for murder, yet far more likely than men with similar charges to be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. A violent woman must either have a very good reason that is justifiable or be the worst kind of psychopath. I think the forgiveness hermione experiences for her violence (punching draco, poisoning (sleeping draught in food) crabbe and goyle, setting snape on fire, kidnapping Rita, sending umbridge to the forbidden forest) is just as likely a gender bias as a wishful plot.

*** Thank you for this comment. It expressed a lot of what I was feeling about Hermione's character. Some of my absolute favourite fics are fics that engage with Harry and his schoolmates as children and they're really effective.

** Dentists everywhere are a sub-group of the Unspeakables, and Hermione is an Agent raised from a young age to incorporate herself into the life of just another Child Of Prophecy. D'you think those are Rare? With how many prophecies are in each of the departments, worldwide? Some people play bigger roles than others, but Everyone is important in some way, and the Master Of Death will be needed in another six hundred years. Agent HG-149 will be forgotten, but Hermione Granger will be remembered.

** Better character arc, would be a fine love story of her falling in love with Harry. Yes I know straight harmony but at the same time, they could have a slow burn of her falling in love with him, getting scared because her logic tells her there's a good chance Harry would die. Then finding out finally that they love each other in the tent.
