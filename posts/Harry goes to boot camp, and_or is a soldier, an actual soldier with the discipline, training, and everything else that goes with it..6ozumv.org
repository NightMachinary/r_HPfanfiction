*** I've heard a lot about this story, some good, some bad. Could you help clear some of it up. Is harry OP in any way in this, and if so to what extent, and when does he become OP. Does the story have a slow pace or fast pace, and lastly how would you describe the character development in this.

I look forward to hearing back from you. Anyone else's opinion is also welcome.

**** Some comments:

- Not all parts are enjoyable for me, but some parts are very enjoyable.
- The amount of politics, strategies, and tactics involved is amazing. The author obviously knows his stuffs.
- Harry would be considered OP in most other HP fics, but not so much in this story because one person's power mattered far less in wars involving thousands of wizards and millions of Muggle soldiers. This Harry was a bloodthirsty one and loved leading his troops personally. His presence often gave them decisive advantages, but also caused severe complications.
- The pace varies. Except for the early war in France, I think the pacing is generally good. The story has mostly covered years between 2008 and 2023.
- Character developments are heavily tied to the overall political and military situations. Harry, Neville, Ginny, Astoria, Gabrielle, and Xenophilius Lovegood are the 6 major Canon characters undergoing the most changes because of the circumstances. OCs are very important, especially Harry's wife Ellie, senior advisor Albert Hughes, and SIS spy Josefina.
- A very interesting theme in this story is the constant and hostile factionalism in Harry's court, and how he balances and plays the factions to his benefits.

** Harry (eventually) attends boot camp - sort of - in my story "Divided and Entwined", but it's not the focus of most of the story (which will be completed next Saturday). But other characters attend the "Boot camp" earlier in the story, and their training plays a major role.

**** After Voldemort's return, Fudge, doesn't try to deny the Dark Lord's return - but, influenced by Malfoy, opts for an Appeasement policy to try and avoid a war (not entirely unjustified, seeing as Britain isn't exactly ready for a war). But while reducing the rights of the muggleborns (thanks to Dumbledore, Britain's much more egalitarian then most of the other countries in that area) does keep the Dark Lord from making an overt move (he's quietly subverting the Wizengamot instead), it also riles up the muggleborns, who can see the parallels to Germany in the 1930s. So Hermione starts a muggleborn resistance group and prepares for a guerilla war. Things don't go entirely according to plan, as usual in a war, and soon Britain is facing a civil war with several factions - Muggleborn Resistance, Death Eaters, Ministry, Order of the Phoenix. Various splinter groups mess things up further as things spiral out of control. The Muggleborn Resistance hire mercenaries to train them as soldiers, and use a mix of muggle weapons, bombs, and magic to fight their battles. Dumbledore does his best to get the Ministry pointed at the Death Eaters instead of the muggleborns and to counter Voldemort's political power. Harry and Ron are trained by Moody, and search for Horcruxes thanks to Harry's link to Voldemort. Later, Dumbledore takes over their training.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
