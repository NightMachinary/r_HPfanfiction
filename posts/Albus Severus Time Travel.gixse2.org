Upon stumbling across the Time Turner in CC, Albus does what he always should have done.

He takes his father back in time with him to meet all of the incredible male role models and other gents in his Hogwarts years with an eventual goal of meeting Harry Potter's past self: the one who had a wife and a son, with his second child on the way.

The goal: Remind Harry that he has plenty of people he should be honouring before he even considered naming his second son after the man who left him with the Dursley's and the actual bully/terrorist that wanted the nail his mum.

"Look dad, I can kinda see why you would name me after Headmaster Dumbledore, but why Snape?"

Harry sighed, his expression drawn for a moment and Albus could very clearly see guilt behind that veil of fatigue,

"Even for a master Occulmens, Snape standing against Voldemort for years. Hell, even defecting, took extraordinary-"

"You know what took real bravery? Rocking up to the ruins of a house with no wand and no plan, knowing the Dark Lord was just there. Then taking a baby that had been targeted personally by the Dark Lord and deciding to keep him safe." Harry blanched, Albus crossed his arms and snapped, "Albus Rubeus Potter, if you REALLY wanted to honour Professor Dumbledore..."


** Here we go again... People are really salty Harry named his kid after Snape. It's been 13 years people, just let it go
