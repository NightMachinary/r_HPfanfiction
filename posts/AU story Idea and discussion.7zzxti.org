What if Neville had been a squib? How much would the story change knowing what we know about canon Neville?


** Well if you want to get seriously crazy we can go down this road:

- Neville born a squib --> Voldemort can confirm that Harry is the baby of the "prophecy". Why on earth would his conqueror and killer be a squib?
- This means that he lets his followers know that Potter is the boy that he goes after. He never once has anything to do with the Longbottoms other than in encounters
- This give no reason for Bellatrix and the others to go searching for the Longbottoms after Voldemort's downfall.
- The Longbottoms will probably want to have more kids. Neville may or may not get shunted aside. Even families like the Weasleys hide their squibs ("Mum's got a second cousin who's a banker or something... but we don't talk about him" (Philosopher's Stone).
- The Lestranges + Junior never actually get captured? So where do we go from here?

They can't tell whether Neville is a squib or not. The whole point about Neville's character is that they weren't sure whether he's a squib or not for a long time.

*** But how would Voldemort even know Neville was a squib? Neville didn't use any serious magic until he was eight, long after Voldemort's first defeat.

**** Good point, I was just thinking about that myself. If you were a good author, you could probably hand wave that and throw it under suspension of disbelief. Of course you'd still have to write an unbelievable story.

*** I wasn't thinking all that I was thinking that maybe his parents still died on an Order mission or something. Neville is still sent to his gran's and she discovers he's a squib and sends him to an orphanage.

Or is that just as a tragic as his canon backstory or not make sense.

**** Well two things to think about:

1. While Neville's grandmother is harsh on paper, she does love Neville. No one's a perfect parent/grandparent, and she makes her share of mistakes. That's what makes her human. But, she passes the biggest requirement - she loves Neville, and he's all she has left. Squib or not, I doubt she'll abandon him if his parents die.

2. I'm going to preface this with I love Neville. He's the inner bullied kid in all of us. But, he doesn't play a role that's so unique that it can't exist without Neville. At first he's comic relief, the bullied kid, and eventually he's Harry-lite. His role could honestly be played by an entirely different face and character and it wouldn't make a difference. So, if Neville's a squib, and canon occurs, someone steps up to fill his role, and canon just happens.

***** I love Neville too. I wouldn't want him to go all through all that. She'd be disappointed that he's not magical but she wouldn't go that far. She will probably have a hard time understanding him but send him to a very good muggle school.

****** Yeah, what I meant by "put aside" generally means out of sight, out of mind. She's not going to kill him or force him to live on the streets, but he's not going to be attending dinners or dances.

The "really good muggle school" makes a lot of sense

** Neville would end up changing his name and join the Scottish rugby team.

The biggest change from canon would be Harry not joining the quidditch team for at least one year probably more. And him not suspecting that Snape is trying to kill him because the jinx on his broom. He would most likely still end up facing Quirrel but he wouldn't have suspected Snape.

** He would've been seriously injured when his family threw him out the window or something to force accidental magic. And then they mightve continued to abuse him in trying to force accidental magic out of him. With a strong headed pushy grandma, she mightve even pushed Neville into hogwarts, despite him never showing any significant signs of magic. The AU story could be of the disabled squib trying to be someone he's not and finding his own way to greatness. Filch mentor?
