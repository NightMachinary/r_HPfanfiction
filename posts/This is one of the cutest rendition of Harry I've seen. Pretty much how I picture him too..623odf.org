** That's actually closer to how I would picture a young Snape or Albus Potter. Idk, I picture Harry to be even scrawnier, and iirc his nose wasn't particularly long (it was shorter than James's, and we can assume James to have had a normal sized nose since JKR didn't say otherwise.) And his hair wouldn't be flowing; it'd be overgrown, sure, but messier. The books did describe his hairstyle as kind of stuck up at the back.

*** When I was reading the books the first time I always assumed Harry had an afro. I just figured that the artists didn't know how to draw one convincingly.

**** Its a word for androgynous, coming from bishounen meaning something along the line of "pretty boy". Meant are boys with a very feminine set of features.

Its mostly used in context with Anime, as there is also a set of typical character traits loosely connected with it.

If you only describe physical appearance and - you know - not anime, then i'd think "androgynous" would be a better word to use.

** Not too bad (actually: Very good - damned, I kind of taught myself to always say "not bad" instead of "quite good"...damned!)

Two small gripes: The head with the glasses looks kind of squished (could be longer, most people's faces are not round but oval shapped after all) and the guard of the sword is too long (yes, such swords did exist, but I think Godric himself would want a practical sword, not a wall-hanger!) in relation to the lenght of the blade and the size of the grip of the sword!
