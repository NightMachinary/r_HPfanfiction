It's told they are the darkest of the magic.

But are they really useful? When someone creates one and then dies, he or she loses the body and continues existing in ghost-like form. What is next?

Suppose Riddle didn't have Crouch and Wormtail. What would he had done without them?


** Well, primarily it's useful because he survived. All else can be dealt with in time only so long as he's still alive, which is what horcruxes are for.

In Voldemort's case, he did exactly what he should have done: possess animals until he can sway someone with promises of power, then possess them and use a ritual or magical artifact. Then it's basically just try, try again until he gets it right.

*** But this is it. The possession of Qurrell didn't work. The whole plot about him was getting the Philosopher's stone, that was a gamble. Riddle didn't have any other variants.

He couldn't use the same ritual as with Wormtail, because he didn't have any body. And for getting a body he needed a follower.

Therefore horcruxes work only if there're trusted followers who can perform required rituals, and even Riddle got two of them because of luck.

**** Voldemort didn't possess Quirrell until the school year started. Note for example, Harry shook Quirrell's hand in the Leaky Cauldron with no burning effect. Quirrell was a willing servant whom Voldemort just happened to possess later. He could have done the same thing as Pettigrew did later, it's just that Voldemort wanted the Philosopher's Stone.

***** That's exactly what I'm talking about.

Riddle's existence as an almost ghost was useless without willing followers. Remove them from the equation and he is a threat no more that Peeves.

As time goes it will be harder and harder to find new followers, because Voldemort's name will fade away.

Riddle managed to find just one in 10 years and no one after Quirrell's ultimate demise.

****** With sufficient cunning, a wizard that exists mostly as a disembodied spirit can still manage to get resurected, even without being well-known. Just finding someone young and power-hungry and not too bright to slowly entice with promises of power and along the way trick them into resurrecting the wizard wouldn't be the hardest thing. Voldemort probably just didn't want to go this path because it would take a while, as opposed to going for the Stone or using the ritual.

**** Quirrell wasn't a follower. Voldemort swayed him to his side when he found him in Albania. We really don't know the extent of his powers in that ghostly form, so we don't know what he could have done to Quirrell to bring him to his side.

Horcruxes are pretty much a last resort. Voldemort was only in his ghostly form for 13 years. That's a drop in the bucket if he's immortal.

The Diary is an interesting one. As I've already mentioned in another thread it's an only active horcrux that at least tried to resurrect its creator.

None of the others did it. Even the Locket did nothing to the Trio except increasing negative emotions. Unlike the Diary it didn't even try to seduce them with power and/or knowledge.

**** The Philosopher's Stone was the most optimal choice for a full resurrection. It was likely the easiest and quickest to use. He could easily have directed Quirrel to make a homunculus for him and used the Blood of my Foe ritual, but that would have taken longer and probably be sub-standard to a Philosopher's Stone resurrection.

***** I can be wrong, but as I remember Quirrell started dying as soon as Riddle had possessed him and the possession was consensual.

But I see some logic in it: find a host, create a cult about himself, make other members of the cult to create a homunculus and then perform the ritual.

Still for 10 years Riddle failed doing it.

He had to survive on animal life before he met Quirrel. And again, Horcruxes make him immortal. He could wait as long as it takes. /Eventually/ he would get his body back.

How? It's the question I'm trying to find an answer on. After a hundred of years no one will remember about Voldemort. He won't be able to use his name to seduce people.

I thought about the cult, because he needed people who he can trust. Why else will they agree to perform the Ritual for him?

There could be plenty rituals that don't require Wizards. He just chose the best one (the one requiring a wizard). Maybe others are of worse quality.

******** Magicals live for a very long time, so even a hundred years would not be sufficient for people to forget. In addition, Voldemort was an extremely powerful and brutal dark lord, and his particular cause of pureblood supremacy would resonate for many generations. It would not be difficult to rally more to his cause. It's like Hitler. No doubt, his name will be remembered for more than the next hundred years. His cause of Aryan supremacy is still popular with some people today. If he were to come back, people would still rally to him.

It's a very debatable statement. In the books we see just one (or two?) truly old people -- Dumbledore (and some witch from the Ministry during OWLs?).

If it was true there would be a lot of grand- and grand-grand-parents. We see none. Even among the Dark families, which suffered less in the War), there aren't any.

Why is Voldemort often compared to Hitler? Hitler started the war where millions died. Compared to him Riddle led just a band of Ku Klux Klan cell. Yes, he is cruel and racist, but on the scale he isn't even near Hitler.

As I remember (I may be wrong) in the books it's stated that true analogue of Hitler is Grindelwald.

I agree that ghost like Riddle can try to seduce a weak minded person.

But last time it took it 10 years to do it, and at that time Quirrell was looking for him.

** There are most likely lesser forms of recreation of a body than those we have seen in the books.

Its just that Voldemort was extremely arrogant and and didn't want to be the one to seek out his followers and waited for them to find him. When Quirrel showed up looking for Voldemort' secrets , Voldemort easily corrupted him.

Now was the problem that Voldemort didnt just want his original body back, he wanted the best possible body, so he tried to steal for the Philosophers Stone so he can create it.

#+begin_quote
  “There was no hope of stealing the Philosopher's stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower . . . I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength
#+end_quote

When that failed he grudgingly accepted to recreate his old body but even then he wanted to make it better by infusing the protective magic of Harry's blood.

A normal dark wizard using a horcrux most likely would just appear in front of someone loyal to them and get them to recreate their old body without anything fancy to make themselves more powerful.

Voldemort mentions that he was able to posses animals and people, and that he was able to break the memory charms on Bertha Jorkins take her memories.

Voldemort also didn't try to find Quirrel, he is to proud for that. Quirrel was looking for Voldemort.

If you are a non arrogant dark wizards in wraith form you could easily spend your time possessing animal and look for suitable wizards who would help you in exchange for knowledge. with Legilimency its even easier to find out what they want. Just seeing someone clearly able to avoid death would convince a lot of people to help in exchange for knowledge, reputation isn't necessary.

** The diary was pretty successful.

I wonder if there were diminishing returns with each successive horcrux. The locket was also able to easily affect those with exposure.

I'm guessing he screwed himself by creating so many. It kept him more tied to Earth, but with other problems. I believe a properly used horcrux would be able to 1. take over someone exposed and 2. once the horcrux has fully posessed an individual the main spirit should re-fuse with the soul that was once inside of the horcrux. 3. The newly formed dark wizard should then create another horcrux in order to keep immortality rolling along. 4. Rinse and Repeat.

I truly think splitting himself up meant he had a lot of problems with rebirth. No followers needed. Although you should practice possession before embarking.

The diary does that by getting the writer to engage, the locket through wearing, etc.. I think some of the objects he chose were poor because they provided little interaction with possible posessees and they were all weakened because he had split himself up so much. The diary had the largest chunk of himself, including whatever he was walking around with in his own actual pre-disembodied self.
