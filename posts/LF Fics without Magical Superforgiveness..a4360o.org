If someone does something Minor (Like Ron in GoF, Hermione... for like the entirety of Book 6) then sure, forgive them, but I want to see fics where the usually forgiven characters actually have consequences/are killed/whatever consequences when they do something that doesn't deserve forgiveness. People write Harry with Naruto level of forgiveness, and it can get irritating. (Blood Prison movie. I know the movies don't fit the canon timeline but damn, if they'd done that to anyone else, they'd have gone Nukenin, Naruto forgave them after Ramen)

I mean there's a fic where Hermione, in Harry's eyes, should be as bad as Voldemort. She kills Ginny and his Daughter, and should have actively been given the Dementors Kiss/Worst punishment possible/was a character that actively deserved a Crucio or 100, but BAM Harry plays the wizarding jesus card and forgives her, actively sacrificing his own life to revive her. Why do authors throw shit like that into what was getting to be a good fic...

I want fics where if someone does something genuinely evil, they end up in Azkaban or get killed. Draco Malfoy in canon should have got heavily fined, and house arrest for years, a reduced punishment due to Narcissa being useful. Lucius Malfoy should have been locked in Azkaban for life. Actual punishments for people that deserve them.


** You will find plenty of those types about the Malfoys. Good luck with Hermione though.

Actually, he should have been sentenced to multiple lifetimes in prison if you are feeling merciful. Based on Article 23 of the Hague convention on land warfare, you can make a strong case for summary execution /(“It's especially forbidden, (a) To employ poison or poisoned weapons; (b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army; [...] (f) To make improper use of a flag of truce, of the national flag or of the military insignia and uniform of the enemy, as well as the distinctive badges of the Geneva Convention;”/).

[[https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/german-commandos-captured-american-uniform-1944/][And before anyone objects, violations of aritcle 23, especially subsection f were usually resolved just one way]]. And no, that is not outdated. You get a Nobel prize for peace and still can summarily execute thousands on a mere suspicion (guess what Drone strikes are).

.

Now, to actually answer the request, here's linkffn(11782884). Harry gets a second chance and goes after the Death Eaters with no remorse, not forgiving anything.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

*** Okay it's mentioned that it's an Harmony but in the beginning of the story it's said comes back a House Elf. How does this go? Is he an elf all the way? (don't fear to spoil)

I'm not really interested in an House Elf Harry that doesn't go to school or a human/house elf relationship

**** At some point, there is a switch. I don't remember the details, but it does take some time to get there. That being said, Harry being a house elf does not have much impact on the story.

Later on, there is a scene where Harry admits what he had done and Hermione runs because she is terrified. They make up a few years later.
