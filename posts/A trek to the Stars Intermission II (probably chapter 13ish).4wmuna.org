  STHP:Intermission II

  A/N: ...

  “Communications link established. Unimatrix 666 has established contact,” spoke a million voices at once.

  “Communications link established. Unimatrix 359 has established contact.”

  "Communications link established. Unimatrix 01 is destroyed.”

  One more Unimatrix made contact. And even more failed or were sending failsafe signals that all Borg were gone. A Collective of over one point three quadrillion Borg had been eliminated by the topological anomaly and the defects it introduced to the Collective, reducing the Collective to 1,211,344 drones without a voice. A Borg Queen did not exist. There was no one to bring order to chaos.

  No Borg Queen candidates existed save one.

  “Borg Queen Candidate designate Seven of Nine, Teriary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01 in working order. Priority: re-assimilate,” spoke the drone designated Secondary Adjunct of Unimatrix 666.

  A second voice led the reply, “Negative. Seven of Nine, Teriary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01 unavailable. Promotion of Drone to Queen necessary.” Still it spoke in all voices of the Collective, including the first speaker.

  Dissension in the Collective. Standing orders settled the issue. “Assimilation of new Borg Queen primary goal. All Unimatrixes, begin scanning for suitable Species.”

  ~•~

  The remnants of Unimatrix 666 and Unimatrix 359, both deep in the Gamma Quadrant found viable Species.

  Borg Tactical Cube 102 of Unimatrix 666 reported the scans of world filled with technological specimens of various species. Underneath the surface of the ship was a planet sized entity, Species 6100, an insectoid species capable of using its young to control unassimilated species while their daughter-queens could control those implanted and obey the orders of the mother-queen entity on the planet. “Their biological distinctiveness will be added to our own.”

  ~•~

  Borg Sphere 360 of Unimatrix 359 reported in. “New Species, gelatinous biomimetic lifeform, designation of Species 110013. Their biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own.

  ~•~

  The Founders did not detect the Borg Sphere scanning their planet. Nor did they detect the 3600 nanoprobe missiles launched at them.

  Their first sign of something wrong was when the nanoprobe missiles detonated in the air, each seeding a thousand miles square of sky with nanoprobes.

  The nanoprobes, on hitting the Great Link went straight to work. Within hours, their biological distinctiveness was added to Borg's own.

  ~•~

  Borg Tactical Cube 102 began transporting down 2000 Borg drones, all optimized for assimilation.

  The insect larvae and queens infecting the humanoids were unable to direct competent resistance. Eighty percent of Species infected were Assimilated and all larval insectoids were Assimilated by nanoprobe missile seeding.

  The Mother-Queen was assimilated quickly, unable to fight back due to her children being Assimilated. At the newly assimilated Queen's orders, the insectoids in the universe began a return to the homeworld with whatever technology they had. Assimilation of their technology would begin upon arriving.

  Borg Tactical Cube 102 went to warp. The new biological distinctiveness of species 84498 had been integrated at the nanite level.

  ~•~

  Borg Sphere 360 and Borg Sphere 361 orbited the Founder's homeworld, tethered together, the gold-green tone of Borg Sphere 361 eating away at Borg Sphere 360. What had once housed the Great Link, hidden by a nebula, was now a dead world, the mimetic lifeforms known as the Founders were now Borg and a million entities, formed into one structure, Borg Sphere 361, capable of taking any form be it biological or technical.

  Individual Borg's flesh and implants were consumed, turned to the new nanomimetic material the Borg had evolved into in their eternal quest for perfection.

  ~•~

  Borg Tactical Cube 102 was tethered between the two Borg Spheres, being reassimilated as every other Borg ship in the Alpha and Gamma Quadrant began to make their way to the new Borg ships.

  ~•~

  “Perfection in form,” spoke a million voices, now led by the new Borg Queen, her body a planet being assimilated, her avatar a perfect facsimile of Borg Queen Species 125, her skin and chassis now golden hued with green filled tubules erupting out of the skull to look like coiled hair.

Okay, this is the intermission between the world building and the war. Any thoughts on this first draft as it's written?


** Erm, no offense, but what does this have to do with Harry Potter?

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.
