This is a pretty elaborate, engaging fanfiction. It's one of those fanfiction that are of longer length, but definitely don't drag out or tread over familiar ground, or at least overly familiar ground. It does a very good job of making you ask what the hell can go wrong next. And I think the latest chapter does an especially good job at this, if in a tragic way.

To be clear, it's a story about Harry Potter where he possesses a large amount of magical power, but very little control over it. This is explored by the author, especially in commenting on how a boy with a troubled past can struggle to use this kind of power thoughtfully, and how it can get him into truly terrible situations. The story isn't over, but I truly do not think that Harry Potter will have a happy ending in this one. I can't wait to see what comes next.


** Very cool to see this promoted here. Glad you are enjoying it!

*** As very well it should be, it's a very good fanfiction. Each chapter it feels like something is happening, and you're always in for a downward spiral just slow enough it isn't a turn off.
