I even took of my bra. Then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time.

“Oh! Oh! Oh! ” I screamed. I was beginning to get an orgasm. We started to kiss everywhere and my pale body became all warm. And then....

** A Harry/Snape where a house elf helps Snape dress all 'sexy' for Harry. I don't remember where I read it or what it was called, but there was loving description of Snape's dress (yes), his jewelry, his 'long, thick fall of inky black hair', and a particularly long description of the colored ribbons braided and fitted around Snape's penis. There were bells and rings involved. I went 'nope' and have steered pretty well clear of Harry/Snape since.

** I can't decide between two really good ones. Both are less "scenes" and more "the entire premise of extremely weird one-shots" but my pics are either the fic where the giant squid has sex with Hogwarts, or where Dobby rapes the sock that Harry used to set him free.

There's also one where Harry empregnates Fred (or George, can't remember which) with a puppy, that he then gives birth to and Fred and George raise it together. (this one is from the Where in the World is Harry Potter series, but I can't remember which of the trilogy it's in)

** yeah .. the kids were 11, on the Express, just met one another. There were kisses and something about 'special places'. I noped out.

The fandom is rife with underage sexuality. It's one thing to write about 15/16 year olds and the rocky road of dating/romance/love/sexuality. 11 year old childen are TINY.

Another 'nope' is either Harry or Hermione paired with Death Eaters/Riddle. Ron doesn't get into those sticky situations nearly as much just judging by summaries.

Is it just this fandom? Is there a ton of Luke/Palpataine mpreg out there? 'good.. good! feel the power of the dark side Luke!'
