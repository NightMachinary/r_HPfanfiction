I have read a lot of Sirius daughter fanfiction but I would like to read a fic about Remus daughter/son. I would like to read something where Remus is alive and the child is around Harry's age.

This was quite literally the only one I could think of that comes anywhere close to your request.

It mismanages canon terribly, but at the same time, it's very touching.

  Remus Lupin has a ... particular interest in Luna Lovegood. But purely paternal, of course! Naturally.

** This is post-canon (so not 100% ur request)

I forget the name (hopefully this jogs someone's memory) but there's a Remus/Lavendar one where he and Tonks break up (but still are on good terms) and he helps Lavendar fight for werewolf rights.

They go on to adopt a daughter later on.
