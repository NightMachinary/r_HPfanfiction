Looking for stories about the inner workings of the Black family. The pureblood politics of it. Doesn't matter what era, as long as it's characters that we all know and love. Already read the obvious ones like ‘time to put galleons where your mouth it' and ‘one step forward, two decades'. Fics where the Lord/heir things have meaning, but the aren't lording it over each other. Preferably stories with Hermione (either time travel or other, as a child of the family), but anything goes. Stories about the pureblood Black family, while still dealing with Voldemort (or another threat)

Over 100k wording and preferably complete


** Not a /story/, but you ought to like [[https://drive.google.com/file/u/0/d/0Bw8o0RludA_KbzhrV2k2UG5idmc/view?usp=drive_web][this]] beautifully-drawn comic. Warning, it's NSFW at times (not smut, just adult content) and really heartbreaking.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

** A Marauder's Plan linkffn(8045114) is pretty long, but it has Sirius taking up his role of head of the Black family and upsetting the status quo.

Delinda Est might qualify as one of your obvious ones.

** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11664138/1/Renewal][Renewal]] by Azenor Sage would be something you're looking for. The only thing that doesn't meet your criteria is the fact it's incomplete. However, so far it's 261,003 words so it would take awhile to read anyways and updates are fairly consistent. linkffn(11664138)

  At the point of death, Regulus Black is de-aged. Given a second chance at life, he becomes a new beacon of hope for the nearly defunct Black Family. He is haunted by strange dreams of his past and the feeling that he has an important mission that he must complete, no matter the cost to himself.

** linkffn(As Black as Night by Roses and Lavender) is a great deep dive into the Blacks from the perspective of Sirius' daughter. She's a decent character but the non-OC family members are excellent.

#+end_quote

She's a picture perfect author avatar. Everyone else is stupid and horrible and she's intelligent and smart and always right.

This story is /just/ good enough to keep my curiosity, but the OC is one of the worst offenders I've ever seen. At least as far as chapter 29, which is where I've gotten so far.

**** I think it becomes obvious as the story progresses that she's somewhat ignorant and has a narrow world view due to her upbringing. She's flawed in a way we're not used to, which is being prejudiced, and that makes her tough to identify with imo. I wouldn't characterize her as perfect though.

The development annoys me a bit but it was worth the read just because it's not a common perspective in fanfiction. Usually even when an author makes Harry a blood purist, it's taken to a cartoonish extreme. I also enjoyed the interfamily dynamics more than the purity debate, although they are often intertwined.

Everyone else is definitely not stupid/horrible though. They just appear that way from a certain POV. Eventually the POV shifts a bit and the story becomes a lot more nuanced because no one seems to be 100% right.

***** I started skimming the story and got to the part where Marius died and it wasn't any better. Chapter 40-something of 98. I gave it a whirl but it didn't get better for me.

***** So I tried skipping to the sequel. Harry and the Author Avatar become amicable in chapter 10. Of the sequel. After a 98 chapter fic.

108 chapters until the Mary Sue OC and Harry are even on decent terms. You might like that slow of a burn, but it seems to be a giant waste of time to me. And the story didn't even end, it hasn't updated since Jan 22, *2015!* It's abandoned.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

** I'm not sure the policy on reccing your own things, but this is definitely something we've explored in [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/809115][renascentia]], more specifically in /the holiday holly bears a berry (as red as any blood) * and *no answers for no questions asked/ (which i will rec, as i didn't write any of it) and will definitely come up again. The former focuses on different members of the tree's perspective, from arcturus and pollux down to sirius and regulus, while the main story is a regulus lives with a decent bit of hermione in it and the patriarch and heir aspects are explored. It's not finished, but the whole series together is pretty long. May not be your cup of tea, but it might be.
