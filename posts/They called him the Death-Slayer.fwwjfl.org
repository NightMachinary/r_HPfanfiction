Kick me outta ogwarts', put meh in a cell, yeh' can take ove'r Britain for all I care. Ardly' affects me, give me a dragon I'll be yer friend for life. But no, yeh just couldn't leave meh alone, made meh watch as arry' fought and urt' meh baby. I could live with at', but no... yeh went and killed me bloody hippogriph. You may break me home, you may take my baby, you make kill my freinds. But fer' Buckbeaks sake, I, Ruperus Hagrid, as the last rightful Heir of Hufflepuff, and the Keeper of the Keys for the finest School in all of Euraisa, promise you this. Rip and Tear, until it is done.

As a response to Buckbeak being "Killed" Hagrid has an entirely appropriate reation.


** Is the Ruperus a Hadrian joke? I never thought about it, but Hagrid really should have been a Hufflepuff. It would have evened out the Hogwarts houses a little. He already had all the defining characteristics.

** How the hell would this work?

After all, Hagrid was never sealed inside a demonic tomb.

*** Think "Man too angry to give up."

Edit: He was trapped in Azkaban for a non-insignificant amount of time. Trapped in a place that basicly kills you once your trapped there. Are there Demons? Yes. I would say this counts.

** To be honest the thing that struck me most is “keeper of keys” never thought about that title much before but used in this context it makes me thinks it's so much more then just the guy who opens the gates.
