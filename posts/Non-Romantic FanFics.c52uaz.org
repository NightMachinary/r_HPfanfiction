Okay, I know these exist, I'm pretty sure I've read one before. Please send in fics that are low on the smut and high on the "taking beloved characters and propelling their stories forward in some profound way" stuff. Like, where Hermoine is Minister and has to deal with some politics. Hell are there any good fanfics about magic in the US? Or anywhere else in the world? Please, I'm starving for good harry potter stories.


** My favorite fic where Hermione 'deals' with politics and becomes minister (with a little romance but it's mostly in the background) is linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution)

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** If by profound, you mean 'different,' there's Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality: A HP-Matrix Crossover. It's an awesome read.

****** To my memory, none of these fics have any romance, though some might mention established or past ships.

World in Pieces is a Harry-centric fic where right after the Battle of Hogwarts he gets summoned into an AU where the Order is on their 4th Harry Potter and is fighting a sane Voldemort.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488/chapters/1493333]]

Greater Than, Lesser Be has Harry traveling back in time trying to stop the rise of Voldemort. He is married to Ginny, but no romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6389009/1/Greater-Than-Lesser-Be]]

Harry Potter and the Mysterious Case of The Girl Who Lived is a fic where the magical world perceives him as a girl, but Harry and all the muggles believe himself to be a boy. Has the funniest Padma in all of fanfiction. Still a WIP.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived]]

Bad Oracle is what Cursed Child should have been. Voldemort's daughter travels to the summer before Harry's 5th year and causes chaos.
