So, I'm looking for fics where a character goes V-style (elaborate and theatrical) one-man vengeance on a Nation, with some idealistic 'political change' stuff involved. Something with some V-level showmanship to it. Can be angry Indy!Harry who shouts at things or not, I don't mind. I'm just looking to read a rebel with some pizzazz, y'know? :)

For those who don't know, V for Vendetta is a short comic book series (and a movie with Hugo Weaving) where an anarchist revolutionary tries to bring down a totalitarian government in various dramatic and theatrical ways. He's putting on a show and grabbing people's attention as much as he's making a political point.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): After events of DH, Harry and his friends finally had it enough and declare war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They begin with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who got off once again. Trio characterization and interaction are extremely compelling in this fic.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** It's been a long while since I've read this fic - in the area of a couple years or so - but I don't remember their rebellion being all that... 'flairy'. It was less blowing up a building with fireworks and more standard freedom fighters, wasn't it? I could also be getting it confused with others, I guess. :D

**** This fic is very much about revenge:

- George against Lucius Malfoy
- Harry against Death Eaters, snatchers, and Umbridge
- They against the entire establishment

As for blowing up buildings, Harry's reputation as the "Fiendfyre Lord" is very well earned.

***** Huh. I guess I am getting it confused, then. Might be time for a reread. Thanks for the rec! :)

** The last chapter of Elizium for the Sleepless Souls reminds me a bit of this. linkffn(7713063)

I really do wish there was a sequel because I think it would be more along the lines of what you're looking for.

*** Ah, Elizium. A classic. I agree on the sequel want, but that's mostly because then we'd get more VotN storytelling. They're one of my favourite authors in all of Fanfiction.

**** It's definitely a classic. Most of it is a bit dark and abstract for my liking though. I'll occasionally reread the first chapter, but I find myself returning to the last chapter a few times a year.

***** Fair. Dark and abstract definitely isn't to everyone's taste. Personally, I prefer it. I find the unknown and incomprehensible far scarier than just a dude with a knife screaming at me. Lovecraft over Carpenter, and all that. :)
