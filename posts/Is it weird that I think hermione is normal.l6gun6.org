When I say normal I mean her study habits and her academic drive. I mean most people I went to school with studied the same she is described as doing as well doing extracurriculars like sports or clubs. It's just whenever I see someone making it seem like she weird or unique for acting the way she does makes me think that either they were extremely lax during their school years or hogwart's stardards are low


** I wasn't lacking in honors/AP classes and spent a good few lunches periods in the library. I found her to be over the top and a little obnoxious.

No offense to anyone who relates to the post, but it's that she didn't have much of a life outside her books. Most of my classmates were in 2+ clubs and/or played a sport. No one was about to sit around attempting to memorize the words on the page or add additional pages to an an essay, certainly not one with a max number and especially not one with a minimum.

**** I would argue that towards the end, she clung to the idea of school because she did not want to confront the constant failures of her role models. She deluded herself that it's just another school year, and since they are at school, Malfoy clearly can't be a Death Eater. Because otherwise, those whom she looked up to would have failed miserably (spoiler, they did).

People like her usually don't socialise because they don't really know how to. They've never done it before, they never "learned" how to be social. As such, by the time they grow a bit reading and studying is all they've ever known. And they cling to it because it's their comfort zone.

**** Exactly that. It's pretty common for kids who were praised as a "genius" or "gifted" kid while growing up to be lacking in social skills, because parents and teachers and other adults all push them to develop that more. Where regular kids mostly first learn social skills and then intellectual ones, "gifted" kids, who were just slightly ahead intellectually at a young age, are pushed into neglecting those social skills and focusing only on intellectual development. Until at the end of high school or the start of college they grow up and realize that their peers mostly caught up in academics and have a healthy social life on top of that, and since they don't they don't know how to even begin to try catching up on those skills, because that's what school is for and everyone assumes that by the time they're adults they're supposed to be able to understand all those social cues.

(Nevermind the fact that if kids are seen as smart, mental health issues or learning disabilities are often overlooked or ignored until later in life when everything seems to fall apart and nothing seems to work anymore.)

Sorry for that slight rant, but yeah I can totally see this being Hermione, honestly wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in her early to mid twenties she kinda breaks down and starts trying to figure out what she wants in life beyond academics

***** I agree, but I would like to add that it's not necessarily the parents that are doing the pushing.

Kids that are more reclusive may end up getting easily bullied. Which leads to them avoiding social interactions more. They seek social validation and since they can't find it in their peers they look towards the adults. Their parents and their teachers. They want to make them proud, so they push themselves to study hard. Something that often can lead to even more bullying (for being nerdy/teacher's pet etc). It can lead to an endless spiral where people end up like that without the parents doing anything "wrong".

****** Pretty much.

Hermione is smart, no question. But she -studies all the time-, and while she knows the occasional upper year spell, she doesn't seem to be years and years ahead of everyone. Honestly, in spite of people liking to say she's Ravenclaw, I think she's more Hufflepuff. Her grades are the result of damn hard work.

Then you get people making her the magical Reed Richards/Tony Stark, inventing everything under the sun. Honestly, in canon, she may have invented one thing, the Four Points spell, and even that's unclear as she says she found it.

Note: It's fine for characters to be really smart and invent stuff. But if you're going to go into that sort of level, it'd better be part of the plot of the story and not just 'Yeah, they're just so wonderful and smart'. ;) Like in the Arithmancer for Hermione. Or in one or two stories about Runes for Harry.

***** It depends on how we look at things, tbh. In the wizarding world of Harry Potter, she basically is a genius by what we can see - at least, if we take things at face value. The adults have to be incompetent for the story to work, by and large, and that makes things like Hermione's role as the one to figure stuff out, do research, etc stand out more.

The way I see it, she's the smartest character that we see in the story firsthand - where most other smart ones tend to be more backstory. (Eg: Percy/Bill getting 12 OWLs is easy as a throwaway statement, or the Marauders getting just a few flashback scenes and reminiscing moments make it easy to handwave /how/ they learned to do the Map, whereas those we see don't appear particularly impressive years later).

Anyways, if one wants to have a genius character in a fanfic, Hermione is pretty clearly the obvious choice to do so. And it can be fun to have smart(er) characters in fics :)

****** The fun part about Hermione and her intelligence is that, as hard as she works, she isn't actually very interested in her own magical development.

She was always more focused in the advocacy, politics, and completing the Harry-missions. While she /can/ be a scientist like Dumbledore and Voldemort, studying magic for magic's sake just isn't something she's interested in. Her knowledge acquisition had always been more goal-oriented, and this constrains her growth by */a lot/*/./ She did what she could to be the best, but after that, she spent all of her time on strictly non-magical things like mastering foreign legal systems (for Buckbeak), knitting elf hats, or running underground militia.

This gives us quite a lot of leeway in exactly how smart she is. The most concrete thing we have is that she's perfectly capable of making NEWT-level potions as a second year, and she made it look easy. This means that the polyjuice potion is probably not her upper limit. Since we don't actually have a proper sense of what her upper limit is, we can therefore set it to whatever suits us.

Sometimes, I like thinking of her as Dumbledore-level genius (which is a stretch but there is nothing in canon that contradicts it) and other times, she is above average but still on this side of normal. Nothing contradicts that reading too.

****** I'd argue that.

The smartest characters we see with an actual impact are the Marauders and Snape.

Hermione actually doesn't invent or create much in the series, the only major thing she does that's uber-advanced for her age (she does a lot more in plot :) is brew polyjuice, and from what we are shown potions is following a recipe. You need to be anal, not smart.

The Marauders created the map, created communication mirrors, and became Animagi. Snape created a fair number of custom spells and is a potions genius.

Really, it makes the new generation look positively sucky compared to them. :)

As for smart, being smart is one thing. Being an overly-worshipped faux genius like many in the fandom do is another. :)

And note, I like book Hermione. Just not Movie or Fanon Hermione, most of the time.

******* My thing with the Marauders and Snape is that it feels 'fake' - like JKR not having a great understanding of scale/consistency in worldbuilding, so it's easy to just put in exposition that makes them way too smart without meaning to or thinking through (like Percy/Bill taking too many OWLs) - vs Hermione, who we obviously see throughout the entirety of her 7 years.

Personally, with how far ahead magically and application wise of spells than everyone else in Hogwarts during the main series (minus perhaps Fred/George), I tend to view that as more impressive than the Marauders. I can see why people might disagree, like you do - it's just not convincing to me as more than JKR having low consistency in worldbuilding ;)

Being a perfect character is obviously pretty boring in fanfiction, though tbh I do see a lot more Harry power fantasies than Hermione. Might just be the ones I stumble across, though.

** She's not particularly weird - like you and her, I consistently did well in my classes, spent quite a bit of time studying, and read a lot of stuff that crossed over with class material in my spare time due to interest. I'd like to think I wasn't as high strung about my grades, but I was probably was.

I think one thing that throws this off is that there's not a lot to do outside of Quidditch and hanging out with friends. I know they mention the choir, and maybe the gobstones club in the books, but that's still a total of 3 things. Like, is that it? I'd expect a boarding school to have more than that.

I also wonder how much I get thrown off by the grading scheme. In the US, it's common for the school year to be divided into multiple grading periods (ours were 6 weeks) and to have your homework and tests count for those. Then there may be year end tests that counted separately. Some tests counted for a particular concept, or grading period(s); some determined if you passed the class and/or moved into the next grade. But it seems like Hogwarts was much simpler, with a single year end exam and homework building up to that? I think I would have felt a lot more pressure to study if that was the case.

You can assume there are, but others in this thread stated that at their schools, it wasn't common to have clubs.

** From my experience, it's hard to say whether it was normal, as I both went to private school and coasted by on my intelligence the entire time. At my school there was a sort of culture that people didn't explicitly see how much extra work you were doing. My school had a guideline that 2 hours of Homework per night plus an hour of ‘scheduled' revision was deemed sufficient.

Of course there were a few people who would go to the library over lunch to do their homework so they wouldn't have to do it at home. The thing is because my school was small, private and encouraged a community spirit, everyone was relatively secure in the knowledge that they belonged there. We had all paid the fee, passed the entrance and progression exams, were held to the same standards, wore the same uniform with the associated rules (Everyone is an ambassador for the school whilst in uniform, and no one was to be in uniform after 5:30pm without good reason. That way behaviour standards were theoretically maintained.)

So for my microcosm of experience she isn't ‘normal' but as I interpret it for someone who may be insecure about their place in the world, it seems perfectly natural. Based on absolutely no evidence for this assumption, but I always imagined Hermione's study habits to be the result of a multitude of factors:

1) Natural Intelligence/ talent. (She likely would have down just as well, 112% excluded, had she relaxed a bit 2) Natural Curiosity 3) Insecurity and need to prove that she is just as capable as everyone else, but not because she is muggleborn or anything just mundane normal insecurity. 4) A little bit of Aspergers/Savant Syndrome.

The answer to your question is entirely contextual when it comes to defining what normality actually is.

** I don't necessarily think her study habits are that weird, honor students probably study that much. I got straight A's and researched my own interests outside of class (electricity stuff). Also it's magic so I can believe wanting to know everything about it, even to the point of looking up spells and things in my free time. Hermione is entirely new to the wizarding world so I can imagine she'd feel a bit inferior initially. And then there's the pressure to "keep it up" in later years, her identity is sort of tied to how smart she is so she can't not know anything. She's literally arming herself with knowledge.

That said, I think what always struck me as unrealistic was how invested she was in everyone else's study habits. Like she bought Harry and Ron magical homework planners, that's a bit odd to me. I'm not saying no one would ever do that, but it qualifies as out of the ordinary to me.

** I think Hermione suffers from being a big fish in a small pond. It's fairly common to separate students roughly by academic performance but Hogwarts is a small enough school there's only two classes running per subject if all are conducted on a 2 houses per class basis. If she's in the top 5% academically there's only one student there with her in a class of 40 kids. Her academic performance blows pretty much everyone else out of the water because there just isn't a big enough student population to offer up reasonable competition.

For the people talking about how it's unrealistic/obnoxious(?) she doesn't do extracurriculars: we don't really get much of any insight into hogwarts extracurriculars apart from the 5th year ban. Off the top of my head there's an exploding snap team, quidditch, and a dueling club for a single year, so I'd say this is more Rowling not caring/remembering much about extra-curriculars than an intentional aspect of the character.

Tl;dr Hermione reads ro me like an above average, high drive kid who is very academically understimulated and making up for it by going to extremes--which is often comes off as being a know-it-all.

** Since Harry is our view into that world and he spends most of his time with Ron and Hermione, I think it's just the matter of the boys not being as studious and finding her to be a bit extreme in comparison. Plus Hogwarts may have relatively lower academic standards depending on your experience.

But yes she's completely normal in my eyes and therefore I do not think it wierd that you find her to be the same.

** What I hate is her being labelled the brightest witch of her age. No. She is not. If she is, then witches must be dumb in that generation. She's not a genius, she's just a bookworm with a good memory.

** Hermione is a workaholic. She is the kind of person that feels guilty any time she isn't studying or doing something else that feels productive. Conversely, when she is studying, she feels like she is doing something useful, even if she is far past the point of diminishing returns.

Like many gifted (avoiding the more contentious "genius" here) children, she has an easier time relating to adults than to her age-peers, and so she seeks validation from them the only way she knows how. And, it lets her stay firmly in her comfort zone even as she finds himself in the bizarre world of wizards with pointy hats, funny names, and Lovecraftian powers.

Is that normal? The great thing about this thread is that we hear of a variety of experiences across cultures, types of schools, etc.. It's certainly not normal at Hogwarts, but in a Magnet or Selective school, or in a culture where academic achievement is valued above all else---who knows?

** I think the same thing. Maybe it's just because of the contrast to Harry and Ron? They're more 'jocks' while Hermione is the 'nerd'.

Honestly, Hermione reminds me a bit of myself younger. She just read a lot. Seriously, that's all you really need to do nowadays to be considered 'smart'. Just read and comprehend and memorise and you've gotten a rep as some resident school genius.

** I didn't give a crap about school and I was always studying the night before a test or doing my homework last minute. I wasn't the best student but I managed... even if with average grades at times. So, yeah, I think she more like what we would call 'nerds' back in my days. Back then it also had a negative connotation.

** She's what I would be if I could go back to that time and do it over again. First time around I didn't care at all, just wanted to do what I wanted to do and didn't give a fig for studying. An undisclosed number of decades later, it would be bloody wonderful to study and learn all day, then exhaust myself with exercise and then have the recovery and energy to do it all again tomorrow. These days it takes a week just to stop being sore.
