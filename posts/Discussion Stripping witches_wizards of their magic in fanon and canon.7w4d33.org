In canon, it is stated by Ron that it is not possible, otherwise there wouldn't be any squibs left.

However, I think that there is at least one way to strip magic in the Potterverse, it's just so abhorrent to a witch/wizard, that even Voldemort would question your sanity. It is definitely a concept that is explored in fanon. Rowling has stated that there are physiological differences between magical and non-magical humans, either from one particular gene or set of genes. I think that through magic and/or technology, it could /theoretically/ be possible to suppress/remove or grant magic from and to and individual respectively. If so, what do you think is the process, and what effects do you think magic removal and magic bestowal would have on individuals?

Personally, I think that if you were to take magic away from a witch/wizard, it would be similar to damaging major components of their DNA. Depending on the individual's health, age, gender etc., they would eventually experience the consequences of no longer having magic - from headaches, haemorrhaging, cellular degeneration, and eventually death - until they reclaim their magic. Very few would survive - even then it would be like living without any of your limbs.

On the other hand, magic bestowal would more likely have positive effects on the previously non-magical individual, though there is still risk of rejection and thus the above ailments. Greater vitality - due to improved physiology - stronger immune system, ability to cast magic (of course) and so on. Removal of magic from such an individual could have varying effects, dependent on how much time the individual has had their magic. If they have had it for a few hours to days, then it isn't a problem. Years? See above to what happens when magic is removed from a witch/wizard. Again, the individual themselves can determine the effects.

So, what do you think? Do you think it is possible in canon?


** It was said you cant steal magic not you cant loose it.

Merope Gaunt lost her ability to use magic after Tom Riddle Sr broke her heart by escaping.

And Tonks powers as metamorphmagus became very bad when she was very depressed because of Lupin.

meaning to make someone loose their magic you would probably have to traumatize them quite a bit.

Source? I always took it (and am quite sure for the Tonk example) that this is just a case of losing the will to use magic, or, rather, the collectedness of mind. Using magic takes concentration and level-headedness that the broken Merope just couldn't muster. That doesn't mean she wasn't still technically a "witch" in the same way a pre-Hogwarts muggleborn is a witch --- she has magic within her and could physically cast a spell if she managed to perform the actual motions of it.

**** I just looked it up. Merope may have choosen to give up magic, but could also have lost acces to it because of her feelings.

  “But she could do magic!” said Harry impatiently. “She could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn't she?” “Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could. But it is my belief --- I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right --- that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen

******* The former is about avoiding magic because it's painful for her to even think about, similar to how closeted gay people may try to reject their sexuality or how some women may be very uncomfortable around any man after being raped by a man. The latter is a loss of motivation across the board. In both cases I think it's mostly psychological.

** I think you are confusing between losing the ability to 'use' magic and 'losing' magic.

Tonks lost control of her meta abilities, she didn't lose the ability to use magic altogether forever. She was still magic. Same with Merope. She lost the ability to use it because of heartbreak, which then lead to her inability to survive childbirth. She didn't die because she didn't have magic, she had it, but lost the will.

** The only way would be to develop some kind of retrovirus that overwrote the part of the generic code of EVERY cell in a wizard's body. And I doubt the genes relating to magic are easy to find, if muggles can detect them at all.

** In CA Dreamin', I have the concept of Binding a witch or wizard away from their magic---making them unable to use it. It's definitely on the Dark end of the magical spectrum, requires the person's blood and can't be done from a distance and is very obscure. As a result, the person is still magical and can pass on their magical genetics, but they are unable to perform magic themselves.

In the story, Harry relates a case where he saw it used on a very old wizard who was going senile and losing control of his magic, creating a very dangerous situation for his family, who turned to it as a last resort to keep grandpa from burning the place down.

To me, it makes for a more interesting story if there's a risk of losing something so integral to oneself. In HP canon, magic is an endless, boundless well that just seems to need a few swishes of a wand and that can get a bit boring after a while.
