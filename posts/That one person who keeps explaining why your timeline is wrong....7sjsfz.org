** Boo that person - if an author has said "aged up for <reason you want them aged up> by <aging method/ timeline> then you should just nod and go with it. Or if your headcanon insists that their age per the story is wrong then just continue reading and mentally subtract 1 year from the age any time it's mentioned. There's no need to antagonize an author over such minutiae imho - maybe mention in a comment "I'm headcanoning that <person> is <age> but great fic!" would be more than fine :/

** This reviewer sounds like one I've gotten some comments from on AO3. Do you have a link to the story? I'm curious to see if it's the same person. The one I'm thinking of said something like my writing can soar with the eagles if the characters stopped cussing. Sorry, person, they're adults and most adults say shit and fuck and bollocks.

I had a recent review on a story that called me out for weak dialog and OOC. I'm not about to get outraged, so I simply said thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts. You don't owe anyone anything. As long as the reason for Hermione being the age she is is adequately explained through your storytelling, then that's all you need to do. Now, if it's confusing, that's on you, but it doesn't sound like that's the case here. If they persist, simply stop engaging. I wouldn't go to moderating reviews unless their comments drift over into abuse.

**** Okay, that's not my person. I don't think I even have any kudos from them. And yeah, totally condescending. They wrote practically a whole treatise on age and school years. No one cares! Let's get to the sexytimes! Also, I like how they point out that "kinky sex" is allowed at age 16. So, only non-kinky sex until then? I mean, according to them, you can't go into a porn shop at 16, so maybe kinky sex isn't really available until you can get your own handcuffs or whatever?

So yeah, do not engage. Let them live in their own little world.

*** It's not explicitly explained in the story because there's no need for that. There is mention of her age and I believe it's been touched on that a time turner was involved, but I don't see the need to go into so much detail. It happened in their 3rd year. This is set in their 6th year. To those involved, it's common knowledge and nobody else need know.

**** Well, I would say that if you do mention her age and it does deviate from what readers understand as the norm, then maybe it should have been explained in the context of the story. Otherwise, why even mention it--as you say, no one else needs to know. To you, she could be 18 and to readers the age she would be in canon. I can see where it could be covered in a simple dialog.

"What are you--oh, God, that's right. You're 18," Ron said, watching as Hermione filled out her ballot for her home council elections. "I keep forgetting all about that time-turner nonsense."

"It's nice to be a bit older and able to do things like this now, but let me tell you, accelerated puberty is not something I'd care to repeat," Hermione said, sliding the filled-out ballot into the envelope. "Be a dear and run this up to the owlery, would you?"

So now you've communicated that Hermione is older than is standard and why. No big deal, let's have sex. :D

******* There isn't a magical line that is crossed when you turn 18 (in fact, the magical line is 17). Hermione isn't suddenly going to do something at 18 that she wouldn't have done at 17 and a half, if it's just the biological age (which, since we're talking time-turners, is the case). And if she actually would say "I'm biologically 18, not 17 and six month, so I can do this..." she would look as mature as a kid claiming they are not 6 years old, but 6 and a half years, so they aren't a kid any more.

******** Wow. Way to read into an off the cuff example of how the author might have dealt with changing an established character's age.

********* The point is that "I'm biologically 18, not 17 and a half" is /hard/ to fit into a scene since it's pretty much meaningless for all practical purposes. It has no legal value, and the age difference isn't enough to affect mental maturity.

In fact, if the author really wants to have her 18, why not simply adjust the world so people start Hogwarts at 12, not 11? Have a birthday party for one of the characters, and it's a natural introduction of the changes.

********** Sure! There are all sorts of things that could have been done to manage the reader's expectations. The author didn't do any of that and instead made a rather arbitrary change and deemed it not important. It's completely their right to do so because it's their story, but then you end up with comments such as the author received.

Fanfic as we know, is playing around in an established world. Deviations are fantastic and the point of fanfic, but deviations without good reasons or explanations tend to confuse and alienate readers. And then some readers are just jerks. Case in point, I just got a comment on one of my stories that nitpicked my use of MPH in the UK as opposed to KPH. Come on. You just read a story about people having sex in a car and /that's/ your takeaway?

** From the way you phrased it, I thought the reviewer left you like 15 reviews talking about the same thing. But after taking a look at your story, it seems to me it's just 2 reviews? And they aren't hostile or anything, just explaining what they thought could be an error in calculating her age. Which seems only natural, given that in your answer, you also focus on the calculation of Hermione's age, instead of the reason you told us here: That you are simply more comfortable writing an 18-year-old character given the content of your story.

I mean... I get that it's frustrating, but that person wrote 2 reviews, you even thanked them "for their concern and their willingness to put themselves out there" in your answer, and then you turn around and portray them as some kind of crazy person on here?
