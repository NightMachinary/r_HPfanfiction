I think Goblet of Fire is my favorite HP book and one if my favorite butterfly points for fics. Anyone have any recommendations for this time period?


** linkffn(13140418) is really good.

  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more. It is a story of growth and maturation.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean victory by DarknessEnthroned]]

After nearly eight years reading fanfiction, this is still my favourite, not just in harry potter, but in any fandom ever. It is the only fic ive ever read that takes the concept of "independent, grey harry" (the mere presence of those word snormally being enough to send me running for the hills), and implement it in such a way that it is actually good. This story changed my perspective on fanfiction forever, its not just a piece of fan art, but a labor of literary love reverently using chracters and settings created by someone else to tell a n incredible story the likes of which Ive never found since.

Ive ready something like 20 times now, all 500k words of it. And boy oh boy, is it a good ride.

*** Does this have Ron bashing. It seems like this would have Ron bashing. Don't get me wrong, I always thought Hermione ending up with Harry just made more sense than Ron, but most HHR stories always bash Ron. I'm all for Harry maybe not being so quick to accept Ron Back after the first task, and I know that Ron has his faults, but overall he's a good friend.

He's still a child, so i'm kind of starting to hate undeserved Ron bashing fics, and the same fics where Hermione is lorded as the pinnacle of beauty, and intelligence instead of just a gifted student who doesn't understand the more practical side of magic.

**** I dislike fics that go crazy with the bashing. I don't like it when Ron is made out to be some evil caricature of himself either, it feels forced and boring to me, and takes me out of my immersion. That being said, I think there's a difference between criticism and bashing and I actually ask a question about that to my readers right in the second chapter. Gratuitous bashing is annoying at best, but criticism towards all characters (not just Ron) when the need arises, shouldn't be seen as something bad.

If you get that far into the second chapter, you can let me know as well, but I like some form of realism. Ron does have his faults in GOF and yes... he is not a very good friend at the start, but neither is he a terrible person. He has room to grow just like any normal person. People grow and change: Ron, Harry, and even Hermione. That's just life.

We'll see how that turns out.

**** The reason there's a lot of Ron bashing is that people recognize something sinister about the "relationship" between him and Hermione but can't put words to it. Put simply, it's unhealthy and dangerous and has the potential to become a domestic abuse situation.

But most of the red flags people sense, appear innocent if you don't already know it's a red flag for abusive relationships, so they bash him because it reflects how they feel about him.

I've wrote about why Ron is terrible to Hermione in this comment, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f53wmb/can_we_get_a_list_of_all_the_things_that_the/fi0atl8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x]]

Edit: it's also why people often turn the Dursleys into physically abusive when bashing them because they just can't accept how awful and much more mentally scarring emotional abuse can be. Personally I think all this bashing cheapens how awful the characters really are especially because I feel like the shit the Dursleys, Snape, Ron, or even Dumbledore did in canon alone are enough to paint them as bad people, but it's subtle and considering how people sometimes claim the Dursleys were just misunderstood and deserve sympathy, I can honestly see the need to exaggerate to illustrate because it seems people can't pick up on subtle. Hell, my first read through when I was a kid, I certainly didn't notice.

*** Signal-boosting /your/ story. It goes well with the art (!)

I appreciate that you're not retreading all the canon plot points.

**** Thank you. I'm glad you like the story and the art. ^^

Re-hashing canon is not my thing haha. I like exploring the moments that change in between much more.

  After his name came out of the Goblet of Fire, Harry woke to a disturbing reality. The wizarding world only saw him as an expendable pawn, his carefree attitude towards studying left him struggling to survive, and he had never truly appreciated the one, constant companion at his side---Hermione Granger. It was high time for change. Gradual Grey!HHR.

** linkffn(12745758)

I started [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12745758/][to write this because]] I was fed up with quite a few plots and tropes you commonly see in fanfics, ranging from "Harry bangs someone his adoptive family" to "Neville is Ron, but better". So instead I wrote a family/friendship centric slice of life fic set in the fourth year.
