Hello,

I read this story on fanfiction.net years ago but I seem unable to find it again: it's 4 chapters long, completed, and Moody and other Aurors hunt Greyback and some other Werewolves down after young Remus is brought to St. Mungo by his father. Could anyone help?


** It's not the one you're looking for but in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) there's a side plot of Moody and Tonks trying to catch Greyback, meanwhile Lupin is trying to convince werewolves in his pack to leave him. At the same time Tonks (in an alternative identity) and Lupin try to find Sirius Black who escaped from Azkaban and kidnapped Harry Potter. Harry Potter is living a good life with his godfather under a Fidelius.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** Thank you, I'll look it up :) I am afraid that the one I want has been taken down by the author. I keep hoping someone has seen it on another archive.
