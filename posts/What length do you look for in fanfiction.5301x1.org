**** The 'Quidditch muscles' trope makes me retch. Harry is even praised as having the 'perfect build' for a Seeker by Oliver Wood in PS.

From the Lexicon:

#+begin_quote
  at the age of 11 he was short and thin, with knobbly knees.

I don't think it's out-of-bounds to assume Beaters were bound to have enormous lats and delts, but beyond that it gets ridiculous.

****** That's a really good point.

I'd guess that the weight gained (and loss of manoeuvrability suffered as a result) would outweigh any other consideration. I know that Krum was tall in the films, but his height is never referenced in the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/viktor-krum/][Lexicon]], so I assume he's rather short and slender as well.

Don't know for sure, though.

**** Have you read any explicit slash? It's ten times worse. Most of the time everyone is a twink or a massive hairy man with little regard for anyone. Let's not forget that everyone smells 'musky'. I haven't even gotten to the other oral stuff and how everyone lies the taste, which is far from accurate.

Oh, yes, everyone has a nine inch dick that is perfect. As for the bodies, Quidditch alone wouldn't make you have abs and be well-toned. I played Soccer often (twice a week) in high school and I was a skinny twig, just somewhat fit from all the running.

** Depends. Generally not /short/ one shots. If its less than 5k words it has to have a certain sort of flavor, like one scene that perfectly captures the essence of what the author wanted to do. Epic length fics are fun every once in a while, but generally attract authors who are better at writing *a lot* rather than writing /well/ (though not always of course). Something in the range of 50-120k words generally hits the spot.

Multi works *always* implode before completion and that is the ultimate dick move. That's my biggest and most aggravating pet peeve: fics that the author went like 80k words into and then just dropped. At least have the decency to post a wrap-up/summary/goodbye-forever chapter damn you!

** When I'm searching for a new fic I usually only go 40k and above. Enough to give me a bit of reading time if it's a new one, plus it deflates the numbers; no authors who post the first few chapters and then drop.

** I tend to not worry about overall length, but I do look at words per chapter. I find that 3-7k words per chapter is the sweet spot. Any longer and it tends to feel like the author is trying too hard to make a good story and putting in way too much detail, any shorter and it feels like the author is trying to do too much too fast.
