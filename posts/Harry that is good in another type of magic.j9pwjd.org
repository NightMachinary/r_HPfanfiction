Does anyone know any fics where Harry is good at something other than defense against the dark arts. I'm fine with him being good at something that isn't a Hogwarts class. I'm ok with any pairings except for snarry, hinny, or romione. Thank you so much everyone!


** Serpentine linkao3(13860426) and linkao3(The Venom Peddler), both about parselmagic: specifically Harry raising basilisks.

There is another thread with stories about Harry being good at potions: [[https://redd.it/j9n479]]

There's a series by Rowling-somebody where he's good at Quiddich, but they are pretty dumb books and I gave up about halfway through.

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way- by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that seeks to either protect or destroy him.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.
