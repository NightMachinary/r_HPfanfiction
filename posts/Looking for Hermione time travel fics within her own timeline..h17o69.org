#+begin_quote
  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

*** I like that one because it takes an interesting premise, develops it, then quits while it's ahead, without trying to overplay it. It wouldn't work as a long fic, but at this length it does.

**** I agree it's an interesting take, and well written, but doesn't try to coax more out of it. It gets the job done and is a very good read.
