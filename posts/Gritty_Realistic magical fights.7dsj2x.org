I'm looking for magical duals that are grim, dirty and creative. Stuff like using the environment i.e shattered glass being thrown at the enemy or transfiguring a spike out of rubble behind them then summoning it through the chest. Just the MA15+ type violence. Pretty much any AU and crossover is fine, just recognisable as HP.

** That's how a number of my fighting scenes go - people conjuring things, transfiguring things, and generally using the environment for cover and attacks. Of my stories, "Patron" has the most pure magic battles.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
