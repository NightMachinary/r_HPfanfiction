I put the "Grey" in quote sign, because i dont know the correct word to Describe the Harry that im looking for. As we experience in HBP Harry is totally focused on Draco for being a Death Eater, but the Order of Phoenix and most importantly his "so called" best Friends dont believe him. He even suspects Snape for some conspiracy, but the others say "Dumbledore trusts Snape...and if we dont trust Dumbledore, we cant trust anyone". Now at the end, All the People were totally shocked as they hear from Harry that Snape killed dumbledore and the Reason for the latters trust was that Snape felt sorry for The Potters Fate. So anything Harry warned about was about to happen, but nobody listened to him. Harry tried to refuse Rons and Hermiones offer to join him, but they decided it "on their own".

To get to the Point now is that im looking for a Fic with a Harry that feels "betrayed" by his Friends and allies for not listening to him. He decides to look and destroy the Horcruxes on his own and pretends to follow the Order to a certain Point (i had in mind, that Harry separates himself from the others at Bills and Fleurs Wedding as the Death Eaters invaded the Party. Also that he learns a couple of spells for preparation and that the Invisibility Cloak will Cover him against the Homenum Revelio Spell). And at some Point returns (or rather Find) to Ron and Hermione, who are either on Grimmauldplace or on the Travel with the Tent, but only because he "need" their Help to find the Weapon to destroy the Horcruxes.

I dont know, if it should contain Phoenixorder, Ron and Hermione Bashing, but i would prefer that Harry is just Angry at them with some sort of indifference (for example: as Hermione is telling Harry that she obliviated her Parents Memories. Harry doesnt feel Guilty about this, because he made it clear that he dont want them to Join. ("It's your own fault")).

I had in mind, that he is looking for the Horcruxes alone, but im fine if he gets help, as long as its as little help as possible.
