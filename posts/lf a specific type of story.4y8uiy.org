I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]] and was wondering if anyone had similar stories to recommend. Maybe a little less heavy at the ending (I cried a bit).

I also recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7145549/1/Duality][Duality]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/][Unatoned]] (bet you can't guess my favorite pairing) and thoroughly enjoyed both.

Really looking for stories with a good plot, but am most definitely not afraid of a little smut if it's well written.


** Like, Harry/Daphne or Pureblood stuff (though there is a big crossover there)?

*** I mean in more of the same style as that story, it doesn't really need a similar plot or anything, although I did really enjoy this plot. But yes, I do really like the Harry/Daphne pairings I've read, but I don't really mind most pairings as long as it's not too vanilla.

** Oh man...I HATE the end of this story. The whole big lie just makes me hate everyone that exists in that world.

*** It's just horribly depressing, but the rest of the story was very well written.
