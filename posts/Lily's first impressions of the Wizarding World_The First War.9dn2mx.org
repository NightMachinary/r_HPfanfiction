She entered Hogwarts and magical Britain directly after the First War picked up steam, but I've yet to stumble upon a fic detailing how she could have felt about that.

It doesn't really have to be Lily, but I'd prefer if the story dealt with someone muggleborn getting dropped from the flourishing post-war world into one of the darkest decades of an already foreign and hostile culture.

Pairings don't really matter if they aren't wonky enough to hurt the story. Not that I'd refuse a Dumbledore/Binns/Walpurga triangle fic if it fulfilled my request otherwise, but... eh.

Thanks in advance!


** linkao3(Culture Shock by thirty2flavors) is rather short, but it deals with some of what you're looking for.

  She first hears the word “Mudblood” bellowed at top volume out of a red envelope she will later learn is called a Howler.   Five times Lily Evans hated being Muggle-born.

** I think Crossroads kind of fits your theme....it's not exactly canon, but it does deal with Lily's feelings about the underlying (and obvious) prejudice against Muggleborns, her identity, and her path to discovering what her place is in the wizarding world. A lot of James/Lily. Linkffn(Crossroads)

  Post ESB. AU. Incapable of recovering, physically and emotionally, from the blow of discovering the truth about Darth Vader and himself on Bespin, Luke falls deadly ill. Desperate and at the end of her rope, Princess Leia does the unthinkable: turn to her sworn enemy for help.
