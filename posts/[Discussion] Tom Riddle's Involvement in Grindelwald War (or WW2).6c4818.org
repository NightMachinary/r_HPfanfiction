I think he should have significant involvements in the last two years of the War, from 1944 to 1945. I brought up this idea two days ago in another thread, and some people seemed to disagree vehemently, because they thought that Hogwarts students shouldn't or couldn't possibly be involved in wars. I mean did they forget about the Canon? What were the Trio, Ginny, Neville, Luna, and the DA doing after all?

Besides, after Dec 31 1943, Tom Riddle was 17 and legally adult. He was also Voldemort by that time and had already made two Horcruxes. Do you really think someone like him would just sit back and NOT try to take advantage from this colossal conflict?

Before we continue with further speculations, let's consider some facts from the Books and history:

- Harry's 2nd Year events fell between Oct 31 1992 and Jun 2 1993. It was said the CoS was opened 50 years ago. It was also said that the school would be closing after Myrtle's death. So Myrtle's death most likely occurred in the first half of 1943, when Tom was still in 5th Year and 16. He made the Diary and his first Horcrux then.
- Tom murdered his father and grandparents sometime in 2nd half of 1943, when he was still underage and bypassed the Trace using his uncle's wand. He made his 2nd Horcrux at this time.
- On June 6 1944, the Western Allies launched [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord][Operation Overlord]]. By Aug 24, Paris was liberated. By Sep 1, most of France was free.
- On June 22 1944, the Soviets launched [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bagration][Operation Bagration]], which destroyed the German Army Group Centre and reached outskirt of Warsaw on Aug 17.

Between late June and Sep 1 1944, Riddle was supposed to be out of Hogwarts. Do you honestly believe he would go back to that hated orphanage, being of age and Trace free? He would be perfectly capable of taking part in the war if he wanted. He might have even contributed greatly, given how badly the Muggle German forces had collapsed during the Summer of 1944.

There is one very good fic out there, albeit an AU one, that described Voldemort's participation in the War: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre][Limpieza de Sangre]] by [[/u/TE7]], linkffn(11752324).

--------------

The upcoming FB movies should shine light on Riddle's involvements, and I suspect it could be substantial. If that was the case, then time travel back to kill Riddle when he was still young would no longer be a good choice. If Grindelwald and Nazis won....


** It makes far more sense in my head for him to be making the most of the freedom given to him by Dumbledore's absence. Dumbledore was the only teacher not to trust him. The Hogwarts library is meant to be extensive and I suspect that there is a lot in there that concerns the Dark Arts, didn't Dumbledore say something about removing lots of them when he became head?

Simply I see Tom as far too selfish to involve himself in the war when he could be making personal gains at home. The idea that he wouldn't simply be raiding Libraries and the like, becoming a the terrifying monster he became doesn't compute for me. Maybe even using the chaos to sneak off to albania and collect the diadum. He was above other people's conflicts and if he was even close he would have observed it like an emperor in the colosseum. Watching others die for his own amusement.

** So, I believe that canon says/implies that Voldemort was dicking around in Albania for a substantial amount of time, after he killed Hepzibah Smith. Ostensibly this was to improve his magical knowledge. (As a side note, it might be interesting to have Albania and other Eastern European countries be the center of dark magic as a culture.)

Voldemort, while narcissistic and sociopathic, was also pretty pragmatic when one of his mental issues wasn't interfering. I cannot really see him fighting out of patriotism, and the idea that he would kill soldiers to steal valubles doesn't make much sense in terms of efficiency.

What he could do however, is grow his influence. Muggle and wizard fighters placed under the Imperious Curse, and no one would suspect, merely calling them "shell-shocked". It would also allow him to aid Eastern Europe, and grant him connections with unsavory elements through Europe. It gets even more interesting with the USSR. What does the magical Russian nation look like, and how would Voldemort have interacted with it? Voldemort himself rather favors a dictator approach, and takes a rather nationalist stance in terms of pure blood vs muggle born.

I could definitely see Voldemort as being politically opposed to the USSR, and if he did manage to Imperious Soviet officials, then at that point, we have to consider just how much magical Russia is under their counterpart's thumb. Because if he controls Muggle policy which in turn controls magical policy, he would have a great deal of influence on the Continent.

I don't have time to look at a timeline, but I could certainly see Voldemort using Muggle Russia to bring Magical Russia under his thumb, dominate and puppet a large number of the magical nation's, and then start a nuclear war to wipe out the Muggle superpowers, allowing them to rise and destroy the Statute of Secrecy, and conquer the world.

This is all speculation, and I don't have time to look at the canon or timelines to confirm this, or even make it plausible, I just thought it was an interesting idea.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** I don't think he was involved either with Grindelwald or Dumbledore or WWII Or any of known anti-Grindelwald wizards. His life before appearing as Voldemort rarely known. Remember that Dumbledore was collecting memories and rarely any known Tom Riddle's memory was found. Dumbledore probably asked Grindelwald and his people about Tom Riddle as well. If Tom had anything to do with Grindelwald, we would have known in 6th book.

Voldemort always was self-obsessed. He had nothing to gain to involve with WWII. He was way too arrogant to associate with either group. Unless it's about collecting a prize as Dumbledore put it, no, I don't think he was involved.

He could loot magical artifacts and trinkets off their dead bodies and abandoned homes. He could experiment and practice spells/rituals on people in war torn areas, without arousing suspicion.

Not completely. First of all, he was British. Second, if Grindelwald's minions were heavily populated by Muggleborns, as some speculated, then he would fight them, in secret of course.

Also, I need to remind you that the Tom Riddle from 1944 was NOT the same compulsive-obsessive, super narcissistic psychopath in 1997, at least not that extreme. He could still put up a good show as the Head Boy from fall 1944 to Jun 1945. He still had enough charm to fool Hepzibah Smith in 1947.

**** During war, operating independently, do you honestly think, he could have any effect? And that anyone Awouldn't know that another force was working? For the sack of purpose, lets assume he did. So he had an effect on either side. Now Dumbledore was searching about Tom Riddle's memory, don't you think Dumbledore would staple upon someone who was affected by Riddle's action? This someone probably wouldn't know who this mysterious force was. But Dumbledore was clever enough to put the clue in right spot.

He could do that without involving as well. And he did that. The thievery at Smith's prove that. The thing that he didn't know much about the Hallows aka Grindelwald sign, shows that he had little interest about the war. If he had, don't you think, as brilliant as he was, wouldn't he research about the origin of Grindelwald's sign? His target was collecting the founder's items and 'pushing' the boundaries of magic. Don't think he'd waste his time involving with the war unless he was sure about that he could gain something.

#+end_quote

I know you speculated in your original post, but otherwise who, though?

Grindelwald is the OG Wizard Hitler, and making it so that his army was full of muggleborns, even though they were to many wizards similar to how Jews were to the Nazis, just so Tom could have a 'legit' reason for being a mad, frothing-at-the-mouth racist really irks me.

Tom Riddle is - in canon - a rabid supporter of the blood-purity ideology nonsense, with a healthy dose of Slytherin superiority thrown into the mix.

If you want to give him an important role (as you described in your original comment - interfering with Dumbledore and Grindelwald's duel somehow, for instance), that's your prerogative.

If you want to somehow make Grindelwald - might I reiterate, /Wizard Hitler/ - field an evil army of evil muggleborns just to make Tom not an insane antagonistic character then you're gonna lose me.

I'm really enjoying /Limpieza de Sangre/ but even I can see it's a /huge/ diversion from canon-Tom, and without you rewriting the foundations of his character, trying to justify his insane racism in later life by making muggleborns the bad guys just seems cheap to me.

I mean, you do you, I suppose, but I wouldn't be on board with that particular idea.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Also, if they have any sense I bloody hope they don't. If the FB movies /have/ to have some titanic struggle between good and evil in them, then they should keep it at Grindelwald and let that be that, rather than write in some convoluted events whereby a teenage Tom Riddle gets involved. It would just muddy the water and unless it was done really well, it would come off like bad fanfiction.

Honestly, it just seems like you want Tom Riddle to be this deep, nuanced character that the audience can sympathise with without addressing the key issues with his personality and actions that both define him and make the above aim an impossibility. Tom Riddle is damaged, perhaps even some kind of psychopath (if I'm using that term correctly). He's cruel, vindictive and murders and tortures for fun. He's not altruistic or noble, and I just don't think what you want to happen would actually happen with his character the way it is. Without addressing these issues - and thus making it an AU - a story describing his possible role in the war would have difficulty getting off the ground.

** I think about this probably an alarming amount and I I've come to two conclusions based off the very little info we are given in canon. I think WWII had 2 effects on Tom Riddle:

1. The bombs and general fear in London cultivated his fear of death. Remember that he was in a muggle orphanage with virtually no magical protection. Aside from bombs and war, there was a lot of sickness and misery surrounding the poor during this time.

2. He must have been at least somewhat aware of what was going on with Hitler, etc. and this fueled his hatred of muggles. They all treated each other like shit, from stigmatization to death camps (on the scale from mild to extreme). He may have thought Grindelwald had a good idea but looked down on him since he (along with anyone else on earth) would never be as smart and powerful as Riddle (in his head).

Other than that, I really don't think Riddle gave a crap about WWII. He found out he was a wizard in 1939(?) when it was just getting started, and since he could do magic, well, who cares about a bunch of muggles?

So I said challenge accepted.
