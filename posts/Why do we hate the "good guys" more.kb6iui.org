I feel like people generally have more intense feelings of hate or strong dislike about say Snape, or Ron, or Dumbledore, or James or Hermione than say Voldemort or Bellatrix. Not that they think Voldemort or Bellatrix are better people or anything but the characters that you are supposed to sympathize more with in the story piss people off more. Even if they have a very limited presence in the story like James does. I mean sometimes there are exceptions like Umbridge but like generally. This isn't a HP exclusive thing I feel like it's a thing in loads of fandoms.


** Villains are supposed to be bad so you expect them to do bad stuff, but positive characters are generally idolised so any mistake they make is more impactful I guess

**** Yes. This, and the fact that the niche of them being good and treated well is somehat filled by canon, while alternative portrayals are 'new'. This also holds for the reverse, 'Draco in leather pants' is a trope for a reason (and because of shippers).

** If you don't like a character or think this thing they did was bad and the story is like yup I agree. That's not frustrating.

But if you don't like a character or think this thing they did was bad and the story is like: look sympathetic backstory, good qualities, they a hero tho, we forgive them. Thats more frustrating.

Its more frustrating when you have to look at a character in a positive light when you don't really like them. That can make you hate them more.

** Part of it is that the good guys get more page time and character development. We only see Bellatrix a) torture people b) kill people c) talk baby talk. That's not a lot to work with. She's one-dimensional evil. But we see a lot of Snape. We see him bully Harry and rescue him, brew Lupin's wolfsbane and ruin his career, befriend Lily and reject her. There's a lot to choose from. So when a fic picks only a couple of those traits/actions to focus on, especially in fics that are lower in word count, yeah, their portrayal is more polarized.

It also goes back to why Umbridge is hated more than Voldemort. Most of us are fortunate enough that we only see genocidal war lords in our history books or on the news. But most of us have had a teacher who belittled their students, refused to listen to them, and gave them unfair punishments. (Especially when you're a teenager and lack the experience and perspective to deal with petty tyrants.) So Umbridge is hated more than Voldemort, and Snape more than Bellatrix. Snape bullying Harry /feels/ more painful than torturing people into insanity, even if objectively it's less damage.

** It might be because in most stories (not just HP) the Good people also tend to be Stupid, while the Bad people get to be Intelligent, which is quite an annoying [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb][trope]]. So people are not actually angry at the characters for being good; they just can't tolerate stupidity.

** Other commenters have brought up good points about "why", but I'll add as to what, in my opinion, makes the dislike more intense for the good guys. Whereas disliking the bad guys is expected and doesn't require much critical thinking, when you have beef with a good guy, you have to put more effort into analyzing and supporting your line of thinking. That effort means you're more invested in that relationship and promotes more intense feelings than the passive dislike of Voldemort or any other generic villain.

** The villains in this fandom tend to be one dimensional bad guys to be bad.

The most debatable is snape... And let's not get me started on that one. I'll probably get some flames for this one, but I consider that character the most pathetic /creepy character I've read in fiction. Alan Rickman did him far too much credit.

I think the most reviled character in the series is Umbridge, in large part due to we've faced someone that we can identify with for that person, and Staunton played the character PERFECTLY. That or Lucian Malfoy.

At no point did Rowling actually capture the horror of any of the horrible things that were done in the fandom, Because well, it's a kids series.

The problem is people identify with the good guys, they tend to be more filled out, and they make horrible mistakes in favor for plot. Ppl forget this was a child's book, and expect adults to make adult choices that we, generally, as adults wouldn't make.

** I would say the main reason for this being so blatantly stupid is lazy authors. They have an idea that they want to write, but they can't be arsed to put in enough effort to make the idea viable - if you want a logical Evil!Dumbledore or Good!Voldemort, you have to essentially re-do the entire timeline starting with the 19th century. You don't have to write it out, but the impact of their actions will have changed a lot of events, and you have to be aware of it - and write differently, as a result. However, what usually happens is they start at a very late point in the timeline and simply shoehorn stuff in as they come up with it, and shove in the same annoying tropes as hundreds of other fics, resulting in "Good guys being bashed" rather then "The Light is evil"

** Because most fanfiction stories are written and read by teenagers or young adults, and they are still in the stage of moral negation, rejection of everything presented to them as good. So, Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape, or even Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange, are suddenly good (and yes, Alan Rickman and Tom Felton helped), and the positive characters Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall or Weasleys and Hermione are suddenly bad (bashing stories).

**** I think it's Nietzsche who says that everyone starts off as a camel (agreeing to anything), then some people become like a lion (saying no to everything), and then some of those become wise enough to be like a child (agree to the things you want to, disagree with the things you don't want to).

** Thermal equilibrium.

People don't know how to write characters, so they write every character as themselves. This makes good characters more evil, evil characters more good, and all characters have less personality.

** In the books, Rowling wrote the main villains as one-dimensional, goose-stepping, Nazi clones. As a result, when it comes to fanfic, writers have a lot of scope to create backstories, and speculate on motivations for them.

Thus, these characters can constantly be re-invented from story to story. Whereas “good” characters like Sirius already have a bunch of stuff about them established in canon and have more well-rounded personalities to begin with. So interpretations of them in fanfic have to adhere to pre-set boundaries. The only real innovative take becomes to negate what is said about them in canon and make them “bad”---thus writers desperate for a different take have to make the good characters bad but can continue to represent the villains in a variety of ways---nearly all of which have to be better than the unthinking, evil cardboard cutouts in the books.

*** I have to disagree with your second paragraph. Many authors completely scrap canon personalities of "good" characters too. Sometimes it's for bashing stories like you said, but look at all the overpowered Harry---excuse me, Lord Hadrian Potter Black Peverell---stories. Lots of stories give the main good guys very OOC personalities.

To use your Sirius example, I've seen many more fics where Sirius calls Harry "pup," "prongslet," or "cub" than fics that attempt to portray Sirius anything remotely like his canon characterization. That's excluding Marauders-era fics, where fans can make the case his personality is less established so of course he's a desperate, nervous wreck around his crush Remus, whose entire personality consists of liking chocolate.

I think people write the stories they want. The HP books came out decades ago (over 20 years since PS/SS was first published), and the fandom is made up of many different kinds of writers. Some have only watched the movies, some have read the books many years ago and have only read other fanfics since, some authors stick close to the source material, some are writing complete AUs, some are teen writers. You'll find nearly everything. Evil Dumbledore, evil Potters, evil Weasleys, good Voldemort, good Malfoys, Harry time travels and falls in love with Bellatrix. I'm more surprised to hear of something that hasn't been done before.

** I think that “bad” characters are often written as knowing that they are bad but do what they do anyway because of deeply held convictions, ultimate end goal, ends justify the means, etc.

So characters that are presented as “good” but do things we find bad feel irritating because then when they compare themselves to the “bad” characters they seem self-righteous at times. Like u want to knock them off their high horse.

Also if they are the main person we get to see a lot of their hypocrisy in how they think about themselves and what they did
