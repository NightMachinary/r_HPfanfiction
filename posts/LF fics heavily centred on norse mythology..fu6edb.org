I'm after fics that heavily focus on horse mythology, possible taking the idea that Harry is a demigod or whatever the case. I just want to read something involving norse gods.


** Ah yes....a "focus on horse mythology"

Just what I wanted.

In all seriousness, I think that would be pretty cool :)

#+begin_quote
  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends. Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power. His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.

** I've had the idea of Harry being an oddity of Magic where Lily was part Ljósálfar (Light Elf) and James was Part Dökkálfar (Dark Elf). And because of the two recessive genes Harry basically becomes a super human.

No one else would have Elvish blood

*** It would need to involve horses and their mythology.

​

But would read the shit out of that. I love fics that deviate from basic bitch humans and explore magical creatures and other magical beings.

**** Well the idea is far more involved with Harry essentially is subject to prophecy as a herald of destruction, basically a herald of Ragnarok which lead the Norse Gods and in particular the Light and Dark Elves to trying to to kill Harry before hand. I would likely shift The Canon prophecy to Neville.

** linkffn(Child of the Storm) -- Marvel Universe Thor is Harry's father. Crossover, obviously. Also has a sequel I can't remember the name of at the moment. Not quite the same as what you're asking for but it does have the "Harry is a demigod" thing.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

**** Loki/Harry pairing. I highly recommend this fic even if u are not into slash. There is a lot of focus on the plot and it's very well written as are the relationships between the people. I also really liked Thors portrayal in this

#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
