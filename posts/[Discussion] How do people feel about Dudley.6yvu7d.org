How do people feel about Dudley when he is used in fanfiction? For example, Dudley is actually a wizard/ Dudley tries to fit into the Wizarding World or Dudley has a massive redemption arc etc.

How do you feel about this?

I personally hate this sort of scenario and it can make me drop a fic almost instantly, especially when it's a Harry centric fic, and they become friends. I find it very distracting if it's not the story that is trying to be told.

Thoughts?


** Someone who has the potential to realise he was a prick. I can see Harry forgiving Dudley before Dudley forgives himself. The fics with Dudley being a wizard are less interesting to me than a child of Dudley is magical.

** My Dudley is a copper. He and Harry collaborate on investigations from time to time. They are on cordial terms but not close. Neither is particularly comfortable around the other.

As an aside, I recall several kids from my own youth who were absolute little shits but who have grown up to be perfectly decent human beings. Age is a great leveller. I think Dudley would have turned out okay in the end.

***** You stop being "the product of your upbringing" at some point and start forming your own oppinions (and that's before age 11 IMHO, I myself remember becoming more and more independent at that age and even disagreeing with my parents on policy and even on politics (I was always kind of fascinated by politics, even as a small child)) and while you might not be legally held accountable, you are still morally responsible for shit you pull and shitty parents aren't a great justification IMHO!

****** Shitty parents aren't justification, they are a reason. Dudley is described as a rather dim and spoiled child, who has been raised according to certain values and got away with everything, so he literally didn't know better. Was Dudley an arsehole? certainly and i would have hated if i was in a school with someone like him, but from an outside perspective i can't really blame him, because with a background like that he couldn't be anything else.

Becoming independent and forming your own opinions does not mean you just pull those options from thin air, you must have access to different ideas to even realise that there are other options to form. It speaks well of you that you could make your own opinions at 11, but did your parents raise you in the same way as Dursleys raised Dudley?

And like i said, Dudley does show remorse later in canon, when he realises that Harry isn't some horrible freak that his parents claimed he was.

Of course do keep in mind i never said that Dudleys bullying victims and the such should just get over it and forgive him because of it, because yes the fact that he was never taught better, does not justify his actions, it merely explains them. And it does mean it is possible for him to be redeemed so that he becomes a decent person in the future.

********* That one I can easily answer, it's /a sad layer/ (the thing where the cake doesn't care about your baking efforts). For all its faults, and for all it feels like Madame Rowling didn't know what to do because she wrote herself into a corner, the final fight could have still been a cake of sorts: the whole series gives us hints that the one chance Harry has at defeating him is to reach for the ancient magic, the magic that comes from emotions and cannot be controlled, the magic that Tom scoffs at and never cared to understand. It could have been epic in a very emotional way, instead we got “Graveyard Duel MK II” with Harry getting boost from the elder wand which had not been foreshadowed sufficiently.

I guess it's mostly up to the fact that I really like stories that play with emotions, and this one just didn't deliver. Still, the seventh book was /readable/, so that's that.

And yes, what I meant with the hyphened title was CC; it wasn't written by Madame Rowling and got adopted into canon on her say-so despite contradicting certain things that were up at the time and still are up, so ... yeah, I'm not going to get onto anyone's case for treating it as canon, but you won't see me use it as such for anything because really.

Personally I never though about wands as sapient creatures and anything more than quasi-sentient items with no actual identity, so for me it's a non-issue, but if for you they are alive-like enough to have genders (or however that works) then that's your choice and that's it for me really, at least for as long as you don't try to crusade for it like a lunatic with no proof (because it's just sad when people do it, and a tad annoying; for an example, see some of the less ... sensible, yes, arguments for certain pairings, which are just pitiful).

** I have to admit, I don't really find Dudley-centric fics or even Dudley-has-a-role fics very interesting - especially given that in my experience, it's almost always the Dudley who's lost all this weight and is now big and muscled and is suddenly an acceptable love interest for someone or other because he's actually kind...

Like, no.

I have a lot of fondness for some of the most flawed characters in the universe, especially Rita Skeeter, Peter Pettigrew and the Malfoys because they all have their own goals while just coming across as absolutely terrible people, you know? With Dudley, I think it's almost more tragic than that - Dudley's been raised with neither goals nor direction in mind, because everything's been given to him, and in order to fill up all his time he just bullies kids and as he grows up, realizes that doesn't satisfy him.

Dudley as a wizard, definitely not. Dudley having a position in the wizarding world, again, no.

But I think Dudley could reach for a redemption arc - how big it would be, one has to wonder. It's very easy to give into the want to just suddenly make a Muggle or squib character magical in order for them to have a semblance of importance, but that isn't necessary; part of Dudley's fear and bitterness toward Harry is an intentional parallel with Petunia and Lily's relationship. Outside of a complete AU, Dudley /shouldn't/ have magic, because it takes away from his character as whole.

I see what you mean about it being distracting though, OP - characters like Dudley are super complex in that even if their intentions might become good, they have a lot of flaws, and you'd really have to lavish a lot of attention on a redeeming plotline in order for it to be convincing, so it would need to be a primary plot.

** Dudley is a character I actually find to have a lot of fanfic potential, especially if he is allowed a bit of growth and development -- because he's so extremely underdeveloped in canon.

The problem with canon Dudley is that he's inconsistent, especially in the first couple of books -- and this is because he's always portrayed as the negative contrast to Harry. Basically, he has the traits and personality that would make him come off as worst compared to Harry depending on the scene. Sometimes it even shifts in the scene itself, just so the narrative can beat over our heads how fat, mean, spoiled, stupid and utterly pathetic he is, and how much better Harry is than him in every way.

And that's pretty interesting, because even though Dudley is SUPPOSED to be the bully who gets his comeuppance, as the story is written he's so pathetic and such a failure in everything that he actually comes across as the underdog compared to Harry. Sure, the narrative insists that he's a bully, but it never shows him successfully bullying anyone, it only shows him being the victim when faced with magic. I think Rowling eventually caught on, because the last two books do show Dudley in a more sympathetic light and hint that there is hope for him to grow and change -- unlike his parents.

There's definitely a lot of potential with Dudley, potential that a good fic writer can expand upon. I'm not saying he should turn into a figure of sweetness and light, or become Harry's best friend or anything, but I'm all for Dudley becoming more than the walking fat joke that canon all too often treated him as.

** Dudley was as much a victim of his parents as Harry, just in a different way.

I do not want to imagine what life altering change it must've been to him when he had to take responsibility for anything the first time. Children like Dudley are defacto unable to live in a society without a serious reprogramming of pretty much everything they know. Or they become sociopaths if they find some way to support their delusions that nothing is their fault.

I feel like Dudley is a prime candidate for a redemption arc. However, I don't mind if he just remains the dumb bully that gets to be the punching bag in the end.

****** that is actually not true.

The dursley's were guilty of creating an unstable and violent home for an orphan. In fact, under british, and US law, Vernon and Petunia are responsible for Dudley's physical abuse of Harry. They are also guilty of neglect. They also did emotionally, and mentally abuse him. Recently, both of those areas were covered in cases in which the child was found to be in an abusive home, and those cases were not to the extreme that Harry's was.

IRL, if the Dursely's did what they did in the novels, and what we can see from the books, Vernon and Petunia would be in prison, and Dudley would be under watch in foster care. That doesn't count the fact that Vernon and Petunia allowed a dog, to repeatedly bite a child, and tree that same child, and allowed both the dog's owner and the dog to be in the same house as the child for an extended period. (Prisoner of Azkaban, first couple chapters mention how much Ripper and Harry Get along). That is actual assault of a minor, and any good lawyer can get Vernon and Petunia on conspiracy to assault a minor. If not, compliance with the action which is the same as being an accomplice to a crime in the United States.

Dudley may not be the worst of the Dursely's and he may have a redemption possible, but if I was Harry, I would never ever want to see him again.

*** I see him forgiving Dudley. That's it. Harry would probably recognize that Dudley has been raised specifically with only negative views of Harry. His parents that loved him didn't like Harry so that's how he's raised. It's be much harder to forgive Dudley if his parents also didn't like him. I think most people exaggerate Harry's childhood a lot. Really Dudley to me in canon is just a local school yard bully, not a sadistic little shit. Of course bullying is bad, but it's exceptionally popular in kids and has different levels of shitheadiness. Harry has lived through a ritual bringing a powerful dark motherfucking voldemort using his own blood and seen a classmate die by his parents batrayer. Harry thinks very little of the attempts to humiliate him by his relatives after that. I'd say it's pretty easy for him to move on. And he does.

***** Full of violence? If that's not a hyperbole I don't know what is. The books never say they beat him up. The most violence we see is that frying pan seen. Which yes is definitely obviously bad, but never was there something like that again, I believe Vernon grabbed Harry by his collar in PoA after he threatened to tell Marge about Hogwarts I think. I think they probably pushed him on the ground and grabbed his glasses. Which is a typical school yard bully act, not to proceed to punch and kick at him.

****** Maybe his childhood wasn't "full of violence" (although it was definitely present) but it was definitely /full of abuse; Both physically and especially psychologically, which can be just as -if not more damaging./ He was treated as a house elf in his own home; not given love, money, or even clothes the fit. He had to tend the garden and cook but when guests came over he was hidden away in his room - which he only even got because they were frightened of McGonagall's letters addressed to "the cupboard under the stairs" - and they literally locked him in there and put bars on his window. I could go on but I won't.

*The point is, these actions were not physically violent, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't abuse.*

******* I never said there isn't any abuse, just that it's exaggerated because people forget what the books say between every single fanfiction saying the same thing about his abuse. I 100% agree emotional abuse can be worse. My problem is everyone takes what is said in the books and multiplies it by 50. I think my counterpoint to that, is that he was only told to do chores for the masons, which he's doing the garden, and I believe Dudley is told to do cleanup inside.And I the cupboard sucks add, but to be fair, its a big add cupboard that's describes in the books. Like I said, there's no question of trauma from a childhood like that. It's the constant exaggeration that people start saying is canon that bothers me.

****** Most of it was insinuated. They starved him in his second year. In one of the years, he survived only on food from his friends.

But, you have an opinion, as do I. I am unwilling to argue. Let's agree to disagree, good?

******* Sure, except he wasn't starved. He got three meals a day. He didn't need to survive from his friends. The ENTIRE family was on diet. That includes who? Dudley, Vernon, and Petunia. He didn't need that food to survive, he wanted it because the food they were all eating was crap. You'd notice that for being sent "life saving" food, it was completely sweets, no nutritional value at all. You'd think if he actually needed food to survive they'd give him something that actually helps him survive right?

******** To be fair, food doesn't need to be healthy to keep you alive. It's still food and it still has calories, just not all the vitamins and such from other food groups.

I agree that he wasn't starved. What he got might have stunted his growth some if it became long term, but it's not like he was burning calories, sitting in his room all day. He would have lived just fine.

Life at the Dursleys was, at most, moderate neglect. Crap situation to be in, but not the worst.

********* That's true, but considering he got sweets from both Herrmione and Molly, both characters that would think to send actual food if one is starved.

Would either of them actually believe him? They'd think he was overreacting or such. Hermione with her Authority complex, Molly with her thinking family is everything.

*********** Yes.

I have no doubt in my mind that if Harry actually, straight forward asks for food because he doesn't get any, neither of those two would hesitate. They would ask questions, especially Hermione. But neither of them would not send food.

*********** True enough, I always thought Hermione recognized Harry's treatment. My impression was always that they were closer and Hermione knows how emotionally stunted he is. I might be talking out of my ass, I haven't read after the Goblet of Fire for a while now. But i think if Harry was actually starving he'd write a letter that meant it to Hermione, not one of them "I'm starving, help" lines that he would probably send in his sarcastic lovable way.

I am not about to argue on this age-old discussion. I could link you to some threads discussing this issue, or you could make a new thread.

I respect your opinion, so please, extend me the same courtesy.
