Pretty much what it says in the title. I think Hermione found a "secret" tower-room or classroom rather than using the RoR. Hermione gets a rush from casting. It's possible Crookshanks also brought some small animals - maybe even Pettigrew the rat.

I think Hermione had kept Rita in a glass-jar for a while and had crucioed the beetle - Rita reverts to human and tries to flee, while rambling about the awards she'll win by uncovering Harry's friend as dark... that's when Hermione AKs her in the back, just as Rita is about to leave the room. AKing a human, gives Hermione the greatest rush.

Too bad it is, in all probability, long abandoned.

  Hermione was known as the brightest witch of her age, but time and circumstances would soon change that. Who will survive a brilliant mind's descent into darkness? A dark Hermione fic'.
