I always thought that there should be so much more to the Cloak than it just not having an expiration date, vastly paling compared to the other two Deathly Hallows. This is my interpretation of its power; you are unable to die no matter how much damage your body takes, but if it's fatal, the moment you take it off, you are leaving your soul open to be taken by the Reaper.

And well, there's a lot of drama potential this way, I think.


** Ideas to make it more powerful

It's given as a baby blanket to the first born child in the Potter family and Harry had it around him when Voldemort cursed him. Dumbledore got it when Harry is swaddled with it by hagrid.

It fucks with soul magic you can't be seen or revealed by magical means. You can also just walk through ward lines but only while your cloaked so taking your head out in a warded house would alert them. I'd retcon Dumbledore seeing through it especially on account of Harry coming every night to the mirror he has a reasonable chance of guessing while mad eye should have a in universe reason like his magic eye picking up something tangental and then making an educated guess it's a cloak

Dementors should be able to sense you but they don't approach they just drift and stare at you menacingly while under the cloak, hell maybe just having the cloak on your person. Imagine walking in to azkaban with hundreds of dementors stopped and staring as you move the prison.

Had an idea similar to this. The cloak actually does protect it's owner from death, even if they're not wearing it. Theoretically, of you go back in Potter/Peverel history, no owner of the cloak has died. They always die after they've passed the cloak onto the next generation. Nobody has discovered this because the cloak is usually passed on at a young age (James got it during his Hogwarts years for example).

My idea is James, by loaning the cloak to Dumbledore, forfeited that protection. Once he died however, the cloak passed to Harry who tanked the killing curse via the cloak's protection, not Lily's sacrifice. Though, that did give Harry nifty 'melt Voldemort's face by touching him' powers.

**** It is easier to think of the cloak as a precognitive probability modifier rather than outright immortality. Its wielders just have insane luck stats in life or death situations. Like magic being always on the wielders side in ambiguous situations involving the killing curse.

It repeats the process, subtly pushing its user into suicide, communicating with dead is just a cover story. /All/ of its users inevitably commit suicide in some form (see Harry and possibly Dumbledore).

Wait a second. Dumbledore had some method of knowing Harry was in the room with the Mirror of Erised (Wand beats cloak).

Dumbledore is cursed by a ring containing the Stone, even though he has the Wand (Stone beats Wand)

All that's missing is a canon event the confirms Cloak beats Stone.

** I read a story once ages ago, with this premise. It was a closely guarded secret of the potter family, that whoever had the cloak would not die from anything. Once it was passed down to the next holder, that person would, as owner of the cloak, be protected from death until they then passed it to the next person. And it worked even if you physically didn't have the cloak on you at the time.

James knew this, and gave the cloak to Harry as protection, which is why he died from Voldemort, when he fought him at the cottage. And that is why Harry did not die from the killing curse the first time. It's why he didn't die from the Dursleys; even while he didn't have the cloak he was still protected; and it's why he survived all the various adventures through the books.

And the only reason the Killing curse worked at the end of the DH was because he had taken the cloak off and met his “death as a friend”.

From what I remember it was a really good story, though I can't for the life of me remember the name.

** I've always thought there should be more to it than what was shown in the books. The power of the cloak was that is was supposed to hide the youngest brother from Death, until he took it off and welcomed Death like an old friend. Thus, as you suggested, if one is gravely wounded, as long as they keep the cloak wrapped around themselves, they are unable to die. The problem with this though, is that if the person is wrapped in the cloak and is so gravely wounded that they are unable to move, they will be stuck on the precipice of death for eternity, unable to live due to being so gravely wounded, and unable to die due to not being able to take off the cloak.

Grindlewald, a man implied to at least be Dumbledore's vague equal before the Wand, still lost even with it because Dumbledore was just better. Dumbledore didn't just stomp Voldemort with it. The stone just summons ghosts to convince you to die, even when Harry did it just made him OK with walking into the forest to his death. There's plenty of theoretical useful things you could do with the stone that canon never shows anyone doing or even considering. The Hallows just sorta suck, and the Cloak being just a forever cloak is still the suckiest of the three, but it fits the theme. I like the fanon of it being specifically against detection spells of any kind and nothing else. because it's just useful enough to be "wow, thats a useful artifact" but not enough to just make Harry win any fight he can prepare for with the cloak.
