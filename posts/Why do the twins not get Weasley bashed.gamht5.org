Seriously. In every anti-weasley story whether it's dramione, Harmione, or indy-Harry, they are still best friends with the twins. What makes this such an attractive storyline?


** Authors bash characters they don't like. Fred and George are pretty universally popular. Therefore Fred and George are rarely bashed.

** They aren't part of the pairings. I think that's the biggest reason Ron and Ginny get bashed. They have never tried to shelter Harry like Molly has and as 'rebellious pranksters' are seen as independent from the puppetmaster Dumbledore Indy Harry writers seem to enjoy so much.

*** I'm a little glad Harmony isn't canon because everyone who wanted Harry to date Daphne Greengrass or whoever would bash Hermione to hell in every other fic

** Canonically, Fred and George's ambitions aren't in line with what their mother wants. She's upset by their lack of seriousness, desire to open a joke shop, and the fact they only earn 3 O.W.Ls in their time at Hogwarts.

This, combined with their general likeability as characters, is enough to have them excluded from most instances of Weasley-bashing - because all that's really needed to exclude them is to exaggerate a minor conflict that's already there and /would/ logically be made more prominent if one party was made into an evil version of themselves.

*** I want more pro-Ron twins bashing!

They turned his bear into a spider and almost got him to make an unbreakable vow. As a set of kids and not lawyers that had a decent chance of killing him outright. They sold love potions in their shop, their ton tongue toffees could very easily kill people... There's a lot to go off of if you want to bash the twins.

(They're generally douchey to Ron and if one were so inclined they could blame the twins for any of Ron's faults in canon, too)

I've seen them bashed, mostly in Slytherin OC fics, which have them as Marauders-esque bullies.

** I agree with the other commenters that for the most part the Weasley twins are rarely bashed. The only time I see them being bashed is if the entire weasley family is "involved". But if the story is only bashing some of the weasleys then the twins are usually not included.

From all the stories I've read I've rarely seen Charlie bashed, I will occasionally see Bill bashed but those are mainly Harry/Fleur stories (where either Bill had been with Fleur or wanted to be with Fleur) or in some of the Harry/Hermione stories where Ginny is being Bashed and Bill supports Ginny.

Many stories I've read don't always include Percy but if they do he is almost always bashed for his ministry support. There have been a couple stories I've read that Percy breaks with the rest of the Weasley family and clings to the Ministry to either protect them, protect penny and/or to even spy against the Ministry.

Unless the story is pushed as an evil!Arthur story he is almost never bashed. Every other Weasley might be bashed in the story but not arthur. The story The Real Us by Seel'vor linkffn(4605681) is an example of this.

Now Ron, Molly, and Ginny are bashed to some level (eg very mild highlighting of some of their worst traits. To extreme where they are evil plotters) in roughly half the stories I've read. Now that's mainly because i'm pretty much an anyone but Ginny shipper (in a one on one relationship, but don't have much of a problem with her in a multi-wife (eg. Black and Potter wives needed) up to the full blown Harem stories).

And that's probably because I was taken by surprise when the later books created that relationship where the earlier books IMO had no hint of it. It probably also didn't help that IRL I was always very good friends with all the women I dated before it turned romantic and remained very good friends when the romance ended. Which made it easier for me to see/relate to a Harry/Hermione ship.

In the stories that either bashed Molly, Ginny, and Ron individually or in various combinations, the twins were almost always on Harry's side. Part of that was probably due to canon making them the successors to the Marauders. Which is probably why most fanfic authors don't bash them. Because most fics (again that I have read) have the Marauders supporting Harry so obviously their successors (the twins) would as well.

** It's mostly just with the fact that they like the characters I think. Also that it wouldn't be in character for them to allow such bigoted thoughts that their family is having. I can't really explain it well since I just do it too. It's also common for them to be corresponding with Bill and Charlie as they are also part of the non-bashing side of the Weasley's. Arthur is more than often just kind of seemingly manipulated most of the time since the man is too kind.

** I see the Weasley twins bashed in fics that focus on Indy!Ron or Pro Percy fics. As mentioned, any fic with a Weasley protagonist that needs an adversary will find a reasonably decent one in the twins for the flimsiest reasons. They did bully their brothers as children, but it's usually taken to cartoonish heights in these type of stories

Examples:

Linkffn(Ares by persephonella) Linkffn(Percy take the Wheel) Linkffn(Fate)

** Just like other comments mentioned Fred and George are well liked and wouldn't follow a bigoted leader they would most likely to go against the leader (Voldemort for example)

There's also that Harry has a pretty good relationship with the twins. Them being cruel to Harry would be so out of character.
