** Just gonna critique the first few paragraphs... not sure if this is going to help you in any way.

#+begin_quote
  He had everything he wanted and he could get anything he wanted.
#+end_quote

Why? Are you telling me the Malfoys didn't have to pay reparations? They should be destitute...

#+begin_quote
  once he had let hundreds of death eaters in the school
#+end_quote

Hundreds? I think you're off by at least an order of magnitude.

#+begin_quote
  figured that he deserved another chance for multiple reasons. He wasn't the one who killed Dumbledore, yes, he was supposed to, but he didn't
#+end_quote

Did you forget about Katie Bell here? Cursing a fellow student with a potentially deadly curse should be enough for expulsion from any school. Not to mention imperiusing Rosmerta. Oh and then almost killing Ron with poisoned mead too. And even if Hogwarts policy allowed him to go back: What about legal repercussions?! At least 3 times of attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, aggravated assault, casting an Unforgivable, possession and distribution of Dark Artefacts, I don't even know which laws apply for letting terrorists in a school full of innocent children. He's clearly a public menace... even if he avoids prison somehow there's no way he'd be allowed around children! It's like sending a known child rapists to summer camp as a counsellor!

#+begin_quote
  Also, per Draco's mother, he was far too young to make the decision himself.
#+end_quote

Why is Narcissa Mafloys opinion important? Isn't she one of those people who aided and abetted known terrorists in a plot to overthrow the government?

#+begin_quote
  put all that aside, he was happy.
#+end_quote

"He's not really happy, but I want him to be happy anyway". What does he have to be happy about? Everything is in shambles! Shouldn't he be depressed?

This is where I'd stop reading. To give you some credit, at least you're trying to give an explanation why Draco would be back at Hogwarts (which is already better than most authors in this genre, who don't even bother), but you didn't sell your premise to me at all. I can't read a fic where nothing in the first few paragraphs makes any sense to me.

** Hey-- thanks for the honesty, legit! :) I'm planning on writing a new fic that is wayy more realistic (but also features Draco) so I'm so happy you pointed all of this out! Going to use all of these tips.

The first three chapters were made when I was 15 and had no idea what I was talking about ðŸ˜‚, then the following chapters after the 3rd are all made after I haven't read the books in years so there's still tons of errors I'm sure. Definitely not canon! Mostly-- it's about the flurry of emotional anguish one feels when they're in love with someone they shouldn't be.

But again- thank you for taking the time to critique me! Seriously wishing I had posted here before I rebooted the fic so that I could have used the critiques earlier on haha. :)
