Like the title said what are some good stories with Harry x Cho as the main pairing?

I'm not really picky about the type of story but please no pointless drama and angst.

Thx in advance


** Harry x Cho is such an OotP pairing. Which means around 2003-2006... that's old, even for me. After that it was mostly Harry x Hermione or Harry x Ginny, due to HBP. But I have a few:

linkffn(7471751) - Werewolf Harry (probably the best one), that was unfortunately never finished.

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/][Betrayal of the Best Kind by Draco664]] - one of the oldies and dated... but perhaps it could interest you.

#+begin_quote
  Harry gets bitten by Lupin in third year. Now he questions himself and his life and struggles against his inner wolf. It's Harry finding support from both Cho and Ginny, questioning if anything good can happen for him. Fighting for the truth, himself, and those dearest to him, Harry wants to see Cho and Ginny safe. Werewolf's life is never simple.

** I know it is just a one-shot, but I really liked linkao3(The Stag and the Swan by White_Squirrel), it is really a better replacement of the equivalent text in the canon.
