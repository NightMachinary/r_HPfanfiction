I'm hoping to read a fic that deals with Harry starting/running an orphanage or a group home or a safe place for students between semesters. I'd love if it also included Drarry but that's not a must. Any length.


** In “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124) sponsors an orphanage. It was the fist fanfiction story, which persuaded me, that it is possible for amateur story to be worth reading.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** There's Witches of Westfield, which is the only one I know that hasn't been recc'ed already. Not sure if I'd actually recommend it on quality, this is purely on it meeting your request. It does feel very much like a character-driven romance-focused TV show from the 90s though, so if you like that vibe you'll probably like this.

  The war is over, Voldemort was defeated and the summer draws to a close as the new school term begins. Harry must decide what to do with his life. Will he return to school for his 7th year, be an Auror...or something else? Read along as Harry finally has control of his own life...or does he?

** There are a couple fics where Harry is involved with starting an orphanage that have Daphne Greengrass as his love interest: "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13498575/1/Potter-and-Prejudice][Potter and Prejudice]]" (complete) and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]]" (in progress). Both involve a wealthy attempting to rebuild the wizarding world. I prefer Novocaine, though I like them both.

  The basic story of Pride & Prejudice - set in the world of Harry Potter. Apparently this has been tried before (I started writing this over a year ago, and only just did a search and saw several others have attempted it in their own ways). Non epilogue compliant. Set post HPaDH. Ignores the Cursed Child. Meant for fun.

** Harry created and runs an orphanage in this fic. It doesn't focus on that too much though, it's more about Draco and regaginging his confidence. It's a drarry fic, and it's super sweet. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23949319/chapters/57597424][Of Labcoats and Animagi]]

  Have you been missing a time travel Tomarry where Harry and Tom are on somewhat equal footing? Where Tom is a plausible budding political leader? Where Harry can stand up to him and their relationship doesn't seem toxic? Where the surrounding events and characters don't go unnoticed? I have, so I gave writing one a try.“The war is over and the Wizarding Britain has been slowly rising from the ashes. Harry just wishes none of it ever happened -- what will he do when he's given a chance to change the past? Was Dumbledore right about “the power he knows not” after all?“
