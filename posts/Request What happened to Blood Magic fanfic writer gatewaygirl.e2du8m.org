It has to be the best Harry Potter fanfic I've read - but the writer seems to have disappeared after 2011. Did they become a famous writer outside of fandom? If so, who are they and where can I find their work?

If anyone hasn't read/wants to check out Blood Magic - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603]]


** They last posted a chapter of another story in July 2019. So still active, just barely.
