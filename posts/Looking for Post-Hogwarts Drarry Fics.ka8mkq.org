hello! i'm fairly new to drarry but i'm really craving a good fic with a few things: -post hogwarts, like when they're slight older -40k+ -completed works only -i would really love some good angst and well written pain -would prefer E or M

thanks everyone!


** Absolutely not a fan of that pairing, but this story was so amazing that I enjoyed it a ton from start to finish:
