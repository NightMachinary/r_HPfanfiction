It may be a Seer!Ron setup in the beginning but it is so much more than that. After a long time of being extremely bored with fanfiction in general this story was able to pull me in since it is actually a mystery with life-changing truths every five chapters or so. Believe me, every thing you think you know by chapter 5 or even chapter 10 is WRONG. I wouldn't be surprised if all I think I know now also ends up being just plain wrong too.

One thing that may annoy people is the author's aversion to timeskips but honestly I understand and agree with his reasoning. Timeskips often imply that everything continues within a set routine for that time period but that is almost never the case in this story. Ron is always doing something or some important thing is happening that needs to be addressed.

Also characters can be fairly annoying and frustrating but don't think it isn't on purpose. Everybody gets shat on for the things they do (Including Ron) and everybody changes, not always immediately for the better either.

I wish I could say more about the plot but it quite heavily relies on mystery and is also mostly character-driven. It's the Game of Thrones of HPFanfiction really.

Hope it doesn't end up disappointing after I hyped it so much ;)


** I agree, it is seriously well written, but I really don't like two things: generally I dislike people with too much superpowers in HP fanfiction. Aside from magic itself, HP books are distinctively pedestrian (certainly middle-class, no Lord Potter!) and I would say even rationalistic. Magic is more like yet-undiscovered part of science than something so cosmic and overwhelming as The Entity here. Also, one of the main moral messages of HP books for me was the freedom of choice, “It is our choices which decide who we are”, and The Entity seems like taking all freedom from Ron. I hope that it will turn to be just side-effect of the brain damage, but I will probably loose on this one.

*** I would instead say there were always two sides to Harry Potter magic. One was the rational side that Hermione or Tom Riddle mastered but there was always that supernatural side like the power of love and the deathly hallows that only Dumbledore and maybe Grindelwald seemed to begin to grasp. Tom knew a lot about magic and how it should work but his rationalist mind could not even fathom how more powerful things could exist when they really shouldn't.

Of course this fic takes it a step above even that but we can be at least sure that the story won't be taken over by the cosmic scale things. That's what the author promises anyway and he seems to be keeping his promises so far.

SPOILERS BELOW THIS(ON MOBILE)

Also I don't think the story means to say that there is no freedom but that Ron is tormented by the question of if he has any freedom at all. If you're caught up then the latest chapters seem to be all about Ron peeling back the chains that bound him and finally feeling somewhat free.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no one is perfect.
