There's plenty of gems found outside FF.net but I'm not sure which stories are worth the time. There might even be some that are on FF.net but are continued elsewhere. I vaguely remember one on DLP like that.

I'd like any complete or actively updating fics but I have a weakness for time travel/fix it fics as well as Lord Potter/Black/etc fics so I'd really like those the most. Any good crack fics would be nice too.

I'd also like longer reads but if its really good shorter ones are fine too.


** Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived: retelling of the HP story in a AU where magic doesn't exist and Hogwarts is an elite spy school. [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]]

I haven't read the James Potter series but I've seen it recommended. JKR had to deny that she wrote it, apparently, because journalists were jumping to conclusions- I guess that's a sign of good writing? [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/muggle_index.html]]

*** And of course with the latter if you change “muggle” to “wizard” you get animated intro and stuff. I'd tried it now out of curiosity (yes, because of the word “muggle” in the link) and I have to say I find it adorable.

*** HG & BWL is an excellent fic, one of my top 5 favorites. I like how the author translated HP world into a non magical, sci-fi setting. Dumbledore was especially well characterized.

/Wake the Dead/

It's story about a /muthafuckin'/ zombies.

Short summary. Big V does some Voodoo and the dead start walking in Hogwarts. Hogwarts goes to a lockdown. Now the students inside need to survive the ZOMBIE *APOCALYPSE*! IRC Also the zombies were quite magic resistant.

*** I liked this one, even though it turned out be a more of a popcorn muncher rather than a serious dark fic the opening chapter made it out to be.

*** Sounds awesome but is there an index to the chapters because having to go through every post would get tedious. And are you sure its complete?

** Idk about best, but two of my favorites series are not found in ff.net

The first is [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/][The Paradigm of Uncertainty]] by Lori. It's among the earliest fics written (I think the first fic in the series was started just after the PoA book came out). It features mage!Harry (this series probably birthed the powerful Harry cliche...)and adult Harry/Hermione. It takes place nine years after Hogwarts and the characters are wholly adult, doing adult things. Voldemort is gone; a new villain is fucking up everything.

I read this every 3-4 years, when fanfiction cliches threaten to choke me up; since it came out so early, the author was pretty creative, for a fanfiction writer.

The second is the [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/horst_pollmann/][Harry Potter and the Flying Squad series]], by Horst Pollman.

It's a post GoF AU (actually probably published before the OttP book) featuring six stories, totalling over one million words.

The main pairing Harry/Cho and it chronicles Harry's life in his 5th, 6th and 7th years and post-hogwarts.

This thing is pretty strangely written - the author is either pretty old, or not a native english speaker. His dialogue and descriptions are not like anything I've ever read. That doesn't mean it's great - I've reccomended the series to a few people - some loved it, some hated it. I personally love it.

If you do take a stab at reading this and you find the 5th year fic boring and/or bad, well, I don't blame you. I think the first fic in the series is the weakest. I believe the series gets much better in the 6th year story - so try that if you want to give it a second shot.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

  History of Magic has something to teach after all, and two resourceful students decide that the key to having any future at all lies in the past, and in Tom Riddle's heart. Assuming he has one.

** If you like Lord Potter, try [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/][Keira Marcos' stuff]]. (her own site, login required)

She has one very long Hogwarts-era (Soulmate Bond), and several post-Hogwarts. One of which is time-travel/do-over (though also slash): the War Mages trilogy (but only one posted so far). Moody's reaction to their "new" dueling prowess is priceless.

I also recommend [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewuser.php?uid=330][Vorabiza]]. Though I think they're all slash, if that's a concern.
