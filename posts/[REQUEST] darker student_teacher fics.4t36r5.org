Yeah.... I know.

I'm fine with any pairing, het, slash, whatever. I'm looking for something preferably a little darker, but don't have any specifications on rating/warnings/whatever. Although more explicit things are certainly welcomed, ahem ahem.

I've been reading linkffn(Aphotic Sage) which is very much student/teacher but it's not especially dark. One of the draws of the whole student/teacher thing for me is /because/ it's intrinsically a messed up power situation, so I'm looking for a fic that will at the very least acknowledge it, if not heavily emphasize it. But I'm not picky.

I've read probably almost all of the SS/HG fics out there, but I always like rereading things so any recs there are greatly appreciated.


** If you are looking for dark/student teacher and on the off chance you haven't read it - I cannot recommend "Self slain Gods on strange altars" by Sumblackentropy highly enough.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

** Well, one of my favorite and most often recced Snape/Harry fics is exactly this, complete with dub con, drugging, Stockholm Syndrome, and general assholish behavior on Snape's part:

****** You read fast! And yeah, it's a specific flavor of Snape/Harry, definitely not the most popular in fandom.

What's an example of your favorite Snape/Harry? I'm always looking for fic I haven't read. And it might give me an idea of something more along the lines of your taste.

******* Oh you are in for a treat. My hands down favorite Snape/Harry fic is linkao3(The Boy Who Died A Lot).

It's pretty slow, but damn if it isn't my favorite characterization of both characters, pretty much ever.

If you're interested in Snape-is-Harry's-father (and isn't it kind of awks to be discussing both in the same post? oops), then linkffn(In Blood Only) jiggles my whiskers like none other.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

  Hermione respected all of her professors. But none more so than the ill-reputed, possible sadist, suspected Death Eater, Professor Dolohov. Antonin never paid special attention to any of his students. But somehow managed to develop an unwelcome, not-so-platonic, highly inappropriate fixation on one Miss Granger. AD/HG Student/Teacher AU
