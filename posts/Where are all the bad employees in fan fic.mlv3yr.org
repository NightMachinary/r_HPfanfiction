Everyone in fan fic is always portrayed as pasionate about something, Ron is a chess god, Harry loves DADA or smt, Bill is obsessed with cursebreaking, the Twins with pranks, Charlie with dragons etc. It is either they love the job or they are willingly bad at it, where are all of the bored employees who dont give a shit? Like there is no way everyone gets to do what they want in the wizarding world, where are the poor dudes stuck in dead end jobs at?


** I think that magic probably eliminates most menial tasks, so businesses hire fewer employees, so they tend to only hire people who enjoy the job. And with the menial bits taken out, the jobs are more enjoyable anyway.

I'm sure there are still people stuck in jobs that they hate, but they're probably mostly in places like the Ministry, because bureaucracy can always use a few more bored cogs.

And there's always Snape.

There was a study I saw once that estimated that up to 40% of corporate jobs are "bullshit jobs," to use its own term - jobs where no meaningful work is done and the job could be eliminated entirely, automated away, or have its little work distributed among a smaller number of employees. There are some fringe benefits, but mostly those jobs aren't eliminated simply because they're not fiscally painful enough to bother with.

I'm fairly certain that the magical world doesn't have the population to support those kind of jobs, nor the culture to tolerate them.

** Tom Riddle worked at Borgin & Burkes for over a decade.

#+begin_quote
  “You won't break the curse on that necklace, and I doubt you---or whoever you would give it to, if it's not for yourself---is interested in regrowing their teeth any time soon,” Riddle recited in a bored tone, as if he didn't seem to really care about whether the recipient would be dissatisfied. Clerking for Borgin & Burkes must inure someone to the curse accidents; Severus wondered how that impacted customer satisfaction. Slug & Jiggers required a much more proactive effort at accident prevention from its employees.

I've always wanted to expand specifically Tom's time as a clerk into a long one-shot or even a short multi-chaptered fic, but, yeah. That guy was absolutely bored out of his wits.

** Stan Shunpike, who lied to make himself more exciting and ended up in jail.

Abberforth, who is in a dead-end job in the service industry and hates his life. (Tom and Madam Rosmerta are in similar situations, but they seem to at least have good public faces, and either enjoy or pretend to enjoy their work.)

Hagrid is a full-grown wizard who should be allowed to use magic - and yet for some reason he is not. Other wizards who are expelled are allowed to buy new wands once they turn seventeen and get on with their lives. Instead, Hagrid is condemned to live in a one-room hut, doing menial labour, until finally his name is cleared in Harry's second year. That was /decades/. Even after that, his lot doesn't change that much. He's almost pathetically grateful, too, which indicates that he has very few options.

Arthur Weasley loves what he does but he's in a dead-end job, almost literally. His office doesn't even have windows. At one point he receives a very minor promotion and his and Molly's excitement is off the charts.

Percy spends several years doing nonsense busywork that he did not enjoy just to get to a position he wanted.

Snape is working a dead end job, in that there is no room for advancement. He hates his work.

Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade are full of shops, which means they are full of /shop keepers/. I guarantee those people are not universally enthusiastic about their trade. There will be more Abberforths than Arthurs, because that's how it is in the muggle world and humans are humans.

*** Hagrid is a half-giant and we all know how the wizarding world in general feels about half-humans.

For all we know, he might not have been allowed a new wand due to his inheritage and no one other than Dumbledore would bother hiring him.

I believe he is not allowed to own a wand because, despite being proved as innocent in the death of Moaning Myrtle, Hagrid was still expelled from Hogwarts. Heir of Slytherin or not, bringing a class XXXXX creature (aka "known wizard killer") into a school full of children is totally expulsion worthy.

***** Newt was expelled for the exact same reason and he did have his wand. The only difference is that Newt is either pure or halfblood while Hagrid is half human. So I am pretty sure there is some discrimination going on.

****** I always thought the difference was due to their age. The way I understood it, OWLs are needed to be considered a full fledged wizard and be able to leave school (at least with his wand intact).

Hagrid was expelled during his 3rd year which means that they broke his wand, while Newt was expelled after he got his OWLs (somewhere during 6th or 7th year), so they let him keep his own.

Though we do know that discrimination against Half Humans does exist in the magical world, no matter if it played a role in Hagrid's wand destruction or not.

Technically none of the offices in the Ministry have windows, considering the whole building is deep underground.

Snape is a Hogwarts professor and Head of House. He has tenure. It's a dead end job only in so far as he peaked when he was 25.

*** Everything I've seen has indicated, and I've never seen anyone who seems to think otherwise, that Aberforth, Madame Rosmerta, and Tom all own their own establishments. Those are hardly what I would call dead end jobs. To some people, that's their greatest dream.

** The Wizarding World doesn't seem to have retail and customer service to the degree as the real/Muggle world. They have shops rather than stores and taverns/bars instead of restaurants. Most of the soul crushing, mind-erasing jobs don't exist and customers are probably less shitty to employees that are armed with potentially lethal weapons.
