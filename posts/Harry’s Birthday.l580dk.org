Harry's birthday has always been agreed on right? (July 31, 1980). Or is it? There is one character who disagrees with his birthday? And that character is non other than... Professor Trelawny. She says that he is born in mid-winter which is completely wrong. Or is it? You see Harry has VOLDERMORT'S soul inside him. And Voldy was born on December 31, 1926. December 31'st is pretty much mid-winter. Did Trelawny see this. Or was it just a bad guess?


** I think she did sense the horcrux in some capacity. She says a few things, outside the prophecies, that suggests that she's not a whole fraud, just mostly one. About 95%.

*** I always loved the little nugget JKR gave us. Trelawny says she's descended from the great Cassandra Trelawny.

Cassandra is the Seer is greek myth who's prophecies were never believed until they came to pass. The foresaw the Trojan horse but was ignored and cast aside.

Crash course. She prayed to Apollo, wanted to become a priestess and promised anything in return. She meant gold or shit like that. Apollo wanted sex. She refused. Apollo cursed her so that her prophecies would always be horrible and entirely correct but no matter what nobody would believe her.

To summarise: Apollo's a dick who can't handle rejection and so, in a fashion that shows his immaturity amazingly well, he curses this poor girl with horrible visions of\\
a future she couldn't stop just because she didn't want to fuck him. Prick.

**** Funny thing is, that summary can apply to basically all the Greek Gods to greater or lesser degrees.

***** My view on Greek gods has always been that they're basically a bunch of immature teenagers with way too much power for their own good.

**** Won't surprise me if that's the case with Sybil. I mean she did see Sirius in the cup.

** I agree with [[/u/cest_la_via/]] ... there is a serious parallel between Cassandra the Troyan and Professor Trelawny. See [[https://youtu.be/MRBimjs_t_U]] . Could she be truly and really cursed? Who would do the cursing? Voldemort's involvement seems like a good candidate, to hamper intelligence collecting capacity of the Order of Phoenix, but some good serious story begs to be created.
