  Harry Potter fulfilled his destiny, but it cost everything he held dear to him. As Death's Champion he's being asked to do it all over again, and this time he'll get the chance to have the family he always wanted. Will Harry once again emerge victorious or will his friends and family pay the price for his failure? Alive James/Lily. Super Harry vs Super Voldemort. Harry/Daphne/OFC.

** Just had a thought we're the reason Gellert was locked up instead of killed is because he was actually polyjuicing as Dumbledore who was locked up instead but no one knew.

  Wrong BWL. FEM Potter. James and Lily Potter has given birth to twins. On that Halloween night, they mistake the real prophecy child, leading to years of abandonment; which ends up being the biggest mistake the light side have ever made. There will be crossovers with many different worlds. Dark FEM Potter. Powerful & Genius FEM Potter. MOD Potter. Warning: Very Extreme M rated.
