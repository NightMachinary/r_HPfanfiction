I'm looking for short stories involving Draco, he can probably be paired with anyone. I'm a fan of HP/DM and I have just recently become fascinated with HG/DM. I'd prefer that he be redeemed/a good guy, but a good story is a good story. If you have any really good fics that are at hogwarts, or longer fics that you really like - I'm open to hear those recommendations too.


** Define "short" Lol. I don't think we're all agreed on what that means.

On the longer side of short probably, 80k or so, there's linkffn(charms can't fix us by Cordelia McGonagall)

That's probably way longer than you're looking for, though.

  The war is over and Hogwarts still stands. A few "eighth years" choose to come back to finish their schooling in peace, to mentor war-weary children, and to patch together the ends of their teenage years. Hermione learns what she was missing while out with Harry and Ron, Neville flexes his newfound confidence, Parvati brews a perfect Amortentia, and Draco lets go. "M" to be safe.

*** I'd consider short to be anything I could read in a couple days at a leisurely pace. I mostly just want something to pepper in between longer fics when I need a break. Though, really any story that is good is a welcome read for me.

**** I think you'll probably like this one. It's got after-war healing, emotions, DM/HG, drama, and the individual chapters are shortish.

** Ooh, anything by [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet]] (she has some complete Draco/Luna, Draco/Astoria, and primarily postwar). She and I run a ficlet tumblr that has [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/tagged/draco%20malfoy][quite a bit]] of Draco content. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=74360][Elysium]] has a lot of HG/DM oneshots (popular back in the day, I like her humor ones as those are the only HG/DMs I read). [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][The Satellite Heart]] is a HP/DM I rec all the time, half-AU and half not and a great post-war character fic. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325457][Traitorous Hearts]] is a Draco/Astoria on my to-read that has been rec'd constantly to me.

*** Thank you! I actually have you to thank for me reading Satellite Heart(you recommended it to me on my last post) and it is what inspired me to look for something similar in this post!
