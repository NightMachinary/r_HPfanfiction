Someone recommended Ouroboros by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/BrilliantLady/pseuds/BrilliantLady][BrilliantLady]] on my bodyswap post and as I'm reading it, it got me wanted to read more stories where someone helps Harry out when he is younger. In this one he swaps bodies with Voldemort who is possessing snakes. Voldemort starts helping him out, first by scaring his relatives into feeding him more but then with answering his questions and getting him book about magic and I really want more stories like that.

I said evil or dark (death eaters would be awesome) because I love the idea of Harry befriending a bad guy and being taught things from a perspective that isn't Dumbledore's or the light side. (I really like that it's Voldemort who should be enjoying his enemy suffering but instead is angry that an other magical child is being mistreated.) the help doesn't have to come from someone bad it could be someone neutral or even someone like Bill or Charlie who aren't as involved with light politics (Dumbledore) as their parents.

I love a Harry who becomes smart, independent, a leader who actually leads, as well as Gray or Dark. As for pairings in the adults I favor slash or Gen, for Harry I prefer slash but please nothing before he is a teen unless it's a cute crush.


** In Blood Crest by Cauchy Harry becomes an OC necromancer's apprentice. linkao3(22022296)

Hit the Ground Running was a really popular fic about scar Voldemort befriending Harry. Unfortunately the author got a lot of bad attention from the fic and deleted it from all of the fanfiction websites, although pdfs and such can still be found floating around.

You also may or may not be interested in Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus by Carnivorous Muffin. It also stars scar Horcrux Voldemort except Harry is female, functionally immortal, acts closer to canon Luna Lovegood than canon Harry Potter and calls Voldemort Wizard Lenin. linkao3(15675621)

That being said if you like BrilliantLady you've probably already read her Perfectly Normal series. Despite the story premise it dives quite deeply into Pureblood Wizarding Culture and features a very Grey Harry.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
