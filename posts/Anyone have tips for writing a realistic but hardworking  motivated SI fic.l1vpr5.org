** It doesn't matter how good at magic the main character is, what matters is how it's shown. How 'realistic' it is for an OC to be talented is less important than how that talent is showcased in the fic. Learning magical theory, using magic in interesting ways, etc, are much more interesting to read than simply stating how talented they are through grades, etc.

** u/Vampire-Lawyer:
#+begin_quote
  magical Gringotts that solves every issue even though they're only a bank, super powered Room of Requirement (sidenote: why the heck would there be a ton of magical money and gems there? Lots of people have been there and have probably thought about making a quick buck), misogyny in every conversation with literally any female, being outright antagonistic towards anyone that slightly opposes you.

I enjoy SI fanfics for pretty much any fandom. But hotdamn if you didn't hit the nail it on the head. A lot of HP SIs sure act the same.

#+begin_quote
  committing crimes/finding loopholes with ease because the SI is just sooo smart and every other wizard is dumb because a 12 year old said they lack common sense, and the armchair philosophy about how the levitation charm can kill you just as easily as the Killing Curse
#+end_quote

Especially this.

I'd add "i'll master occlumency on my own asap" as something overdone. Weasley twins being lectured on immaturity is something I see fairly often (even when the SI is years younger). The SI lecturing canon characters in general with no pushback is pretty dumb imo.

Good luck with your fic.

** Well actually, you might want to use that last bit. Not in the sense that they go around stating all this shit. But realistically if you want to make them like Flitwick at a young age, you need creativity. They should be doing things they learn at their age but creatively and at a higher level.

Change Matchsticks to Needles.

The needles would have patterns and they could experiment with the size and shape of the needles. The needle used for hair is different from a knitting needle. Different kinds of materials for the needles etc. Silver or plastic?

Show them experimenting and practicing. Have scenes where they can /use/ this or show it off. But do it without shoving in our faces how amazing they are.

Make it seem like they have to struggle for everything but don't make it a drag.

If you want a beta reader for your fic...depending on how the characters are written and ship....

I could do it. Not in the grammar sense but in the /writing/ aspect.

But I'm not going to read something I don't enjoy so please pm a synopsis and anything I know if you want my help.

** One of the main points I've picked up is that practice, knowledge and desire are the triad needed to have power over a spell and eventually over magic in general.

All of the DA become 'exceptional', through sheer practice and need.

Harry isn't a huge scholar, he just uses a few spells very well and picks them up quickly, by trying again and again and again until it sticks.

Non-verbal magic also seems to be about sheer practice.

So, for your SI, magic /should/ be complicated (adults have trouble going over their kids' maths homework because they've forgotten it, and have no idea what a 'fronted adverbial' is and why would they, and don't 'get' computer programming when dedicated kids manage a good start). However, an adult has different priorities to a child and might well be able to buckle down for a long term goal. An adult that has studied /as/ an adult has a leg up.
