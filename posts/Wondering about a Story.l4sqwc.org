I was wondering if Seel'vor was going to finish Harry Potter and the Quantum Leap. I really like this story, but it was last updated in 2010. Any chance they are going to be coming back to finish it? Or has it just been abandoned?


** It's been 10 years. If a google search doesn't have their stories popping up on another site then it's abandoned. Sad but there it is.
