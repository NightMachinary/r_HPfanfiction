***** What do you mean it was updated on the 11th? The last update was in 2017. I mean I'm reading it on ff.net, is it on a different platform that was recently updated?

*** Quality writing, but the plot... the plot has not only ran away from the author, it has created a new country and presides over it.

There is just a ton of shit that is going on with that story. Apart from the Harry/Sirius/Voldemort angle, you have time travel, you have the Fae, the Unspeakables, the various ministry going ons, the magical/muggle mafia, plus the Order and Dumbledore. It's a huge clusterfuck, you need a schematic of plot threads to make sense of that story.

That said, I love it.

**** Yeah, it kept getting recommended to me and I kept putting it off. The start was slow and the story is an old one that reflects old tropes and writing style. While I definitely do enjoy the newer styles more, I did finally read-through and enjoy the fic.
