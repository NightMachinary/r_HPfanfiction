  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

But I don't think anyone would care (or probably even notice) if she was either made a few years younger or her marriage and Death Eater joining dates were pushed back a few years to give the time travelers room to appear after Tonks's birth but before it's too late for Bellatrix.

Maybe some "light supporters" against werewolves ended up killing or maiming him because of Remus and that's what pushes Harry into agreeing.

** When Andromeda Tonks asked Harry over to her house, he was expecting them to talk about how Teddy was doing, or maybe have a bit of a cry over their dead loved ones. Not...not the insanity she was spouting.

He decided that the polite thing to do was let her finish talking. When she did, and was looking at him expectantly--eyes alight with an uncomfortable amount of mania--he said. "Mrs. Tonks--"

"Please, Harry, you can call me Andy."

"Right, Andy," he pursed his lips, "I'm sorry, but...have you lost it?"

Her lips dipped into a scowl, "I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about."

The Boy-Who-Lived-Twice-Over scoffed, "You...You and Mrs. Malfoy--who I had no idea you on speaking terms with, by the way--want me to travel back in time to...to...snog Bellatrix Lestrange?"

"She's still be a Black at that point in time."

"That's /not/ the issue here."

"Oh, honestly Harry," she sniffed, face morphing into a neutral expression, "it's simple! The Ministry's still in shambles. Cissy--through Lucius--has found out about a number of time-related projects the Unspeakables were working on in the Department of Mysteries. We'll just sneak in and use one on us to send us all back to before V-Voldemort rose to power. It just so happens that Bella was engaged to Rodolphus around that time and, really, the problems just present and fix themselves."

"So," Harry laughed, pinching the bridge of his nose, "that's it then? Just throw us through time like a bunch of quaffles?"

"Better than being batted like bludgers."

Harry grit his teeth, "This isn't a joke, Andy."

"I agree."

"No, you don't! Because you're actually entertaining this...insanity!" A scowl returned to her lips, "You think that our dead loved ones would want this? You think that would want us to spit in the face of their sacrifices? That Remus and Tonks would risk--"

"What about what I want?!" she wailed. Harry stilled, eyes widening as she started to cry, "My husband ran away and died like a dog! My baby girl went off to die in battle after giving birth to her son! Did I get a say in any of that? No! But now I have a choice--/we/ have a choice!" She started sobbing, then, dropping her head in her hands, tears running down her face and onto the floor.

Harry licked his lips--he honestly had /no/ idea how to act when girls cried, even now. But he was told he had good instincts, so he got up from his seat and moved closer to Andy. He hesitated a touch, before wrapping an arm around her shuddering form. "I...I get it, Andy. I do. I...there's /so/ many people that...that died that I want back. But that's just it. They /died/, and they're not coming back." She moaned, burying her head deeper in her hands. "And we don't have to like--we can even hate it--but we have to understand it. And understand that they all died for something."

"For what?!" she hissed.

"The future. For Edward," Andromeda stilled. "I can't speak for Tonks, but I know that Remus wanted his son to live knowing that his father died for what was right. How can we take that away from him?"

Andy just sobbed louder, clutching onto Harry like a lifeline. He gently rubbed her back, letting her shed her tears.

When she stopped, she pulled back, drawing a shaky breath, "I'm...I'm sorry you had to see me like that."

"It's fine," Harry said with a soft smile, "you've been through a lot, and believe me, it's not good to keep everything bottled inside." He drew her into a hug, "I know it's hard, but we can't go searching for miracles."

"Yes," she tightened the embrace, "yes...I suppose you're right." She drew away from the hug, a sad smile on her face, "I'll...I'll talk to Cissy, put this whole thing out of our minds."

Harry nodded, "Good. Teddy's asleep in his crib, right." At Andy's nod, he rose to his feet, "C'mon then, let's just...be together for a bit." She sent him a watery smile, standing up and leading the way.
