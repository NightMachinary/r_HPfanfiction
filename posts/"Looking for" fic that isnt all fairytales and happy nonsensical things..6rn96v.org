An odd Topic, Ill admit. But lately Im so sick of all the crap im reading, I actually have a long fuse, very long, but then completely at random I find a fic I havent read, that has more then 4000 favs and follows, and it literally has deus ex bullshit with peoples magic intermingle with people that has the same level of magic potential, and this makes them super attracted to each other, and its all happy three/more somes after that of course, and for some reason Harry is the only male that has that amount of Magic, so everyone that reacts to him and his girls are female.

And thats truly just one of the many crap fics that floating around that people actually like for some reason. Anyway rant over, Im looking for something thats not necessarily realistic - they have magic, it shouldnt be realistic- but something that dosnt completely ignore their own plot in order to force their dream ending, for example, if Harry can be forcibly bonded and lose his Magic to a Goblet, why cant they do the same with Voldemort? he went to school there, there should be tons of paper left with his name on, and he cant compete obviously. Something that isnt all forcibly happy, like there can be bad people, every bad person dosnt have to have a sob story behind them that totally explain why they did what they did and why it makes it okay, I would much prefer if there was actual bad guys, and not misunderstood teens with issues.

I guess its obvious now that Im worthless and writing even a thread, I guess its because I dont really know what im looking for, ive spent days looking for something engaging to read, but simply cant find it, I guess bottom line, something gritty, or humorous like 'In the Mind of a Scientist By: ZenoNoKyuubi'

Again, sorry for rambling like a lunatic, im just not sure how to describe what it is im looking for.


** linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky)

By the same author, linkffn(In Which the Princess Rescues the Dragon by Vera Rozalsky) I really like this one because Andromeda Tonks is a rare perspective in fic. Sort of a side story to Amends. They both pick up where the final battle left off, and things slowly fall apart.

linkffn(The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville) Deconstruction of the Epilogue's "All was well".

linkffn(Playmate by Yunaine) A very different take on the Veela-bonding trope.

** linkao3(in loco parentis by dolores crane) is a very dark and gritty fanfic. The main character is Hermione. The fic discusses societal aspects of the Wizarding World. There is an overarching plot to defeat Voldemort but that doesn't seem to be the main point of the story. I have not read anything like this, and it's not very predictable.

We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties.

** If you really want something the opposite of happy unicorns dancing across sun-drenched meadows, check out Harry Potter/Lord Voldemort fics. There are plenty of craptacular misunderstood teen angst stories in this pairing, but when done right this pairing is all about the horror.

"in death we seek devotion" by flat_teeth takes excellent advantage of the soul mate trope. Basically, Harry is Tom's soul mate and keeps getting reincarnated because Tom keeps killing him every time he reincarnates. If slash isn't your thing, know that there is absolutely zero romance in this and no graphic sex that I can recall.

*** Thanks, Ill check the second one out, Im completely creeped out about slash sadly enough, cause theres a true crap ton of slash stories in Harry Potter fanfics.

on your first stories topic though, I wish there was a story where Harry is Dark, but where the author understands that being Dark dosnt mean you have to automatically start liking Draco as a friend, or sympathize with the current Dark Lord, like being 'Dark' automatically makes you the exact copy of already existing Dark people. Side Topic, I really dislike how people use Light, Gray, and Dark, to express peoples leanings, but since thats the way it is, if I dont speak the same way, some might misunderstand me.

I actually like dark!Gryffindor!Harry a lot better than dark!Slytherin!Harry, especially when his old DA friends joined his new cause. It would be the ultimate insult to Dumbledore's ineffective and failed leadership, who turned to sacrificing children in desperation. I love to see Harry's generation tearing down the Old Order, rebuilding the society to their liking, and making their enemies PAY.

That was why l like "The Sum of Their Parts" so much. If the author managed to come up with a sequel of similar quality, this story series would become by far my top favorite.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

***** I tried the first fic on your list, Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, well its top of the Fanfiction bot list. I was abit hesitant because Ginny was apparently going to be a main character, never really liked her much, but its fanfiction, so its allowed to change characters, so for all I know she might be very OOC, the other thing that gave me pause was the Harem, I dont necessarily dislike harem, but I have truly never read a Harem story that had pulled it of, the only story I personally think came close was a story Noodlehammer made about Naruto, and that story isnt really a Harem fic to being with.

But I thought what the crap lets try it! Im bored after all. And I actually quite enjoyed it, it kinda felt like the whole "book" 1 was a prologue though, and hes really stupid at making money, painfully so, but he only really have 12 years of muggle experience, Tom's memories wouldnt be applicable in the current muggle world. But the first chapter of "book" 2 completely destroyed it! All those 11 year olds with their crazy in depth political machinations (I mean it makes sense for Harry) not everyone else, that author seriously needs to take a look around himself, preteens are NOT like that, and if he force in that kind of crap, it really bodes bad for future chapters. So I decided to simply stop reading that story, wait til its finished, read the last chapter, if its any good, I might bulldoze through their teen years til shit start making sense.

Anyway, im going to try the second on the list now, The sum of their parts, already read Emperor.
