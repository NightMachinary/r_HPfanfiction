If a lot of fan fiction authors had a chance to rewrite each of the seven books, there would probably be a good amount of changes judging by common criticisms of the books.

But what scenes are awesome? What scenes did JKR perfectly hit? Preferably I'd like to see at least one scene from each book.

*** Oh man oh man. What I would do is create a subtle tension before at some point. One that flows but keeps Harry alert and maybe Molly on edge. Then do that exact scene.

His realization would hit a little harder and show him that even if people (parent/child) disagree love is there.

**** Conceptually, I would have had Hermione find the Time Turner in the Restricted Section at the end of the previous book, including a guide for its use. Her use of it wouldn't be approved (though it wouldn't be needed since /there is no reason any of the third year classes should conflict/). At the end, Hermione uses the Time Turner at Albus' insistence to enable Harry to make this one change, but the Turner breaks from the strain they put on the timeline.

***** Eh, there is good reason classes would conflict. I don't know if it's just a British thing but when I was choosing my GCSEs and A Levels both times there were subjects I enjoyed that I had to choose between because of timetabling concerns.

I also think it would be a bit OOC for Hermione to break the rules quite so drastically at such a young age.

** I'd leave the scene were Sirius asks Harry to live with him, and Harry can't say yes fast enough.

How completely fucked in the head does Harry have to be to say yes that fast? Not even a little hesitation? Here is a man that not 15 minutes ago was moments away from killing someone, and that was after spending 12 years as a felon in Azkaban and believed to be Voldemort's right hand man. Not even a little thought about his mental state?

It really just goes to show how much the Dursleys fucked him up, that he was willing to spend his life with someone who, at the time, was a pretty major unknown all things considered.

I'd keep it because I think it says a lot about Harry. He's so desperate to know more about his parents and to leave the Dursleys that he's willing to live with Sirius. I just think it's an interesting scene.

Harry has no capacity for self-preservation, nor does he have any sense of his limits. It's as simple as that. At age 11 he followed a fully grown and experienced wizard into an area he could not return from, knowing /maybe/ three spells at most.

** The bathroom scene in 6. It shows us a lot: a sneak peak of Draco's struggle and Harry's imperfection. I think it is also a turning point for Harry. Even though he tried to use an Unforgivable the previous year, he had never truly intentionally hurt someone or that that badly before and it showed him what he could be capable of if he wasn't careful.

Edit: yes. Unforgivable. Morning brain 😅

*** I disagree with this. In the cave when things go bad his first instinct it to start throwing sectumsepra around. Book 7 he uses multiple imperious curses, then uses a cruciatus on Carrow for spitting at McGonagall.

One of the reasons I like dark Harry so much it that I think with a bit of a catalyst it could have been that, and without it being out of character at all. If Harry had met someone from a darker family instead of Ron thing would've been so different.

****** I would be interested to see a rewrite of the first 3-4 books a la the tone of the latter half of the story. It would require mildly concerned guardians, less-greasy Snape, more dynamic Draco, competent adults (philosopher's stone protection?!). The fairy tale of HP is part of the series' charm but the problems it presents is extremely evident when more serious fanfics try to take Harry's canon first few years seriously. I'm tired of reading about how abusive the Dursleys are even if it's true.

Then again, I'm aware that a lot of criticism is directed at books 6 and 7 so maybe the whole series should've stayed a fairy tale.

I don't think he would have gone to prison had Draco died, but he'd have been in one hell of a shitstorm. Expulsion likely. Plus what it would have done to his own conscience.

Though having him get off "easy" by showing the memory does play more true to what happens in canon when one of the good guys does something wrong, so it just might work.

******* If you're attacked with lethal intent, you're allowed to defend yourself with lethal means. Harry did nothing wrong - he was about to get killed, in a high stress situation, and facing a Death Eater. Any spell (short of an unforgivable) would have been legal in that situation.

Shitstorm? The only ones making a fuss about dead Draco would be Death Eaters and their friends.

And his conscience? He can rest well. Draco was trying to murder Dumbledore, and didn't care about collateral damage. That Draco's death also would have led to the death of his murdering father would have been icing on the cake.

Killing Draco wouldn't have been wrong at all.

The issue, in this case, is Snape and his bias. A simple stunning spell might have been enough, but then again the one who was the biggest complainer about Harry's use of Sectusempra was Snape and had he actually been doing his job Draco would not have felt it right to taunt and try to assault other students pretty much all the time.
