:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember it was a very dark and gritty dystopian fic. In the start, Harry was the leader of a combat team of some of the last wizards and witches left, and all the Muggles had revolted and were trying to kill all of them. This last bit is kind of random but I think one of the members was like Lee Jordan's cousin or something and was apparently a huge guy. Anyways if anyone could help me out, I'd really appreciate it, it's an awesome story!!
