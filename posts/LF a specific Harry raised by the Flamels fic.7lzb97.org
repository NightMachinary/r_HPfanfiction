What I do remember is that Dumbledore takes Harry away from the Dursley's and the Flamels take him in. He is home schooled though he helps Dumbledore with the whole Chamber business. Eventually the Flamels die and Harry goes to Japan and after that, he goes to the order and a year at Hogwarts.

This was a Harry/Ginny pairing.


** I want to say that is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect by Brennus).

  Minor events can have repercussions far beyond their size and importance. When one of these minor events occurs to a ten year-old Harry Potter he finds his world turned upside-down and it starts him down a very different path than the one he expected to follow.
