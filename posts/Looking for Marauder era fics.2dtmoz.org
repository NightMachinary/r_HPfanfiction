I'm searching for (but having a terrible time finding) Marauder era fics that, generally speaking, follow James' perspective, but that don't also have his chase for Lily be the overarching plot. If you know of any fics about the era that are at least as much about his interactions with the other Marauders as they are about his interactions with Lily, than please share! Thanks!


** I'm a fan of The Life and Times ( [[https://fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times]])

It's quite long but I think it's pretty good, one of the best fics I've read actually, but it doesn't get much love here

*** I feel like I really should've specified that I've read that one, that's my bad. Damn shame it's not been updated lately.

** Try White Flags by MarauderLover7. All of the Marauders (and Lily) have POVs in it, and while the James/Lily interactions feature, there are other things going on, particularly in the second half of the story. :) This is one of my favourite stories about how the boys interact with each other. :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9233100/1/White-Flags]]
