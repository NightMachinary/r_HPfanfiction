Obviously if you've read a fic that takes place during the war the debate on whether or not the good guys should use lethal force in combat or even executions and assassinations comes up. These can range from "we must protect every life and every soul lost is a tradegy no matter how evil" to "in combat you do what you have to to make sure you're opponent doesn't get back up" to "we should kill anyone who has ever met a Pureblood".

The first point is normally championed by an overly idealistic Dumbledore who is pretty much just there to be bashed by an edgier Harry. Though Dumbledore probably could follow this philosophy personally, considering how much more powerful his is the average wizard.

The second is the most common and most sensible IMO, characters can agree that in a fight you probably shouldn't just be trying to disarm and yet you don't have to go around turning people inside out.

I exaggerated in the third point but I've think we've all seen those fics where a darker Harry slaughters whole families in their beds. I do think a bit of this can be interesting, someone like Moody pushing for executions or pre-emptive attacks rather than just being reactive makes totals sense and would solve maybe my largest issue with the series (how passive all the good guys are).

Unfortunately the author tends to agree with the main character, funny that, so whether they're letting Bellatrix go for the third time in a week or stepping on their puppy it's probably going to all work out in the end.

Sorry for the complete ramble of a post, just wanted to know what people think and prefer. Any fics where there's an actual discussion and characters change their minds would be much appreciated.


** 1. It is a common misconception that Dumbledore forbid the Order from fighting to kill. Dumbledore himself is powerful enough to subdue any number of Death Eaters nonlethally, and so for him specifically, any killing would be gratuitous and damaging to his soul. As for the rest of the Order, they cast to kill when the situation warranted it. We even have a scene with Remus chastising Harry for using a Disarming Charm rather than Stunning Spell because his opponent was on a broom; we have Molly killing Bellatrix; we have Hufflepuffs dropping mandrakes on people; and so on.
2. In DH, escalating against the Death Eaters may have been a very bad idea. The Death Eater regime was slow, confident in its security, bureaucratic, mostly content to rest on its laurels. They would arrest known blood-traitors and Harry Potter's known allies, and then just let them go after a brief and harmless interrogation. They would allow Hogwarts students to engage in anti-Voldemort agitation. They would take Muggleborns' wands, and then let them go if they didn't resist. They would take no meaningful measures against infiltration. Voldemort was wandering around Europe, searching for the Elder Wand, rather than hunting down the regime's remaining enemies. Had the Order escalated the violence, all that could change very quickly.

*** Additionally, the first thing Snape says to Dumbledore upon defecting to him is:

#+begin_quote
  His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for ---

  Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.

  *“Don't kill me!”*

  “That was not my intention.”
#+end_quote

This could mean Dumbledore has been known to kill people before, though I can also see it as Snape just overreacting? And possibly your soul only gets damaged if you kill somebody who's innocent? (I feel like this also breaks with the ethics JKR is trying to come across with, though.)

*** From an out of universe perspective, I think 'damaging to the soul' is a lazy way out TBH. I do agree that psychologically it would be damaging to canon Dumbledore to go about slaughtering people who can't actually fight back - but that's a bit more nuanced than 'damaging his soul'.

That's not me disagreeing with you, mind you. Just figuring that adding a bit more nuance makes it a bit more interesting ;)

*** Another is that with how small the WW is, you might not want to start slaughtering people and getting blood feuds going worse than they already are. It doesn't do you any good if you kill [insert death eater] once they've surrendered, and that just makes their brother decide to avenge them.

Making martyrs is usually not a great idea either - particularly if you're trying to make yourselves look like the good guys.

** Hmm, such a great question - did we ever get confirmation if it was possible to get the dark mark while under the imperius curse? Because I have a hard time believing Stan Shunpike was really a pure blood supremacist.

That said, Bellatrix and Dolohov (among others) are vicious unrepentant monsters and if they could be taken out before harming more people than absolutely necessary (and I mean, Dolohov's injury/kill count was outrageous - helped kill the Prewitt twins, attacked Hermione in the DofM, tracked the trio to London along with Rowle and then murdered Remus!) I cant say that it would be immoral to do so.

I actually just finished a story where this question comes into play and the decision is made to stun and bind the death eaters so only a certain person can undo the binding - pointing out in story that otherwise they would soon be overwhelmed. That story was linkao3(Rewriting Destiny)

Hmm...I don't think we did. 'You can only get the Dark Mark willingly and by committing a murder' is a popular fanon concept used to justify Harry killing Death Eaters and convicting Peter Pettigrew, but it has no basis in canon that I know of. Considering its ability to let Voldemort summon his followers (ranged communication, mental Apparation instruction), it may well be the opposite, a slave brand used by Voldemort to control the most important members of the Death Eaters.

  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around.

** It's happens a fair way in, but the best debates I've seen are in linkao3(14454174) Basically the idea is that use of dark magic, especially the killing curse, is corrupting - as in tainting the person's magic and appearance ( eventually) to the extent that others can notice it. The debates start from chapter 26, as the resistance debates using darker magic to get more traction in their battles against the death eaters.

Fairwarning. If you start at chapter one, it's a pretty dark fic as it's a handmaid's tale crossover ie after Voldemort's victory, surviving muggle-born witches are allocated to deatheater households. Chapter 26 is the beginning of flashbacks examining the last few years prior to Voldemort's victory. Despite the darkness, this was without doubt the best written fic imho that I read last year.
