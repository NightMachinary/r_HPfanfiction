Harry was suspicious at first and only answered questions vaguely.

But then he saw how much it riled his aunt and uncle up and, well, he couldn't pass up the opportunity


** There is a fic where Dudley is mad at his parents and at dinner he asks Harry what James & Lily did for a living. Then he starts asking more questions and eventually he and Harry went to Diagon Alley together.

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2228359/1/][*/Harry Potter and the Time of Second Chances/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/664710/Neville-James][/Neville James/]]

#+begin_quote
  A sixth year tale filled with new surprises for the trio. The heirs will be discovered and the new defense professor has a curious last name. There's something a little bit off about one of the new students as well. Filled with adventure and eventual Time travel, but most importantly a chance for Harry to find the family he always wanted.
