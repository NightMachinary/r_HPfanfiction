I remember reading a fix where the first war (against Voldemort) was still carrying on. Harry was a super soldier for the Order. Voldemort was powerful and the whole country was war torn.

Harry can be weak or powerful. The Potters can be dead or alive. I don't mind about pairings (though I'd much prefer no slash). I just want those kinda apocalypse vibes.

Thanks


** If crossover is allowed you can read The Salem Settlement linkffn(12588456)
