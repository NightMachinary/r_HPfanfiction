** I'll try

Ok so the cute little rabbit patronus(like the rabbit from the zoo movie you know the one) is trying her best to hold off the 10 dementors who are beginning to remove their cloaks btw.

The biggest dementor of the group is Steve but he's actually not a normal dementor. He's the alpha dementor - it means he has a much bigger.. well. Also it's a horse version right now because dementors can control what they are. but not the size, that's always the same.

anyway steve makes love to the rabbit the end.

The rabbit belongs to Luna and she's taking notes in the background because Luna is random like that xD.

oh and harry is a metamorphmagus vampire dementor hybrid in this fic so he can control his thing just like steve.
