Marauders plot: My character name is Wallace. He is a decendant of the last kaiser of Germany. He lives with his parents and his older sister. His older sister is cruel and abusive when their parents aren't around. In first year he meets James Sirius remus and Peter. He fancies Lily a muggleborn girl much to his parents delight and Sisters dismay. Things take a dark turn once his parents are murdered and his sister has custody. This is my marauders story. Need a co writer and beta. Please be serious and only pm if going to help. 18+ is recommended not desired. Also please tell me your time zone as I can plan accordingly.
