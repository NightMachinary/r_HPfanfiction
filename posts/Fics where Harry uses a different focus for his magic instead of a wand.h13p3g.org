** I don't know how to do that bot thing but there is the Spellmaker by SonnyGietzel in ao3. I didn't like it that much, personally but it is the only one I could find.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable, and allows him to use magic that no one's ever heard of, that no one's ever seen. But as time goes on, and he becomes more and more entangled in the webs spun by those around him, he starts to realize just how deep the magical rabbit hole goes and how dangerous power like his can be. All Harry had ever wanted was for the world to make sense.

*** You just put the story ID (in this case, 689909) from the URL and put it after either linkao3 (if it's on [[https://archiveofourown.org][archiveofourown.org]]) or linkffn (if it's on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]). You can also just out the story name instead of the ID and that should work, especially if you also use the Author name.

[[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/wiki/Usage][Here]]'s an 'Extended Bot Usage' guide that might help a bit more than I can.

  Everybody comments on Harry Potter's eyes. Why? It's not because they look like his mother's. Super Harry, Good Dumbledore. AU. Rated for violence, swearing,etc.

** The story Power of the Press by Bobmin has Harry using a wooden ring as a focus rather than a wand. Set in 4th year. Like most of Bobmin's stories it's a fun read.
