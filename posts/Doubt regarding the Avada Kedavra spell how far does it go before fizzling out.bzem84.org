Stunners fizzle out in a short distance. Petrificus totalus-es can go for quite a while, at least 400 - 500 meters based on the HP DH2(Deathly Hallows) game. How far does the AK (Avada Kedavra) go?

Note: this is about both fanon and canon


** It just goes straight ahead until it hits something, following the curvature of the Earth.

There's a Dark Lord who has the reputation of being a bit barmy amongst his peers, who's been staying in an out of the way area for years now, firing killing curses all around him while giggling like mad.

As he is surrounded by mountains and seldom hits anything beyond the occasional rabbit or deer, nobody's bothered to try and take him down.

** So I read your title and got to thinking.. If magic was real and you shot a spell off in space, would it keep going till it hit something? Or would it also fizzle out? I'd like to think it would keep going.

**** Yeah but to what degree? Because it takes a whole lot for light to bend to a degree. A black hole. And that would take a lot of time. Too much time to even calculate.

***** It's got nothing to do with what degree light is affected by gravity. It's affected in the same way regular objects are (to my knowledge), but when something travels horizontally at 300000000m/s you tend not to notice that it's accelerating downwards slighty. Black holes just have a strong enough gravitational field strength that they noticeably affect light.

****** Yes, but light bends ever so slowly around earth that it is virtually unaffected. Light even escapes the gravity of the sun and several times larger stars. So unless it heads on to a solid object, it is highly likely it will just go on. If magic behaves as light does, and considering the weightlessness of it, and the speed, it may just never hit anything.

** As another take, what if spells require a target to be cast? I imagine it as trying to paint a picture without a canvas, you have no target so the spell would fail to cast. To me, having one able to fire off blind Killing Curses makes the spell feel a lot more like a gun, as opposed to the crystalized hatred I prefer to see it as.

*** But crystalli,ed hatred DOES have a target; It xomes fron one's memories the same as the happiness for an expecto patronum comes from one's memories. Voldy's hate from orphanage days and stuff led to him being able to AK now. If his orphanage days were mundane and he grew to be a mundane wizard, he wouldnt be able to AK if he wanted to. At least, that's how I see it.

** Do the games count as canon? I've always thought of spells as short range (50-100m max) in my head, with some being really short range (imperio, incendio, aguamenti), some medium range (avada kedravra, crucio, reducto) and then some longer range (stupefy, diffindo). I don't know why, but that's just how I've thought of them. The short range ones make sense, then I've always thought that the more damage the spell does, the more magic it takes to hold it together, so it has a shorter range.

** I see no reason it would stop before hitting something.\\
Range on magic makes more sense limited by travel time (as in good luck hitting anyone too far away) than randomly fizzling out. Especially the unblockable killing curse.
