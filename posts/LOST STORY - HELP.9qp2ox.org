I am looking for a Dramione (Draco/Hermione) story called Siren Song by CaptainRaychill. Here is the summary: The silver ring called to Hermione with the magical equivalent of a siren song. The more she was near it, the more she wanted it, overwhelmed by intense feelings of longing and desire. She knew about sirens and sailors, about ships dashed against rocky shores. But she began to care less and less about perilous consequences.

If any of you know where this story is located or have a file of it, I would appreciate it! Thanks!!


** Over in the [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]] wiki there's a page on how to find Dramione fics lostdhrfics on tumblr is usually the best place, you have to email her to see if she has it

*** Thanks for your help! It looks like someone asked for it on there and they don't have it. I will keep my eyes out!
