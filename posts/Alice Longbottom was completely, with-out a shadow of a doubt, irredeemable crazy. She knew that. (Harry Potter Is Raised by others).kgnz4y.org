The thing is that when you are plagued by mental lagoons, extreme twitching, chronic pain, self-harm episodes and attacks of unstoppable laughter mixed with weeping is hard not to notice when you have lost your marbles. She could accept that, and what's more, /she could work with that/.

Alice was a well educated pureblood witch with the character and the pedigree to be married off to a heir of a Most Ancient and Noble House, given that she was the only living member of the Fortescue, a branch family born from the union of a Prewett and some other french pureblood family almost a millennia ago, and then trained since birth to be the perfect wife.

Frank had been a blessing, a glitch, because they actually fell in love when they were children and were pleased to learn that they were to marry after their education was complete. To this day, even when his brain was melting and giving up on her, she could still feel the joy when she thought of the little she could remember about their wedding; her light blue robes that showed off her shoulders, the sun kissing his skin, her feet sore after they spend all night dancing and holding each other. Oh, how she loved him; his quiet but fierce love, his hugs, his smooth hands in hers, his shining eyes, that looked at her like she hung up the moon in the sky... his bravery, that made him put himself between his wife and the cruciatus curse at any given chance when they were kidnapped by death eaters, just a couple of weeks after Lily and James Potter were murdered.

It was not a surprise when, after the attack, the pronostic showed that Alice could get at least a few lucid hours of consciousness a week while Frank wouldn't even be able to talk coherently, not even after years of treatment. Her husband sacrifice was the best and most cruel opportunity she had to recognize her son and watch him grow now thar her beloved wouldn't be able to, and then...

“You cannot do it, Alice, you are not thinking clearly... This responsibility will inevitably fall on me, and I can do the effort for my grandson but this baby isn't ours to keep” Augusta Longbottom hissed, his grip on her arm painfully and severe.

“I know I'm not capable to look after my own son, it's not even safe to leave him with me a few minutes and Merlin, I know that, I really know, but... Augusta, this is my godson and they want to sent him with his muggle relatives. Without money, totally isolated and with those terrible, horrible people. Lily would have my head if I let this happen; she would have done anything for Neville and I ought to do this for Harry too.” She said as confident as she could, trying to ignore the phantom screams and ringing in her ears but still cradling the green-eyed baby with care.

“Alice...my dear, we both know you won't be cleared by any healer, you will not be entrusted with the care of neither. Foremost, Dumbledore has the upper hand and he really wants to win this fight”. The eyes of the younger witch grew cold, his feelings of betrayal clear in her face. The silence was heavy in the room.

“There's a way... Augusta, if you do it, there's a way...”She finally said, and her mother-in-law grimaced at the suggestion.

Old families have their secrets and their own spells passed generation to generation. All of them encountered blood curses and other illnesses within them at some point or another and maybe the cures or counter spells not always worked perfectly, but it was enough to get by; The Longbottom house indeed had a problem with mental illnesses, extreme forgetfulness towards the end of their lives and madness, so they certainly had something for that. More like a curse, the /Proeliowitt/ spell will grant the recipient with a month of sanity at the cost of years of lifespan. What is more, they could only cast it three times before it led to a painful death.

“And so you want... what? For me to aid you with the deceit and take care of these boys all on my own, with lord Longbottom breathing down our necks now that he has lost his perfect heir?” She said, hiding the pain of talking about this as if she hadn't lost her son too.

“No. I just want... a chance to keep them safe and hold them close...” Alice stood from the St. Mungos bed and approached the cradle where her own son was sleeping and put baby Harry at his side, eagerly trying to commit this scene to memory; the two boys, with their cubby and rosy cheeks, their dark hair and soft breathing. Augusta walked towards them and stared down at the children with a stern gaze.

/“Look at them, mother/...” the young witch whispered, her hand tugging painfully at her short chocolate curls. “Look at them and tell me you do not want what is best for them...”

Augusta Longbottom hesitated just a moment... and then raised her wand.
