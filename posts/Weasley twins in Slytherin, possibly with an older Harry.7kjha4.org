** I like the idea of the twins in Slytherin, and challenging the status quo. Hell, I didn't even know I wanted it until now. However, dark magic and pureblood bigotry is just plain retarded, and should be burnt to the ground alongside with whoever thought it up.

**** I also like seeing things from the "bad" point of view. Except on this subreddit that means you're racist and a disgusting bigot. I know I'm not, it's just super annoying when some on here assume so. I've seen writers get bashed for this as well, even when the entire story is clearly a message to make you uncomfortable, because they know it's wrong. Gets me riled up.

Exactly what your asking for as far as I remember. Had slytherin twins with an aged up harry + dark magic. Can't remember the bigotry part though.

**** Ya the beginning is pretty meh, the middle is pretty good though with some flaws like how Sirius was done, and the end was alright.
