I can understand where Dumbledore bashing comes from, at least to a degree. But I don't understand why some people seem to detest the Weasleys.


** I feel like it's less Weasely family bashing and more bashing of specific characters. I know a lot of fans bash Ron because he left Harry and Hermione in DH and he ostracized Harry in GoF and Hermione in PoA. A lot of fans also think Ron is unfit for Hermione as a life partner. Another frequently bashed Weasely is Molly because of her attitude towards Hermione in GoF. Most fans/fanfics I've read love the twins, Arthur, Bill and Charlie. Ginny also gets hate half of the time because fans think she isn't good enough for Harry. I think Percy hate is self explanatory due to him exiling himself from his own family in GoF.

** A lot of the Weasley Bashing I've read is in HHr fanfiction, and it's just an easy out for authors who don't like the canon ships and want a quick and easy way to discredit them. Weasley family bashing comes hand-in-hand with Dumbledore bashing because both Molly and Dumbledore are a bit controlling and can easily be written to be manipulative. I haven't seen quite as much Arthur/Bill/Charlie bashing though.

Honestly, if you're going to write HHr (or any ship) there should be sufficient character development to explain the relationship and I don't want to go on a rant about soulbond fic right now.

The "manipulation" angle is the only explanation I find for Molly asking loudly what the platform number is. She went to school for 7 years, and sent her own children to the same school since /1982/. She'd been to the same platform /16 times/, and she still has to ask what the platform number is?

** The only three that usually get off in a bash fic are the twins and Arthur.

The others...

It is easy to come up with a scenario where Ginny was using potions to get Harry's attention. From there it is easy to say Ron was doing the same to Hermione. If not those two, then Molly trying to play matchmaker. All because A) Molly mentioned using a love potion on Arthur and B) Harry's extreme sudden noticing Ginny and C) Hermione's personality change in book 6 suddenly lovestruck and Jealous over Ron

Most bash fic might spare Bill and Charlie, by saying that Molly being overbearing drove them away from home as soon as they were allowed (see also Percy and the Twins).

The REAL reason that bashing became popular is due to shipping wars, people who don't like Harry/Ginny finding reasons to split them up and more especially people who HATE Hermione/Ron being together (even if they are not Harmony shippers)

It basically boils down to "What reason besides "soulmates" would Harry suddenly like Ginny, what does Hermione see in Ron, and why is Molly always sending Howlers to her kids?

Personally I think the theories on potions are pretty dead on, but someone clued JKR into the "rapey" feel it gave the relationship so she took it out. That doesn't mean I hate Ginny, but I can't stand HeRon...

It also usually goes along with Dumbledore bashing, as they were his strongest light family supporters so obviously were involved in his schemes for Harry (ie marry Ginny off or get her pregnant before Harry dies so the Weasleys get the Potter Fortune).

It's not very specific about whom she used the love potion on but she did make one. Arthur was also sitting there, so whatever the love potion story was, Arthur was fine with it.

It really was just a fleeting sentence in the books, which makes it kind of amazing how far it's been twisted out of shape--it's Chinese Whispers on a truly grandiose scale. I knew that the Greater Good wasn't a big deal in the books, really, but doesn't he say it even /once/?

** In the great Denial, thousands of Emma Watson... uh, I mean Hermione Granger fans went through a terrible let down when reading the Deathly Hallows and discovering that the strong central female character was wedded to the comic relief rather than the hero.

'Why? How did this happen? What clues could possibly support our belief in the one true pairing?' they asked.

And so, to codify the sinister subtext that rose to greet their eager yearning for vindication, the theory arose that the Weasleys, being poor, plentiful and loyal to the Great Manipulator, must have had a conspiracy going. They lured Harry at the platform, turned his head from considering Slytherin as just another House, later plotted with the use of love potions to befuddle Harry into ignoring his soul-mate, Emma - sorry, again, Hermione and instead 'choosing' to fixate on Ginny.

Ginny! I tell you! Like she wasn't shagging every boy who ever was seen in her proximity. It had to be a potion- why else would Harry fall for someone who looked like his MUM?!?!... 'cause, y'know, there's only one English redhead who was ever beautiful- St. Lily, and all others aspire to be an avatar of her.

Basically it's the author's fault for not making Ginny more memorable, making Ron human and the casting of Emma Watson.

*** I don't think Emma Watson plays as much of a part in people shipping HHr as you imply. Yes, the films gave Hermione a bigger role and reduced Ron's, but a lot of HHr shippers also date back to pre-HBP (the book) when the actors were still young. The potion theory had little basis in canon but was sort of a last attempt to stay afloat by HHr shippers.

*** ...right. It couldn't possibly be that people dislike Ron as a character. Couldn't possibly be people having a problem with the idea of someone who abandoned his supposed friends in the middle of a WAR who had a history of getting so caught up in himself that he abandoned his friends when they needed him most. It absolutely positively must be because he ended up with the female lead. And obviously the only reason people dislike that pairing is because Emma Watson is cute and not because of Ron's history of belittling basically everything Hermione did, from her cat acting like a fucking cat to the rights movement that she felt very strongly about (but it's okay, because one time he was like 'what about the elves' and that totally made his treating her and the cause she cared about so terribly during every other scene competely okay)

**** Chill out, dude. Wordhammer is talking about one particular aspect of Ron-bashing common in fics. You simply cannot deny that the amount of people that will hate one character purely out of shipping preferences is positively huge.

I don't think it's fair comparing Harry- you know, savior of the wizarding world- to Ron like that. Plain and simple, not everybody is equipped to handle the pressures of war. It would be unrealistic if every single one of Harry's group of friends was perfectly loyal in a war situation. People crack and fail on behalf of others when under pressure. I don't see anyone proclaiming Harry is the worst guy of all time for doing something so stupid it got Sirius killed. If people can like Snape despite his flaws, I find it unreasonable for Ron to be so demonized.

True, I don't like Ron that much because of all the jealousy issues, but do I have such a hatred for him that I would resort to something as childish and unbecoming of a writer as to bash him in fanfiction? Certainly not.

Further... Everyone seems to be forgetting that all three characters were heavily emotionally compromised by the Horcrux throughout much of DH. All of the blame can't fall on Ron for that.

***** Oh come on. In GoF he was a fair weather friend without their being war going on. Then again, the Sirius/Remus relationship has those kinds of betrayals all the time and they are still friends:

- Sirius nearly made Remus kill as a werewolf, making his worst fear come true; moon as a bogart and all. He didn't even consider Remus because he hated Snape more than he liked Remus.

- Sirius didn't trust Remus enough to be the secret keeper (thought he was more likely the traitor than Pettigrew).

- Remus believed that Sirius was a Death Eater and mass murderer... his doubts (if any) weren't enough to warrant a query.

The Ron&Harry relationship is one of perfect behavior in comparison.

****** Forgive my late reply. I understand where you're coming from. Except the Sirius I read was confident (but not mature) in all things EXCEPT his family. So when the conflict with Remus happens, it's not from a position introspection and inadequacy, it's from a position of immaturity (at first) and arrogance later.

Ron has dealt with severe self esteem issues and a soft hand in being raised.

Harry has been neglected at best and emotionally abused at worst.

Sirius ran to the Potters as soon as he decided to get out of his family, then never really matured during Hogwarts (whereas James did). Remus dealt with his issues as best he could. But being a werewolf really did a number on him. So they weren't really foils for each other.

Ron is a foil for Harry but comes short every time.

So then it's easy to see where you can twist the character to fall further and end up not as a friend or even bashed.

** +I started rereading the original series recently. I couldn't take it. Harry was a brat, prejudiced against Slytherins, and seemed no better than Malfoy. Ron was slightly worse, if anything. If you're writing Harry Potter fanfic, 99.99% chance it's got Harry as the protagonist, so you pretty much have to redeem him. Ron, though? You can keep him as is or make him even worse, and it's easy. You just write Malfoy with less money, less refinement, less whining about what his father will do, and more red hair.

Add to that the fact that Weasley has no real role in much of the story aside from attending -- and being a window to the pureblood point of view, a role that a well-studied Hermione could mostly fulfill, and that isn't necessary for fan fiction, where your readers have all read the source material -- and you have this as the obvious role for Weasley.

But what was his prejudice based on? 1) What Hagrid told him before the sorting. 2) What Ron told him before the sorting. 3) Draco's behaviour before the sorting.

As time passed, his unreasonable prejudice was replaced by /reasonable/ prejudice, because most Slytherins were /assholes/.

And of course Harry was a brat. /All/ 11-year-olds are brats.

*** It's hard to say they don't bring much to the fanfic story when they open up so many avenues for fanfic writers! Authors can choose to go the easy route and bash away, but they give writers a chance to explore a complex family dynamic which can really add a lot to a story. I mean, each Weasley child has a different way of (essentially) getting their parents' attention, which manifests in their characterization. Bill is cool, Charlie is adventurous, Percy is a goody-two-shoes, the twins are pranksters, Ron struggles to find a niche which shapes his identity, and Ginny is the youngest and only girl. All that is at play, then add money troubles and a war that the parents fought in when the kids were really little and that the whole family fought in when they were older and fanfic authors really have no excuse for ignoring the goldmine of possibilities that is the Weasley family.
