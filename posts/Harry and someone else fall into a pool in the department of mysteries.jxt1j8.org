They're in a battle and the pool is the only way to go, and the pool sends them to the past/future.


** I've read this story, i know it's a harry/ginny story and that adult Harry and Ginny fell into that DOM pool during an attack at a ministry event led by Pansy Parkinson.

i'll try looking for it, but it's been a while since i read it.
