I'm looking for anything to read with Harry being raised French (likely from the Delacours) to him being a player in the French political arena, to him being a student at Beauxbatons. I've read a few lately and I really enjoy them. Anything with French Harry is welcome


** Mind sharing the ones you've found? I can't seem to find any good ones lately.

** The only one that I know of that is currently updating and decent enough for me to follow is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9884872/1/th%C3%A9-%C3%A0-la-grenouille]].

(Political & Psychological fic) Due to a filing error, young Harry Potter receives an invitation to Beauxbâtons while with the Dursleys in France. The school, eager to get its claws on the famous Boy Who Lived, doesn't repair the mistake, and Harry is forced to attend a school where he is unable to even comprehend the language the classes are taught in. (Twist on the cliché)

What I like about it is that the author does a good job writing Harry as a young child that is completely out of his element and that France isn't some magical utopia that will teach him everything he needs to kill Voldemort by the time he's fourteen. Too many fics that have Harry raised somewhere other than the Dursleys don't do a good job portraying him as a believable kid and show Britain to be completely backwards in every conceivable way.

It's too soon to tell if this fic will turn out good, but I'm hoping it will. I'm also interested in any French raised Harry fics anyone cares to recommend.

e: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8276762/1/French-Twist]] also comes to mind, but it hasn't updated in years. I thought it had potential.
