Prefer if it is not a short fic ( >40,000 words)

Also prefer if is in Harry's pov


** Haven't seen one, but Luna with a gambling addiction would be pretty good as a story. She loses her money, is broke as fuck, and has to crash with Harry. He helps her get a job, and fluffy romance occurs from there.

*** Or, the weird mystic nature of Luna gives her luck. She's the type that people are afraid because she knows more than she lets on.

I don't remember cannon Luna anymore.

  Draco organizes a no-holds-barred poker game. Harry decides to compete... just a little fun fic co-written by Joshua. I might or might not write more on this.
