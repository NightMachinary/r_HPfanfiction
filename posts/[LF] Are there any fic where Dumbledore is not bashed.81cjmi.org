I have no clue how many fics I have read where Dumbledore is basically bashed. I know there is a possibility that Dumbledore had a bit of a manipulation side to him, but I genuinely think that Dumbledore has others flaws besides ‘simple straight forward' manipulation. However powerful or omniscience he may seem, he is still human. His aged reveals he had experienced many things throughout his life. Dumbledore had made mistakes before which the books gave evidence of them. Some notable time periods are what happen with Ariana, his involvement with Grindelwald, and how Tom ended up the way he is.

Is it possible that Lily had lied to Dumbledore about her relationship with her sister? Possibly playing down how bad it actually was. What if Dumbledore really was not aware of the Potters switching Secret Keepers? What if the fact it was easy to get the Sorcerer's Stone was to tempt Quirrell/Voldemort to think it was that easy? What if Harry really wasn't suppose to go get the Sorcerer's Stone since the Mirror of Erised would trap Quirrell/Voldemort there anyways? Realistically, would Dumbledore simply use Legilimency willy nilly just to get information? What if the whole Wizarding World held Dumbledore in such high regard that they had forgotten that he was still very much human like them, even through all his achievements? There are others, but than this post would take forever.

I highly doubt the accusations of the ‘manipulative old coot' had warrant the amount of bashing Dumbledore had gotten. Albus Dumbledore is /Albus Dumbledore/ because he is a strategist and a scholar. Which means he is very good at making connections with various details. Add that with experience and age.

Anyways, sorry for that rant. My actual topic of this post is to ask if there are any fics that balance all sides of Dumbledore. Preferably, a Dumbledore centric fic in the Golden Trio Era. Though, I am cool with reading fics of the time periods before that.


** Currently in my tabs, I'm re-reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/Barefoot][Barefoot]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]].

Barefoot has a pretty-super Harry who has the unique ability of postcognition, being able to get readings by touching stuff with his bare skin (hence, why he goes barefoot). Dumbledore's a main character in that one and has a downright casual relationship with Harry.

Nightmares of Futures Past has an interesting portrayal of Dumbledore; Harry is semi-antagonistic towards him because he's worried that Dumbledore would do something stupid if he learned Harry had future knowledge, but story-wise Dumbledore is overall a normal and sensible character. That story has the Malfoys and Snape being spectacularly villainous, though.

Among other things, Malfoy being able to conjure a serpent does seem like magic far beyond what a second year *should* know.

Well that makes him a not so brilliant strategist then and more of an idiot if he can't see how announcing a super duper secret to the whole school might lead to them investigating it and possibly getting in trouble. Maybe he should have protected it in a way that school children can't get in danger?

Honestly this requires such a huge amount of idiocy that I have a hard time believing anything except that Philsopher's Stone played out exactly as Dumbledore intended and he wanted Harry & Friends to confront Voldemort. Everything else means Dumbledore is actually retarded.

Honestly, the issue is that Rowling likely didn't put that much thought into it. It's a fantasy (fairy tale) story, the hero needs obstacles to overcome. A mentor exists but needs to be absent during a climactic showdown to raise the stakes for the protagonist. Everything about "manipulative Dumbledore" comes down to the values dissonance between the early books, where Harry is seemingly purposefully put in grave danger, and the later books, where Dumbledore is painted as a more complex character.

*** The Dumbledore in that story is really frustrating since all onscreen evidence shows that he is totally incompetent and a huge dick who, according to his own words, throws Neville in life or death situations as character building experience. Yet Harry looks up to him and forgives any missteps immediately. I know that this is intended since the author is trying to make the story about realising the flaws of your idols (at least that's what he told me), but boy can it be frustrating to read, even if it is quite masterfully executed.

**** I can only apologise if you find it annoying, but the point is that it grates against you as a reader. My goal in writing this story is to portray heavily flawed characters. Harry is not some ubermensch; he's talented in his studies, but he's also profoundly underdeveloped elsewhere. You giveth, you taketh away.

Dumbledore is similar in that way too. Within canon, the very premise of their relationship is that Harry must trust Dumbledore so much that Harry is willing to die at his behest. I don't like that aspect, but I see a level of pragmatism to Dumbledore's character that I rather enjoyed and I wanted that within my fic. Rather than allow Neville to just die as a scapegoat, he's offering an opportunity for Neville to get his sword sharpened in these highly pressured situations. It is not what a perfectly moral person would do, but it is what someone who understands the steps someone must take to win would do.

The goal of my writing Dumbledore is not for you to love him, or even admire him, but recognise that he is flawed and that he does more good than harm.

*** I think it was because OotP was the book where we got a whole genre-shift. And a lot of ‘reveals'. - Harry's father was a bully when he was young. - Dumbledore knowing the prophecy all along. - the abused orphan trope the first book opened with started to get uncomfortable. - the lack of communication, dear god. The entire book could've been cut in half of people talked to each other.

And the death of a beloved character. It was the book where ‘shit got real' so to say, whereas the previous ones still ran a sense of whimsy and fantasy.

That's why I think he's demonized so much. Now, I don't mind a ‘manipulative' Dumbledore. My problem is that so many fics write him as incompetent. If you're going to portray him as ‘actually satan' then make him live up to that.

** I doubt that Lily would have been very open with Dumbledore about her relationship with Petunia at all. Generally, it's kind of random to bring up your personal life when you have a strictly professional relationship with someone - Harry isn't a great example of an average student. Most wouldn't have held more than a handful of conversations with Dumbledore, and by the time Lily was in the Order, she probably had more important things to worry about, like a genocide, rather than her less than ideal relationship with Petunia.

The important thing about leaving Harry with the Dursleys is that regardless of the magic that he felt was protecting Harry from Voldemort, he shouldn't have gone against Lily and James' wishes. There's no /way/ that they would have consented to letting Petunia and Vernon be Harry's guardians in the event of their deaths. If he didn't believe that Sirius was innocent and at /least/ deserved a trial before getting carted off to Azkaban, then who was Harry's godmother? Could he not have been placed under the care of another Order of the Phoenix member? If he wasn't confident that Voldemort was dead like the rest of the magical world was, then why couldn't exceptionally strong, but average protection wards suffice, at least until Voldemort had really come back? The Death Eaters that weren't convicted didn't have the same connection with Harry that Voldemort did, the love magic wouldn't have been effective against them. The only reason that they weren't aware of Harry's location is because /they didn't know./ And there's reason to believe that there were wards placed on the Dursleys house anyway, because if there hadn't been, the Boy Who Lived would have /definitely/ been receiving fanmail quite early in life. So that's /at least/ thirteen years where Harry was neglected and (emotionally, if not physically) abused where it may not have been strictly necessary.

Like [[/u/Deathcrow]] stated, there is a canon exchange in Deathly Hallows where Dumbledore admits by lack of refutation that he has been manipulating Harry this whole time. Whether or not the rest of your examples are a result of this, I can see both your point and the alternative, that it was all set up to maximise Harry's interaction with Voldemort/his supporters. I do think that there are examples of Dumbledore simply making mistakes like an average person in the books. The thing is: since even before Harry was born, he was essentially a chess piece for Dumbledore. Bashing fics can be generally uninteresting writing, but manipulative Dumbledore is absolutely canon.

Also, "strategist" and "manipulative" are synonyms when it comes to "strategising" how people think and act without their consent.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** Self-plug here, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12610360/1/We-Harry-Potter]]) has Dumbledore simply trying to be helpful and caring for students in need - including Harry (plus Harry, Harry, Harry, and yet another Harry as well).

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?
