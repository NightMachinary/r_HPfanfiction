So I happen to hate the cursed child. I dont hate it because its a terrible book but because despite it being a fanfiction(and not even a very good one. You couldve found multiple versions of this story written with the same depth of plot by middleschoolers well before this one came out) of my favorite series that is considered canon by a lot of people. Even though J.K.Rowling didnt even write the play herself.

Anyway i used to read a lot of the SI genre and I had a thought about what would happen if you end up thrown into your favorite series but it turns out to be a really dumb fanfiction version of it.

I feel like that would be quite painful to go through.

What are your guy's thoughts? What would you do in that kind of situation? Is there already a fanfiction like this out there? Im dying to read it if there is one I feel like it would be quite hilarious if done well.


** Thats a cool premise. What SI fics did you read? Ive been looking for a good one for ages

*** There is a fic with a SI inserted into one of robst's fics i believe. I think its called the red headed fool or something. I found it rather good, (and can find the correct name if needed) but author has stopped updating it atm :(

#+begin_quote
  Based on Robst's fanfic "In this world and the next" where Harry and Hermoine get betrayed by their best friend, Ron. After dying they get a do over, sent back to their 11 year old selves. But this isn't their story. A guy from our world where Harry Potter canon and fanfic exists gets plopped in Ron's 11 year old body during H&H's do over. Now he's thrown in the deep end.

** Do I get to choose the fanfic? Can it be one where I can convince the goblins to love me and greatly increase my wealth with their incredible business brains just because I remembered their names and was polite? Maybe one where I become the Lord of multiple Ancient and Noble Houses and do politics by just yelling at and scaring people?

**** Yes, that was the joke. Although, let's be honest, if any of us could be a Mary Sue we all would be. If you could be well-liked/respected by everyone you know, if you could be naturally gifted to the point where anything you want to do is easy for you, then you'd want that. It makes for a shit character but that's why people end up making their SI's Mary Sues.

** Honestly while I understand how reading the cursed child and trying to act as if it was supposed to be a continuation of the main story would lead you to think it sucks, it isn't meant to be that. It's a play that is separate from Harry Potter, and for the format of a play is actually quite well written.

I thought it was very fun to watch, with very good acting and special effects for a play.

*** I don't like TCC at all, but it does have its moments which I wished were canon. This one particular moment when Ginny talks to Harry:

#+begin_quote
  GINNY: After I came out of hospital --- everyone ignored me, shut me out --- other than, that is, the boy who had everything --- who came across the Gryffindor common room and challenged me to a game of Exploding Snap. People think they know all there is to know about you, but the best bits of you are --- have always been --- heroic in really quiet ways.
#+end_quote

I really wished this would have been an actual scene in CoS. I really wished this would have been a canon moment between Harry and Ginny.

**** It'd have given her more depth. But honestly I don't like canon!Ginny. With the few scenes she had in the books, she seems like underdeveloped 2dimensional fangirl. Don't get me wrong I think the character has potential but JKR never used that potential. Imho.

***** Canon Ginny often fails (IMO) because she gets technically introduced early, but is relatively unimportant, one dimensional, etc. Then she pops back in in the back half, but seems to mainly be in there just to be Harry's love interest.

Her character absolutely had potential, but I would have appreciated seeing more of her if JKR knew that'd be the endgame - to show her as a character of more importance throughout books 3-5.

An alternative would be to make her stand out a bit more. I know that I find Tonks and Luna - who don't get all that much screen time themselves - much more interesting as characters, because we only get introduced to them later (when they're interesting) and they're more unique. Ginny striked me in canon as less interesting/unique, and burdened with her book 1-4 character that she never managed to overcome - at least for me.

**** I can agree that Ginny had her moments but Harry was just made into the worst father even when in the whole original series his dream was to have a family. You don't become a bad father after striving to make your own family and aiming for the family man lifestyle. its just waaaaay too ooc.

*** When JK says its canon by stating it is so on the cover of the book, it just brings the book to really high expectations. When those expectations aren't met and the book is still shoved in fans faces as canon it can piss some people off. I'm glad you found some enjoyment from it even though i can't though.
