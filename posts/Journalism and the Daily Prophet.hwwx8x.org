As a journalist, whenever I read anything with Rita Skeeter I get twitchy. No, Daily Prophet, that should not be front page news! That's not how you write a news lede! Get a real editor!

So, anyone know any fics that delve into or touch upon the inner workings of the Daily Prophet?

A real editor tearing her down would be fantastic...

Thanks!

** Hmm... unhelpfully I cannot think of anything that would exactly fulfill OP's request (or at least the sort of fic that I think you are requesting.) But I have put some fics after my perambulating below.

Certainly, journalism and the Daily Prophet feature in many fics, but often as a side plot. Even where journalism moves to the center stage, that does not mean there is depiction of the nuts and bolts of editing and writing.

There are some fairly regular plot beats for the Daily Prophet which I sometimes think of as:

1. the "Ministry Mouthpiece" where the Daily Prophet's editor is basically an extension of the the Minister of Magic's will,
2. the "Hostile Takeover" where there will be stock ownership in the Daily Prophet and Harry, or more rarely a Death Eater, will purchase the stocks or suddenly come into an inheritance, allowing them to control the Daily Prophet and radically change its editorial direction (e.g. it's a minor plot in Sunrise/sunset over Britain by Bobmin),
3. the "Propaganda War" where good outlets (typically the Quibbler and Potterwatch or a new outlet started by Harry and whomsoever his allies are) and bad outlets (the Prophet and WW) battle it off (typically with open warfare taking place simultaneously),
4. the "Defamation Lawsuit" where Harry or Hermione sues or threatens to sue the Daily Prophet for libel (this is relatively rare in what I read)\\

Of course, these plots are not mutually exclusive nor are they an exhaustive account of fanfic journalism.

Some other journalism fanfic moments are:

1. Zooming in on the thoughts of the editor of the Daily Prophet, who is usually Barnabus Cuffe.
2. Rita Skeeter blackmail (of course!)
3. International takes of what's going on (basically showing different outlets having different takes on what is going on and different ways of looking at the world.)

As for fics, immediately springing to mind is: /Poison Pen/ by Genkaifan which may be sort of what you are looking for, although I cannot remember what happens in it very well... linkffn(5554780)

Otherwise, I'm having a blank atm, especially as for Rita Skeeter/editing centric plots. /The Resistance of Azkaban/ by Shezza shows some competing media perspectives, as a /very/ minor part of the story) linkffn(2980054).

Best of luck, fic hunting OP!

** Although the Prophet is only a subplot in this story, but the whole story is a bunch of subplot with a lot of POV. It has a really detailed Goblin Nation in it too. It's a really slow-going story because everything is so detailed and shown from many points of view. Basically 3 months is covered in 40 chapters, but it's not boring.

Because of these, when the Prophet came into the story, you got a glimpse into the organization in a detailed way too, through a new employee's eyes. You can see the inside of the newsroom the first time in chapter 35. I expect to see more later when the story continues.
