I was just watching POA on ITV1HD and Sirius said that "James suggested that he made the change permanent", referring to his animagus state.

Listening to it made me think about Mrs Norris.

What if Mrs Norris was a witch, maybe Filch's predecessor, and she made the animagus change permanent? Could that be why she shows more than an average level of intelligence for a cat, with Filch not knowing about her being a witch?


** There are magical cats called Kneezles iirc which are smarter than your average cat. I believe Hermione's cat was part kneezle. I always figured Ms. Norris was simply a magical cat. I like this idea, though. Could make for an interesting story with characters interacting with the cat.

** Hows this for and idea? A dark wizard attacked Filch and his girlfriend when they where young and transformed her into a cat. However when Filch appealed to the people for help they turned him down because they either didn't believe him or just didn't like him because he was a squib. Now as revenge Filch and Mrs.Norris take out their petty revenge on innocent students.

** This is actually a big plot point in the third Alexandra Quick novel. There is a witch permanently trapped as a cat after an attack and her backstory is a revelation to the main character.

(Spoiler) the cat animagus is Alexandra's mother, and she was brain-damaged in a magical battle fighting with Alexandra's father against the authorities. She doesn't have the mental capacity to change back to human, and one of her sisters cares for her as a pet. (/spoiler)

** I think he was just joking about how he liked Sirius better as a dog, but that's an interesting theory. She certainly seems more intelligent than most cats.

** What witch, even one who spends all her time as a cat, would WANT to spend her life with Filch?

*** Well he might have been better looking 60 years ago and if he lost his crappy personality it might be a point in his favor.

** Mrs Norris is an unfortunate ex-student of Zelretch who unwisely sent out one too many links to cat videos and was thus banished to Potterverse so that she can be 'cured' of her cat addiction by the 'best' caretaker ever.
