** Well the most famous Harry goes to Durmstrang fic is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived), which is probably my favorite WBWL-style fic as Harry's relationship with his family isn't antagonistic. haven't read Consuming Shadows. Who's the author?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  In which Harry goes to Beauxbâtons instead of Hogwarts. Butterfly effects ensue, with Voldemort reviving without opposition from Harry, Dumbledore trying to save the situation and Fudge making everything worse. Meanwhile, Harry learns French. (Twist on the cliché and a slow-going Independent!Harry)
