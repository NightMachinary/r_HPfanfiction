I'm looking for good, preferably completed, time travel fics where the time traveler is not Harry. I'd also prefer no slash, but honestly a gen fic or not primarily romance-focused fic would be even better. Thanks!


** Shoot, I know there's one where Luna Lovegood goes back in time to adopt Tom Riddle and prevent him from turning into Lord Voldemort.

It's a one-shot, I just can't remember the name or any phrases that'd help me find it...

Found it! It's Doubting Thomas by AzarDarkstar. linkffn(5492188)

It's only a one-shot that looks at the outcome of 'what if Luna Lovegood adopted Tom Riddle using time travel', though. Not much character development.

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.

** Linkffn(8479548) where George Weasley travels back, it's complete, gen though unlike most he doesn't possess his younger self. Also, Linkffn(4740107) time travelling Ginny, also complete though somewhat romantic. I am also interested in finding other stories of this nature.

  Ginny is reading a book by the pond at the Burrow and generally minding her own business, when she gets unceremoniously dumped in the...lake at Hogwarts? Now she is bouncing around in time with no discernible return date...maybe she shouldn't have been reading aloud. First chapter written in the form of letters back to her own time. T for language and mentions of drinking.

** "Far Too Many Time Travelers" isn't complete, but it's an amusing read nonetheless. linkffn(6728900) Almost everyone /except/ Harry is a time traveller.

Doubting Thomas was mentioned, so another one by the same author is Future Imperfect. linkffn(4590039)

There's Fate's Favourite, which is an alright fic and complete. linkffn(5725656). "Harry Potter and the Warrior's Code" is unfortunately incomplete. linkffn(10673953)

  An odd, dark-haired man rescues Harry from the Dursleys when he's nine years old. Harry would have been thrilled if his saviour didn't claim to be a disillusioned madman come back in time to stop his other self from taking over the world. Add to that his apparent belief that Harry is important to his plans, and things become just a little bit complicated.

  Explores the close, loving friendship between Hermione and Harry mainly from Hermione's viewpoint. Is it enough to form a devoted life-partnership even if they're not romantically in love? Might their love be just as true? And if so, what could bring them together? The story is fluffy, sometimes sensual, but never smutty or crude, and, of course, has the touch of magic.

  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.
