In many fanfictions i read Dumbledore seems to be obsessed with sparing the bad guys. This is not limited to bashing stories either.

Canonically however this is not true. In the first year Dumbledore all but tells Harry to not feel bad for killing Quirrel and he does tries to kill Voldemort in the Order of the Phoenix by drowning him. Only enemy Dumbledore blatantly spares in the canon is Grindewald and that is due to their shared past.

It seems to me just because dumbledore isn't systematically distributing killing curses like Voldemort does people believe him to not just dont kill but punish those who kill in self defence.


** Dumbledore's canon treatment of both Snape and Draco Malfoy is probably responsible. Katie Bell and Ron both very nearly died as part of Malfoy's plans in 6th year. Dumbledore did nothing. Snape was a Death Eater, who knows what he did as a Death Eater, but we can imagine it was not pleasant but what punishment did he receive for that?

It shows that Dumbledore, for whatever reason is unwilling to take action against those many would consider needed action taken against them. Dumbledore could have stopped Malfoy, and/or had Snape imprisoned and much of the fandom would have been happy, but he didn't. I don't want to argue either way if this was a good thing, a plot necessary thing or argue at all, but it is canon that Dumbledore could have done more.

Canon does suggest that Dumbledore does not have a problem with killing, however it also shows that Dumbledore does spare some from what many would consider just punishment. The edgelords within the fandom often consider death the just punishment for all death eaters and therefore Dumbledore spares their lives. Which is spun into Dumbledore is overly forgiving and against killing.

Imagine Katie Bell's parents somehow found out that Dumbledore knew exactly who was behind their daughter being put into a coma and nearly dying, but refused to do anything. Do you think they care about Dumbledore's plan or do they want Malfoy punished?

** Part of it probably stems from the fight in OotP, where Dumbledore is explicitly not trying to kill Voldemort with the stated reason being that "there are some things worse than death."

In hindsight, it's obvious that his real reason is that he knows Voldemort still has horcruxes, so "killing" him would only delay the inevitable, allow the Ministry to continue its Voldemort-denying status quo, and doom Harry later down the line (the thing that ultimately saves him is that Voldemort's body has his blood; if he made a new body without Harry's blood, he'd have to die and stay dead to destroy the scarcrux). By stalling Voldemort until more people arrived, Dumbledore ensured that he wouldn't be able to operate in secret anymore, but given how much most fanfic writers hate him, they tend to ignore the obvious tactical benefits of this and instead conclude that "the old goat is too soft to do what must be done, unless what must be done is stealing from and plotting to murder a prepubescent orphan, in which case he's down for whatever."

** Because if Dumbledore took the road that actually made sense, the second war would never have happened.

Why the fuck are the Lestranges alive? Why are the Malfoys? Walden fuckin MacNair? They were all openly death eaters, responsible for dozens of deaths. Dumbledore's urging of forgiveness basically hands over British Wizard Society (granted, it is a /garbage/ society) and hundreds of Muggleborns on a fucking platter. Dumbledore keeps playing merciful even when it is clearly the dumbest fucking thing to do.

He didn't kill Grindelwald, he refuses to kill Death Eaters. The only people he's happy to kill or watch die are loyal followers of the cult of Albus Dumbledore. Don't believe me? Think about what would have happened to Arthur Weasley if Harry hadn't been a horcrux. Harry never sees the attack, Arthur Weasley dies a horrific, venom-filled death in the Ministry, right before Christmas, over an object that no one but Harry or Voldemort could have touched anyway.

** u/JennaSayquah:
#+begin_quote
  he does tries to kill Voldemort in the Order of the Phoenix by drowning him
#+end_quote

Bit of a quibble: by this point he already knows that Voldemort has multiple horcruxes, so he knows that he will not (permanently) die even if he manages to kill this body. He also believes that Harry is the only one who can defeat Voldemort. So this arguably is him just attempting to get them more time by forcing Voldie back into a wraith form, but not violating any "anti-killing" bias he has.

But honestly, to answer your question, it comes down to Dumbledore being "the good guy." Good guys don't use killing as their solution, unless all other options are exhausted. This of course always backfires: as Harry and his friends discovered, the Death Eaters they stunned were revived by their buddies and came after them again. (This also ironically makes Dumbledore a "bad guy": by choosing not to kill, he is in fact setting up countless other people to die by allowing them to escape and continue their rampage.)

So Dumbledore was automatically ranked higher in terms of morality, if if it's not strictly written on page. And since Moody never killed if he could help it, that would mean that Dumbledore wouldn't either.

****** Fair point on the Wizengamot, I may have some fanon clashing with canon in my head. But even as a chief judge keeping order he could easily sustain an objection to the imperious defense and require proof.

I think the difference is that the whole point of the ICW is to preserve the international statue of secrecy, which requires an enforcement arm is some sort, which would likely be rather eager to prevent a third Dark Lord. The man who stopped one and held the line against a second arguing for intervention to prevent a third would hold done weight.

I honestly dont remember Dumbledore saying he wrote a number of laws so if you can give examples i would appreciate it.

Being the Headmaster of a school does not make you its king so i would say Dumbledores powers were quite restricted due to school laws potentially passed down by people like Lucius Malfoy in the board of Governance. We dont know what powers the chief warlock and the supreme mugwump have so it very possible he has little to no influence over the jurisdiction of Wizarding Britain.

** Well, a 'no killing rule' is an easy way of either portraying character as morally superior or as having misguided morality, plus there is this thing with Grindelwald still being alive.

Personally, to give a bit of a logical explananation of why Dumbledore seems reluctant to condemn people? Well, he's a sucker for a redemption arc, and is objectively right that there are fates worse than death, especially in the context of what we know of HP-verse - we know there is some sort of afterlife and it doesn't seem to be something to be afraid of, so it's perfectly fine to not want to punish people by killing them - it's far better to either give them some form of punishment alive (Azkaban) or, if such thing is possible - give them a second chance.

** I always thought that it was assumed given Rowling's message. The entire point about how Horcruxes were so terrible because they required you to kill somebody and that split your soul every time. And he made seven! He also filled an entire lake with the zombies of his victims, and slaughtered innocents left and right, but nobody cares about that. She bent over backwards to get Harry through a literal terrorist coup/civil war (both ways) without killing, even pulling the bs "Power of Love" deflecting Voldemort's own curse back at him. Given that Dumbledore is the wise mentor who Harry aspires to emulate, it is reasonable to assume that he must be the personification of this in universe.
