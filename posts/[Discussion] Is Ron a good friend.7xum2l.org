Looking for insight from you. That's right, you, the person reading this right now. I have read and written both Ron as a friend and not a friend. I see points in both sides. He sacrificed himself in first year in the chess game. Went to the Chamber of Secrets with Harry, although to save his sister. Not sure about his positive and negatives in third book book but sure there are some. 4th book abandoned Harry in moment of need, but eventually came around I guess. 5th book went with him to DOM. 6th year can't remember if he believed Harry about Draco or not. 7th year went on the journey, and although swayed by the horcrux, still abandoned them but saved Harry. Also, did Hermione and Harry have any major fights? (just curious) Please give your thoughts and opinions (and shouldn't have to say this, but be please be respectful to others opinions!) Thanks!


** I think Ron is probably the "realest" friend Harry has, in a sense that he is someone I could picture being an actual person by the traits shown in the books. He becomes friends with Harry by chance. One wrong word, or if he had been in a foul mood, and his friendship with Harry wouldn't have become a thing. His shortcomings, in his personal character and in his friendships are very relateable. He has his own mind, his own problems, his own interests and reacts accordingly.

I think a lot of people hate Ron because he reminds them of their own shortcomings and weaknesses. None of us are perfect friends - and many of us want something like Harry and Ron have. Which is why his mistakes in this brotherhood irk us something fierce.

Nah, they lived together. If you live with somebody and you're reasonably compatible, you'll inevitably end up as friends. Just because you have a bad first couple of encounters with somebody doesn't mean you won't eventually figure out that you like them. That's exactly what happened with Harry/Ron and Hermione.

2. The thing that sent Hermione crying to that bathroom? She overheard Ron talking to Harry /not Ron yelling/telling her that stuff/, but merely a dude venting to his bro about the annoying girl who is smart but is incredibly irritating.

** I think he's Harry's */best/* friend. People always talk about him abandoning Harry, and they're right, even though Ron was completely justified in both instances and was even the bigger man and apologized. But Ron has never directly went against Harry. Like the saying, "A friend (Hermione) will be there to bail you out of jail, but a best friend (Ron) will be in the next cell saying, 'Damn, that was fun!'" People often forget that while Ron may not always be /at/ Harry's side, there's never been a time he wasn't /on/ Harry's side. Think about the broomstick or the potions book.

And Ron has always put Harry first. Forget the chess game, since he did that to stop Voldemort, but look in the context of some of the smaller situations. He went into the Forbidden Forest knowing full well there were spiders, which he's deathly afraid of, for Harry's and Hermione's sake. He stood up to Sirius, saying if he wanted to kill Harry, he'd have to kill him first. And a big moment for me, is how he correlates Harry to family. The most apparent of these moments is with Harry's relationship with Ginny. With Dean, or Michael, or whoever, Ron treats them all with disdain and is pretty much against the thought of Ginny with any boy in general, but Harry's the exception and Ron doesn't make a fuss of it.

The point is, Ron has his flaws. He's overly emotional, prone to anger, foulmouthed, lazy, insensitive, insecure, and many other things, but he's still Harry's best friend, and with good reason. Is your best friend perfect? I doubt it, but they're still your best friend because you understand each other, have been through a lot together, and are always there one another when in need.

** Ron is a much better friend to Harry than Harry is to Ron. It's far easier to find examples of Ron being there for Harry, having Harry's back, supporting Harry and so on, than it is to find examples of Harry doing the same for Ron.

I think people who complain about Ron often greatly identify with Harry, to the point where they instantly forgive or even ignore Harry's shortcomings or character flaws. In a way, this is a testimony to JKR's ability to write Harry as a reader-insert character.

Harry is the main character, and the one whose POV we follow throughout the series. We get to know how he thinks and feels, how he experiences the world. His characterisation, compared to just about every other character in the books, is pretty weak... he has just enough personality to avoid becoming a cardboard cutout, but just little enough personality that it's easy for most readers to identify with him.

And because Harry is a reader-stand-in, you do get to see how other people appear to him, but not so much how he appears to other people. So it's not always as apparent to the reader because we spend most of the books in his head, but Harry is INCREDIBLY self-centered. For the most part, he really only cares about himself and the things that directly affect him.

He's not mean, cold or unfeeling... he very easily feels sympathy or pity for others, he'll go through hell and back to help people in danger, and he's extremely forgiving. But he generally isn't very INTERESTED in other people, not even his best friends. He never takes the time to find out how they are doing, he never tries to find out anything about them, and he really has no interest in them as people. He also has a tendency to take people for granted, he gets peeved if they aren't considerate enough towards him and his feelings, but he hardly ever bothers to give them and their feelings the same consideration.

In his friendships with Ron and Hermione, he TAKES far more than he GIVES, and he doesn't seem to really get this. Partly because nobody ever really calls him out on it. His nastier moments (and boy does he have them!) are always glossed over and instantly forgiven. Harry never has to apologise to anyone, and he's hardly ever made to reflect on whether he may have behaved badly or inconsiderately.

I'm fairly certain that if the books had been from Ron's POV but everything else had been the exact same... people would have written tons of Power!Ron stories and had long rants about what a terrible friend and overal bad person Harry was.

Definitely.

However, the Harry Potter series have as main thematic questions the effects of true love & the difference of how good and bad people deal with their flaws. Ron is indeed deeply flawed; sometimes he acts selfishly, sometimes he acts cowardly and sometimes he is envious and jealous. How does he deal with it? He realises he was wrong, apologises and tries to do better. Snape is shown to have similar flaws. How does he deal with them? He wallows in self-hate, he despises others and he is never wrong in his mind.

So yeah, Ron is easily a good friend.

** Well...I suppose Ron is a bit irresponsible; he doesn't really gravitate towards learning, he snaps at Malfoy a lot, he forgets to research Buckbeak's case, um...stuff like that, he does tend to be a laziness-inducing influence on Harry.

His worst points...well, he blew up at Hermione in third year (but he thought Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers after he warned her about it and she did nothing), and he got mad at Harry in fourth year (somewhat understandable jealousy, and it ended after three weeks when it was revealed how the supposedly-safe Tournament involved dragons), and he left Harry & Hermione in seventh year (but that was almost completely the influence of the horcrux)...and I suppose he was a bit doubtful about Harry's 'Draco's a Death Eater' theory in 6th year.

That's...about all the bad points I can think of regarding Ron. He's a bit lazy and his emotions can get the better of him, but aside from that, nothing. I guess that makes him a good friend by default.

*** I don't know... DOES he get easily jealous? I know everyone keeps saying jealousy is a major trait of Ron's, but... how often do we see him display it? When it comes to Harry, hardly ever.

Usually when Harry gets something really good, or his celebrity status gets him special privileges or makes sure he gets out of trouble, or he's shingled out in a positive way, Ron couldn't be more thrilled for him. He thinks it's SUPER-COOL that Harry gets an ultra-rare Invisibility Cloak, or becomes the youngest Seeker in a Century, or gets off scot-free from blowing up his aunt. Even when these things don't include Ron, or benefit him in any way -- even when Harry gets everything and Ron gets nothing, Ron is generally just thrilled for Harry.

The jealousy issue comes up exactly ONCE, and that's in GOF. And even there it seems to be less of a jealousy thing and more a sense of hurt that Harry might have sneaked his own name into the Goblet of Fire and didn't even think to include Ron. They'd talked about ways to try and fool the Goblet TOGETHER, so when it looked like Harry had just gone off without Ron, that was a slap in the face. Especially since for the last three years, Fate has seemed to conspire against Ron to make sure he's always excluded from everything important Harry does. Of course this isn't Harry's fault, but by now it has become such a consistent pattern that it's hard not to wonder... is Ron being excluded on PURPOSE?

Harry didn't really help matters by snapping at Ron, refusing to explain anything and call him stupid. During their fights, Harry is by far the nastier one... and yet, I notice that while Ron tries to apologise for his behaviour later on, Harry never even seems to consider that he has anything to apologise for.

I think Harry would be a much more trying friend than Ron.

** tl;dr: No. He's barely even a friend. Certainly not a good one.

#+begin_quote
  He sacrificed himself in first year in the chess game.
#+end_quote

He's brave. Ron is almost the perfect Gryffindor. IMHO there should be a lot more Gryffindors like Ron or McClaggen, but they need to be the "good House" in the books.

He's not sacrificing himself (in a chess game, I don't think he thought he'd die) for a friend, but because that's what Heros do in that situation. For the glory and the fame and all that. That's also why he's jealous of Harry during the tournament or why he wants to be quidditch captain and a prefect. He's very superficial and single minded.

#+begin_quote
  4th book abandoned Harry in moment of need, but eventually came around I guess.
#+end_quote

That's what called a "flag in the wind". Harry just did something amazing... Ron could hardly go on being the only Gryffindor who was still upset with Harry.

#+begin_quote
  and although swayed by the horcrux, still abandoned them but saved Harry.
#+end_quote

Sure, that's just "author fiat" though, a narrative convenience. The author needed a way to bring Ron back without having a big fight and what's better than give him an opportunity to save Harry - even though the timing and whole situation is very ridiculous.

If HP were a crime novel I'd be wondering about the convenience of it all and Ron being somehow involved in Harry's almost drowning, but it's just bad writing instead.

I'm extremely concerned about people who claim that this is "realistic" and therefore okay. Yeah sure, it's probably realistic, but in real-life I wouldn't be friends with a guy like Ron either. Betrayal is a deal breaker and I have ended plenty of friendships/acquaintances for much less-serious events than turning their back on me during a deadly tournament or while being hunted by rapists and murderers and their insane Overlord. Doing the whole betrayal thing twice is just beyond the pale. Is it wrong to have standards? Harry embracing Ron again and again with alls his faults and flaws paints an interesting psychological angle (the abused lonely child, desperately looking for friends even when they don't deserve his attention), but I'm sure that wasn't JKRs intent. If you want me to like Ron there should have been a scene like: "Haha, Harry, did you really think I would betray my best friend *again* after the horrible thing I did during the tournament? That's silly, you're my best friend and we're in this together till the end!"

It's not like I want to hate Ron, he just rarely does the right thing after Book 2&3. Not to mention that I hold Ron responsible for Harry slacking off in school as much as he does. There's plenty of fanfics that explored the idea of Harry, the boy who was excited about learning magic and reading all his books before school, being friends with more studious people or just in general people who work for their goals instead of expecting to get them handed to them like Ron (why exactly is Ron a prefect?). JKR wanted to have her Hero win with Love, Friendship and Magic than with skill though.

In summary:

Ron is a horrible person and I'd want nothing to do with him. JKR did a bad thing by implying that it is more important to have many friends or falling in love than honoring principles and basic human decency. Ron could maybe change his ways, but it needs a wake up call and not this stupid coddling ("Oh, it's all okay now, it's behind us! It's not like you have some kind of deep seated flaws that need serious work! Just forget about it!"). It's the same bullshit that JKR pulled with Dumbledore and "everyone needs a chance to be redeemed". No consequences for terrible behaviour is not a good thing.

That's just silly. Yes, of course he is evil: He tried to murder Dumbledore and almost killed some of his school mates in the process. That's pretty straight up evil. He also let a bunch of terrorists (murderers and rapists) in a school full of little children. He's also ultimately responsible for all the torture that Muggleborns had to suffer at the hands of the Carrows.

He's evil.

That he's too much of a coward and would rather let others do the dirty work doesn't really diminish his evilness. Pettigrew is also evil and doesn't get a pass for trying to save his own hide.

He would have been evil if he did that 'on his own free will', but Voldemort would have killed his entire family if he didn't follow orders. And he didn't want that, did he? "He's also ultimately responsible for all the torture that Muggleborns had to suffer at the hands of the Carrows."

Ahem...no...Crabbe and Goyle actually enjoyed doing the 'torture', whereas Draco was forced to by Lord Voldemort, because otherwise his entire family would have been killed.

"He's evil."

In his defence, he didn't kill, torture, or control anyone on his own free will? Voldemort would have had his entire family killed if he didn't follow his orders. Your opinion is your own though, in the end, because I can't badger anyone to change.

"That he's too much of a coward and would rather let others do the dirty work doesn't really diminish his evilness. Pettigrew is also evil and doesn't get a pass for trying to save his own hide."

Just like Snape, he was one of the only Death Eaters that could feel love, but he ISN'T good, either.

"After the events in HBP Draco is pretty much irredeemable." ? Well, he did save Harry, Ron and Hermione in Malfoy Manor, as without him not identifying them, Harry would have been killed by Voldemort. In my previous post, I said he wasn't evil, but he was not good either.

I'm not going to give him or his parents credit for wasting years of opportunities to avoid this foreseeable outcome. You don't get to deliberately put yourself in a position where you'll have to choose between the life of your family or becoming a murderer and then expect pity. Same goes for Snape. It's not like they suddenly find themselves in their unfortunate positions through no fault of their own. Or in other words "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes". The Malfoys are elite Death Eaters, they know exactly what is involved in following Voldemort and I'm convinced Draco had many many more opportunities than Andromeda to move away from that lifestyle. But he was perfectly fine with killing all the Muggleborn, as long as he didn't have to get his own hands dirty.

Are your saying that only full blown psychopaths qualify as evil? I don't care if they loved someone, they are still evil fucks. Some of the worst atrocities have been done by people who deeply care and love their family and friends. If you can't feel love and have actual brain damage is actually a pretty good excuse not to be judged too harshly.

Well yeah that's why I said irredeemable. It means that taking a 1 day vacation from your job as a terrorist isn't really going to be enough to make up for all the pain and misery. Imagine being this unhinged and leading someone like those AR-15 school shooters in a school full of children. Draco did that. With a bunch of Death Eaters, who are probably worse. It's only thanks to JKR that it didn't turn into a total massacre.
