**** Neither have I. There's very few stories where he's really well written. Oh God Not Again, also by Sarah (she likes the guy for some reason), is the best off the top of my head though I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6849022/1/An-Old-and-New-World][Old and New World]] by Lens of Sanity, and it has a much smarter Lockhart than canon, and also includes a plot element I've been looking for since 2010/1 and nobody bloody told me already existed, which if you've been around here long enough you've seen me whine about a whole bunch but I don't want to spoil it for you in case you haven't.

*** Fun story, this. It should be mentioned that it is very much a humor/friendship piece, with little real storyline or challenges facing the characters. A Sarah1281, and if you've read any of her stuff, you probably know the tone I'm talking about.

*** Damn, just finished that. That was a good read. Never cared for Lockhart, but he does have potential when taken like this.

I also now realize, why is there no HP/FF7 crossover linking on the Lockhart name?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9458931/1/The-New-Dark-Lord][The New Dark Lord]] by TheFlowerOfTheCourt

Harry won at the Battle of Hogwarts, but corruption still controlled the Ministry. With the help of his 'friends', they send him to Azkaban. Haunted with his worst memories by the Dementors, Harry starts to plot his escape and his revenge on the world. His first plan? To free and enlist the help of Grindelwald. Dark!Harry; HP/GD. SLOW UPDATES UNTIL COMPLETION OF THE SOUL WITHIN!

Only posting this because you said you wanted Grindelwald or Regulus. In my opinion, Grindelwald isn't nearly as much as a mentor in this story as Regulus was in Dead Man Walking, but he still has the role.

** Every story by cywscross should be considered abandoned from the first chapter. The author is constitutionally unable to finish stories, content to start story after story, then leaving them for the next shiny. It's bad enough that I won't even start any new stories by the author (who, coincidentally, just posted four new chapters of a new Bleach fic last night).

Perhaps you might try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7165521/1/Don-t-Disrespect-the-Queen][Don't Disrespect the Queen]] by Perspicacity? Harry's mentored by Connor MacLeod (crossover with the first Highlander film).

Edit: editorializing on cywscross.

huh, i have read that summary several times while looking for new fics and always ignore it becuase it sounds like your average Indy!harry fic which i kind find of dull most of the time

Should i give it a chance?, i don't want to waste my time reading something i will drop in the second or third chapter

***** It's certainly Indy!harry, but it's not completely derivative like so many are.

For one, it begins during Harry's 4th school year, so there's no "I killed Sirius!" angst, no shopping trip (no super!wand, no super!trunk, etc), no weepy letter from Harry's parents found in the vault that the good!super!Goblins led him to, no weepy message from Sirius in his will, and no showing off Harry's collections of fancy titles and Head of House rings.

It also portrays a manipulative!Dumbledore who is actually marginally competent, which means Harry can't just deliver [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam][inane melodramatic speeches]] to defeat him. And the fic actually portrays the horror of mind magic realistically.

BUT, it is indy!Harry, so maybe that's just not your thing. Also, the prose can get way too purple for my taste. And it's on hiatus :(

****** I don't need to read past the summary (most of the time) to know I won't like an Indy!Harry Evil!Manipualtive!Dumbledore Weasley!bashing or a Powerful!Dark!harry Fic but sometimes is good to ask someone it's opinion because some writters are terrible at writing sumaries but quite decent at actual story telling

For example I would never read The Denarian Renegade if not for a recomendation from someone here in this subreddit because from the outset sounds like your average powerfull harry even through it's actually quite good.

Yet I don't have the time to read every fic out there to find if it's actually decent or worth the read.

**** This was the one I was thinking of, thank you.

It's been a while since I read this, but if I recall correctly the fic was very original (to me anyway), very well written, and had plausible premises or at least the author made attempts to fill plot holes without resorting to miracles.

It's hard to recommend things to readers without knowing their tastes, but I would feel reasonably confident recommending this to anyone in this subreddit.

** I suppose [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][this]] and to a far lesser extent [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][this]] applies, as mentor Voldemort fics of sorts.

The first, PotDK, is the one you'll have heard about as having the best Voldemort in town, and is a long-spanning AU set in a world where Voldemort won, and ends up mentoring Harry to be his "prince". Great example of worldbuilding, but it must be said that it is a very long and sprawling fic, (a million words and in the sixth year) and features some rare examples of mythology and paganism (done well).

What Lies Beneath is very much the opposite, being a tightly plotted and compact fic, which basically has Riddle influencing Harry after the events of second year. More recommending because I finished it today and have it on the brain than applicability, tbh, but a very high-quality read.

Neither are slash, ftr.
