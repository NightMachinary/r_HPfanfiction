I'm looking for the best fics that are centered around the professors at Hogwarts! It can be the original professors (Snape, Flitwick, McGonagall, etc) or make next-gen fics where Neville, Hermione, Harry, Ron, etc become professors.

Just anything with cute scenes of them in the teachers lounge, or playful banter between professors of opposing houses. Iâ€˜m dying to see the professors dealing with unruly students, and grading papers etc. :) just any behind the scenes of the teachers type of a story!

Thank you!

Edit: thank you everyone for the great suggestions! :)


** linkffn(3124159) definitely comes to mind, and I'm super interested to see what other suggestions people have. RemindMe! 3 days

(Can you do the two bots at once? I guess I'm about to find out.)

EDIT: Yessss it works

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11687216/1/The-Carriage-Held][The Carriage Held]] has some great scenes focused on Snape and the other professors (day to day interaction, bets between teachers, pranks, occasional staff parties, friction with Umbridge and related humor, etc.) I particularly like the friendship between Snape and McGonnagal and the interaction with Professor Vector at the staff Christmas party. linkffn(11687216)

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  Albus believes in knitting as hugs, friendship as armor, laughter as a weapon, love as a power, the redemption of Death Eaters, and today, sadly, basilisks. What he can't believe is what one uninvited DADA teacher has done to his unusually serious and important end-of-term staff meeting. Or, some days, that he employs any of these clow---highly qualified and very professional people.

  "Albus Dumbledore discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late one evening, after she found out about the marriage of Dougal McGregor to another woman. She confessed the whole story to him, and Albus Dumbledore offered both comfort and wisdom, telling Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship," says JKR. This is a development---actually, four possibilities, one per chapter, of how it could have looked, sounded, felt like to a younger Minerva McGonagall and a less ancient Albus Dumbledore. This story was featured on The Petulant Poetess for october-november 2013.
