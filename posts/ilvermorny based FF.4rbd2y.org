Obviously I'm not expecting full length stories yet. However, has anyone seen the promising beginnings of stories based in the American school.

As an aside, because I know the A. Quick stories will inevitably get brought up whenever there's a question about American wizardry, I've read those stories.


** What is "ilvermorny"?

** I think the potential for new and original fics could be really cool and a good boost for the fandom. As a non-American though, I do like that HP is one fandom not saturated in Americanisms and would hate to see American spellings etc pop up in fics again.

Td;lr I'm from 'straya and we follow USA like Colin Creevey follows Harry

*** I understand! It seems like I'm a little early on the request as of now. I have no doubt - as you say - that Ilvermorny stories will give a boost to the fandom, it just seems like we'll have to wait a bit.
