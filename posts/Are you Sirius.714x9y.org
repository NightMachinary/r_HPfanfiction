** Tonks, because Teddy shouldn't have lost both parents, and she's more likely to step up rather than fall into a self-destructive 'I'm not worthy' depression like Lupin would. All the others are effectively single.

Fred would be my second choice.

That said, I think Harry should hunt down the Resurrection Stone and call Albus back for a few heated conversations, but the last thing he needs is Albus taking a role in things once again.

** Top 3 choices:

1: Tonks (Because of Harry/Tonks possibilities, Tonks deserving to be a mother, and having one of the coolest abilities ever)

2: Sirius Black (Because he deserved a life as Harry's Godfather and could have done so much for society as a "good" Black)

3: Fred Weasley (Because losing a twin has got to be one of the most heartbreaking things ever and George needs him)

** Bellatrix, because Helena Bonham Carter?

More seriously (I guess...), maybe Luna's mum. Because I'm almost certain nobody's gonna pick her and because I'm genuinely curious how it would impact everything. I think it could make an excellent for want of a nail story.

*** Neither one is in the shown choices but Luna's mom actually is a really neat and likely overlooked idea.

** My top 3 would be:

1. Sirius; depending on how his return happened, his could potentially be the most interesting to me since it opens the door to what's on the other side of the Veil and/or how would this effect other characters, especially Harry.
2. Cedric; again, not only was his death incredibly traumatic for Harry but with his death happening so early on, it'd be interesting to see how his return would effect the rest of the characters.
3. Tonks; for a variety of reasons not the least of which was that I felt she deserved better than what she got.
