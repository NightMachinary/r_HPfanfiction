** This reminds me of a cracky idea I had.

A slightly less blind Dumbledore realizes how Harry's treated during first year, and asks a friend to move in with him.

Cue the mentor of a lifetime as Mad Eye Moody moves in.

Though I like the idea of him hiding in a cloak for a while and then stepping up the first time Vernon gets yelly with Harry.
