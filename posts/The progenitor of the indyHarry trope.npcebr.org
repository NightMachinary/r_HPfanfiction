Just as the title says, I'd like to know the one fic which gave birth to the idea of Dumbledor dosing him with loyalty potions and compulsions and armorentia, stealing from his vault trying to marry him off to the Weaslys, detecting andgetting that stuff removed by paying goblins becoming super op , rich and edgy as well as suddenly being related to every important magical family to the point where he has a name that is even longer than Dumbledor's.

And some plus point if it's a Tom/Harry and of course Tom had always been actually good and he too was just a victim of the evil schemes of !EvilDumbledor.

No judging but this used so often that I would like to know how the original was to compare it to the new ones.


** It's unlikely that one story gave birth to all these tropes. More likely, there were several progenitors, and not necessarily all at the same time.

*** Hmm, then would you happen to know at least the indepandant trope? At one point I see them as a inseperable thing as they usually come in this kind of "package".

**** I believe that the progenitor of the "indy!Harry" genre was Poison Pen

***** Of the modern ones maybe, but there were thousands of attempts at Indy!harrys before Poison Pen (2009). The big wave likely came during the lull period between the 4th and 5th books(2000-2003) and the 5th and 6th books (2003-2005). I recall hundreds of the honestly poorly written 'Summer after 4th year' fics during the early 2000s before OOTP came out, where Harry has to suddenly change because Voldemort is back and he saw Cedric die. They increased pretty heavily after OOTP came out with Harry making his own 'faction' other than the Death Eaters, or the Order.

Whatever that old website where Bobmin and Summer of Change and all those were originally hosted was likely one of the more popular original attempts of indie!harrys canonically

****** True, but Poison Pen formed the archetypal example of that fic, complete with gratuitous bashing of other characters, extreme numbers of lordships, and dismantling the entire magical world using Harry's "genius intelligence"
