Hey everybody, im looking for a harry Potter fanfiction with harry part of a mage's association after beating Voldemort, also if I remember well he uses dual wands in his fighting style, he is also very paranoid.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13365454/1/Casting-Shadows]] fits the bill, somewhat. Harry in the later chapters is part of a mage "family" and fights horrors.
