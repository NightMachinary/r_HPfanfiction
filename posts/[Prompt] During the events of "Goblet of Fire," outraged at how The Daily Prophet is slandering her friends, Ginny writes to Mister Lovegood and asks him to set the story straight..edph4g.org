I acknowledge that Ginny didn't have an overly positive view of the Quibbler in canon, but she seemed the most logical choice to make the request, as Hermione disdains the Quibbler and Luna isn't Harry's friend yet. And the notion that Xenophilius would be more directly opposed to Rita Skeeter's libelous writings is one I think worth exploring.


** Something like this happens in A Thorny Rose, by Brennus. Ginny convinces Harry to be interviewed for the Quibbler (by Luna) to counter Skeeter.

*** It's more trustworthy than the Prophet!

(Also, Luna and Scamander did canonically find a bunch of such creatures, except for the Snorkak)

**** Of course it's more trustworthy than the prophet, hard to be worse than a combination gossip rag/propaganda dispenser.

*** I remember in canon they did do this, while Harry and the others were on the run/looking for Horcruxes as well.

It'd be interesting to see it explored more.
