Granted, this is probably due more to fanfiction than canon portrayal of Ginny, but I just realised. So if Harry Potter were rewritten in GrimmAnderson world, who would be who? I think Hermione being Belle would be one obvious take. On the other hand, could be Fleur, and Bill being the Beast. Or Tonks and Remus.

Rumpelstiltskin is Voldemort, obviously. I suppose Harry could be the king's son. Or Cinderella.

(for the most part, try to stick to original characters, not disney-ified ones!)


** Ginny reminds me of Red Riding Hood, personally- naive girl gets stalked by a predator and when she starts asking questions of her suspiciously acting 'trustworthy' grandmother, the wolf jumps out and eats her. And then the woodcutter/Harry comes along later to cut her out of the wolf's stomach/stab the diary and save her life.

*** This is an excellent analogy. I like it! Ginny as Red is confirmed.

** Probably a bit of a stretch, but I can sort of see Snape as Kai from the Snow Queen.

*** Nope, I can totally see this! Though Lily didn't love him the way Gerda did Kay, of course, his love for her did save him
