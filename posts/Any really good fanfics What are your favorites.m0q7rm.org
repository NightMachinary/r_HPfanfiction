As the title suggests, are there any really good fanfics anyone knows of? I'm in the time span where I'm looking for something new. My all time favorite is Shadowed Malice, by Oceanbreeze7. That entire story is just.... perfect. Reply if you have any, or if you just want to talk about your favorite!


** I have a whole list of fanfics that are my favourite and I enjoyed a /lot/. But if I narrow it down, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] by /Tsume Yuki/ is the very first Harry Potter fanfiction I've ever read and I keep going back to it because I love it so much. Harry is Master of Death and gets reborn all over the centuries in no particular order but one notable time he is Sirius' and Regulus' older brother and he'd raise hell for them. Complete. Gen.

And pretty much all HP work of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/LullabyKnell/pseuds/LullabyKnell/works?fandom_id=136512][LullabyKnell]] because she's my favourite author. Her worldbuilding and writing is pure bliss.

Lastly, I just have to link this one because it's golden. BAMF Lily Evans Potter!

  Dumbledore explains Lily why it is vital that Harry and his twin brother are seperated.

** I think my favourite is linkffn(extradition escape) but I also really like linkao3(evitative) and linkao3(hermione granger hogwarts crammer for delinquents on the run)

I know two of those are drarry (although only at the end in Evitative) and I'm not really the biggest drarry fan but they just felt well written. I'm not a fan of romance fics but they seemed to do it well and didn't focus on the romance too much.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

#+begin_quote
  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup - to escape where the contract can't follow; across borders where the Ministry's laws can't follow him. Where he goes changes him, and those who remained change too. Desperate measures implemented change how paths are walked for not just Harry but others too.

** My favourites are probably (Sorry but most of these are probably Drarry)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23636362/chapters/56728846][Oxytocin]]

Hogwarts Eight Year, complete fluff and had my heart aching throughout the whole thing, in a good way though.

[[http://insecure.archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]]

It's just how can you not like it? Its magic is interesting and the story is good as well.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23815003/chapters/57220303][Everything Black]]

Have to admit there are only 12 chapters but its not dropped. And it has a lot of potential.

Sorry if you dont like Drarry,

Have a night day!

** My favorites keep changing depending on where my head is at. Right now my all time favorite is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28860678][Pandemic]]. Like many folks I am having a pretty bad time during the quarantine and lockdowns. So this fic about Harry getting through the pandemic really resonated with me. It's written really well, the story is original, great characterizations. Like you said, the entire story is just perfect for me right now.

** Shadowed Malice is...well I wrote it (I'm the author) when I was 12. If you'd like, I've rewritten it (slightly different plot but similar aspects and concepts) and it's called Antithesis! Thank you for enjoying my work!

*** I love Antithesis too, but the original will always hold a special place in my heart. I just find myself continuing to come back to it every few months or so, and every time I finish it, there's a massive hole in my chest. Thank you for writing two masterpieces of HP fanficiton!
