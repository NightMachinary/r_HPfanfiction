** Well, this is just a small tip on writing dialogue that might be obvious already, but I'll offer it anyway:

Manufacture pauses yourself.

When people speak in everyday life or when actors read scripts, there's naturally going to be some pauses throughout. People don't just recite paragraphs with no breaks. Sometimes they linger on a thought, change the direction of the conversation, take a breath, etc. And while readers are mostly intelligent enough to insert those pauses themselves, I've found that it's better as a writer to do it for them. It's just cleaner that way and reads more smoothly.

The way you do this is by inserting dialogue/action tags that physically read the amount of time you want the pause to take. (# of words is proportional to length of pause)

So, here are two lines of dialogue without manufactured pauses:

1) "I'm Harry. Harry Potter."

2) "The name's Potter. Don't wear it out."

And with:

1) "I'm Harry," he said, "Harry Potter."

2) "The name's Potter," he said, crossing his arms and giving her a wink. "Don't wear it out."

These are really simple examples that may seem obvious, but when it comes to reading long scenes of dialogue, I find that many times, I'm mentally inserting pauses myself so that it reads more naturally. As a writer, you can save the reader's energy by doing it for them.

This can also be applied when one character says something, and you want the next character to pause for a moment before responding back. For example:

(Without pauses)

"I killed a man once," he said.

"What?"

(With pauses)

"I killed a man once," he said.

Her eyes shot up to meet his. "What?"

Or alternatively:

"I killed a man once," he said, staring at a spot in the distance.

"What?"

There you have it. Simple, but effective.

** A few takeaways from a decade of fanfiction writing:

- No matter how good something is that you wrote, there will always be a plurality of readers who absolutely hate it.

- And there will be another faction who will read the most bizarre shit into your motivations for writing: that you're a warmongering fascist, a country-hating hippie, a closet homosexual with daddy attachment issues, a Trump voter. And you'll wonder what torturous logical leaps they needed to go from "Harry kissed Hermione" to that.

- Your best writing will get the least attention. Your least impressive work will get the most. Without fail.

- Covey was right: begin with the end in mind. Have a general plot outline. Chew on the story in your head for awhile before you even begin. You need more than just an idea; you need pegpost scenes that you can play in your head before turning it into text. Humans evolved over millions of years to develop a six-layered neocortex, enabling them to simulate actions and outcomes in their heads before putting them down to paper. Use your evolutionarily granted gifts.

- It's never /just/ a story.

*** The second point is hilariously true. I've been accused by at least five people of being a sixteen year old goth girl with mommy issues because I wrote The Pureblood Princess.

I am none of those things. But good luck convincing the accusers of that. The best part is the ones that state it in an accusatory manner and then promptly try to flirt with me.

** Write in advance - don't ever be releasing chapters without at least a good plan for the next one. I write one chapter ahead at all times, and ensure that each is fully proofread before I release the /previous/ one. It lets me keep on top of where I'm going, and also not feel pressured to constantly write-release-repeat.

If you get writer's block (which is officially the worst thing ever), take some time out, unless you can get something productive from it. I can't, so when I've got writer's block, I don't write. I go and play video games, or read a book, or watch a movie, or go for a pint. When I feel like it, I come back to my work - which ties into this next bit: be careful with any kind of release schedule. You write fanfiction because you want to, and because you enjoy it (I hope), and if it becomes a chore to write and release stuff just to stay on time, then you're doing it wrong. Don't promise new chapters within any time-frames, and let the readers deal with it if they want more - it's /never/ your job as a writer to appease them.

Use the 'smart lookup' and 'definition' functions on Microsoft Word if you've got it - otherwise, I recommend Dictionary.com and Thesaurus.com, they're fantastic resources for vocabulary and such.

Most importantly, enjoy what you write, enjoy your ideas! If you don't enjoy the creative process, it'll show in your work more often than not. Have fun, and don't listen to everything reviewers might say!

** - Don't trust any feedback you get in reviews.

- Don't overdo yourself on wordcount per day. Writers Block can also stem from some kind of writers-burnout.

- Prepare at least a small overview of what your story is about and the plot. Helps you focus on the story and keeps you from writing filler chapters.

- Remember: Reviews, Favorites and Follows don't mean shit. Of the Top3 most reviewed fics on FFN, 2 are absolute horseshit and one is HPMOR. Write what you want to write, the Internet-points you collect are just a bonus.

** I guess I'll start and throw in my 2 cents first.

If there is one thing I've learnt in my first year of writing fanfic, it's that if you know that a chapter is going to be controversial amongst your readers, you should pre-write the next few chapters before posting it. Writing a chapter while you are receiving feedback on a controversial chapter isn't . . . . let's just say that it isn't a fun experience. You'll be /very/ tempted to give up, so its best not to give yourself the chance.

** Don't be afraid to disagree with people.

If you have a completely different opinion about how magic works, how x or y might function, how characters might respond to situations, that's fine and normal: whole university departments are built on the understanding that different people will have different analyses of set texts. If you want to back it up to other people, have your evidence to hand, but you can genuinely just go based on something and write it as you want.

There's no actual law or some kind of enforcer of what is canon or what is an acceptable AU. You can pretty much do whatever you want, and some people might not like it, but some people probably will.

Most large groups of people will average incredibly low standards, and this is especially true of FFnet. Do whatever you feel like doing - the world won't end.

** 1. A good beta is worth their weight in gold. Nurture them and treat them like the rare and precious flower they are.

2. Manage your expectations. You might be lucky enough to find your stories are popular, but it isn't a given; there are no guarantees. Lack of attention doesn't necessarily mean you're not a decent writer, just perhaps that your taste is a bit different from the norm.

3. Do not argue with your reviewers. Ever. If you don't like what they say, thank them politely and move on.

This has never worked for me for some reason. I try forcing myself to writing while I'm blocked and half my characters are dead and the other half knocked into an alternate dimension within 10 minutes.

The trick that works for me is that I just write Luna. Something about writing pure insanity just tickles the block right out of my head.

** As several others have said, don't force yourself to a schedule. But I say /do/ let a schedule evolve naturally and use it.

The way to do this is to write several chapters and use them to figure out what your natural writing speed is before you ever post anything. That way, you'll have a buffer of a couple chapters, and you can set a schedule you /know/ you can keep because you've already done it.

Inform your readers anytime your schedule changes as a basic courtesy.

** 1. Don't get too attached to your ideas when writing a long story. If you really wanted one part of your story, but it no longer makes sense with a decision you've made, shelve the idea for another fic. I've found that to be better than awkwardly including the original idea.

2. When you hit writer's block for one fic, try writing something else. It may have nothing to do with what you want to be writing, but it will help get your mind working again.

3. As everyone else has said, don't take reviews too seriously. Some people will praise your work, some will say it's an affront against nature, and some will tell you to die. Just learn to take it all in stride, and keep writing.

4. Views, reviews, bookmarks, and comments all mean nothing. What's important is having fun writing.

** When I first started writing, I felt an almost guilty obligation to update quickly and regularly. I was getting stressed out, trying to make sure I made the readers were happy, but I had homework and tests to study for, and was wasting time trying to perfect the story at the expense of that stuff. So my bit of advice is that it's ok to want to make your readers happy and all that, but in the end you're doing this for fun. You're not getting paid. You're taking time out of your day to write this, and you probably have irl obligations in life that need to get done too. So don't let yourself get too worried about the readers and making /them/ happy, because that makes /you/ unhappy. And if /you're/ unhappy, the story will suffer, which makes the readers unhappy, which makes you unhappy...and I think you get the picture.
