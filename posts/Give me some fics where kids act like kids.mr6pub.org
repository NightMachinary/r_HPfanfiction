I've read so many fics where the kid characters feel like tiny adults, and that's not quite my cup of tea. Anyone got anything good for me?

(Bonus points for pre-Hogwarts fic!)


** I realized that I don't have much. Any way, I hope you like these, that are shorts and complete.

These first three are in Spanish, if you don't mind.

linkffn(12899937)

I always recommend it because it is so cute. It is about Harry and Sirius, some AU, I think.

linkffn(11593872)

It is about a Luna and his father.

linkffn(13858667)

or linkao3(75502619)

Harry and Dudley cooking.

So the last two are in English.

linkffn(7400990)

A Harry x Ginny.

linkffn(7058158)

Ginny go to Hogwarts.

  Hello journal. Today we have a prompt. Our prompt is our favrit family tradition. I do not have a favrit family tradition because I do not have a family. Signed, Harry Potter.

  Harry Potter's third form journal. A peek at pre-Hogwarts life.

Very soul-crushing type of fic, though- be warned. WIP, but ends at a note that feels complete.

  Tom laughed. “Are you barmy? The Silver Jubilee. The King's been ruling for twenty five years.”

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

** The Secret Life of Epsilon Brown has them mostly act like children - running out to the grounds to play footie, how those little green army men are superior for waging war to magical toys for 11 year old boy reasons, etc. He's a bit more mature than most for reasons that are explained, but it's literally the only fic I've seen with pickup football games, so it wins points for that.
