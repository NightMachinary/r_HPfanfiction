I would like to read a story where Harry or another character uses magical inventions to trick people into thinking they are uber powerful wizards, but in fact its all just illusions. Like appearing to stun an entire room but in reality uses a glass orb full of knockout potion or something. Or appearing to blow up a building with a spell but actually laid down runic bombs beforehand that charged themselves or something


** Not exactly tricking, but Harry in linkffn(Almost a Squib) has a similar premise.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

** Linkffn(What would Slytherin Harry do by Bid D on a Diet)

This Harry acknowledges the fact that he is not that powerful magically and uses tricks to make him look powerful. Saying anything further would give away the plot.

And in case you don't mind a long fic (around 250k words), there is linkffn(The many deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT) which has Harry using tricks whenever fight scenes arise.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
