Just a fun plot bunny that popped in my head. After Sirius' supposed betrayal of the blood traitor Potters, Walburga wants it official. Its not enough that everyone thinks Sirius is guilty she wants it proven in court so no one will have any doubt that Sirius has returned to the traditions/views of the Most Ancient and Noble house of Black. Walburga hounds Crouch night and day to schedule a trial for Sirius. Crouch, having enough of the old shrew, finally relents and schedules the trial. In the end Sirius is proven innocent, Walburga is furious and Crouch/the Ministry are embarrassed for throwing him in Azkaban without a trial. I'm sure Sirius will have some interesting comments/discussions with his friends/allies when Walburga is the one that gets him out of Azkaban and not his friends/allies. Any fics along this line or any others where Sirius is proven innocent soon after ending up in Azkaban would be most appreciated.

  AU Sirius Black gets a trial, is acquitted, but isn't allowed to take Harry from the Dursleys. What does he do? He moves in with the Dursleys, of course.

** I read this request after replaying the first Phoenix Wright game, and I am now imagining a fic where Phoenix defends Sirius and I must now thank but also curse you for making me think of that.

** I feel like there are a few fics like this: where someone discovers that Sirius didn't have a trial and they are pissed that it could happen to a (former) heir of a Noble and Ancient House.

** I could also see this playing out the same way it did for the other Death Eaters. She could have tried to get him off on the imperius defense or by bribing people.

*** No, as OP mentioned, she takes pride in showing the world that her son was the 'RIght Hand Man' of the Dark lord. She don't want him to plead any imperious.
