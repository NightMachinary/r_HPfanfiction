Do you prefer to read about Harry Potter with a personality transplant, or completely original characters in a similar situation?

With Harry, even if he acts differently, there are a few constants: His fame, his family and upbringing, and often his friends.

His base personality is a bit of a cypher, but he definitely is a natural at and loves flying and Quidditch, is quite humble, a little curious, brave, trusting, and impressionable. He begins excited about magic in general but grows less studious over the years.

For Want of a Nail-style fics often result in a quite different harry, but other will change him off the bat. At what point does it stop being worthwhile to fill Harry's shoes?

Fics around original characters have a lot more context to fill before the reader can start to understand, relate to, and predict the character, and if the first chapter's not exceptional, can be difficult for readers to start.

I, for one, took a long time to bother with the Alexandra Quick series, because it's virtually a new setting with an entire new cast. How much backstory do you prefer for original characters?

When it comes to setting, how much do the different divergences affect your enjoyment? Do you prefer Hogwarts and Britain, or do you like seeing new places?

Any other thoughts or opinions are welcome.


** I prefer my canon characters to be recognizable. If you don't write about Harry Potter don't call him Harry Potter. If his personality is different because of a different upbringing, that's fine, but even then some traits of canon Harry should be there.

** OOC every day of the week.

** If we are talking generally I'd go with OOC Harry, just because it's so much easier to get an original character botched.

That said, I do prefer good fanfiction with either different characters or a different settings. You get tired by constantly seeing Harry run around Hogwarts, except if it's handled with rare ingenuity.

** If a Canon character is OOC and there's and actual /reason/ for it, then I'm fine with it. Otherwise just give me an OC since that's clearly what you wanted to write anyway.

** I like seeing Harry in whatever form as long as we can follow and understand why he is different. For example I doubt Harry would be so self sacrificing if he grew up with his parents. Harry adopted by purebloods would be different. The same things like the prophecy apply so it just gives different views on it. The questionable OC called Harry are stuff like Knowledge is Power where Harry isn't BWL and is older and different and for all intents and purposes not Harry.

** I don't really enjoy canon Harry's personality, so I don't care if the fic stars Harry-in-name-only as long as the OOC character has consistent characterization /within/ the story.

** I don't have a problem with OCs (or original interpretations of minor characters). In fact, I'd rather have a well-done OC fill a gap in the story, rather than distorting a canon character. If we're going to see OOC Harry, that's fine too, he's an OC then. But there needs to be justification for why he's turned out that way (we know more about his background).

What I loathe is when writers distort canon Harry into something original. If you're going to write an OOC Harry, fine, but make it clear from the start what's different and how, and stick to it.

** That's assuming Harry Potter has a personality. And some authors take a few aspects of him and stretch them to infinity as his sole identity. "I want to be Normal" "dumbledores man" "save everyone! Never attack people in a way that can't be reversed in 5 seconds!" "Angst" I usually prefer OOC Harry then.

** Personally, I can't stand OC's...at all, unless they're side characters who are mentioned only briefly. They're usually Mary-sues standing in as self-inserts and I can't tolerate those at all. I'd definitely rather have an OOC Harry (or OOC anyone) over an OC.
