Looking for a HP/GW were they start as friends/very good friends, flirt with each other to annoy Ron and as the title states, turns into a romantic relationship between HP/GW...I'll also take your favorite/best HP/GW fics as well. Thanks!


** linkffn(3830952)

Doesn't quite match your request as they don't specifically flirt to annoy Ron (though it does happen), but a very good entry in the "started off as best friends" category.

  Their nightmares and demons bound them together. Their love helped them to survive. Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley knew they needed each other the trouble was in admitting it.

** OK, it is not Harry & Ginny (actually both of them are almost invisible in this story), but linkao3(17777138) seems to be heading exactly in this direction. Also, there was another story (from Lavender's POV) were the ridiculous love story between Ron & her was explained as her not very successful effort to get Ron & Hermione finally together.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)
