I'd like to start this post off by clarifying that I understand chess is a difficult game to master and requires a large amount of planning ahead to be successful in. So bearing in mind Ron's talent for chess in PS, it would make sense to assume that's he a strong tactician. My issue with this belief is Ron's tactical side is never brought up in the series ever again.

If Ron was so talented at strategising, you'd think that personality trait would be put to use more in a series with an ongoing war occurring. But nope, it never really does. The closest he comes to it would probably be when he thinks to retrieve the basilisk fang. But honestly, that moment felt like it was only there to make his kiss with Hermione a couple of pages later feel earned. Yet quite often when people talk about what Ron brings to the main trio, strategy ends up being mentioned. And I for one do not see it.

Is it more so that people want to believe he's a great tactician? Or they wish that piece of potential hadn't been squandered? Maybe that's the case, but as it is in canon, the only takeaway I get from Ron's skill for Wizards chess is that he happens to be good at Wizards chess.


** because chess is a frequent [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility][Informed Ability]] that reminds you [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess][Smart People Play Chess]]. Warning, TVTropes links.

The real issue, however, is that Rowling wasn't writing a war story, or a very compelling survivor's account, because it all amounts to "We did essentially nothing to help ourselves, others sacrificed themselves to make it possible, and in the end, we just got extremely lucky beyond reasonable doubt."

Because Harry Potter is Wizard Jesus and cannot be seen as aggressive in the slightest. Ron being strategically talented and leveraging that into an assault on Death Eaters is a no-no, because Harry Potter would have to be aggressive---and active instead of passive.

  He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.

  His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, *learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape.* Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out...though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love.

  On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys' returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness...

  The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows...Horcruxes...Hallows...Horcruxes...yet no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been slapped awake again.

  *Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why...*

This is Harry not only mastering Occlumency but also Legilimency , also as far as we know it there is no being bad at Occlumency , either you can use it or not. We have seen both Harry and Draco use it against powerful Wizards like Voldemort and Snape shortly after they learned it, with no appearance that a skilled Legilimens is harder to defend against than bad one.

​

And this is the scene of Harry not feeling the Cruciatus Curse.

#+begin_quote
  ‘You see?' screeched Voldemort over the tumult. ‘Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! /Crucio/!'

  Harry had been expecting it: knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the Forest floor, it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, *yet the pain he expected did not come*.

******* Britain was not essential to the war efforts. I'm sure nobody would have rejoiced if Britain signed a peace treaty with the Axis. And the UK was still on War rationing up to '54. They were quite frugal.

The thing is that in 1942, Japanese forces were poised to strike India. And Japan was getting most of it's supplies locally because of their stretched out supply lines. So a large stockpile of food in India would've enticed them to attack there even more. Furthermore in 1942 they still did not know how long the war would be, having a stockpile of basic food supplies is a basic idea of a long term war.

Harry is the best at DADA, and the proof was that he got an O in the OWL exam and taught the DA. Hermione is the best at research, and the proof is her always quoting library books and getting points in class. Ron, on the other hand, is inferior to Harry at the physical stuff (flying, dueling) and inferior to Hermione at the mental stuff (advanced spells, puzzles). If Ron didn't have his strategic skills, which adds something to the team dynamic that neither Hermione or Harry have, then he only has his sense of humor and being the Team Heart... but neither of those really fit on a stat sheet.

In my experience, "opposites attract" and "boy who pulls the girl's pigtails on the playground because he likes her" type relationships have never worked as well as those where the couple actually get along. Using bickering as an example of chemistry also leads to some strange implications, such as Draco Malfoy having some secret unrequited crush on Harry.

************ Personally, I'm a books-only kind of guy. The fandom seems to pick and choose what statements from JK Rowling to accept, like the canon status of Cursed Child. Like you just did, choosing to ignore the second half of the same interview where she says they'd be fine:

#+begin_quote
  JK: Oh, maybe she and Ron will be alright with a bit of counseling, you know. I wonder what happens at wizard marriage counseling? They'll probably be fine. He needs to work on his self-esteem issues and she needs to work on being a little less critical.

  Emma: I think it makes sense to me that Ron would make friends with the most famous wizard in the school because I think life presents to you over and over again your biggest and most painful fear ' until you conquer it. It just keeps coming up.

  JK: That is so true, it has happened in my own life. The issue keeps coming up because you are drawn to it and you are putting yourself in front of it all the time. At a certain point you have to choose what to do about it and sometimes conquering it is choosing to say: I don't want that anymore, I'm going to stop walking up to you because there is nothing there for me. But yes, you're so right, that's very insightful! Ron's used to playing second fiddle. I think that's a comfortable role for him, but at a certain point he has to be his own man, doesn't he?

  Emma: Yes and until he does it is unresolved. It is unfinished business. So maybe life presented this to him enough times until he had to make a choice and become the man that Hermione needs.

  JK: Just like her creator, she has a real weakness for a funny man. These uptight girls, they do like them funny. They do like them funny, they need them funny. It's such a relief from being so intense yourself ' you need someone who takes life, or appears to take life, a little more light heartedly.
#+end_quote

All of which is part of becoming an adult. In the entire series but especially in the later books, Ron is the one in the main trio that grows emotionally the most.

And the "wish fulfillment" bit is always misinterpreted.

#+begin_quote
  JK: What I will say is that I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione with Ron.
#+end_quote

In literature, the most prominent male and female lead tend to stick together. If she followed that literary trope, which is what you tend to do, she'd put Harry and Hermione together, but she chose Ron/Hermione instead due to "wish fulfillment" - aka, she liked them together better, so she wrote them to fit together better. It's a sub-plot for like 5 books, she setting them two up to be together isn't an accident - if she wanted another couple to make more sense, she should've written it that way. But she didn't.

--------------

I'm increasingly surprised by how this fandom seems to take normal teenage bratty behavior and turn it into psychopathic traits. How long ago were you a teenager? Were you super mature all the time? Did you never say stuff you regretted?

It's like taking the couple of weeks Ron and Harry were miffed with each other in GOF and making it seem like Ron's this evil bastard due to it. Just because he was a bit insecure and didn't know how to channel it, despite not even doing anything that bad and getting brushed off the first time he attempts reconciliation. It's an example I've seen on this sub more than once and it baffles me every time. Same with the classroom example you gave - it's mostly a miscommunication and escalation issue really. They show regret over the times they do shit like that later on, and as adults they probably wouldn't pull any of it to begin with, because hey - they're adults then.

They both grow up after that. End of DH Ron (before the epilogue obviously) is already twice the man HBP Ron ever was, and that's a year, he's still 18 by the end of it. We're talking about TEENS here. Saying the Ron we get to know in most of the books is immature and too insecure is a bit silly - he has plenty of reasons to be insecure, as the fandom keeps proving by hating on his lack of "specialness", and he's not even a legal adult in the muggle world until the end of the series.

This really isn't a good way to argue your point.

It's entirely possible for people to go through their teenage years without ever actually fitting the stereotype of being meaningfully immature.

Sometimes it's because they genuinely just were super mature as teens, and sometimes it's because they were simply never exposed to situations that revealed an immature side to them.

******** But that's not really all that goes into a good relationship, is it? Like maybe Harry and Hermione are more even on intelligence (though nothing in canon suggests either are even close to her level of intelligence), but so what? They are fundamentally incompatible for a romantic relationship. For one, it's not like Hermione wouldn't argue with Harry. In canon, she is regularly trying to force Harry into a discussion, which is really just her lecturing him and him trying to simply not have that discussion. Truth is Harry and Hermione communicate fairly poorly, and Ron and Hermione actually have much healthier communication (though perhaps not entirely healthy itself).

Also, regardless of whether they are in fact equal, Hermione does not actually treat Harry as an equal. Rather, she treats him like a little brother or a child who needs to be told the right way to act or think. Harry, meanwhile, plays the role of the little brother or child who refuses to discuss and instead snaps back or tries to run away from the lecture. He doesn't really listen to Hermione's arguments and stubbornly insists on going his own way.

A strong, compatible relationship does require both participants to be equals within the relationship, but that absolutely is not the dynamic Harry and Hermione have.

***** I wish JK had expanded on using Ron's knowledge of everything you mentioned and more. He's the guy that was born and raised in the culture Harry enters. So much could have been done with that. Like, the British wizarding world is pretty small so everyone would know everyone's business. Ron could have been the one to introduce Harry to the other characters showing that Ron had some connections before meeting Harry (not in the political way, but that he had met other kids before Harry and didn't stay at the Burrow 24/7 before going to Hogwarts).\\
I refuse to believe that Ron only knew the Malfoy family and some of his dad's coworkers before going to school, especially since he had 5 older brother before him who would have talked about the people they met in school. Ron could have been the guy with connections, with Harry as the leader, and Hermione as the researcher.

Writing this all out is making me really mad at Ron's wasted potential. Once the world building that Ron provided was established, the character needed something else to show growth, but we barely got that.

In GoF when Harry's name come out of the Goblet, where Harry is at least half responsible (Ron WAS brooding the first night, but the conflict would never had lasted a month if Harry didn't blow him off and later insulted him and threw a badge at his face),

In DH where he leaves the other. But part of this was influenced by the Horcruxe (both for him and Harry, who invited to leave), and he just left to cool off. The only reason and didn't come back minute later is because he was found by Snatcher the moment he moved, and the time he left them the other had already left.

Ron is far from perfect, but he is the most well adjusted member of the trio. And it's not like the other a the perfect friends too (Ron may have big disputes from time to time, but Harry can spend month brooding with the occasional Angs moment).

  Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn't there --- he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.

  “You've had an owl,” said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was pointing at Harry's pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there.

  “Oh --- right,” said Harry.

  “And we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape's dungeon,” said Ron.

  He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry.

Ron seems to have done most things with his friends, but both Harry and Hermione had done things and kept things secret from Ron. Harry's Cloak - he did lots of exploring on his own before bringing Ron along (once). Hermione's Time Turner - not only did she never tell them, but then she and Harry went off together and used it to save the day. Ron was left feeling likely useless and...out of the loop. :p Harry had special classes with a teacher to learn a really advanced charm, Fred and George gave him a unique powerful item, and Harry was always ending up places he shouldn't be - inside Fluffys room, inside the teacher's lounge eavesdropping, Hogsmeade, Knockturn Alley, etc etc. At this point, getting into the tournament seems pretty par for the course for Harry Potter.

#+begin_quote
  But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn't hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn't put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn't at all in the mood to celebrate... Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn't get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands... Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore's Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet...

  "I didn't," he said, over and over again, "I don't know how it happened."

  But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.

  "I'm tired!" he bellowed finally,*after nearly half an hour.* "No, seriously, George - I'm going to bed -"
#+end_quote

There's no way that Ron didn't hear the "blast of noise" when Harry came in. But Harry remains downstairs with his admirers for nearly a half hour before he comes upstairs to find Ron. Which gives Ron a half hour to brood about why if Harry didn't put his name in the goblet, Ron's upstairs alone with zero information while Harry hangs out with his admirers downstairs.

And things don't go well when Harry finally does show up.

#+begin_quote
  He [Ron] looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.

  "Where've you been?" Harry said.
#+end_quote

Not a great start from Harry. Harry means it as "why weren't you there for moral support?" But to Ron, this registers as "Why weren't you downstairs congratulating me at the party with the others?"

Since we see the books from Harry's POV, we know that Harry wasn't really a voluntary participant in his own party. But Ron doesn't know this. Harry shows up thirty minutes "late" with a Gryffindor banner tied around his neck and looking like he's enjoyed spending the last 30 minutes being praised by the entire house.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh hello," said Ron.

  He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.

  "So," he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. "Congratulations."

  "What d'you mean, congratulations?" said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace.

  "Well... no one else got across the Age Line," said Ron. "Not even Fred and George. What did you use - the Invisibility Cloak?"

  "The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line," said Harry slowly.

  "Oh right," said Ron. "I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak... because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? But you found another way, did you?"

  "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it."

  Ron raised his eyebrows.

  "What would they do that for?"

  "I dunno," said Harry. *He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill me."*

  Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.

  "It's okay, you know, you can tell /me/ the truth," he said. "If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet, she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either..."

  "I didn't put my name in that goblet!" said Harry, starting to feel angry.

  "Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same skeptical tone as Cedric. "Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you... I'm not stupid, you know."

  "You're doing a really good impression of it," Harry snapped.

  "Yeah?" said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. "You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something."

  “Oh right,” said Ron. “I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak ... because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? But you found another way, did you?”

  “Listen,” said Harry, “I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it.”

  Ron raised his eyebrows.

  “What would they do that for?”

  “I dunno,” said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, “To kill me.”

  Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair

  “It's okay, you know, you can tell /me/ the truth,” he said. “If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet, she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either. ...”

  “I didn't put my name in that goblet!” said Harry, starting to feel angry.

  “Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. “Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you. ... I'm not stupid, you know.”

  “You're doing a really good impression of it,” Harry snapped.

  “Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. “You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something.”

  He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him.

And then they didn't speak until days later

  Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn't there --- he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.

  “You've had an owl,” said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was pointing at Harry's pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there.

  “Oh --- right,” said Harry.

  “And we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape's dungeon,” said Ron.

  He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. For a moment, Harry considered going after him --- he wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing --- but the lure of Sirius's answer was too strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it.

​

So, when exactly is Ron supposed to be trying to put forwards this olive branch?

And when he got the badge thrown at him, it was the evening of the 22nd. Harry had just learned what the task was, he might've had reason to be extra stressed then.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry is moody because stuff he doesn't like is happening" is as much of a defense as "Ron is jealous because stuff he doesn't like is happening"

The danger of the tournament was only being stated by Hermione, everyone else seemed pretty relaxed about it.

Ron attempts to reconcile when Harry's trying to talk with Sirius. He comes downstairs, asks what Harry's up to, Harry's pissed about not being able to talk more with Sirius and answers moodily. I also recall him offering Pig for something in that period, but I don't have the book at hand atm.

No, everybody was not relaxed about the tournament. Previous tournaments has had all contestants die. It's peculated since Halloween that it might be some sort of assassination attempt. And even Sirius discuss this.

  “But Karkaroff, it doesn't work like that,” said Bagman. “The Goblet of Fire's just gone out --- it won't reignite until the start of the next tournament ---”

  “--- in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded Karkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now!”

  “Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door. “You can't leave your champion now. He's got to compete. They've all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?”

  Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with every right step he took, there was a loud clunk.

  “Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I'm afraid I don't understand you, Moody.”

  Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled themselves into fists.

  “Don't you?” said Moody quietly. “It's very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put Potter's name in that goblet knowing he'd have to compete if it came out.”

  “Evidently, someone 'oo wished to give 'Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!” said Madame Maxime.

  “I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff, bowing to her. “I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards ---”

  “If anyone's got reason to complain, it's Potter,” growled Moody, “but ... funny thing ... I don't hear him saying a word. ...”

  “Why should 'e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot. “ 'E 'as ze chance to compete, 'asn't 'e? We 'ave all been 'oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons in prize money --- zis is a chance many would die for!”

  “Maybe someone's hoping Potter is going to die for it,” said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl.

  An extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said, “Moody, old man ... what a thing to say!”

  “We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn't discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,” said Karkaroff loudly. “Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons.”

  “Imagining things, am I?” growled Moody. “Seeing things, eh? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy's name in that goblet. ...”

  “Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?” said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands.

  “Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!” said Moody. “It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament. ... I'm guessing they submitted Potter's name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category. ...”

  “You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,” said Karkaroff coldly, “and a very ingenious theory it is --- though of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock. So you'll understand if we don't take you entirely seriously. ...”

  “There are those who'll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,” Moody retorted in a menacing voice. “It's my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff --- as you ought to remember. ...”

  “Who were you talking to?” he said.

  “What's that got to do with you?” Harry snarled. “What are you doing down here at this time of night?”

  “I just wondered where you ---” Ron broke off, shrugging. “Nothing. I'm going back to bed.”

  “Just thought you'd come nosing around, did you?” Harry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he'd walked in on, knew he hadn't done it on purpose, but he didn't care --- at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.

  “Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with anger. “Should've realized you didn't want to be disturbed. I'll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace.”

  Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead and bounced off.

******* Yeah, I'm not interested in a huge debate, so I'll just state some facts: Ron dating Lavender purely to mess with Hermione is total fanon. There's every reason to imagine that he was giving the relationship an honest go, only to be unsettled by how babyish Lavender turned out to be. He and Hermione regularly insult each other, and Hermione's much worse if you consider nagging to be a sort of insult.

The "jealousy fits" are a direct result of his aforementioned backstory, just as much as Harry withdrawing or getting in over his head without a plan, or Hermione getting to wrapped up in studies or aggravating the others. His behavior was understandable and nowhere near as cruel or traitorous as fanon makes it out to be.

Hey, remember that time Hermione insisted upon defending her cat after it repeatedly tried to kill Ron's pet? Remember that time Harry refused to talk about anything with anyone? Remember that time Hermione cast a Confundus Charm on a guy who was dozens of feet in the air on a broom? Remember all those times Ron convinced his impoverished family to get Harry out of Privet Drive as soon as possible, because he knew about the abuse occurring there? Remember when he stood up to a serial killer on a broken leg to defend his friend? Remember when *while fighting with Hermione,* he told off Snape for unjust treatment? Remember when he tried to hex Malfoy for calling his twelve-year-old friend a racial slur? Remember when he offered to be Harry's second in what was technically supposed to be a duel to the death... at ten years old?

** Ron has nothing that makes him stand out amongst the three. Even though he isn't untalented and does contributes by pointing out things Ron and Hermione miss, he ultimately has nothing that Hermione and Harry can't do but better. It's a real conundrum for stories that want to write Ron contributing strongly, so they choose the one skill we were shown and associated commonly with great strategy.

In my opinion, a better way to allow Ron to contribute and stand out would be to characterise him as having business acumen and strong interpersonal skills. We know that Weasleys' Wizards Wheezes only grew further post-series and I personally think that was Ron.

Ron has all the right skills to succeed in that area, I have met talented entrepreneurs and they do act a bit like Ron-bold, clever but not in a Hermione way, charismatic, funny, imaginative etc. I could even see his chess skills coming into play, outmaneourving the competition.

So I think in a story, to help give him meaningful contribution, you could have Ron building connections and calming down hostilities as he does a few times in the books. Ron is ultimately Harry's right hand man that manages the team.

The only thing he's good at is chess, and what use is that in real life? Yes, chess is all about strategy and war, but there's no classic chess-type war in HP, there's only a series of guerilla skirmishes on both sides. His possible strategic skills are in effect useless.

** Also the fact that Wizards Chess pieces are capable of talking to the player and giving suggestions, so how good of a tactician could Ron really be? That'd be like saying you're a master at playing Call of Duty while playing with Aimbots on.

** Ron's chess-playing ability was key to potentially stopping Voldemort from getting the Philosopher's Stone with McGonagall's chess set. His skill with chess is brought up simply so you as the audience member aren't suddenly irritated that Hermione is suddenly good at chess. It makes sense in the context of the first book and would get old fast if it was brought up in subsequent books.

Chess-playing ability is not a transferable skill. You're allowing the rose-tinted goggles of the fanfiction to affect the canon character. What Ron brings to the "team" is the wealth of his native Wizarding knowledge that neither Harry nor even Hermione are likely to have come across through /study alone/.

In any case, using Ron's chess ability to showcase strategic expertise generally I take as the author being lazy with not building Ron's skills up naturally. If he's /interested/ in chess, then that gives you, as the author, wiggle-room in developing an interest in other talents that might manifest as useful to the trio's adventures.

That is I think JKR's missed opportunity in her books that stopped Ron being elevated to a great character (imho).

** Because it's a children's story, and at the end of the day - despite the book's popularity - she's just not a very good writer. Assigning one-dimensional traits to characters, like being "bookish" for Hermione is about the best she can do. Pretty much anything emotional or to do with character development is so ridiculously hamfisted and obtuse, it's not even funny.

Giving the character that is constantly portrayed as the not-so-bright comedy relief a skill like chess doesn't add depth, it's poor writing.

** Is it possible that JKR is not herself an accomplished strategist and when trying to come up with a basis for Ron being one thought "Oh! Chess! That's hard. I can make a Wizard's version of it too! Two birds, one stone, huzzah!!!" and then left it at that?

** IMHO (and I am probably not making many friends saying that) it's because (Mo-)Ron needs a skill, any skill to kind of contribute anything worthwhile (comic-relief doesn't count and neither does supposedly steadfast friendship - not to mention that saying Ron is a good friend is IMHO a lie! He's fickle and jealous and a fair weather friend IMHO!) to the trio!

I mean Harry has his skill at fighting, he can think on his feet and he isn't all that bad at inspiring others and he can resists compulsions (Imperius-Curse? Yeah, how about: NO!)!

Hermione on the other hand is smart (not a genius, but not a slouch either!), she has a mind for research and she's determined/driven to learn!

Ron? Ron has nothing truly to offer, except the insights of someone who was born among magic-users (which neither Hermione nor Harry (he was born there, but didn't grow up with magic) have!)...otherwise he's not all that great, so many fanfiction writers make him a strategist :(
