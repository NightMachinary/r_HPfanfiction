Harry Potter wiki states that one Galleon is worth 4.97 pounds/6.14 US dollars (which brings about another set of problems(Shitty exchange rates))

I can't seem to find any source for this information, however.


** JKR said a galleon is worth about 5 pounds.

*** Considering that interview was done in 2001, a galleon is now worth about 8 pounds, xD.

Up above on the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Galleon][Galleon wiki page]], it gives a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Galleon#cite_note-3][reference]] to a JKR interview.

** I think the 4.97 pounds/6.14 US dollars is what a muggle has to pay to get a galleon but if you tried to pawn a gold coin off (assuming that it's solid gold or at least has a good gold content in it) you could get a lot more for it.

** Given that they are about an ounce of gold, 150-300 Pound Sterling during the time of the books. I don't care about the exchange rate, I am melting them down either way.

*** I'm not sure why you would think the goblins(or Ministry/ICW perhaps?) don't have a way to prevent/discourage this. I've seen it in multiple fics where Harry uses this as a way to make profit, as if it's some great plan only he can think of and not a blatantly obvious attempt at fraud(but wizards dur hur). If such a loophole was possible so many people would be doing it that economys would be ruined.

**** I usually have some Muggleborns use that exploit in general but since they are not the top of the economy the overall impact is almost negligible. And the Ministry watches gleefully since the goblins have to provide cheap gold due to a treaty.

***** Except that, by treaty, each galleon /is/ five quid's worth of gold. Under stonking great engorgement charms to make them a useful size of coin. Melting them down breaks the engorgement charm and they shrink as they melt.

You can picture the goblins rolling their eyes at the idea of an exchange rate fixed by treaty, and sniggering at the wizards who apparently aren't aware of the possibilities for coinage debasement you get when you involve magic.

** Ultimately, the story never addresses the issue of being able to sell the Galleons as gold or melting them down, and the world of the story seems to be operating as if neither of those were actual issues for the goblins. This means that quite likely you can do neither of those and have to rely on the exchange rates.
