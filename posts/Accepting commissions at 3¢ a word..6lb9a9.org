I'll write anything you want and you can post it as your own work. Three edits, then 1¢ Every five words for subsequent edits.

Edit: also, by joining my patreon.com/PCo i'll write a story per dollar pledge (so $1, 100 words, a significant savings). Each month, probably as a serial.


** $3 for 100 words? Dude, I know how much time writing takes but we are talking about fanfic here. If you don't enjoy it then just stop rather than making silly passes at a community that doesn't have a market for you.

If you are good at writing erotic literature then I hear self publishing through e-tailers can make a decent amount.

** Who would want to hire you to write his story? FANfiction are made by fans who enjoy writting storys about their favorites universe. I do it because I want to do it on my free time. If you enjoy writting and want to win money doing it then write a book and sell it on Amazon. But don't degrade an entire community by involving money in it.

** Hey, I really recommend looking up copywriting sites as a way of earning some extra cash as it's unlikely you'll have much success this route and could even stumble into legal trouble. I used a site called copify and though I believe it's UK specific I'm sure there's an US equivalent. I made about £100 extra a month just doing it in my spare time.

** If you are short on money and absolutely love the HP franchise, I suggest finding a job within it. There are actually quite a few opportunities: Warner Brothers, Disney, Pottermore, to name just a few.
