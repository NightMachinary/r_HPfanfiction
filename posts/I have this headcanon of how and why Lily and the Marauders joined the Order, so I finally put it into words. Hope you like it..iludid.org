[Minor violence and language]

She had agreed to one prank. After all, if she really wanted to understand James, she should get in on his hobbies, and it wasn't really a nasty prank. So Sirius and him had explained to her the plan, that they would go into the forbidden forest, capture a load of bowtruckles and hide them in Professor Flitwick's desk drawer. That way tomorrow morning during their first lesson of the day, and last one of their years at highschool, the Charms classroom would be in total disarray as dozens of angry bowtruckles would fight with their small professor. Lily had laughed at James's and Sirius's gleeful expression when they were done speaking: - " Alright, that's not actually mean, and it could be quite funny. I'm in." The boys had jumped in the air, and James had ran to the boy's dormitory and come back with a bundle of shiny cloth, which he had unwrapped to reveal a long cape. With stars in his eyes, he had explained to Lily: -" This is my invisibility cape, which we'll use to sneak out of the castle. However we're too many to all fit under, so me and you will use it while the boys will use charms to remain invisible. We'll try to be as discreet as possible, and once outside of the castle, Remus and Peter will stand watch while we go in the forest." Even now, as she walked through the castle grounds with her body tight with James's, she couldn't comprehend the magic that was fuelling this cape, but she certainly understood how the Marauders had gotten away with so many of their shenanigans over the years. Remus and Peter had assumed their positions near the castle, eyes sharp to make sure no one was doing rounds that could compromise the mission, and Sirius had disappeared into the night, silent and swift. She wasn't sure of the kind of spell he had used to make himself so stealthy, but for some reason she could sense that he was almost as invisible as the two under the magical cloth. They were nearing the border of the forest, already past Hagrid's hut was, when a bright light and loud crack stopped them in their tracks. A dischevelled McGonagall appeared at the edge of the woods, her wand barely hanging at the end of the arm, and she stumbled forward towards them, and fell, face first into the grass. -"Professor!" shouted James, leaving the cover of the cape and running towards where she lay. In shock, Lily slowly advanced and saw the damage the woman had sustained. Long, bloody gashes ran across her arms and legs, her robe was torn in a dozen places and several bruises were turning purple on her face. James was already performing minor healing spells on their transfiguration teacher, and looked up to we're she stood: -" Go get help! She's bleeding out!" Lily shook herself out of the transe that kept her frozen, and ran straight towards the groundskeeper's house: - " HAGRID! " She pounded on the door, " Help! It's McGonagall! " The giant stepped into view, opening the door, his eyes showing a terror she had never seen. He ran towards James and Minerva, kneeled on the ground and picked up the head of the fallen professor. -" I'll take her to the infirmary! James keep doing what you're doing while we go, and you Lily, go wake professor Dumbledore! Quick !" His huge hands then picked up the fallen professor, cradling her in his arms, and his legs began to race towards the castle, James in tow, trying his best to keep up while casting healing charms. Lily hurried after, flying past the gates, forgetting about the repercussions of being outside at night, climbing the stairs towards the headmaster's office. Luckily she knew the password, perk of being the headgirl, and she shouted at the gargoyle as soon as it came into view: - " Chocolate frogs!" As soon as she entered the ancient office, Professor Dumbledore appeared out of the darkness, his night gown still on: -" What's going on?" -" It's professor McGonagall, she's in the infirmary!" His eyes wide with fear, the white bearded man responded: -" Go wake professor Slughorn, his potions might be needed!" Lily's race resumed, her heart beating hard in her chest, but there was no time to catch a breath. When a few minutes later she finally brought the potions master into Madame Pomfrey's lair, the small woman was busy stopping the bleeding and assessing the internal damage on a still unconscious McGonagall. The four Marauders and Hagrid were standing around the bed, with stupefaction in their eyes. Professor Dumbledore turned towards Horace Slughorn, and quickly asked him to begin preparations for antidotes and other healing potions, warning him that Madame Pomfrey would need all the help she could get. -" How is she" panted Lily. -" Give me space to work, and maybe she'll be alright, but right now, both her and I need air!" responded Poppy Pomfrey. The men quickly backed away, all but James, who turned towards Dumbledore with a fiery look: -" How did this happen? Aren't you supposed to protect your students and staff? What kind of dangerous situation did you put her in? Do you see what happened to her?" -" James, I assure you I did not send Minerva into danger, and I am as angry at myself then you are at me, for you are right, her safety is my responsibility." -" Then how could this happen? Do you know what she was doing and where she was? She apparated right at the edge of the limits of the castle, so clearly she wasn't on the grounds when she got hurt!" -" There are things I cannot talk about unfortunately." -" How do we explain this to the other students huh? What do you expect us to say?" added Lily, making Dumbledore turn to her. The tall man looked at his head boy and head girl, realising he would not get of this easily. -" Alright, both of you come with me. I guess you should know so that we can keep this as quiet as possible. But I trust your discretion on this." The young adults following him into a corner of the room, where he leaned to them, and explained: -" I had asked Minerva to go on a intelligence mission, to speak to an ally of ours who has information on the movements of You Know Who. I suspect they were found, or betrayed, and Minerva found herself fighting off Death Eaters. Several of them, it seems, as the curses hit her body from different angles, and I don't know many wizards who can hold in one to one combat against our transfiguration professor." James and Lily's expression turned serious, taken by surprise at the revelation. -" I am trusting you with this information, because I know you two are loyal to Hogwarts and what we stand for. However I ask you to make use of this information carefully, as there are many who support the Dark Lord, and I do not want to put more people in danger." He paused for a moment, gazing at his star students, and continued: -" None of the other students can know, and we will make sure to keep Professor McGonagall isolated until she is well. The official story is that she fell suddenly ill, and is being kept in quarantine for a few days. I'm certain Madame Pomfrey and Horace will get her back on her feet in no time, but until then, we have to keep everyone from panicking." Lily and James nodded solemnly, understanding how much danger they could put their professor in if they spoke of the story. -" I must thank you for sneaking out of the castle when you did, as it could have been a lot worse if no one had seen or heard her arrive. Fate has an interesting way of working it seems." Lily blushed and James put his head down, hearing the rebuke underneath the gratitude, but knowing that Dumbledore was truly thankful for their presence outside the castle that night. -" Can we tell the others? Sirius, Remus and Peter saw what happened, and they're not going to be okay with being kept in the dark." -" Tell them at your discretion. I'm sure that you could ask them not to question tonight's events, and tell them at a later date, but they are not fools, and will make their own assumptions. But for now you should return to the Griffindor Tower and get some sleep. Poppy, Horace and I will take care of Minerva, I assure you she's in the best hands possible." When the five teenagers had returned to the Griffindor common room, Sirius broke the uneasy silence by asking: -" Are you guys gonna tell us what Dumbledore said?" Lily looked at James, seeing that he could not hide the truth from his friends: -" You should tell them James, it's important that they know." James sighed, his tension released, and began to relate the conversation to the three Marauders. When he was done, they were all sat around the fireplace, somberly looking down, all but Sirius, who exclaimed: -" I'm gonna get those sons of bitches, nobody messes with the Griffindors!" Remus put his hand on the boy's shoulder: -" These are Death Eaters we're talking about, dangerous maniacs, you can't just go around picking fights with everybody." -" Yeah, and this is McGonagall we're talking about, we can't just let her go unavenged!" To the boys' surprise, Lily added: -" I agree with Sirius, we need to do something. But we can't do much while we're in here. However, we're the next generation of wizards, and unless we want more attacks like this happening, we have to join the war effort as soon as we're out of Hogwarts, and help Dumbledore, McGonagall and the others fight the Dark Lord and his forces." She turned to her boyfriend, and placed her hand on his, and as he grasped it back, she said: -" What do you say James? Are you with me on this?" The boy looked back at her. No, not a boy anymore, as tonight's horrific situation had ended his childhood and left him aged, with the determination of a man. He brought the small hand of his girlfriend to his face, and responded: -" Of course I'm with you. I will fight with you, and for you, for as long as I breathe. And if this is what Death Eaters do to the people we love, I'll fight them for you until none of them are left standing." -" Well we already know I'm up for it" interrupted Sirius, "so what do you say boys? All the Marauders fighting the good cause?" -" I guess we're all doing this aren't we?" said Remus. -" I guess we are." ended Peter.
