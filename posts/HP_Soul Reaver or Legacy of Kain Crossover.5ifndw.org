I had a thought; what if the Power He Knows Not is the Soul Reaver? With its convoluted plotline applied to HP, it'll be an epic adventure. However, when I checked the crossover section, there were only 5 fics. Haven't read them yet, but do you guys know of any other fic libraries that have this crossover?

Also, any suggestions for fics would be appriciated.


** I had an idea about doing it but had so many annoying purists complain about the idea.

*** Lol. Why? I was thinking that inserting certain concepts from The legacy of Kain series would spice the HP world a bit more. Now all we have to decide is [[/s][if Potter or Voldemort is going to be a paradox]]

**** They were all "harry's powers don't work like that." I replied "it's fanfiction, I get to rewrite the canon however i want" but the whininess drove me off the idea. I nixed it out and ended up writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/6/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery]] then rewriting it as its own story here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11859282/1/Darkness-Ascendant-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]

***** /Sigh. There's a reason why is called crossovers. You get concepts or characters from one place then apply it to another.

Iirc that's a Vertigo Darkness crossover. I think I read that. I'm not too sure though. Would suggest having a witchblade cameo or any of the major Vertigo characters *cough*Gaiman's Endless, Swamp-Thing, or Constantine*cough*
