Don't pretend like you've never read any! Recommend the best ones here. Any pairing and any combination of plot with smut, from balanced to mostly one or the other!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]] is a Bellatrix/Hermione fic set in an AU where Voldemort didn't exist so Bellatrix isn't an insane psychopath, though she's still an insufferable bigot, at least at first. It's a pretty good story actually.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5652272/1/To-Know-To-Feel-To-Love][To Know, To Feel, To Love]] is a classic Hermione/Ginny story set after book 7, it's a slow burner with not that many lemon scenes but it's well worth it as it builds up a realistic relationship first. It's also written by an actual woman not a horny guy as is usually the case with Femslash stories.

EDIT: I should have read your post more carefully as you seem to be only interested in smut, so here you go:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736369/1/Darling-Pansy][Darling Pansy]] Is part one of a three part series, really filthy stuff. Fembuck has tones of other Femslash stories too, and not all of them Harry Potter related.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9386150][Patience]] is Hermione/Pansy. It dives right into the scene with no attempt at a plot, so if you're looking to get right to it, this is perfect.

If, on the other hand, you're looking for a some plot with that smut, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6857392][Blindness and Stars]] delivers! Rita/Amelia pairing, and a interesting look into wizarding politics.

I have a bit of a weakness for the idea of Ginny/Cho, and Wet by elie-nors is a smutty ride on the Hogwarts Express at the end of Ginny's fifth year. It's tagged underage so I won't provide the link - Google if interested.

** Is length an issue? I really love the smut in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12505731/1/Extinction][Extinction]], but it's a long, mostly plot fic. It's one the best Narcissa/Hermione's out there though, and probably the only completed one.

I also remember [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12652575][Good Things Come for Those Who Wait]] being pretty good, but I haven't read it in a while. It's a one-shot Narcissa/Pansy.
