So the site is supposed to be focused towards the writer? So they can get construction criticism and reviews before posting to somewhere like FFN? I feel a little confused, and it doesn't help that help that some of the people who are supporting DLP are being aggressive and that's not a good way to get information stated.

What is DLP for, and what is the difference between it, and FFN?


** Darklordpotter.net is a forum established for the sake of encouraging higher quality in fanfiction compared to other forums which seemed more focused on a particular 'ship. It has evolved into a kind of gentleman's club (though ladies with something to say are welcome, the tone still has that occasionally crass Ivy League fraternity aesthetic going on), with topics discussed now covering a much wider range than just fanfiction for Harry Potter.

The makers also host the fanfiction hosting site PatronusCharm, as an alternative to the vast sea of suck in fanfiction.net. Within the forum is a subsection exclusive to members called WorkByAuthor, specifically created to get critical (some would say vicious) review of stories as yet unpublished. Whether the authors of those works choose to take or not take the advice given, it remains in place forever after so that the author can reread the responses. The expectation is that they would post what they were satisfied with out onto other hosting sites like PatronusCharm, fanfiction.net, Ao3 or wherever.

Separate from that is the Review Board, a subforum dedicated to evaluating stories posted to hosting sites that have caught the attention of the membership and evaluating whether those stories are worth including in the DLP Library. The evaluation here has nothing to do with the author (they aren't even notified that their story is being scrutinized) as it is more a readers' critical view: like a rating site that collects product reviews. Stories that have gone through the WorkByAuthor process are more likely to be posted in the Review Board and evaluated positively, simply because those stories have already been considered for their merits and the author advised how to improve their writing. If they don't take the advice they'll still probably be run through the review board if the story gets posted anywhere, but the Review Board only considers stories that are publicly accessible.

Hope that clarifies things, and if I mis-spoke hopefully one of the other members will correct me.

The one clarification I'd add is that WBA is there for constructive (if blunt) criticism of one's writing. Viciousness is explicitly discouraged unless one proves oneself to be wholly incapable of responding to criticism (see Alexx).

When it comes to their standards, I meant to use elitist in both a good and a bad way. Didn't quite manage that, but yea...

What I meant was that while they do hold their fanfiction to higher standards, their way of looking at, in their eyes, sub-par fanfiction is like nobles looking at peasants.

Why have standards about what you watch on TV? It's not fine art, go watch Honey Booboo instead of Breaking Bad.

Of course, if you had a choice, you'd pick Breaking Bad over Honey Booboo (I hope). You'd pick a steak over tasteless goop. You'd pick a Lamborghini instead of a 1990 Honda Civic. People have standards in every aspect of their life. Shall I call you elitist for having these standards?

** For what it's worth, here are my thoughts on DLP, from the perspective of someone who's /very/ new in the grand scheme of things, but threw myself pretty hard into the community when I did start participating about a year ago.

I think the bad rep DLP gets is explained in two ways:

1) A holdover, momentum kind of thing from 8-9 years ago when it was (so I understand, not having actually been there) an explicit reaction to perceived failings in the fanfiction community and was more about being /against/ certain things (like Harry/Ginny) than it was particularly /for/ anything. These days, the scope is much, much wider and the voices are quite diverse, and mostly everyone who's active gets along.

2) A few "squeaky wheels" who have a bad first experience and then go cry about it elsewhere. See, there's this thing that happens, like clockwork, every few months or so. Someone who's either a complete newbie or a longtime lurker makes the plunge and starts posting a lot in a short amount of time, and it's pretty obvious that they haven't really read the forum enough to get a handle on the atmosphere. Like, they'll post something in the General forum with some asinine/cliche opinion that's been talked up to death elsewhere.

Which is fine! You're allowed to be loud and wrong, in moderation. But the problem is, a member will give them a little sass, and because they're accustomed to, say, Spacebattles or something with a very clear Code of Conduct and Zero Tolerance For Insults and a whole staff of mods going "EVERYTHING SUNNY ALL THE TIME ALWAYS," they get kind of rocked back on their heels when their first few posts aren't met with a) enthusiasm or even b) benign "agree to disagree!" fluff.

And then they start hitting back, in just really obvious defensive/flailing ways. "Why shouldn't I have the right to express my opinion?" they think.

Well, you do. But... so does everyone else. What I like about DLP is that the rules, the culture, the atmosphere, is actually very basic and very freeform at the same time. It's like:

1) Don't be a moron 2) Don't be an asshole 3) If you're going to be a moron, be entertaining (see: Syed, entire post history of) 4) If you're going to be an asshole, be funny.

Just super simple stuff. Common sense. Anyone who makes a good-faith effort to be a part of the community without suddenly deciding that the community should be something other than it is, is welcomed, or at least tolerated.

DLP is like that scene in /The Wire/ with Marlo and the security guard. The guard takes a stand after Marlo swipes a lollipop from the store. Common sense says let it go: Marlo's insanely dangerous, he has this huge rep, and some plastic badge security guard's going to do exactly nothing to curtail his criminal activities. But the guard feels a sense of duty. A sense that this world should be fair. That it should matter that he's got justice and law and truth on his side.

"You want it to be one way," says Marlo, giving him that /look./ "But it's the other way."

Anyway.

Personally, I think DLP is great. Getting to know some of the people there has been awesome, and I'm continually blown away by the diverse opinions and lifestyles of people who are brought together by nothing more than a love of quality fiction. The feedback I get on my story in WbA was so much better than anything else I got that I straight-up ditched my beta and now just post my raw stuff there, and it's better off for it.

It's not for everybody. It doesn't pretend to be. There's no single voice, single opinion, single way of thinking, except for that one maxim: /Don't be an idiot./ And if you immediately want to jump on me because "Don't be an idiot is subjective" - that's exactly the attitude that gets people in trouble. Because it's really not.

*** As someone who was around back in the day, I can say your first point is probably on the the dot. I haven't been on DLP for a few years now but it certainly used to be a very closed off and unwelcoming place. That is not that I dislike DLP (it has done some really fantastic work with many authors) and certainly cannot speak for it now, but you definetly needed to think and post a certain way or it was made quite apparent that you would not fit in (read: be welcome). It left me with a negative impression after watching some people get absolutely shredded and I just moved on to other places in the fandom. But from what I hear, the community has improved and made it to its intended goal (only high quality stories). If people think it is elitest or cruel today, they have no idea what they missed haha

It's become a place where people go to to read stories before they're posted to fanfic sites, and that's fine, but that's not the original purpose nor is it the purpose today.

Anything not meeting to their high standards gets instantly mocked and abused, doesn't matter if the author is 12 or 22, nor do they take into account if the author might not be a native English speaker, to them, you either write like a professional writer, or you're garbage and not worth their time.

*** Actually, a lot of members take multiple factors into account when judging. They're going to be a lot more lenient judgement wise if they know english isn't a persons first language, that doesn't mean they're gonna be insincere about what they think about a story.

The whole 'everyone is special and everything is good' attitude isn't tolerated at DLP.

If an author comes to DLP and posts something that's bad, we're gonna tell them that, and then we're going to tell them what to improve. Pretending that a bad story is good only hurts them in the end and stilts their progress as an author.

A lot of authors who come to DLP have aspirations of moving on from fanfiction and eventually turning to original writing. They aren't going to succeed if we coddle them.

If the author has brought their material to DLP they want our opinion. If they haven't and a member has posted a story for review, then whats the issue? The author isn't personally involved in the process and has no idea that they're being reviewed unless a) someone specifically points them to it or b) they go looking.

I always find it mind boggling that people seem to get personally offended that there exists a group of people who prefer to read high quality stories. Doesn't matter if it's fanfiction, original or other. You have a finite amount of time, why would you not what to spend it on reading stuff you know you'll enjoy?

I wouldn't say it's got everyone but it's a place you can lurk around for some new stories.

However due to the lack of fan fiction stories in general and also lack of publish worthy fan fiction, there isn't much activity there... Maybe that's one of the reasons as to why their discussions has expanded beyond Harry Potter.
