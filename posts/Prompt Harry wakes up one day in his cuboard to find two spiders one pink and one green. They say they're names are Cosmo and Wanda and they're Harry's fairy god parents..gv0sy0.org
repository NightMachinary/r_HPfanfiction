***** Yeah. There's not really any decent HP + FOP x-overs. The fairies are too OP for the HP universe. Other than what's banned by Da Rulez they can do anything.

****** They really are too OP. It'd take a pretty dumb protag and rulez forbidding effecting magic users. Even then, it'd be hard to do.

OP insert character here seems like the only genre that will really work with a crossover unless you go full fairy vs anti-fairy world for conflict.

******** Even ramping up the bad guys doesn't really do it. You'd have to ramp up Harry potter magic to fairy magic level for anyone to stand a chance against fairy magic without a dumb protag.

I wish there was a planet on the other side of the universe that was capable of sustaining life. I wish Voldemort and all the death eaters were on that planet. Done.

Now, the way to do it I think would be this:

Everyone knows not to leave children in a vulnerable situation. All the adults know about the power of fairy godparents. They do not remember them, but they know that children should ALWAYS be protected, never abused or mistreated, lest bad things happen in the world. And the rise of every lord of magic was rooted in gaining fairy godparents. Tom in the orphanage, Dumbledore lacking a father and having a mother whose sole purpose was to try to protect his sister, Grindlewald with a secretly abusive family. Dumbledore knew that Harry would need power. He knew that Harry would be abused. He doesn't remember his fairys, but he knows that Harry will need help that he can't provide.

I guess then you just have to nerf fairy magic by not allowing it to directly affect other witches and wizards. That doesn't mean that creativity wouldn't be able to overcome that though, hence the need for a broken and dumb protag to not realize this obvious flaw. Or it gives Harry just enough power to make the story interesting, before he screws up and tells someone of their existence (such as being introduced to the wizarding world and thinking that he can tell them the secret).

********* That sounds like it would be an amazing take. And heck, "the power he knows not" could actually be a power he forgot.

Harry, as he walks towards his death at Voldemort's hand: "I wish I didn't have to fight Voldemort. I wish I didn't have to die to save everyone. Come off it, Potter, you know you've gotta do this. Magic might be real, but life isn't some sparkly fairy tale where you can just wish away your problems. But /dammit,/ I wish I could defeat Voldemort and save everyone without having to kill or be killed!"

*/POOF!/*

Harry found himself marveling at the vibrant, scarlet train as the gaggle of gingers he'd followed through the portal left to get themselves situated, jumping when a hand fell on his shoulder. "Well go on, then," his mother said as she gently pushed him towards the Hogwarts Express. "Get aboard already, find a seat---and make some new friends! And don't you dare forget to let us know once you've been Sorted tonight, I want to hear all about your first day."

"I know, Mum," Harry replied, struggling not to roll his eyes. He fingered the locket with a built in communication mirrorthat was hung around his neck. "I'm not as bad as Uncle Wormtail; I've still got it right here. I'll call right before bed."

"Good boy. Now, off with you, don't want to be left behind, Harry!"

○•°•°•○

Harry was looking over his Potions notes when the door to his compartment suddenly jerked open. "Excuse me, have you seen a toad in here?"

"No, sorry. Just been in here by myself, really. Want me to help look?"

The black haired boy in the doorway looked immediately relieved, his smile a mix of hopeful and wariness that Harry completely missed. "You'll help? That'd be /brilliant./ Neville's toad, Trevor, got loose you see, and here asked this girl named Hermione to help him look, and I ended up roped into it as well, but I just feel hopeless."

"How did I know Neville was involved," Harry wondered to himself with a chuckle. "Yeah, let's find ourselves a toad!" Harry set aside his potions review with eager relief as he shot up, a crooked smile on his lips. "My name's Harry, by the way. What's yours?"

"Oh, uh---Tom. Tom Riddle."

"Well Tom Riddle, I'm Harry Potter, and I happen to be an expert Trevor hunter!"

** I've played with a version that has Timmy being a fan of the Potter books, and deciding that he wants to be part of the adventures, so he ends up wishing himself (and his fairies) into the story. So Timmy is in Gryffindor, a member of the Golden Parallelogram, having Harry and co always add "and Timmy" when they are in their plotting sessions, like the Larry character in Pinky and the Brain.

Working title: "If Wishes were Fishes

*/The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell./*

*/"He'll be alright," murmured Ginny./*

*/As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. "I know he will."/*

*/The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well./*

The tiny pink-haired woman closed the book thoughtfully. “Well, that seemed... abrupt.

“Abrupt?” The boy wearing a pink hat asked incredulously. “That made absolutely no sense. After spending months in a tent with Hermione, he marries Ginny? And then Harry named his kid after the dink that was always picking on him? What the heck?”

“I liked Ron,” Cosmo said removing his floating crowny-thing so as to scratch at his thicket of green hair. “He seemed so balanced and smart.”

Wanda and Timmy just shared a look and shrugged.

“And Hermione married Ron? The nose to the grindstone bookworm married to the king of the slackers? That's insane, that would be like Trixie Tang marrying.... Marrying...”

“You?” Cosmo suggested helpfully.

“Well, that's the way the story goes Sport.” Wanda sighed, sharing the feeling of let down that the final book had inspired. “Want to read Goblet of Fire again; we all really liked that one.”

“No. I want to stop Harry from being so stupid.”

“He did the best he could, Timmy,” Cosmo noted as he floated by the bed again. “I mean, he's no Ron...”

“Timmy,” Wanda said in her ‘I'm very concerned about you and about to explain why you're being stupid' voice. “The magic of the Harry Potter world is very different than ours, much more limited, and...”

“Don't care.” The youngest Turner said. “I wish I had a wand that would let me do magic”

“Ok, done!” Cosmos said waving his wand.

A Timmy sized wand appeared in the boy's hand, ten inches long balsa wood with a snail snot core, terminating in a three-inch sparkling five-pointed star. Stiff and good for anything the user decided he wanted to do.

“Timmy!” Wanda pleaded for a bit of sanity, “Why don't we go help the Crimson Chin again? That's always fun.”

“No!” the boy in the pink hat proclaimed. “I wish I was being sorted into Gryffindor for Harry's first year!”

Cosmo cluelessly raised his wand, while Wanda sighed and raised hers as well.

*---===oooOOOooo===---*

Vickie, the world's most evil babysitter was standing outside Timmy's room trying to decide which of the horrible tortures she had devised to use on Timmy next. There were four distinct options, any of which would have the boy a sobbing wreck in seconds. She shook her head as herself. It was obvious, do all four simultaneously. The evil teen kicked the door open only to find herself looking at a huge roiling mass of smoke inside the room.

The smoke seemed to be forming the words ‘*/Fanfiction Mode/*'... That was odd, she thought as she found herself pulled into the vortex the smoke concealed.

​

​

So, yeah, Timmy joins the Trio, and the Dark Lord's most evil and nasty follower, the woman that even Voldemort is terrified of, Vickitrix is along for the ride.

** I remembered the "Da Rules" rulebook...

The HP universe was practically designed to invalidate everything.

- Fairies can't directly kill, maim, or injure living beings (but their magic can if it is done indirectly).
- Fairy magic can't affect other magical or super-powerful items.

The second one most likely extends to people as well. There's also a hinted at one that pertains to no stealing.

But, you can always do an immigration scene of a fairy couple who are each related to the summer or winter fairy court. That could empower them to override it. iunno.
