Those fics where people find out what they've done to Harry (canon or not) through any way. E.G. arrest, Harry going public etc.


** linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) starts with the arrest of Dursleys (later, Petunia is slightly reformed from the prison, and divorced).

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
