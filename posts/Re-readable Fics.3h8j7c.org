I'm new to this sub so if it's been talked about before please redirect me :).

I was inspired by the AskReddit about rewatching/binge-ing TV.

Are there any fics that you can reread over and over again (even when there's been no update)?

The shining example I have is Make A Wish, and to a lesser extent, The Lie I've Lived.

I've probably read it a good 3-4 times post completion and I could never get enough and I don't know why. It's just such a feel-good fic.

I've reread others (HPMoR, Hogwarts Battle School, Prince of a Dark Kingdom) but mostly when there's an update and there's been a long enough gap between updates. And then there's others I remember enjoying but when I try to pick it up again it just doesn't appeal (Song of the Trees, God of the Lost).

Oddly, I never read books 5-7 more than once but non-fanfic readers love to talk about how many times they reread the series LOL


** It isn't everyone's thing, but I've never re-read a book in my life and have only really re-read the Denarian Trilogy.

linkffn(The Denrian Renegade)

It is about a sarcastic, asshole, powerful Harry with a fallen angel living inside his head. Some say he is unlikeable, but it my favourite story ever.

He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre.

** The complete list of Harry Potter fan fiction I've read and think I would be somewhat happy to reread:

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or by jacobk)
- linkffn(A Different Fate by lordhellebore)
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20), though it doesn't pass the Bechdel test.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon)
- linkao3(In Loco Parentis by Dolores_Crane)
- linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern)
- linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

Any of those, I'd be willing to read at least once every other year, and not just because I was scraping the bottom of the barrel.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

  #+begin_example
      This story takes place in the school year after Order of the Phoenix \(1996\-7\), and disregards the last two books\. \(Let's pretend I finished it on time and posted it when I originally intended to, before Half\-Blood Prince was published\.\)The question of 'underage' is pretty complicated, so I'll just say that Harry is sixteen for the duration of the story and Hermione is sixteen, turning seventeen\. The story is set in the UK at a period when the age of consent was eighteen for m/m and sixteen for m/f sex\. It's my intention and belief that all the sex in the story is depicted as taking place between fully consenting adults, even when it is ill\-advised\.Thanks to my generous and able beta\-readers; I disregarded many of their suggestions, so if this story is flawed, it's my fault, not theirs\.

** The /Alexandra Quick/ series, if one takes enough time in between the finishing of Stars Above and the restarting of Thorn Circle. It's so complex and the plot is so well-crafted that it's honestly a joy reading it again, if only in preparation for World Away, which I HOPE will come out sometime before the end of 2016. It's like the 3-year-summer with GoF and OotP (4 and 5 in both cases!) but it's already been 4 years.
