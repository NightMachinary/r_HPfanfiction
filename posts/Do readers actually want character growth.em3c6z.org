I clicked on the comments for a few stories today and was struck by how many essentially read "I hate what you've done to X character and I'm not going to read anymore!" but were for chapter 3 of fics with dozens more chapters. I realised I've seen this sort of comment often.

This got me to wondering:

Do we as readers have little patience for character growth, and do we only want things a certain way, right away? (I don't mean growth as in Harry learns a bunch of spells or has a massive change of character in chapter 2 and pretty much stays that new, static character for the rest of the fic. Rather, I mean the sort of prolonged, fluid character growth that comes with continued experiences.)

Does readers' disinterest in character growth encourage authors to nix nuanced character development in favour of immediate audience gratification (after all, many of the most popular fics are devoid of real character development)?

How much do you think you allow for characters to grow and change before giving up on a fic that has a character (especially younger Harry, for example) who has traits you don't immediately like?

I'd also appreciate recs for fics that you think show real interest in character development (I'm wondering if I also have little patience and opted out before I should have.)

Thanks in advance.


** It depends on how it is done.

For example, the web novel Overgeared starts the protagonist out as an worthless, stupid, unlikable person - all in the name of character development. If you read the reviews of the story, many people say “Sure, he's pretty bad, but he gets a lot better after chapter 100.” So I am expected to slog through 100 chapters of unlikable main character because the author wanted a lot of character development. Fuck that...

Whereas A Practical Guide to Evil shows a lot of development in the protagonist, but she's interesting/likeable the whole time, not after hundreds of pages of “character development”.

** I think it's true in most cases. Fanfiction is mostly read by people who want to read about their favorite characters. They want something familiar. And character growth is mostly not on the menu unless it's similar to how canon developed those characters.

The number of threads/posts criticizing authors for things that they decide to do different than canon, long essays telling how things went down in canon and insistence on keeping it same are far too common.

I think people, in fandom, prefer it more if characters stays same in story (preferably similar to canon - the only exception being Harry Potter but even that is accepted barely on this subreddit), and goes through different situations.

** One of my less popular fics has young Tonks starting out as an anti-werewolf bigot, which I think is to be expected considering the culture she grew up in. She only comes around later, after she falls for Lupin. A reader flounced off in a huff, commenting that Tonks was one of the good guys, therefore it was OOC for her to have any flaws. I just laughed and kept writing what I like. I don't write for readers like that.

** I never go off of the most recent comments/reviews on a fic. I go for the middle of the list or when the last chapter was made.

I tend to go look for warnings of bad grammar, "written by a middle school student", major character death out of goddamn nowhere.

​***

But I agree. Any kind of character growth, or movement away from canon and it's "OMFWTFBBQ, THAT'S BASHING! BASHING IS EVIL!!!1 FUCK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER'S COUCH!"

I can stand wild character growth or movement from canon as long as the writing supports it.

Like this one: The Power, linkffn(5422914)

It /looks/ like your run of the mill bashing fic *at first glance*. But, as you go in you find out all sorts of stuff. Yeah, Dumbledore is an asshole in this fic, but you can't win everything. Ron looks bad too for a while until it's revealed that it is because of Dumbledore's meddling AND birth defects from potions while Molly was pregnant (Every sibling is brilliant in their own way except for him?). It really went deep into backstory and lore of the planet, magic, and society.

Back to the character growth of this fic: Harry makes a different decision and things start changing. He picked up a runes book at the start of summer and instead of putting it back down, started devouring it, wanting to be able to do magic during the summer. More stuff happens and his character starts to diverge from canon. Then all of a sudden he's snapped back to canon for reasons. Then the growth happens again, in a different direction.

Quite a few other characters have growth too, and it fits with canon in a weird way. Even with the background tweaking. Hell, even CRABBE and freaking GOYLE have character growth. Crazy, right? But it happens.

*** This fic has some interesting elements, but I didn't really feel like Harry was a fluid character the way OP was talking about. His growth seemed kinda forced imo.

And sure, some fics develop past the bashing. I agree this fic does. Most fics don't and I understand why some people drop them instantly. I do if it seems particularly forced (or if it has bad H/Hr, which this fic does).

I tried reading a time traveling Harry fic and the old Harry said Ron was a no good drop out in the first chapter. Okay, fine. The next chapter talked about how he was going to ensure idiot Ron's destruction, how he never regarded him as a friend in the first place, and literally described Hermione as an angel. No thanks.

** In my experience - Yes, but not most readers.

I'm writing a trilogy of Harry/Daphne fics, the first two are published now (Reddit app is being a b*tch and won't let me link, but they're called Living Dangerously and Living in Secret on FF . Net) and they focus their relationship from a real world point of view - aka Harry and Daphne are dumb, self destructive and horny teenagers - and a lot of readers have gotten very annoyed at me in the reviews for this portrayal of them. For context it's written to be Daphne's story more than it is Harry's, and sees her dealing with her emotionally abusive family in realistic ways; she's constantly the victim of gaslighting, is sheltered from the real world and sports more than a few prejudice/racist feelings of her own because of these. These issues and others aren't immediately addressed as problems (because shocker, character development takes time to happen) and the story has been labelled problematic and Daphne a Nazi as a result. There was even one instance toward the end of the first book where Daphne makes good progress becoming more independent from her Death Eater father but then relapses through fear - which anyone who has been addicted to something or has tried deliberately to change their ways will know is a very common thing to happen. But that was instantly declared “a waste of character development” and many abandoned the story, for me that was when I realised I was writing mostly for myself and not for others.

If I was just a bad author then I could completely understand the critique of this portrayal as I know what it's like to read a story that has characters acting nonsensical and dumb, but there's still a decent amount of the reviewers (usually ones who actually sound like they know what they're talking about) who absolutely love the story, understand completely what I'm doing with it and praise the realistic approach.

So - and I acknowledge that I may just be speaking from the point of view of a sour author - in my experience there is genuinely a large amount of FF readers that DO want realistic/good quality character development in their story, but sadly there is a larger amount who just want a fairytale version of their character filled with enough average fluff to feed their fandom appetite for a few more days.

That's my bit of rant/free advertising done, anyone else have similar experiences to me? Would love to feel some validation

** I like character growth quite a bit, but my tastes are pretty unusual.

I'm currently writing a fic where Lavender is overdramatic, can't really talk about her feelings, kinda careless, and judgmental. The fic is partially about the issues those traits cause her and how she learns as time goes on, but also how she can be all those things and still be a "good" person. I want her to be a dynamic character, like you talked about. It's harder to write, especially as a guy, but it feels rewarding.

** I think if you start off as drastically different from canon personality, and in a seemingly lazy way, people will be disappointed. Now, some people have their headcanon that will make even a canon personality for your characters seem like an issue.

For instance, if you start your fic with character bashing and making Ron completely useless, I don't particularly care if you've got him growing a lot throughout the next 30+ chapters - it's still something that makes it likelier I'll drop it early. A non-lazy one, though, is much more fun.

It all comes down to the writing quality for me - but I think most people find it easier to see character growth from a starting point they believe in, and the easiest there is to have the characters similar to how they are at that point in canon.

** Short answer: fanfiction is mostly made for (and by) people seeking rapid wish fulfillment, so of course the majority is exactly that, which is not good story unless done ironically (can be turned into hilarity that way).

Long answer:

Most people (generally) get into fanfiction to see their insert character(s) be amazing or spectacular at whatever they do. To this end, the changes are almost always immediate or hand-waved and often used as a poor man's diatribe about "what is wrong in the canon story." Now, practically everyone starts in ff for exactly that - its popular because its what most people get into this pseudo-apocrypha for.

However, when people stick around for a time, have read enough fics to see the same tropes/styles/poor writing done ad infinitum, they start looking for something more. They mellow out, if you will. To that end they start looking for more realistic portrayals or more canon-like styles or something that truly stands out amidst the carbon copies.

Or more succinctly: most readers and writers of fanfiction don't care about character growth so much as character /empowerment/. But once they have grown tired of the rehashed characterizations, they either a) leave the fandom or fanfiction entirely or b) start looking for the needles in the hay stack.

So yes and no basically.

** One of the best ways I've found to cut down on comments like that is to post the entire story, all at once. It's easier to stay engaged with a completed story than a story that you have to come back to every week (or month, or year) and reread to remember what's happening.

But to answer your question: it depends on the time frame of the story, how likable the character is, and what length. A story spanning a few hours won't get much character development; a story spanning a few years should have it as a primary focus. A character determined to do bad things for bad reasons will have people leaving the fic, no matter how much the character is developed later on. A 2k-word story won't develop a character the way a 200k-word story does.

The thing is, I'm reading (and writing) fic for fun. I'm not going to read a story that isn't compelling. That's not necessarily the same as "has traits I don't like". If a fic starts out with seven pages of "Harry was having the worst summer of his life and here's why", before we even get to the opening scene of him lying on his bed and staring at the wall before getting up to make breakfast for the Dursleys, I'm going to back out by page 4. If a story starts with Harry lying on his bed, staring at the wall, and thinking of how he can change something before getting up to make breakfast and, say, poisoning the food because he's decided murder-suicide is the way to go, I'm probably going to keep reading barring grammar/spelling/formatting errors making things unreadable. A great example of this is the Vahan Saga - Harry's learns weapons and how to lead his own gang of street rats before he even gets his Hogwarts letter. He's cold, ruthless, and overall a pretty awful person. I don't like that version of Harry as a person. But as a character, it's interesting to see how things play out, and to see how he grows into the role of a prepubescent mobster. Last I checked, his first year at Hogwarts was still being written.

I also prefer long, fluid character growth, and if there's a massive change (like, say, Snape deciding to adopt Harry in chapter 2 and Harry going along with it with no reservations), I'll back out, because it doesn't make sense. Even if it's the opening scene with flashbacks, I'll still back out - do the character development BEFORE you hit the never-gonna-happen scenes.

Don't worry about being impatient. It's not worth slogging through something you don't like on the off chance it might get better if you stick with it long enough. If you don't like it, back out.

** I think it depends on the story and the reader.

some stories don't need character development, but people often act as if they do. An action story or one where a mystery is solved, don't need to change a character, if the plot and actions are the focus that can be enough.

now other stories need character development to be interesting. Those stories focus on characters and relationships and how and why those change.

And there are of course one-shots that just focus on a small moment and only present a moment in time without any changes or the need for a deep plot.

​

All those are different and one is not better than the others on principle, but readers and writers prefer different things.

I personally I'm more of a character-driven writer and I need the decisions of the characters to make sense and they can't take a backseat to the plot, but that means that I sometimes kind of lose the plot and focus to much on the character development. At the moment I write a story about Lily Evans time in school and I know that it is not everybody's cup of tea

** It is just the opposite: the character development is everything. I have wrote this [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][blog post]] which originated in the discussion here on Reddit about what I think about the development of a story.

Having said that, there are just some character developments where readers may disagree. Either because they are missed the point of what the author wanted to say, or perhaps because the author just wrote something bad.

I don't want to name any, but all those stories where Harry gets snapped by somebody (Andromeda Tonks, Amelia Bones, Grangers) and suddenly he completely changes into spoiled superhuman prat, who forgets all above his former friends and is now super!Harry, indy!Harry, lord!Harry, who cares about his new friends/girlfriends Heiress Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones (she is at least usually not that obnoxious) or Hermione, and kicks off as a dirt anybody who socialized with him in the past as just a childish nonsense. Yeah, that is just unbelievable and badly written character development, because that is just not the person JKR wrote about (if you need to explain why, you are a lost cause).

So, other possibility than the hasty judgement over the stupid readers who don't like character development may be that the author just made a shoddy work with it.

** Its all about cause and effect. More often than not the change in character happens in an instant due to some threat or even realization. Think about that happening in real life, especially something as massive as oh im a cinic or workoholic now. Not a small thing and not something that would happen like just like that, more likely slow and deliberate stages. How often do you see realistic stages of grief? And even then if the actions feel like they exist for the change in character rather than the other way around your fucked. A great tip is the but/therefore rule from the south park guys. "If you can put and then between all the beats of your story your fucked. Change the story so that those points inbetween are but or therefore and everything will feel more natural and flowing.
