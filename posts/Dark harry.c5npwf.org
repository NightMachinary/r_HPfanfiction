Looking for a good fic that's pretty long and has a Harry that loses him self in the darkness after a terrible event. Would also like for somebody to try and save him like a love interest, but he ends up running away or they end up failing and Harry ends up going on a dark suicidal mission to kill Voldemort.

**** To be fair he is not bashing. He is saying a way to find what this person wants.
