I remember reading this fic where in 3rd year after Remus tells Harry that he was like his fathers best friend and all that. Harry just immediately starts to dislike him and asks Remus why couldn't he come get harry from the Dursley's, why couldn't he send a letter. I know that in the Art of Self Fashioning Harry doesn't like Remus.


** I'm very torn on Remus. I think in a lot of ways he's not a great person. Not evil or malicious or anything, just kind of weak willed and self-deprecating, which leads him to occasionally making harmful choices.

On the other hand, he never wanted to be a father. We know this about him. He was not Harry's guardian. He had no official or unofficial duty to Harry. Dumbledore probably told him Harry was somewhere safe, which he would have taken at face value since he trusted and respected Dumbledore and so did the Potters. He honestly would have had no reason to contact a child who wasn't related to him and who was too young to remember him, especially if he believed the child was somewhere secret and safe.

If my best friend died and her child was adopted out to distant family members at just over a year old, would I make the effort to stay in contact with them? Probably not, if I'm being honest. When the child was older I may send a letter or email offering to meet up and talk about their mom if they wanted, if I knew how to contact them/their guardians. But I wouldn't do that until the child was 15-16 and old enough to have that sort of open conversation about stuff. I certainly wouldn't feel the need to track down a young child who had no memories of me and insert myself into their life... and doubly so if I knew terrorists killed their family and others may be after the child, and the child was specifically being kept somewhere secret.

Blaming Remus for not contacting Harry earlier just feels very unfair. However, what he SHOULD have done is pull Harry aside after his first DADA lesson and say “Hey, I was friends with your parents in school. If you ever want to talk about them, my door is open.” That, IMO, is the beginning and the end of his duty to Harry.

*** Besides, ignoring the whole argument of the ministry not letting Remus take care of Harry the truth is that he turned monthly on a vicious killing machine that will do it's best to kill those around and won't differentiate friend and foe. Say what you will about wolfsbane, locked rooms and other such measures, it would only take a moment of inattentiveness or Harry getting curious and somehow managing to enter the locked room (he would be a kid, he would find a way of motivated enough) for Harry to end either dead or infected (which probably would result in Remus himself either committing suicide or being lynched at the hands of all Harry's fans. Compared to it even cannon level of abuse (bad, but not the unspeakable evil we can find in many stories) would be somewhat preferable to the risk, even more so for Lupin's eyes. And all this is without even taking in account if he would be capable (mentally, economically, physically or in any other way) of raisins successfully a child.

** I've read a couple that are interesting. Most are pretty generic "Indy!Harry yells at everything until it bends to his indomitable, all-knowing will".

The Lie I've Lived has some really interesting ideas on how Harry and Remus relate to each other, and there's some antagonistic dislike there.

Faery Heroes has a really interesting discussion with Tonks about Remus that I found quite novel. I don't remember much in the way of dealings with Remus, but it's an interesting discussion about how this Harry feels about Remus.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** I always did think that in the end, Lupin wasn't a great guy really - maybe not malicious or anything, but such a weak-spined guy that couldn't step up when his best friend's son needed him. So, like, not outright condemnable but certainly not someone James and Lily would have felt warmly towards after. I always thought he should be very grateful that Harry was a much better guardian towards Teddy than he was towards Harry.

*** Quick question: where does cannon talk about how Harry interacting with Teddy? Not a trick question, I do rather like stories in which Harry raises/helps to raise Teddy and would like to see how it went in cannon (some years since I read the books, so I could have forgotten, but for the life of me I can't remember any mention at all of Teddy in the epilogue).

*** Exactly! A lot of fics (and even canon to some extent) give Lupin the excuse of “oh I'm a werewolf and the ministry wouldn't have allowed me to be the guardian of the boy who lived” but I always found that to be bullshit. You're willing to be a part of a illegal resistance group and also fight a terrifying dark lord and his group of terrorists but you're not willing to to check in on the child of somebody who you considered your closest friend and brother?

**** I agree. I mean, I get why Lupin didn't adopt him or anything, but maybe a visit now and then? And in my humble opinion there is absolutely no reason he couldn't mention James being a friend during third year. No letters after that either.

** Only fic I've read where harry didnt like remus was Harry Potter and the marriage contracts. But that was because remus bowed to Dumbledore's will and let harry be manipulated and memory charmed.
