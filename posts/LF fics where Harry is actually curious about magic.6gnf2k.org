Hey there,

I was wondering if there were any fics which expanded on the idea that muggleborn and people like Harry (living outside of the wizarding world) would naturally be more curious about magic and its inner workings than those born and raised in the magical world and thus would learn (or try to learn) anything they could get their hands on.

Thanks in advance!


** Damn, and I was excited seeing so many comments here. This is actually one kind of fic I have always always searched for. It'sâ€‹ surprising that there aren't many good ones.

The point is that not everything has to be centered around Voldemort, or the fight with him. There are already a million such fics.

In the first book, all the "adventures" that Harry gets up to is mostly because he is naturally curious. Why can't that curiousity go towards him just exploring magic, or even Hogwarts? It seems like such an amazing place, with so many mysteries and hidden things.

It doesn't even have to be Harry, any muggleborn would be so amazed at the thought of magic, at actually learning magic, that they'd naturally treat it more than school; I know I would.

On the other hand, there is only one fic I remember seeing something remotely close to it, and I can't find it for the life of me. Well, let's go a-hunting. It started at the Hogwarts express, where Harry says something to the effect of, "Famous people are crazy, aren't they? I'd hate to be famous", and Draco, Ron and I think it was Neville worked together to keep him from finding out he was famous. Also, all of their boggarts were Harry, which was really amusing. Light hearted fic, one that I really loved.

I hate to be that guy but if your curiosity gets you into a couple of life threatening situations including an encounter with the undead genocidal Dark Lord that killed your parents it tends to fade rather quickly due to your self preservation.

** I'd like to see people do more of the linkffn(Forging The Sword) method of having a Harry later on in his education (3rd Year+ ) who becomes more interested in Magic due to his maturity (but more of a gradual progress rather than the usual heir of thirty houses and has founders and Merlin in his head). I think that it's extremely unlikely that an eleven-year-old version of myself (or anybody for that matter) would have as much interest in Magic as we would at thirteen or fourteen years of age. So it sorta makes sense for a younger Harry to feel like this is another chore, read books, do essays, practice silly motions and say silly words, just so some sparks can come out of your wand, or maybe you can levitate something one way and not be able to move it any way other than up or down. I think it's more likely for a mature Harry to appreciate magic more than a young Harry.

We also have to look at Nature vs Nurture when it comes to using Controlled Magic at a young age. Tom developed it as a necessity, a defense mechanism. We can imagine that he was bullied before his discovery of magic (though I don't think Rowling would admit it due to not wanting anyone to sympathize with him) so when he found his powers, he did anything he could to keep them around. Harry never really had those problems. I mean, he did, but it was to a much lesser extent, and in a way where it was almost considered normal to him. He grew up with the Dursleys, you know, a cupboard shouldn't just suddenly dawn on his during his eleventh birthday, as bad. Nor do I think an eleven-year-old can differentiate that when all he knows is the cupboard and hatred from his Aunt and Uncle.

Tom, however, knew that what the kids were saying was meant to hurt. He was taught differently and raised differently than Harry had been. An Orphan, he was abandoned by parents he never knew, to live with people he doesn't want to know. While this doesn't excuse his crimes, this does shed some light as to why he is so capable in Controlled Magic (probably emotion based) and why Harry isn't until we get a glimpse of it with Marge (who he feels the same contempt for as Riddle did for his possible bullies). Riddle simply grew up in a worse situation. So unless you give Harry a new threat to unleash his power on, I don't think controlled magic early for him is too plausible.

**** Not really. As far as Harry knew, he had just stopped Voldemort for either a very long time, or for good (Dumbledore's words). Nor would he specifically assume Voldemort was after him and didn't just use him as a pawn for the whole Philosopher's Stone debacle. Either way, Harry cannot train on his own to match the Dark Lord, he needs the help of Dumbledore or someone equally as competent. And Dumbledore himself stated that he was only really starting to play with the idea of telling Harry during his third year at Hogwarts. Sure, Harry could look up Defensive Spells, but I doubt he can defeat Voldemort with a book that is mass produced and mass marketed in every book store.

************ I always assumed that there were many bookstores, maybe even some that stocked battle-magic deep within its bowels for Auror Trainee self-study, and they need a permit. Definitely not at Flourish and Blotts, though, it seems too in the mainstream of things, too corporate. It's likely that they only stock up on mass-marketed and ministry-regulated books. I'm almost certain, that even in canon, there is a large list of books that are outright banned despite being for School Children.

I just think that it's a bit too easy in Hogwarts to find books and information on something. Maybe that's just the way Rowling presented it, but when I hear Wizarding library, I hear an entire room filled with shelves upon shelves of Magnum Opus', forgotten Journals, books banned from the public eye, books in ancient tounges, and books that can only be found by those they want to find. What we got was a walking plot device, where a character only went to the library because they needed to know something. If we put Harry in a position of reliance on the Hogwarts library (which is the more likely approach) we have to firstly have him already develop a habit of going there, then we need to have him develop a strong bond with teachers (aka, years of asking about things after class, talking to them in earnest, and doing extremely well in class). Because we need that Restricted Section.

The oddest thing was that Harry was in the perfect year to do this. Flitwick was a softy at heart despite being a champion duellist, he would likely admire Harry's interest in duelling and teach him some tricks of the trade. Not to mention the fact that he has an almost Horace Slughorn level of trust in his favorite students (telling Hermione that she passed despite him not supposed to be doing that, etc...)

Next, we have McGonagall, the hardass of the group. But she does show the occasional smirk when someone does something well, and she seems all too willing to break rules for Harry's and Hermione's sake. When he was supposed to get a detention for riding a broom when he wasn't supposed to, he got on the Quidditch team a year early. When Hermione was supposed to change her schedule, she instead got a Time Turner.

I'm just a bit disappointed that Hogwarts doesn't have a more comprehensive history of Magic course, where they learn and use Magic through the ages. With amazing elemental spells and odd divination techniques. History of Magic should have been one of the better classes, and I was fully prepared for Harry to come back to Hogwarts one day in canon and find that Binns had passed on, and they needed a new History of Magic Teacher, in which this one was a friend of Harry's (could be a sufficient way of putting Remus and Sirius both in a teaching position).

So just to clarify...

You mean fics where he discovers his magic at a much earlier age and tries to learn more about it and play with it and explore it and the like... WELL before learning of and entering the Wizarding world?

Or do you just mean hes naturally more curious and like Hermione, reads everything he can and perhaps experiments way more outside the bounds of "classes"?

Of course, there is also matter of the body being pretty stupid. Of course, you can construct the argument that those who live with magic their whole lives will be used to it and treat it like a normal part of the life, whereas people new to it will be fascinated by it and want to learn a lot about it.

But you can also construct different arguments. You can say that people familiar with magic their whole life will have the greater understanding of its vast possibilities, people they will want to match, years of waiting for being finally able to finally learn it. Those new to it? They will be fine with whatever their achievements will be, they will be blinded by pretty lights and not look for what is deeper, they won't understand how the ability will shape their future life.

There is, of course, some truth to the both sides here. In the end, it will largely depend on individuals, that's why the whole assumption from the OP is ridiculous and comes straight from some terribad muggle-wank fics.

You've got a valid point. There are of course those that have been around magic their whole life and will still be eager to learn anything they can get their hands on. But then there will also be those (much like canon Harry) who, after a time, say "oh, that's cool" but don't do much to try and actually grasp what's behind it. That seemed to be a common theme.

I must say, I didn't formulate the body very well, but setting into a circle jerk of "that's stupid" isn't gonna help anyone and if you had read pretty much /anything/ written in here, I'm sure you would've had something actually valuable to contribute to the discussion.

Canonically, we were shown pretty much even numbers of more inspired and creative wizards from both muggle and wizarding background with most of the wizards being unambitious. There was no correlation shown there, it was all up to individual personality.

  Plus, you seem like a somewhat eloquent guy, so I'm sure a bit of thinking could have brought you to a conclusion as to what's really being asked in here.

You flatter me, but actually I still don't know if you want any fic where Harry is curious about magic (in which case I know some good), or the "muggleborns rule" ones (in case of which I've read some like that, but they blended together in my mind with other OP Harry trash fics).

******* Nah no "muggleborn rule" fics. I think the discussion got out of hand.

It seems I'll have to reread the books, because I have entirely different memories regarding Hogwarts students applying themselves.

I'm basically just looking for a Harry that's more curious about magic. No godlike!Harry shit, no Mini-Voldemort-Harry, and no super genius!Harry. Most of it is just super cringy so I try to avoid it.

******** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slowpaced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friends sister. And things spiral out of there.

[[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in a more magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year is complete, but it stands on its own and theoretically, there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. On hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still a very good read. And of course, it's dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] - Inspired by the above fic comes this AU in the world where Voldemort won. Unfortunately pretty short and hiatused so far, but I hold hope that Halt will continue it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. Just came out of hiatus.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html][Out of the Night]] - Pretty AU fic about Harry hiding in Knockturn Alley. Interesting take on wizarding culture and dark magic. Sadly dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505][Wit of the Raven]] - Heavily AU fic, with an interesting alternative system of magic and more meritocratic Hogwarts. Strong focus on school life and especially school competitions. Dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826][An Unfound Door]] - Very talented, yet very flawed Harry spends most of his time away from his classmates. Hidden in secret rooms he spends his time learning, experimenting and making drugs. Infrequent updates.

********* Holy damn. The only fic of those I've already read is /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ (amazing one at that).

I usually don't touch fics that haven't been updated in over a year, but I think I'll make an exception here.

This list will definitely keep me reading for a while. Thank you!
