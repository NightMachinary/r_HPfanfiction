Do any good ones exist? All of them are cliche out the wazoo or are just terribly written. I'm honestly curious if any good ones exist.


** Best fic of soul bond there is imo, without question, the linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond)

Its just so so funny and well done and realisticaly between 2 people who don't know each other, as most soul bond fics are, but sadly abandoned.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

** The only two that I've ever come across that have been worth reading are:

- /Harry Potter and the Lost Demon/ by Angry Hermione, which doesn't use the soul bond in the typical way that most fics do - it's not just the means to get two characters together, rather, it was something that arose naturally between compatible people and was subsequently broken and therefore in need of repair. This fic also has the only good use of a "love potion" that I've ever come across. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2993199/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lost-Demon]])

- /Error of Soul/ by Materia-Blade. This fic actually tried to explore what having a soul bond formed against your will would actually be like for two people. Sadly, as has been mentioned already in this thread, it's been abandoned. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul]])

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

*** It is really good. I am afraid I've lost couple of hours of work by reading this instead, but I would really sequel to this. I have been thinking lately (and I am over twenty years happily married) about the proportion of important of pure love (they just fit together) and hard work on the happiness in the marriage. I am more and more annoyed how all fan fictions (including those who are supposedly written for more adult readers) fawns just about the first and nobody ever mentions the latter.

Which leads to my thoughts about arranged marriages. We Europeans are usually completely outraged over the idea, but when the majority of humankind does it, it cannot be all bad, could it? I have a friend from India who is breaking her head about what to do with her relationships. She still expects her parents help her with arranging her marriage (which is rather sweet, when she says it), except she is living in Prague, Czechia, and they are in India, she is a Christian and her parents are Hindus, so they don't know almost anybody who is a Christian, and so on. And it is the same thing as hard work on the marriage relationship: all Hollywood-induced films are raging against this, but I would love to see more thoughts about it.

So, I would like to see continuation of this story, where Harry and Hermione realize (she is a rather smart girl, after all), that their dating options are rather limited, and that the Fate just ordered them to be together. They will gradually accept the idea. Not in the all other soul-bond fics style, "We say to everybody we are forced to do it, but really we cannot wait until we hop into the bed together and tell everybody in details how it was". Hermione really in tears breaks up with Ron ("Hermione, do you mean to say that the really the only option for both of us to be together is a threesome? Ewww."), and they just decide with Harry to make it work, even though they really don't like each other like that. It could be interesting and original.
