  Hermione makes new friends at Hogwarts -- and one lifelong enemy -- with her newfound love for proper skin and hair care. The wizarding world will be changed forever! A silly idea turned serious, and dedicated to those who skim read the title of my fic "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" a bit too fast. Hermione POV, humour, no pairings, complete.

** For a moment, I was expecting with the Halloween and Ron thing that the normal troll incident would actually be reversed, with Hermione and her friends saying something that jabs at Ron's inferiority complex, which provokes him to run away, and inadvertently run into the troll.

*** For a moment I though you were going to make Hermione talk with the surprisingly female troll about skin and hair care products...
