You know how it is... Harry doing accidental magic at the dursley's for whatever reason. My question is what is canon and what is fanon. Common ones include but are not limited to; Harry appearing on his school's roof to escape. Harry's hair growing back in one night (I think this one is fanon actually) and one I just recently heard, Harry healing quickly from things.

I am fairly certain the latter two are fanon, but the former is the hard one. I found a reference to it on Harry Potter wikia, but not on the lexicon, and I am unsure if it was an add on.

ANY help would be appreciated.

Also, what are other *believable* accidental magic moments for Harry James Potter?


** Hair growing back IS CANON. Petunia cut everything except his bangs (to hide his 'ugly' scar). Harry fretted about how he would be teased the next day at school, and by the morning it seemed like petunia had done nothing at all. School roof is canon. There's also turning some annoying teacher's wig blue, and she told Petunia. I'm pretty sure the only instance of healing is when Harry gets pushed by Dudley and breaks his arm, and it heals. All I can remember, correct me if I'm wrong.

Edit: Opened up the book because I can. Chapter 2, pg 24 in American hardback version. In addition to what I listed before: Petunia was trying to force Harry in to 'a revolting old sweater', but it just kept shrinking until it 'might have fitted a hand puppet.' Oh and vanishing the glass in the snake exhibit at the zoo. I also remember the door to the cupboard under the stairs blew open of its own accord after the Marge incident. Huh. No mention of turning his teachers wig blue. I was so sure it was canon.

*** I too, am sure that the wig blue thing is canon. I'm sure I can find it

EDIT: Ah, here we are: " Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue"

No wonder I was having a hard time finding it, it's all the way on chapter 7, when Harry is wating to be sorted.

Definitely fanon. The others are canon IIRC.

*** I always considered the hair growth event as proof of some metamorphic ability. In fact ignoring the movies we never get any proof that Harry ever cuts is hair.. Yes it is a rather silly thing that doesn't need to be written about, but one wonders...

**** There is as much evidence for that as there is for Harry being a replicant or having a tapeworm. He eats many feasts, but according to canon, never has a bowel movement. Not. One.

****** Girls' bathrooms, as I believe that outside of the prefects' bathroom these are the only ones we see him go into.

Since we are doing crazy ideas now, is that evidence that all the gender-bender stories about him are true?

** Also canon: Harry making an ugly sweater shrink to doll-size as Petunia was trying to fit it over his head.

The thing with escaping to the roof is often attributed to apparition, but the description lends itself more to a sudden leap with less mass to hold him down.

** Hair growing back is, as others have pointed out, canon. A very common fan interpretation is that this is a sign that Harry is really a Metamorphmagus... but I don't really buy it.

If he was, we would have seen a lot more instances of changing. We saw how Tonks altered her appearance at a whim, and even her son was changing his hair colour readily when he was only a few hours old. Seems to me more likely that what happened was that Harry unwittingly performed a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hair-thickening_Charm][Hair-Thickening Charm]], or some variant thereof.

*** Yeah - HP being a metamorph from that evidence only makes sense if you also have some variant of 'HP's magic or specific abilities were bound/sealed/suppressed'

** Vanishing the glass at the zoo.

I think a believable instance of accidental magic would be: turning something of Dudleys into something else, like Fred did with Ron's bear, unlocking a door, and summoning food. Both Riddle and McGonagall controlled pets, so maybe he does something with Ripper, too.

** The thing with the roof is that it is canon that he /somehow/ got there with his accidental magic; the exact method of doing so, however, is not known.

Also, it should be fairly obvious but he caused Marjorie Dursley to get blown up like a balloon and float.
