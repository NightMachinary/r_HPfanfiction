  Anyone can tell you that there aren't muggleborns in Slytherin. There may be a handful of particularly vicious halfbloods, but there aren't any muggleborns. No one can say precisely how they know there aren't muggleborns in Slytherin, but they know that there aren't. It's just how things work. “Tracey Davis,” Tracey introduces herself. Daphne Greengrass lifts one snowy eyebrow. “Davis? Do you mean Davies?”If there were any muggleborns in Slytherin, they would be playing a very dangerous game. (In which Tracey Davis accidentally tricks nearly everyone into thinking she's a pureblood, befriends the Bloody Baron, and slowly climbs to greatness.)

** I released the first year of a fic with a Harry, Tracey, Neville trio. Writing the second year atm. I'm /hoping/ it doesn't come off like she has no personality. No promises.

No bash or slash, though leaving possibility of future slash open.

  A different Harry Potter grows up on Privet Drive. From there, everything changes. Or are there perhaps larger undercurrents at work? Year One Complete. Expect more canon divergence as time goes on. *Will be released by year, second year well underway*

** There's definitely a Slytherin!Harry series where she's probably the most well-developed female character, but I'm struggling to find it at the moment... I'll keep looking and try to update if I can find it

Update: it's the They Shook Hands series by Dethryl. It has 6 complete years, but looks abandoned (3 years since any activity on his FFN account).

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”
