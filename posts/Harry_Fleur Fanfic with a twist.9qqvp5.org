Just came here to post about the fic I am currently writing and see if anyone was interested in it.

The Codex

Harry is left with a lasting legacy. He is given a most curious object in the form of a dragon egg, the last of its kind in the hopes that it will hatch for him. Two will become one, bonded for eternity. Matched only by the bond of love. The power of that bond will give him strength to stand against his enemies. Good Dumbledore, no bashing. FleurxHarry romance, slow burn. Harry Potter - Rated: T - English - Adventure/Romance - Chapters: 16 - Words: 78,124 - Reviews: 151 - Updated: 10/15/2018 - Published: 5/9/2018 - [Harry P., Fleur D.]

There aren't any soul bonds

** As with your last post, tell us something about your story and don't just leave us with a vague description. It is impossible to tell what the overall setting of that story is (TWT? 5th year? 6th year?) and where this story is going other than the fact that romance will play a predominant role.

Because I will point out once more, that description sounds like a "worst of bad tropes" collection and "Matched only by the bond of love" sticks out like a sore thumb there.

*** Yeah I've been thinking of a rewrite of the summary I just don't want to give too much away on a summery, id rather have someone just read and and see what it's about, but I'll give a revision some thought. I just don't want to mess up what's been working for me.

Its something else if I come across your fic on FFN and have no other options. But on here I want some details. That is /why/ i'm here in the first place.

I agree with you 100%, doesn't matter if summary gives things away because without sufficient information I won't even read.

****** u/Hellstrike:
#+begin_quote
  But that's exactly what i'll do
#+end_quote

I think that's what everyone here does. Look at the description/tags and go through a mental checklist, For me, said list looks roughly like:

#+begin_quote
  Any Malfoy?

  Snape?

  Voldemort?

  Any other Death Eater?

  Angst?

  Tragedy?

  Hermione/any Weasely?

  Remus Lupin?

  Neville Longbottom?

  Albus Severus?

  Happy Weasley family?

  Hermione bashing?

  Kids in "true love"?

  Less than 1k words/chapter?
#+end_quote

If the answer has been no all across the board, I'll consider the story.

**** I don't normally do this because God knows I make my fair share of typos.

But...

summery - of pertaining to Summer

summary - a brief statement accounting for the main points of something.

Only an idiot like TE7 makes grammar errors in a self-promo post.

** I don't know why everyone's saying your summary sucks. It's a bit cheesy with the "bond of love, bonded for eternity" bit (you use bond three times, I'd reword that, it sounds repetitive), but overall, it provides a pretty decent picture of what to expect: a somewhat sappy, emotionally-driven Harry/Fluer fic with Dumbledore playing a positive (possible mentor-like) role.

Maybe the people that didn't understand that needed a picture or a powerpoint presentation or something; I dunno.

As far as tropes go: that word is really overused a lot. It means nothing. If your writing and plot structure is good, then any so-called "trope" will be overlooked.

As far as your story: it's not really my thing. However, I read the first chapter. I think you use descriptors very well; the adjectives are often well placed, vivid, and give a real sense of the event that's happening.

I was not, however, a fan of the character's motivations: for example, at the very start, Petunia enters with a change of heart and there's no build-up for it; which isn't really something I enjoy. One more thing that bothered me was that you don't denote some conversations with a comma at the end (I glanced at chapter 16, you don't do it there either).

So, for example, you have: "I know" Aldrich agreed... ; it should be "I know/,/" Aldrich agreed. It's not a major thing, but if I was reading, I would find it bothersome.

I'm actually curious, is english a second language for you? Don't take that as criticism -- it's not, at all -- but some of the sentence structure sounded more like french...or maybe spanish...a romance language.

Anyway, that's my two cents. Hope you keep on writing! You're doing pretty good; obviously a lot of people are following/enjoying, so keep it up!

**** They're saying the sentence structure doesn't flow right. It reads as if the person who wrote it isn't overly familiar with the language.

It's minor things that seem just off. Like usage of passive voice that makes it feel more translated than native. Things like the opening two sentences. The first one, the word order just feels wrong. The second one is a fragment.

Then the second sentence of the letter is a run-on.

A lot of it feels like something that was run through a translator app rather than something that was composed in English. Short, choppy sentences with odd word order and a lack of understanding of comma usage are two of the trademarks of ESL writers.

Popping randomly to Chapter 13. It's opens with:

"There were standing outside an old pub that's sign read the Leaky Cauldron."

Apostrophe usage arguments aside that sentence isn't...technically...wrong. (It is, but I don't feel like typing out a grammar lesson about subject agreement and apostrophe usage). But it's just poor. Something better would be along the lines of:

"They were standing outside of an old pub The sign on the wall indicated the building was known as The Leaky Cauldron."

I could go into a stylistic commentary on certain things, like why even bother using a separate clause to identify the building because that's not usually how narration or thinking works and there's no grammatical reason to have the subject be 'pub' then identify it in a secondary clause. But that would be more of a discussion on my opinions of style and not something that you may agree with.

** I really like your story, but one thing that you may want to take into account is putting slightly longer chapters out(maybe around 6k-7k words) even if it means taking an extra few days for the chapter to come out. I'm pretty sure that many would not mind waiting a couple extra days or even an extra week if we get longer updates.

Edit: week, as in a singular week. Not weeks.

*** O.o 16 chapters and 80k words is a very good ratio, hell a 16/32k would have been already way above average....

5k per chapter is a nice middle ground, no need to have novel length chapters, otherwise people is forced to stop mid chapter which sucks.
