No slash. This is a slightly insane Harry that decides since he is going to be the next Dumbledore, Draco would be the perfect Snape.

Because I have to say this, obviously OOC and Crack.


** "Harry...." began Hermione

"Shut up,McGonagall,go stand next to Gellert" snapped Harry . Hermione huffed and walked over to stand next to Ron

A familiar whiff of an expensive cologne made from baby unicorns could be smelt as the blond boy whose nickname of the week was "inbred showdog" walked into the corridor with his nose up in the air

Harry gave a wide smile,a permanent twinkle in his eye (the result of a bribed Ravenclaw who was good at Charms)

"Hello,Drakey" he drawled

"Hello,Potter. You and the Weasel taking turns with the Mudblood" grunted the Malfory heir

Harry's twinkle grew ever larger

"I am in need of an inside man in the Slytherin Common Room. The last person they would ever suspect"

"Ha" snorted Malfoy "I would never help someone like you"

Harry's twinkle grew to blinding levels

"Why Draco,I have what the French call leverage" he snapped his fingers as Hermione fumbled in her bag and retrieved a large stack of photographs which she handed to Harry who shoved them at Malfoy

Malfoy glanced down and paled . The photographs were all of him engaged in various reputation ruining activites

"It's amazing what some Creevys and photo-altering charms can do" laughed Ron

Malfoy gave Ron an intense glare and was abruptly slapped across the face by Harry

"Don't you dare look at my Gellert like that,you whore" he screeched

Draco whimpered,tears starting to form in his eyes

Hermione gave a small smile

"Do we have an agreement ?" She whispered

Draco gave a choked sob of yes before darting down the corridor

Harry stared down the hall as the blond ponce fled

"This could be the start of a fruitful relationship,my little Severus" he giggled

** Not gonna lie, I clicked on this thinking it'd be Harry deciding that since Draco is his Snape, then he should go out of his way to win over the girl that's always around Draco, namely Pansy Parkinson. Maybe I just feel like we need more Harry/Pansy in the world, I dunno.

*** I don't care about the pairings all that much, but your idea is such a great subversion of what I was thinking of I can't help but like it.
