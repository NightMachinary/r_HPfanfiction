I like them on the longer side, prefer story over the alternative, and can stand with almost anyone else being paired with Harry as long as Hermione is there and it is a good story.

I know that there has been one in the past, but it has been a while and lots of new fics have been published since then.


** Either Forever Knight or Angelica by delivermefromeve on Portkey are among my favourites. Forever Knight is generally more well known and liked, but I think I prefer Angelica now.

FK has a lot of sex in the first half, as a warning. The author admits she went a bit overboard, but the fic itself is worth it.

Both are big reads (FK bigger) that follow a similar structure but with very different, fairly original stories. They're both angsty though, if that will turn you off. But both endings are quite satisfying. The interpersonal drama is top notch in these two fics.

My main problem with them is that Harry tends to be portrayed as rather angry, far more than I feel he is in canon. That said, I feel all characters are well written. And both manage to put Harry and Hermione's together without bashing Ron, which is a rarity.

Pretty sure the bot doesn't work for Portkey...? Delivermefromeve in Google should get you to Portkey.

** A really great one in terms of story is Reign of the Serpent, by AlphaEph19. It's an AU where the Hogwarts houses are actually a magical caste system and Muggleborns are essentially Untouchables. It's hugely absorbing and a fascinating read. A really angsty one is Many Thanks, by Madm05. It's a good one to check out if you're a Hermione fan.

Happy reading!

** Any story about H/Hr by Starfox5 is good: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5]] *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), and *Harry Potter and the Spygirl*, linkffn(10959290), are especially fun read.

White Squirrel writes great Hermione centered stories too: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel]] I particularly like *The Arithmancer*, *Lady Archimedes*, and *The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(10070079;11463030;9863146)

Then there is *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), a very popular fic on this sub. I like the Hermione in this story the most.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059), is not well known, but is a nice time travel story. The Hermione here is different than in canon (thanks to Harry's intervention), but nevertheless has a great character.

Finally, I highly recommend *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), for some light hearted reading.

** Most of my favourites have already been suggested but here are a couple of others.

linkffn(8378130) The Portrait - just about the shortest story on ff.net and the H/Hr is implied rather than explicit, but still rather sweet.

linkffn(9766604) What We're Fighting For - takes a while to get going but it's definitely a good one.

linkffn(3705709) Blood Bound: A Vampire Story - won't be to everyone's taste but I found myself hooked. The pairing takes a long time to get going though.

linkffn(11080542) Patron - Disclaimer: I've been a beta on this one for the past couple of months. However, the reason I volunteered to do that is because this story is absolutely brilliant. The romance is utterly believable and beautifully written.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

** linkffn(Resistance by lorien829; Senses by lorien829; Bridges by lorien829)

I love everything I've read so far by Lorien829. Her narration is especially good. There's an excellent use of imagery throughout her work that enhances the already wonderfully concise and thoughtful worldbuilding.

I'd recommend starting with Senses. It's a fully canon compliant story that picks up shortly after the DH epilogue. Even though it's labeled as Angst, it's really not. The conflict is purposeful and relevant to the characters' arcs within the larger narrative. The characters themselves communicate their desires effectively to the reader through well-crafted dialogue and exhibit just the right amount of agency to move the plot forward.

** If you like them well written but tropey as hell then basically anything written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][Robst]] will fit what you are looking for.

Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion is a crack fic that is well worth the read. linkffn(5483280)

Probably the best romance H/Hr fic is Vox Corporis. linkffn(3186836)

Lastly, Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon is probably the most interesting time travel H/Hr fic out there. linkffn(6517567)

*** Buyer beware with Robst for those that are unaware: His stories tend to start out well, and (sometimes) have interesting premises, but end up ridiculously sappy, with protagonists experiencing no actually threatening conflict after the beginning of the story

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

**** I was going to add Vox Corporis but you beat me to it. It's a beautiful romantic story without the usual bashing of other characters. It's possibly a little drawn-out, and the ending definitely goes on a bit long, but it's definitely worth a read.
