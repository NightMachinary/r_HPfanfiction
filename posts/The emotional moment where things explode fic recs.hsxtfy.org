You know when a character is overcome with grief or rage and everything gets wrecked in a dramatic and cool fashion?

I want some fics with that moment and with Harry having it because I love this strongly emotional boy.

My Preferences, but can be ignored:

- No Character Bashing
- No Independent Harry fics or any variation of that.

I don't care if they are WiPs or abandoned.

Just The Moment.

*Edit: added words to widen the net.


** Harry gets real upset when he isn't able to save Ron on Ron's birthday in For Lack of a Bezoar (alternate 6th/7th year).

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

**** That had elements of what I wanted, not quite an big moment. HOWEVER, holy shit that was good. Like at the end I cried when Ron met him at the station and when I loved when Andromeda had a moment of that Black family madness. Thank you for putting that in my life.

*** If it's not up my alley, it'll be up someone else's.

People like The Moment in different settings than I do. Gonna add the word preferred to my above preferences.

If he gets super emotional enough to cause destruction on accident then it fits.

If you remember it then you can link it if you want to.

** What exactly are you asking for? Theres tons of fics that use it as a one off use of accidental magic once harry is at Hogwarts, do you want fics where it is a plot point/happens more often or just any fic where it happens?

*** There are a lot of answers to that question.

Ones that come from fear of distress

The sudden black out ones with the destructive aftermath

The “What Have I Done?” ones

The ones with clear warning signs that you should stop pushing him.

The ones that they don't know are starting until someone else is yelling at them

I'm not sure how the scale works for HP fic.

The ones that stuck with you and maybe you sometimes think about or even reread.

** There's one where Hermione gets thrown out of Hogwarts by Umbridge, then almost killed by violent aurors trying to arrest her for something she didn't do, and then she's a fugitive. She's pretty angry at the government, mostly at Lucius Malfoy who was pretty obviously behind the latest anti-muggleborn laws so bigoted the NSDAP would file a copyright claim, so she gets revenge and blows up his party. Not with accidental magic, but with a ruthlessly calculated blast of magically duplicated plastic explosives and Gemino-cursed homemade Napalm. Almost as destructive as Fiendfyre with a shockwave way faster than anyone could cast a shield charm. The moment you're looking for is in Chapter 3, with more attacks and explosions in later chapters.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
