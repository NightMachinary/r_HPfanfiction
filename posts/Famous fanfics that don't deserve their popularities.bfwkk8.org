Title says it. My two picks are:

- 893 by Yanagi-wa. Pandering to stereotypical Japanese ninja "fetishes", random character settings(Neville can speak Japanese?!), baseless Weasley Bashing(of course, twins are exceptions), high key weeabo, Japan apologist, terrible Japanese translation, brain dead Dumbledore.

- Harry Potter and Slytherin Prince. Completely derailed from the original plot, way too many side plots, cringy powerful Harry.

For example, 1 MoR fic is called Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence and it involves Hariezer Yudotter founding a cult and trying to feed all of humanity to a basilisk.

Another is called Significant Digits, and within the first chapter Harry reflects on how his actions in MoR had "the confidence of a first year psychology student" and how the only reason he hadn't destroyed the world was because Dumbledore literally knew the future.

***** Well, the machine translations generally do botch grammar a bit for context-specific languages, which is one thing (and you can fix that some if you know enough and have access to a dictionary, though generally I think it's better to just copy-paste the whole thing into your Japanese text editor of choice and check the meaning of kanji you do not know and then just translate as you go), but the author botched basic spelling which is ... wow.

And, for the benefit of those who don't want to read it to protect their brains from it, I'm not talking about things stemming from differences in the romanisation used, but rather about things like “wa tashi” (“watashi” is a single ideogram, so separating that into two words is ... how does that even happen?) and “des” (there's no “s” syllable in Japanese, only “su” because when you want the last vowel to be inaudible you usually go with “-u”). The whole phrase in which it appears is clearly something you can only see in basic language learning books, with the whole “watashi no namae ha [insert name] desu”, so clearly the author hasn't really moved beyond the very basics that would require them to copy-paste, which makes it even more baffling. I could go further and dissect the whole thing by stating that it's also unrealistic for someone presented as a boy in mafia to use “watashi” instead of “boku”, or even “ore” depending on the age, and that the author seems to be lacking any kind of knowledge about Japanese culture and that they are treating it as more or less a fad.

*** I actually really liked the way she was written. I didn't find her passive, just more reserved than canon Harry in a way that is consistent with her being a girl and raised by the Dursleys. She still maintains strong loyalty to her friends, cares about others and has a people saving thing. She speaks her mind when it matters and still has the sarcastic and sassy side.

There are a lot of fem!Harry fics about that make Harry super OP and outgoing and I liked the fact that this fic didn't go that in that direction.

Although the main reason I liked the fic may be because I found her experiences as a girl to be very relatable. The way she experiences Hogwarts life and friendships as a slightly awkward tomgirl was well written and really captured growing up for me.

Who's a judge and what are the criteria?

Fanfiction is first of all guilty pleasure. We don't read it for the best writing or outstanding plot -- we have more serious and classical literature for that.

The most popular stories on FanFiction.Net are good for the most, especially for the first time readers.

But you gave me a thought and I think I'll implement it in a minute... :-)
