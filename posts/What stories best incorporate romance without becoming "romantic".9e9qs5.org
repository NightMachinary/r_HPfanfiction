I'm having a hard time formulating a title for this post. I'm interested in what stories people think balance action/story/non-romantic main plot well with romantic elements, but which aren't /devoted/ to romance.

Sort of related to this, I'm curious about stories that people think are great even if they don't care for the main pairing typically.

To take a really famous example, it seems lots of people who generally don't care for slash really like /The Marriage Stone/ despite the Snape/Harry pairing.\\
I'm not a big fan of H/G , but I quite liked Kurinoone's /Dark Prince/ trilogy.\\
Both these fics incorporate romance, but they're still great fics even if you take out the romantic elements.

What stories do you know that are like this?

** I absolutely recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. It's basically about Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Audrey's perspectives during the Deathly Hallows. It mainly focuses on their struggles during the war. linkffn(12181042) Status: Complete

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802), is mostly adventure, but handles Petunia/Sirius and Harry/Hermione relationships very well.

Another recent work from the same author, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), is mainly about fighting Voldemort and his allies, but both H/G and R/Hr romances have a strong effect of turning Harry dark, since Ginny, Hermione, and Ron are becoming increasingly corrupted by their association with Grindelwald.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...

** Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer For Delinquents on the Run comes to mind. I definitely don't view it as a romantic tale, it's much less about Draco/Harry (a pairing I have never been a fan of) than it is about friendships in general.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

*** The thing is, romantic relationships are a huge part of the human existence and outright ignoring them makes longer stories lack something. Obviously, a main plot not centred around romance is a good thing, but denying its existence isn't the way to go.
