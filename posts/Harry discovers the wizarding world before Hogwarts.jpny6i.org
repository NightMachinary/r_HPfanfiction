Looking for stories where Harry somehow discovers the wizarding world (not just magic) before he goes to Hogwarts, this could be through accidentally stumbling upon the Leaky Cauldron or finding Lily's old diaries or maybe a magical snake told him about it etc. etc.

Then he would go on to learn about magic from books, his family history perhaps, meeting other wizards, get a job, anything really.

I first saw this in 'Two Sides of The Same Coin' by Ten Toes, which, unfortunately is incomplete but Harry basically is given Lily's old things and there's a hidden diary amongst it where he learns about the Leady Cauldron. He spends his time trying to find it and ends up doing so and meeting Draco. It cuts short before he got to Hogwarts but it would have been really cool to see how things would have turned out.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11047995/chapters/24629568#workskin][Amethyst]] is first in a long series where he gets himself adopted by Snape. He works in an apothecary before that as an oddsbody. It morphs into age appropriate slash after a while though, and that's where I dropped it.

  What would happen if the Dursleys abandoned Harry Potter before he could attend school? What kind of problems would a street wise, self-reliant, and Slytherin Harry could create?

  Vernon gets the smarts when accidental magic in response to a bellow breaks the compulsion to be mean to Harry. He is well sore with the magical world which is making a child soldier by grooming Harry, so he decides to turn the weapon back on them by teaching Harry all he needs to survive.
