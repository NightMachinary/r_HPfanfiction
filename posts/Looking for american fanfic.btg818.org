:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, so recently I've been reading some fics about either an american wizard school or an american exchange student to hogwarts. Does anyone know any good stories like that? Complete, with at least 10k words would be ideal. Thanks!


** Basic recommendation here but you can check out the Alexandra Quick series. Totally set in American Wizarding world and very very loosely tied to the HP universe (basically past how the magic works its an original piece). It's a series of fanfic, fairly in depth and long but as of now uncompleted as I think Inverarity writes the whole book at a time.

Eta: there's four books finished out of seven, he posted an update about book five a bit ago

** Several books in this series are complete, but the series itself isn't. Not compliant with the FantasticBeastsverse, but you might prefer the worldbuilding to the FB version. It's darker and more mature than Rowling's style overall, and gets very un-Rowling-esque in places, but it's very good in its own right.

** JJ Rust had an American OC named Jimmy O'Bannon who featured in some of his stories. He and the Weasley Twins are in a great 3000-word one-shot called "A Perilous Pass", which serves as a good introduction to the character. After that, you might like to move on to the 60,000-word "Air of Disharmony".
