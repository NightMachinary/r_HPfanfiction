Most of the time, dropping a fanfic can be rooted to a good reason, e.g. character-bashing, horrible dialogue etc. However, some fanfics are known to improve with time, and sometimes supposed crap was actually a foundation for deconstruction/subversion.

So, which fanfics did you regret dropping, and why?

Bonus question: If a fanfic starts off being purposely "bad", e.g. stunted dialogue is revealed to be because of 'x' later on, would this reasoning be good enough to drop it?

** Well, I don't know if any of the fanfics I dropped got better later on, since I stopped reading them. Don't regret it though, too many interesting fics on my to-read list.

Do you think the two might be related? Joking aside, I've had these moments. I noticed it happens when I only read fanfiction. Have you tried reading other fiction, unrelated to Harry Potter? I read Dune last year and it was great. It really helps to take some time away from it and then come back.

****** Fair enough. I also had a period when I moved away from fiction but it was more out of necessity- I simply didn't have the time. After reading textbooks for uni for several hours the last thing I wanted was to read for fun.

***** I try to oscillate and have had great success! Hitting the end of a series, or the currently published work in a series in progress (in either fanfiction or regular fiction) is a bummer, so I try to jump around as much as possible.

** On your bonus question, yes I'd drop it if I wasn't enjoying reading it because of stunted dialogue. Even if there's a reason for the stunted dialogue, if its a chore to read then it doesn't get read. Just like I'll put a film off part way in if I find the main character annoying, even if they're absolutely within character for the role and its vital to the film. If its annoying, its annoying.

Good example, that god awful cadet in the recent Star Trek netflix. I get she's been written as an accurate portrayal of a certain level of autistic spectrum disorder. But by god, she's super fucking annoying. I stopped watching, and in large part it was down to that character (there were other reasons, but she was a big one).

** Prince of Slytherin, because the James bashing got revealed to have a reason, and it got rewritten a bit. I've since redropped it. I don't regret it.

Most of my reasons for dropping fics was because I couldn't keep track of the plot between each plot. Once finished, I read em. No regrets doing it that way.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]

It's a very cool AU and writing style, but Romione just grosses me out too much for me to continue once that started getting any focus.

Even if you're like me I recommend reading it through at least CoS

** I don't regret dropping any fics but I almost passed over this amazing one! I didn't read it at first but I found it again and tried it. It's one of favorites to this day. I would've regretted my past self if I didn't pick it up.

*** The audiobook is a real lifesaver for this one. First time I dropped it around where the plot just took a vacation and it turned in an essay about heroes/ villains and their roles. And Hermione formed some sort of a group for female heroes. What a snoozefest. I only learned that there is an audiobook later and it was surprisingly good. Mind you, Harry is even more insufferable there because of his high pitched voice, but the other characters were very well done. Especially Mcgonagall and the parseltongue hissing at the end.

** I'm extremely picky with my stories. I'll drop a story for any number of reasons, and I've never regretted it and I've never gone back to finish them and have no intention too. I personally enjoy certain character bashings, Dumbledore, and I can ignore dialogue and other grammatical things. What I can't ignore is what I would consider a bad plot/story. If the story moves in a direction that I don't enjoy I'll immediately stop reading it because at that point I don't care to finish it and I'll move onto something else.

** I'm ashamed to admit that I dropped Prince of the Dark Kingdom after Harry and Luna get together in chapter 100, on account of Natalie is bestgirl. I've been meaning to get back to it for ages, now, but I somehow never have.
