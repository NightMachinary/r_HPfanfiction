Take /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ for example. It's dead, but so many people love it that I'm surprised somebody hasn't taken it upon themselves to continue the story.

I'm wondering if it's seen as an insult or something to write fanfiction about other fanfiction, and if so, why?


** This is called recursive fanfiction, and is generally considered a compliment. However, you may wish to ask the author if you can use their characters/AU/whatever first, since some take a dim view of others using what they made (because irony is hard to understand).

Continuing fanfictions, particularly dead/abandoned ones, is a slightly more difficult topic, but if you ask first, and either get a 'yes' or no reply at all, then there's no real reason not to give it a try.

*** Personally, as an author with a lot of their own original characters and settings as prominent parts of the story, I prefer not to see re-writes because the majority put no thought into the changes they make to those characters and settings. That said, if another author comes along and asks if they can borrow my premise and a couple of my characters, just changing names and they actually show me a well-thought-out draft with evidence of almost as much thought, planning and effort as I out into my work, then yes, I'll be happy to have them write and post it. I simply don't want to be associated with poor writing when I put so much effort into my work and making it good.

***** Irony is really not hard to understand. I get it, and I've understood what you're saying from the outset. BUT, what I'M saying is, I expect someone borrowing my characters and settings to put as much effort, thought and research into their work as I do, or at least close to as much. I'm not so full of myself as to say I'm on par with JK Rowling herself, but I will say that a hell of a lot of effort, research and forethought goes into my work. I've had one of my sweetest, gentlest, most nurturing characters, who is more of a father figure than anything else, turned into a perverted headmaster. I felt, I imagine, somewhat like Ms Rowling would feel about Dumbledore suddenly turning Hogwarts into a brothel. This is why I put a lot of effort into my OCs and I try to keep her characters relatively in character with researched, justifiable and planned alterations to certain facets of their appearance or personality in order to serve my purpose. Basically, I'm just salty about that time someone made my sweet grandpa into a pimp.

** It really depends. For example, there's linkffn(12927826) which is a LdS fanfic. It takes TE7's femVoldemort and pairs her with Harry. TE7 doesn't like it since it takes his concept and turns it into shipping, but at the same time, there's not much else he can do.

Most writers will probably take it as a compliment if you don't butcher their ideas too much. Of course, most authors are gone if their fics are abandoned.

*** It's not just about the shipping. The original was a very subtle and clever piece of writing. This story has Voldemort sticking her tongue down Harry's throat in the first few hundred words.

There's no point in calling it a fanfic of Limpieza de Sangre when the characters and their motivations are so totally different from the original.

*** I don't really dislike it because it's fanfiction of my fanfiction though, as the OP is asking about. My initial reaction was 'he should have asked for permission!' which I instantly countered with, "Well you didn't." so That kinda becomes moot.

*** Hey guys. I made a reddit account so I could hop into this discussion real quick. ^_^ I am the author of the fanfiction in question, La Puissance est le Controle. I would like to point out that my fanfiction is unfortunately not very applicable to this discussion. ^_^ A fanfiction literally takes the universe of another author and changes peices of it. And I do feel like one /SHOULD/ give the author a courtesy heads up that they are using their work.

When I read Limpiza de Sangre, it was a very good read. And I enjoyed it greatly. But it wasn't a romance. Or at least it wasn't a prevalent one. The story inspired me to create my own fiction, and anyone who reads it can tell you that my story is not a fanfiction of LdS. Its a fanfiction of Harry Potter. I had originally given a shout out to TE7 because I loved his work and wanted other's to experience that work for themselves. When some of my readers shared his opinions of my story with me I deleted all references to his story in mine out of respect for those opinions. I understood that he did not desire for his story to be misconstrued to be in the same vein as mine. Which, I think we can safely say they are as far apart from one another as possible. I was happy to remove such references and help him as much as possible to keep the message in his story clear and unfettered. I have recieved a handful of reviews of some people comparing the two together when that was never the intention. Its like taking life and death and fifty shades and comparing them. (If you don't get that reference sorry) They aren't meant to be compared as they are different things entirely.

Once again, shout out to my muse TheEndless7. He rocks.

** Some rare exceptions of authors are incredible hypocrites and take offense, but it's definitely not the norm (and shouldn't be).

Usually it's totally fine. There's lots of fanfics that are basically fanfics of other fanfics, they just don't reference them directly. Things like WBWL fics, aber basically fanfictions of fanfiction.

** I suspect most writers appreciate the courtesy of being asked, partly because fandom does have problems with plagiarism and some people do try to get popular by riding on the coattails of better and more established authors.

But I recently had the pleasure of being asked, and IMO it's incredibly flattering. I enjoyed the results, which were at somewhat of a slant from my personal version, but that simply means I would have written it differently. And that's the point! It /should/ be a new take, 'inspired by' rather than 'imitating the original in all particulars.' It's also led to a warm and congenial acquaintance with someone who I hope goes on to write plenty more in the fandom.

Also, I don't know how universal this is, but it's fascinating to see people react excitedly to something that I wrote precisely in the hope of eliciting said excitement. A tribute fic (which fanfic essentially is, except when it's a deconstruction) is the most eloquent sort of engagement. It's a lens onto how this person felt about my story and how it influenced their own vision of the characters. I love seeing what my work looks like to someone else. (Someone genuinely interested, not the "this is shit" contingent or the "ew, you wrote slash" brigade.) It's often not what I expected, or it catches something I was only vaguely aware of, or one aspect looms larger than all the rest of the fic put together. And that's very cool.

The original story is The Bespoke Witch, by Glitterally. It's no longer available to read on ff.net, but she has her own little site it and all of her works are on, just find it by googling The Bespoke Witch. It's a different take on a 'arranged' (a 'war stake') marriage between Draco/Hermione/Lucius.

And the fanfic of it is called Casting the Stake, by LJ Summers. Linkffn(Casting the Stake by LJ Summers). It's the same base principle of a war stake, but an 'if Hermione married the Weasley boys' instead of the Malfoys (Hermione/Fred/George/Bill/Charlie)

Note: no incest in either of these, in case anyone is wondering :)
