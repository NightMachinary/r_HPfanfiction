Could anyone please recommend a good fanfic with a harry similar to the one from hp and bwl?, essentially I'm asking for:

- competent harry.( doesn't have to be harry, I'm open to OC as well)

- strong/ powerful ( doesn't have to start out that way but can or will get there eventually)

- doesn't rely on his friends or Dumbledore as much ( essentially he's jaded enough not to put up with people's bullsh*t , especially Ron's jealousy streaks)

- honeslty don't need a romance but if one is there preferably not ginny or hermoine or fleur.( best if it's OC).

- No harems or slash please. Thanks a lot.


** linkffn(Black Luminary by YakAge) is what I'm going to give you. And yes I'm reccing it again, as it deserves all the love I can give it. Harry is certainly competent, his DADA professor allowed him to skip all normal classes and personally sparred with him. The result of one of his duels caused countless deaths and the destruction of London.He views friends as tools, his interactions with Hermione in 1st year assure us of this. No decided pairing, although if there is it will likely be either Aenor Rose (OC) or Daphne.

This fic is very AU, Voldemort does not exist (thus far) in this fic. After Grindelwald fell the Pillars, a group of light pureblood families took over the political scene. Harry is a Black, and the Blacks have falled from grace, but retain much of their power. The most promising currently updating AU in the fandom, the lethifold arc was nothing short of incredible.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

**** I just gave this a try....Daphne in this story is truly a Trainwreck. Why is she groping him (they are cousins) and laughing (for no reason) and screaming at people (for no reason) and sobbing (for no reason) all in one sitting?? She does all of these things during one meal, cycles through a few of each, actually.

At the risk of sounding harsh, there's no way I'll be able to continue if she doesn't get killed off--like before the second chapter she is in ends. The characterization of Daphne is REALLY at odds with how interesting and reasonable every other character was. How upsetting.

***** I think my main distaste is his near crippling fear of the fairer sex..sure as a young sheltered teen it's quite understandable if he's not not exactly some ladies man or whatever but this phobia of his is a liitle disturbing and daphne personality doesn't really help matters. I'll still continue to read till I'm done as it's quite well written and the author has obviously put a lot of thought into this story, but my hype is slowly whittling away.

****** The worst part for me is that it's only 'okay' because she is a girl. If a male character did that we'd all be very concerned that Harry was about to be raped or something and it would be pretty dark (and still make no sense). Since she's a girl her emotions apparently are just that way and her predatory behavior is played for laughs. So not cool.

******* And it's not only her, even the dark arts teacher seems to enjoy malicious teasing and as usual harry clams up like a dense anime protagonist, it's like half the girl's he runs into are some sort of sexual predators more disturbing is the fact that some are technically family.

******** Well the DADA teacher isa sick sadist. In generall i mean she is a sick fuck.

Teens in generall are horrible people who enjoy the missery of others. People seem to forget that bullying is acutally rather common

** My favorite WIP [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin series]] it has its flaws but it has also one thing I like about my ffs: fast pacing. Now days i just cant stand slow pacing witch is one of most common problems in fanfics.

*** The story is finally coming into it's own. The first three in my opinion were weak in how closely they followed Canon. For me it was like what was the point? Sure you get to see Harry becoming something awesome, but it's really only a glimpse or two. Those first three years also felt really similar to Prince of Slytherin, just half as long and half as good.

Second year made no sense at all. Harry and his friends figure a lot of things out in February and then nothing until near the end of the school year just like in Canon? Infuriating.

Not really a fan of Dumbledore or James in this story either. The author wants those characters to be seen as evil and wrong but it's done so poorly that it's hard to take the author seriously.

Regardless of the faults I still find it pretty interesting and it helps that the author updates consistently. There have been lots of hints about things not really being what they seem and of course I want to see how powerful Harry gets.
