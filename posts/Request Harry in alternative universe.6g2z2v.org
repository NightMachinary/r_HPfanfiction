Hi, so I've run out of fics to read and I have a lot of free time this week, maybe you could help me find something to read. I would like a fic with Harry traveling/being summoned to a different universe. Those kind of fics are my guilty pleasure but sadly a lot of them are abandoned.

So I'm looking for a fic in which Harry finds himself in a parallel world, preferably a world where his family/Sirius/Remus/Dumbledore or all of them are alive and he helps them with the war with Voldemort or another villain. I don't mind WIPs if they're regularly updated and not abandoned.

I already read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4144226/1/Dimension-Father]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5502136/1/The-Mirror-of-possibilities]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10621216/1/A-Place-Past-Loss]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9649140/1/To-Call-A-Place-Home]]),

I also read/tried to read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5757945/1/Too-Far-from-Home]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9308763/1/Harry-From-Another-World]]) but didn't quite like it.

Please, no slash, multi and God-like Harry.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land]] is excellent, although sequel is not complete and not as good either way. Features one of the best Voldemorts I've read and a unique concept.

*** Let me start out by saying this fic was one of my absolute favorites when I first read it from 2004-2007, but it has not aged well at all. The writing isn't very good, and Harry's characterization is extremely annoying.

It's almost impossible to get passed the first several chapters where Harry approaches every single person in the entire wizarding world and it completely astonished that none of them recognize him as the person he is. Even after he's encountered 50 people that don't recognize him, he still is like, "Ron, Hermione, Ginny, it's me!" He's so goddamn stupid it's ridiculous.

I agree that Voldemort is pretty well done here, and overall, I still like the fic despite it's faults.

Sorry if I'm being pedantic, but I also see this mistake often in fics. Otherwise, I agree with you :)

***** Indeed, it's in the same category as "could of done something" (or any other constructions where the writer replaces have or had with of, which of course makes no sense at all in most cases (you notice that it doesn't make any sense if you try to translate it into another language IMHO if you don't see it otherwise))...or any of those false friend things like:

- bear and bare :D (which make even less sense if you switch them around!)

ps: Sometimes it's really great not to be a native speaker because if you translate your own crap and if said crap makes no sense then you know that you screwed up, big time!

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

** Dunuelos has a long series where Harry goes to alternate universes to fix things, ala "Quantum Leap". He's pretty damn powerful and in the latest part [[/spoiler][Harry does become a literal god]] but it's an interesting ride. There are many, many, crossovers with this as Harry doesn't just stay in the HP universe. He visits Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The West Wing, Joan of Arcadia, NCIS, and maybe some more I can't think of at the moment.
