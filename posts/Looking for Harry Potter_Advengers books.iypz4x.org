Eather Harry is adopted by the Advengers or he is the family of one of the Advengers.


** Linkffn(I See The Moon By hctiB-notsoB) is imcomplete and long abandoned but what we do have is excellent. Harry and Bruce travel together after the events of the lamentable stand alone Hulk film and it cuts off a little after Loki is brought to the Helicarrier in Avengers.

  Magic and technology. Polar opposites for some, and yet for one boy living on the streets ... maybe they can be something more. Follow Harry as he is taken in by the famous Tony Stark and starts to combine his own unique powers with technology in ways that make him more than just a wizard, or a thief, or a prodigy, but instead make him ... an Avenger. Harry/multi.

** Quality varies, and some of these are the first story in a series. Loki and Black Panther as family are included, and some are abandoned - A Happy Accident, for example, is included because it's referenced as inspiration for another (complete) story. I have a cleaned up/chronological version of Faultlines if you're interested in that as well.

  Crazy idea. What if Harry was Tony's dad?Not in a million years would Harry thought that by letting Anthony be held for a moment by a woman whom just lost her baby, would let the press go wild. In under an hour, the whole city knew about his baby. And under a couple of hours so did the whole United States of America. And soon the whole world would know. The worst thing was that they thought Anthony was the Stark heir.This work is a slow burn. So basically it will cover Tony as a baby, kid, teen, young man 'till adult. And mostly i used Howard, Harry, and Tony's POVPs. This work is 70% marvel and 30% Harpot world. And neither marvel or harpot charactrs are mine, but most of the story ideas are mine. So hope u enjoy reading itCOMPLETED

  It all started with a blond strand of hair. From there, all Harry Potter has known about his life begins to unravel as he finds out the truth about his past and who he is, unearthing secrets that he didn't believe possible and finding family he didn't know existed. But maybe these changes could be a new beginning, a blessing in disguise, if he looks at it the right way.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours).

But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
