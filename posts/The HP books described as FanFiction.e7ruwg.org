Essentially what the title says, imagine that in the back of the Harry Potter books the description is like a FanFiction one. How would you do it?

*** Ha! "Canon compliant" is exactly what I was hoping to see when I saw the prompt. The "mild rehash" really killed it though.

** Eventually HP/GW & RW/HG though romance is not main focus, and they date other characters before then.
