I.e. Princess of the Blacks where the main character is no hesitant to kill or torture or where one of the main characters is sadistic with reason.

Preferably w/o male slash (I don't mind femslash) and with over 85,000 words (that's completed). Harry-centric


** there is a very dark fic in general, but not dark harry that you might want to read, very disturbing, linkffn(4269983)

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

*** I like that one too.

I think this scenario would actually be more likely after the 2nd War.

**** I want one story that has winners of the 2nd War exacting terrible retributions against Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers. I mean they had every right to be angry, and I don't think people who had suffered so much were really keen in that overused 'we are better than them' moral superiority play.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  I was in a violent mood . . so I wrote this fic, where Harry is EVIL! And, of course, as Snape is another of my favorite people, he's playing the good guy and trying to get Harry back to normal.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
