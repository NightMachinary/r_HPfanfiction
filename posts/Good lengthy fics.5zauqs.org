I'm looking for one or several semi-decent or better fics that span atleast 200k words per book, preferably completed.

Anything goes except for crackfics.

Thanks!

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]: Has two completed sequels and a prequel series ([[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]).

#+begin_quote
  A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]]: Companion novel of sorts to HBP.

#+begin_quote
  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305303][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]]: I thought the plot was a little too predictable, but otherwise good.

#+begin_quote
  Many years after the Battle of Hogwarts, follow Harry, Ron and Hermione as they lead four generations of the Potter and Weasley family in an action-packed battle for survival against a shadowy puppet master who threatens to destroy the world that they worked so hard to build.

#+begin_quote
  Milo, a genre-savvy D&D Wizard and Adventurer Extraordinaire is forced to attend Hogwarts, and soon finds himself plunged into a new adventure of magic, mad old Wizards, metagaming, misunderstandings, and munchkinry. Updates Fridays.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]]: Well written and interesting AU.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

**** I don't think it's clear yet. But it's actually a really well written fic. Harry and Tonks seem to have something going on. But that just might be Tonks teasing. Harry and Hermione might be possible too.

***** Gotcha, thanks! I'll look into this fic :)

And yeah I've read several fics where Tonks is a bit of a flirt with Harry, even if neither of them are super serious; I think it's a semi-common portrayal of Tonks. I don't mind, typically they're pretty well-written!

**** There's no singular ship. The overarching pairing is with Tonks, but they rarely meet 'cause he's still in school and she's busy with the war. Aside from her, he's flitatious with a few people and has a clearly deepening relationship with quite a few others (Hermione, Tracy). He's also got a motherly relationship with somebody other than Molly, which I absolutely adore and fervently wish other fics had more of.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** The Rune Stone Path is probably the only well-depicted polyamorous relationship I have read so far. Although it is Harry/Hermione/Fleur/Daphne with Daphne/Luna/Tracy is the background it is a superbly written story with a well-designed concept (Harry uses runes for everything and invents his own tools that way) and good characters.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
