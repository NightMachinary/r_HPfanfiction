Hermione died in hospital, after using some fancy Magic, and leaves Harry with a child. Harry ends up with like Susan or someone, is a lot smarter, and I think it's Evil Dumbledore of some kind and the kid is kidnapped at some point (Greater Good Dumbledore is Evil Dumbledore, as we never see "Fiendfyre" Dumbledore decided to burn down Azkaban with all of Voldemort's loyal followers inside. It was for the Greater Good. We see Evil Dumbledore who tries to justify himself)
