I love Sirius and I even love Regulus from what writers have done with them. But one thing that bothers me is that writers tend to write Sirius as a womanizer who takes nothing well pardon the unintentional pun, seriously.

But in canon he was again pardon the pun pretty serious guy. How do you view Sirius and Regulus? And maybe the other Blacks as well?

I know that people's personalities can change in Azkaban, I just don't see Sirius being the womanizing kid that does nothing productive and then turning into what he does in canon, that's just a really big leap for me.

Of course he likely doesn't take things as seriously as he should when he was a kid, just not as much as so many authors write him.

Thoughts? How do you view him? Regulus, and other Black family members?


** I always think of Sirius as the smarter of the two. I think Sirius always found something wrong with the rhetoric he was confronted with, but couldn't put a finger on it until he came in contact with muggleborns and halfbloods. He was a boy who constantly asked "why". Why do we hate muggles? Why does out blood make us better? Why do we have to be Slytherins? And so on and so forth. Combined with a lack of respect for authority and you got a free thinking little wizard there who makes his own path - if only out of spite to the people who never gave him satisfactory answers to the "Whys" he asked.

In Hogwarts he meets James, Remus and Peter who further solidify a path apart from his family's ideologies. I think that in the first few years he still hopes to find some acceptance among the Blacks, however at this point I also think he was already the traitor in his mother's eyes and his general disobedience made the rest of the family look at Regulus with hope. In the end, they pushed him away by not moving an inch. Unstoppable force, meet unbreakable wall.

In school I imagine Sirius to be good in the things he has interest in and just good enough in those he hasn't. As i said, I think he's an intelligent man (crippled by Dementors and depression in the books) and was an intelligent boy. His knowledge gain was probably very project-oriented. If they had a need for a spell for some prank or joke, it would be Remus figuring out /which/ spell and Sirius mastering it pretty quickly. I see him a lot like his godson in this regard. Like Harry I feel like Sirius would be the type who has a grasp for magic that is more gut-based than Hermione's or Remus' knowledge based approach.

I don't think he was a womanizer in the sense of "every week a new girl". However, I do think that Sirius was extremely love-depraved. At the point of his budding interest in women, he was already well and good on his way out of the Black family. Summers were hell, and feelings were only negative between him and the people who /should/ show him love and affection. In general that leads towards either an isolationist behavior, or seeing that Sirius is a rather open guy, a superficially flirtatious behavior, mixed with serious trust issues. Sirius seems like the guy who couldn't let the girls in and would break it up once the getting-to-know-you part of the relationship was done, and deeper feelings were sought. He then just went to the next one and repeat the cycle. Sirius just never met his Hermione or (post-battle) Ginny - relentless women with patience and perseverance. For that reason I'm also fond of the thought that Sirius was jealous of James when he came together with Lily. By far not enough to end a friendship, but enough for the "thoughts you aren't supposed to think" scenarios when Sirius was alone in bed and pondering (I remember a fic where only James died by Voldemort's hand and Sirius and Lily ended up together afterwards. Anyone know what fic I'm talking about?).

This was, of course, a lot of just projecting and building things on meager sources. Its all just fanon, but I think it's somewhat reasonable. In turn, for Regulus we know even less.

I think Regulus was overall not quite as intelligent and skeptic as Sirius, but the more gentle and kind of the two. He had a good relationship with a creature he was not supposed to have any sort of relationship with beyond being it's master. Kreacher. He was also trying to do right in the end, for whatever motivations, we don't know.

I do believe that Regulus soaked up the family's ideology like a sponge, and even more so after Sirius was faced with the consequences of disappointing expectations. I would believe that being at home after Sirius got sorted into Gryffindor was a hellish experience for the boy. At that point /every single bit of expectations/ rested on his shoulders. From then on out it was a relatively clear cut path. He got into Slytherin, was fed the propaganda and swallowed it whole with seconds. Because, truly, it only had advantages for him. Slytherin accepted him readily. He had like-minded friends. His family was proud. However, I do also think that Regulus was convinced that what they did was just; a righteous fight. In the end he became savvy of the depravity of Voldemort and ended up a traitor to the Dark Lord.

** Firstly, I want to say that I see the Blacks as being very inbred and more than a wee bit mad. They're very attractive people, it seems (Bellatrix and Dromeda are beautiful but dark, Narcissa is beautiful, Sirius is very handsome), but there seems to be a running insanity among them that is probably passed down a lot, on top of a troubling home environment for each branch of the tree, as it were.

*Walburga Black.*

- Probably genuinely mad. She definitely got less rational as she got on in age, and her anger isn't just passion for an ideology - it seems to be much more than that, and much more aggressive. I think Walburga certainly loved her children, but whatever mental illness she strugged with (which I would guess? involved periods of rage and depression, but that's different person by person) masked that hugely.
- Definitely believed in Pureblood ideology, and likely saw Muggles and interbreeding as a very big threat. Believed in /heritage/ and the crucial importance of it, and was massively obsessed with the future. She was probably second-guessing every second as "how will Sirius and Regulus' children see this?" even as Sirius and Regulus were still babes in arms, and that probably explains her hyperfixation on disowning people from the family tree.
- I would headcanon as not a hugely talented witch herself. She's just too focused on other stuff to seem like she had a lot of talent in alternate areas.
- I'm not gonna make another section about Orion because I don't really care about him, but basically, I think he was probably very self-isolating and quiet in comparison to his wife, but I don't think he disagreed with a lot of her actions, and was pretty glad to let her take the lead.

*Sirius Black:*

- Biting wit. Sarcastic, sharp, and genuinely capable of cruelty. He grew up around harsh people with harsh words, and he definitely doesn't really know how to temper his words while teasing, or when to stop when he's getting rough with another student.
- Well-dressed, and charming. Despite not knowing when to stop, Sirius is magnetic, funny, and great at parties, despite having a slight tendency to cruelty - he's honorable, and he's noble.
- Probably picked on Remus & Peter in turns when bored - more so Peter, but I don't think Remus was completely free of it. I definitely see the Marauders, and especially James, acting as some part of his impulse control.
- Grew to truly despise his family's ideology, but views family as paramount. He loved his brother and his cousins, until 3 out of 4 were out of reach. He loved his Uncle. He loved James, and the Potters.
- A hugely talented wizard. Excelled at school, a terrifying duellist, and undoubtedly not somebody you'd want to face in a fight.
- Definitely had some of his mother's madness in him. I don't think Sirius was a completely rational boy of sound mind, and I think as he grew up some moments of rage and depression probably cropped up as he was a teenager.

*Regulus Black:*

- Desperate to impress his parents. He was the "spare", not the "heir", remember: he had to work harder to be seen as equal to Sirius.
- Probably threw himself into the Pureblood ideology to try to impress his parents and be the "good" son.
- Likely wanted Sirius' approval too, being several years younger; he was likely very jealous of James, and the whole thing was probably brought to a sudden stop when his mother disowned Sirius.
- Wasn't as good a wizard as Sirius. A decent wizard, sure, and probably studied extremely hard (with huge intellect), but likely became frustrated that he wasn't on Sirius' level; this explains a fascination with the Dark Arts, which seem easier to approach to get huge power earlier.
- Joining Voldemort was an ideological next step. He probably regretted it soon after - perhaps he became disillusioned with his mother's irrationality and cruelty, perhaps he hated how easily Voldemort killed and tortured. I don't think he necessarily stopped believing in the ideology, just in Voldemort.
- Thought the suicide was worth it. His family was on the way out: he had nothing left to live for.

Might add more thoughts about the Black sisters, Cygnus and Druella on their side, as well as re: Alphard, but I'm not sure.

** It isn't too much of a leap from careless boy to somber adult when you remember that Hogwarts Sirius, although having to deal with his horrid family for over a decade, had yet to know the trauma of war. Unlike the Sirius we meet in the books, who had also suffered the loss of his best friend and wrongful imprisonment for 12 years. Those events would change anyone.

** Funnily enough, having delved back into the fandom recently and started writing again, this is what came up. What came of it was me (and my usual writing partner) ending up doing one-shots on various family members to try and sort them out and having a lot of fun doing it.

Sirius to me is the livewire; especially pre-azkaban, he's like a charged spring that looks completely still but isn't. I think he also reacts very quickly to things without thinking about why he's doing them, is a pretty manipulative person (though I'm not sure he knows he's doing it), an unreliable narrator, fiercely heartful and does not want to be the last person left giving a damn. I think he and Regulus have a lot of similarities but end up expressing themselves in different ways. I also think a lot of it comes down to how you view the family, and how they were raised.
