  â€˜That's right ... well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh. You know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!'

Does anyone know a fic where that scene is shown in detail? Someone from the Ministry browsing Fred & George's shop, mentally going over combat applications for everything they sell, before making the 500 hat order and watching the Weasleys' jaws drop, perhaps?


** It would be interesting if it was Mad-Eye, or at least someone trained by him, as they would constantly be looking at things through a paranoid mindset.

** Charmed clothing and other objects really need to be explored in stories a lot more! :) Especially when it comes to yes combat. Maybe someone can have a coat that splits up into a bunch of purple flaming tendrils that can burn through steel or something? What about a pair of gloves that give you super strength? What about boots that let you run and jump faster and higher than ever?
