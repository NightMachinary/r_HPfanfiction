I am feeling down today. Want to read some feel good romantic fics with Harry as the lead and no slash. I am not sure if there is already a post or repository, so went ahead with this.

Please recommend some feel good romance fics, preferably long, centred around Harry.

TIA

  "Isn't, you know, your entire magical identity kind of a lot to 'just not bring up' to somebody?" Harry shrugged. "I was kind of surprised but it wasn't as important as you'd think it would be." A story in which Harry meets a muggle and is wrong. OC/Harry. Also, a trio friendship fic.

** This one is pretty good. Only problem is that it's unfinished and ends on a sad note. Pretty heavy but a good read.

  A little girl of mysterious origins will become the driving force that will change the very nature of Harry and Hermione's relationship with each other. Moves from canon, disregards epilogue.

** How much lemon do you expect? “To Walk A Mile In someone else's Shoes” by IamMegumi linkffn(7452425) seems like a reasonable middle-road. It still has some story.

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.
