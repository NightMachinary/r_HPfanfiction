  Bellatrix Lestrange uses dark, sacrificial magic to bring the Dark Lord back to life after Harry Potter has given his life to defeat him. However, asking for a "Dark Lord" turns out to be a tad bit too ambiguous. Baba Yaga is having fun, Godelot is a sadistic bastard, Herpo the Foul brags about his horcrux, Tom Riddle is unimpressed. (Dark)

** I would love this. A Dark Lord of Ancient Times comes to the present.

Turns out he was considered a Dark Lord because he advocated for equal rights. So he immediately begins a campaign for equality.
