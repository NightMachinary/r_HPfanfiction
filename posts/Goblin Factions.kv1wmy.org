Not only are the Gringotts and the "Goblin Nation" entirely seperate entities, they are actually at odds with one another. But the ignorance and disinterest of the Ministry (and careful fact manipulation of the humans that do work closer to them) means wizards and witches don't actually know this.

Of course, at one point, this wasn't the case. Historically, Gringotts has been both the bridge and public face of the Goblin species, representing their underground dwelling kin as shrewd, no nonsense men and women of business.

But under wraps, that very image is not one the Goblins wish to portray, and the peace between them and the rest of the magical world is one of great reluctance. Peace Gringotts maintains in secret, not by convincing their brethren not to go to war, but by highlighting flaws in plans and suggesting that it should be postponed, giving the Gringotts goblins a reputation of spinelessness.

Decades ago, the two fractured and became entirely seperate communities. Those somewhat content with the status quo and/or seeking proper equality with the wizards (such as through the right to use wands) remaining in territories the banks control.

Those who seek dominion and supremacy, a sizeable chunk of the species, vanishing into the dark with their own plans and designs. Roughly half of the goblin nation seceding from Gringotts with intentions to return to the war and bloodshed their ancestors sought.

And no one knows when or where they will strike...
