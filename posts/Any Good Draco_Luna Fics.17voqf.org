Are there any outstanding Draco/Luna fics you good folks could recommend to me? Pretty please? Looking for IC Luna, hopefully not OOC Mary Sue Luna.


** A D/L one-shot and one of my favorites all around: [[http://samhain-smut.livejournal.com/25948.html][Hold Me in a Perfect Square of Sky]]

** If you've got a lot of time on your hands, Bobmin's Sunrise/Sunset over Britain are phenomenal and Draco/Luna, while not the main point of the story, plays a prominent role. One of the best overall plotlines I've ever come across in HP fanfic.
