Hey, looking for some stories where Harry has a twin sister (or just regular sister). I really like "Two is Better than One" by kevin1984, so if there are any good stories that you guys know (preferably long, but doesn't matter unless it's abandoned) that are like that, if you could comment/link them below that would be awesome.

Preferably Harry and his sister would have a relationship, if there are other characters in that relationship, that's fine.

  What if Harry had a twin sister, someone who grew up with him as they ventured through life together, instead of him facing the world by himself. And Malfoy has a sister as well, which makes life even more chaotic. Sequel to Battle of Wills, with AU elements. Story begins with Harry's 4th year. Harry/OC/OC/Fleur. Warning: wincest, BDSM, harem.
