5 year old Harry Potter constantly jumps out scaring people with "Constant Vigilance!"

Dumbledore gives Harry the Invisibility Cloak right before Harry goes to Hogwarts.

Thanks to knowing people like Fred, George and even Nymphadora (Call me Dora!) he's able to prank and not get caught.

Kingsley teaches Harry and Ron the words and wand movements of plenty of different spells. (He doesn't use magic before Hogwarts though, he just knows how to do them).

etc.

Not looking for a super OP INDY Harry Potter, as those tend to get overdone. But a more diverse learned Harry Potter, who has different information and skills thanks to different people.

Because Ron is friends with Harry before Hogwarts, he sticks with Harry and understands him better, he follows him with whatever lessons an Order Member wants to give them.


** Turns out that that night when Rosmerta found Harry trying to get Dumbledore back to his feet on the Main Street of Hogsmeade, they were not coming from the Inferi cave. They were coming from the Hog's Head.

*** That would imply Albus and Aberforth are on good terms. Maybe taking care of Harry as a baby brought them back together as brothers.

**** They are. Dumbledore (Albus) says that it pays to be friendly with the local bartenders implying Aberforth. Just because they had one quarrel in the past doesn't mean they didn't come to better feelings. I mean Aberforth is an Order member.

*** I personally love the idea that while moody is a rather serious person

he actually promotes the proud tradition of Gryfindor pranksters because a skilled prankster requires Constant Vigilance to not get caught

** I love the “it takes a village” idea of him growing up with the Order, but logistically a number of the people who were in the Order the second time weren't in it the first time - in particular, the Weasleys only joined the second time and the Tonkses weren't really part of it all until the end besides Tonks herself joining the second time.

** Wait, but in that case it'd have to be the first Order that you're mentioning. In this case, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Shacklebolt and Tonks weren't a part of it. The only one it might slide is the Weasleys, given Molly's brothers were in the Order and she might have known of it. But there isn't any mention of Shacklebolt and Tonks was a kid herself back then.

****** I think the only people from the original Order were the ones in the picture Moody showed Harry. Still, an older Tonks (at least older enough to be in the Order) would imply altering her parents' age too. But then again, it's fanfiction, you can change whatever you want. I just pointed out because I thought OP's idea was canon Order raising Harry, except they mixed the first and second wars Orders.

Actually, now that I think about it, there are other implications in having Tonks' family as a part of the Order in the first war. Say her parents were members, so the other members would probably have met her as a child, including Remus. That's creepy.

** They become best friends with Hermione when she reluctantly helps Ron and Harry prank Lavender and Parvati.

In the first year, Lavender and Parvati had an annoying habit of giggling when Harry was around. This annoyed Harry, Ron (obviously) and Hermione, since she shared a dorm with them. The prank works and L&P are no longer HP crazy...

They do the same thing to Ginny in the second year, at the burrow.
