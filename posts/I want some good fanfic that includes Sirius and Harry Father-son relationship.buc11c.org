I really crave for these fanfictions because I really love them taking care of each other, especially when Sirius comforts Harty, vise versa. I have read plenty and only a small portion of them are good ones, it doesn't matter where it is from, just give me some please.


** My favourite in this genre has always been linkffn(4062601) The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox. That book has Sirius taking Harry from the Dursleys then the pair travel around the world meeting new friends and learning new magic.

Books two is unfortunately pretty much a powerful!Harry at Hogwarts story and Book three isn't that great, but the first one stands alone and I always enjoy it.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

** The Danger series by Whydoyouneedtoknow on fanfaction.com has a good father/son relationship. The first two books are the best of the series in my opinion. linkffn(living with danger by whydoyouneedtoknow) linkffn(living without danger by whydoyouneedtoknow)

** Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is good, although the sequels are a bit too close to canon. Featuring Sirius trying his best to be a father figure for 8 year old Harry while being a hunted criminal. Featuring Tonks as auror trainee, Remus trying to draw werewolves away from Greyback and Kreacher being somewhat helpful.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Hogwarts Rumble kind of fits that bill, but it's more of a side thing that doesn't kick in until Harry's third year. The story is also a romcom, predominantly.

Typical time travel (Remus is the traveler) canon divergence (after POA) fix-it. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not until halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; features adults who don't leave it to teenagers to save the world. OK?
