Personally the reviews page is the second thing after the summary I check. I noticed that in general the average quality of reviews correlates with the story quality.

If all or almost all reviews are just one sentence praises of the author, then the story also doesn't contain anything noteworthy. It can't attract a reader who cares enough to leave a significant review for others.

If there're reviews with critique, I'm giving them more attention. If the critique is subjective (expresses the reviewer's preferences), but it's still good, it's a big plus for the story. It means that the story is good enough to attract a reader with self respect to leave a meaningful review and it doesn't contain big flaws.

If the critique is objective and points to plot holes, inconsistencies and other flaws, it means that the story really has them and I'll be disappointed with them too. If such reviews are repeated through several chapters, it shows that the author lives in the world of his/her story and doesn't really care about anything else.

What are reviews for you?


** I do not review as often as I should :( a lot of my reading is done through the ffn mobile app, often offline, while either travelling or winding down to sleep (I don't like to get notifications when I'm about to go to bed). Also, a mental holdover from my school days is that reviews are written at the end of a story, and a lot of the things I read are unfinished. Consequently, for me to write a review it usually has to either be:

- so good that it makes me pause before starting something new, so I can write between stories.
- leave lingering thoughts or something incredibly memorable that I wish to comment on
- something that makes me want to send a message of support to the author (usually either arguing against unwarranted negative reviews, constructive criticism and encouragement, etc)
- good luck and timing. Sometimes I just feel like it, and have a keyboard available, and have time.

I very rarely leave negative reviews... I suspect I've only written one or two ever. The one I remember vividly was for a story which was fun crack with some cool ideas I hadn't seen before, but no particularly special writing... until about 5 chapters from the end, when it suddenly introduced blatant Islamophobic commentary jarringly into the story. I was displeased.

**** I don't leave 100% negative reviews... okay I did leave one on Harry Crow. If a story is so bad that I can't find anything to say about it, I generally stop reading early enough that there's no point saying why.

On the other hand, I think it's helpful to point out things that I don't think worked as well as the things that did. As long as criticism is done politely and constructively it can be useful. If it's just "I hate Hermione", which was the full text of one review I saw recently, then there's not much point to it.

I agree with this. A good review should contain some positive things to encourage the author to continue writing.

But sometimes it's becoming harder and harder to do it, when in each new chapter the writing style is the same as in previous, but the plot itself brings more and more holes and inconsistencies.

In such cases I usually stop repeating the same positive things and it leaves just negative feedback about newly introduced things :-(

Is it a correct statement if an author didn't mentioned it in the story summary?

By default I assume that every publishing (even just in Internet) author wants reviews both positive and negative.

If an author has issues with negative reviews, he or she isn't worthy to read, because he/she doesn't care about his readers. The only important thing for such author is himself/herself.

This is a thing I assume as well. If you're posting to an archive that has an embedded function for leaving feedback, then I'm going to think you're open to feedback. If you want to just write for yourself, that's what places like Tumblr are for where you can control the feedback options.

I think people write for a lot of different reasons. If we were talking about original fiction I would agree with you. I personally don't mind constructive criticism but I'm not every author.

Some people are writing for fun. Other people write because they might be going through something. They may care about growing as a writer they may not. I wouldn't say that someone isn't worth reading or doesn't care about their readers because they're not open to negative or constructive criticism.

Make your own website or shit. But don't complain when you stumble over people discussing your works elsewhere. You wanted people to read it, deal with them having an opinion on it.

But usually it comes down to writers wanting as many people as possible to read their crap, and for that it needs to be in a popular, heavily frequented place. Which usually contains some form of user interaction.

** I rarely pay attention to the reviews as a reader. The exceptions actually apply to ongoing stories rather that completed stories that I want to gauge the quality of. Either there's a very big reveal or cliffhanger in an ongoing story, and I want to see other people's reactions; or I feel like the story is going off the rails, and I want to see if other people feel the same way before offering constructive criticism of my own.

As an author, definitely, at least if there's anything substantive. If the review just say "More please", that's really annoying. Even if it's just "Great!" that's almost as annoying. But there have been several occasions when reviewers caught me going off the rails, and I was able to go back and fix it early.

Eh, sometimes that's a good thing. At least it tells me that the author is attempting to have an actual plot. Even hugely popular and cultural influential stories have plot-holes (this is the subreddit for Harry Potter fanfiction, so I won't have to go into the HP plot-holes). If someone cares enough about a story to think it through and point out plot-holes they are already quite invested and that's a good thing. In stories that I don't like I don't get far enough to even care about plot-holes... in the tier-list of shitness plot-holes are much lower than bad grammar or other types of "bad writing". But maybe I'm just projecting and other people don't have the same priorities.

You already said a lot about reading reviews... I like /writing/ reviews. Sometimes it might come across as harsh, but I have always enjoyed critiquing stuff and sometimes it results in a good dialogue with the author.

When several people wonder "WTF?" about the plot and/or heroes actions and their questions aren't addressed in the next chapters, it shows that the author doesn't even attempt to do a reality check. He or she is too fixated on the story to admit its flaws.

Sometimes the absence of common sense can be forgiven to some degree. But often authors totally reject it for the sake of the plot. Like introduction of non magical weapons -- such thing immediately kills HP world, because even Voldemort couldn't do anything against a headshot from something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobaev_Sniper_Rifle]]

**** *Lobaev Sniper Rifle*

The Lobaev sniper rifle is a rifle line of custom-built bolt-action sniper rifles manufactured at the now defunct small, private company named "Tsar-Cannon Ltd" (ООО Царь-Пушка), which produced benchrest equipment and long-range, sniper and mountain hunting rifles in Tarusa, Russia. The Lobaev rifles are based on a single-shot bolt-action designed for benchrest shooting by Vladislav Lobaev. The chambering, barrel, stock, ammunition feeding method and other rifle characteristics are determined by the clients' preferences. With an accuracy of 0.3-0.2 MOA, the Lobaev SVL is claimed as the most accurate sniper rifle in the world.

** As an author, I generally enjoy most reviews even if they aren't much beyond 'Nice update'. It is a bit irritating to see 'update pls' three times, but well, it boosts my review count, so I'm not mad about it. Of course, it's always lovely when readers care to leave more than one sentence reviews about what they liked about the story, or leave a review about how a certain scene or chapter made them laugh, etc. The reviews that actually hold substance always make my day.

As a reader, I rarely check reviews unless I want to see if an opinion I have is shared by others. I always fear spoilers when I check reviews. I don't really leave much reviews either; when I do, I've usually either followed the author/story for a while and thus, am actually invested in it, or the story was so good I just had to.

** As an author, not really. Very few people have anything useful to say. I'm grateful when someone points out grammar mistakes, but less grateful when someone suggests the story should be Harry/Draco for literally no reason at all. And the ones just going "thanks" are pretty much just spam. Occasionally I get people PMing me to talk about the story, but without wanting to share 30k words of notes, it makes discussing it hard at times without it just being straight up spoilers of the next chapter.

As a reader, I've tried my best to give useful, constructed reviews, but I've learned that it really doesn't matter. If an author really wants to write in his super magical trunk made of 7 different exotic woods and containing 49 different rooms, nothing I say will change that. Most authors are content with meaningless reviews as long as it raises their review count. Though, I will say, the authors who get super defensive about their shitty stories are more entertaining than the stories themselves.

Sometimes I'm not objective and it can come out worse than it sounds. For example, I was reading a HP and SW crossover where Harry basically figured out a way for immortality by taking different cloned bodies of himself. This guy is almost 90 years old mentally and has both Jedi and Sith training. When he gets back to earth the author uses Snape as an excuse for his poor potions marks. We've just read almost 18 chapters of describing Harry's character being able to focus on stuff that'll make him more powerful or knowledgeable, without giving up because "bad teacher". The author DM'ed me and said not to leave negative reviews... I don't understand that kind of thinking but there you go.

I rarely get anything constructive. But I like when readers speculate or even try and convince me to write down a certain path. It means they're engaged enough to care on some level.

As a reader, in the past I very rarely reviewed, and if I did, it was for the latest chapter. At their heart these reviews were an "update pls" lol. Nowadays I try and review every fic I read.

As a reader, I tend to read reviews only if I'm starting to have doubts about reading further into a story. You know the sort of thing - you're 10 chapters into a 50 chapter story and while it started well, everything has got a bit bogged down. If I find some detailed reviews for later on then I might keep going. If there are several that talk about giving up or how they wish the pace would pick up or something similar, then I might not bother.

When reviewers are either impatient about seeing how a new development progresses or misstate what was written, it sticks in my craw.

That said, I don't take a lack of substantive criticism to be a death knell against stories I'm interested in. I check the reviews briefly just to gauge if there are annoying developments later (harems, prolonged OOCness, melodrama).

Even if they're not /as/ helpful, I certainly won't turn my nose up at 'Nice chapter more pls' type ones, because even that means they took the time to write even that much (which, honestly, is a lot more effort than I usually put in when reading.)

  If all or almost all reviews are just one sentence praises of the author, then the story also doesn't contain anything noteworthy
#+end_quote

It depends. If the story is complete, then yes. But if it is still updating? Taken from my own stories, sometimes you have a filler chapter because you don't want to skip two months of character development, which is important but not very exciting. And you are not getting many reviews for those, unless you include Ron or Hermione (and then they all say "Fuck "Worse than Hitler" Granger!" for some reason, despite it being a positive portrayal of her).

*** Even if it's still updating, absence of meaningful reviews means that there isn't anything meaningful in already written chapters.

I think even filler chapters should show something. Another side of character interactions, traits that aren't shown in the plot chapters, etc.

If inside a chapter equals blank page, I think it's better to remove it at all. I noticed that too many fanfiction stories can be easily cut half or more without losing anything.

  the average reviewer is stupid

In my personal experience a rare author who thinks the same is really as smart as he/she wants to think. And all these rare authors are professional writers.

In this thread there're a lot of people who admitted leaving 1 like reviews. Are they stupid too?

** Reviews rank somewhere below pulling your favorite unit in a gatcha but above getting a team kill on my favorite game for me. I constantly check for new reviews, and I even like the ones that are simple "write moar plz" in the darkest part of my heart. When I get a really good review I am tempted to show it to everyone I know because someone liked what I wrote. I have a review addiction, and that's a problem. It's why I always try and leave a review if I read something so someone else can get that beautiful high.

Of course, now I just write terrible SI stories and niche warcraft crossovers no one likes so I'm either in recovery or just a really stupid addict.

** I love leaving reviews, but sometimes I am not sure what to say and it is not the fault of the story, so I will leave a one liner or two just letting them know I'm still around and enjoying the story. I do like to leave con-crit sometimes, but I've been bad at knowing when I've gone over the line and coming off harsh or rude because I have a personality/neurological disorder and am a blunt person without meaning to be.

When looking for something to read I will look at the reviews on chapter one, because I hate being spoiled. I don't judge the fic based on the reviews, because some great fics go unread, or some will get hit by trolls.

Another thing that might make me not read a story has nothing to do with reviews, but if the title has bad grammar(some don't have punctuation and I guess they do it as artistic style, but it throws me off), or the tags like this "I know this sucks, but I just had to write it, don't kill me."

** The content of reviews does not matter much to me, except reviews from specific people whose views I respect (Newcomb and Sesc spring to mind). However, the existence of reviews is an important psychological aid to maintaining writing momentum for me. On more than one occassion, I have been inspired to go write because I have received a review, even if the content of that review was "meh".

** As a reader, I tend not to be too bothered about reviews unless it's a story I've been following for a while. Then it's more like chatting with other readers in the comments.

As a writer, even the one word reviews mean someone took the time to login and write it. They felt strong enough about the story to do it and that means the world. We have a handful of people who do a couple of paragraphs most of the time and it's always something we're grateful for, because often it contains questions about the world building or how we see the character so we get the chance to give some writer commentary or do a little bit of meta in the comments. These can lead to new ideas and new things we want to address. So reviews are basically an engaging with the reader tool to see what's working, what's not and talk about some of the thoughts that go into the decisions we make.

** As a writer I love reviews.

I overanalyze my own stories for my character decisions and changes I have reasons that I can't really put in the stories (because my POV character doesn't know all of this) and I really enjoy it if people try to figure it out or even talk to them why I interpret something like I do.

** As a reader? Not really. A well-written summary is more important. Doesn't have to be fancy, just grammatically correct with an intriguing concept. That combined with what characters are involved is how I decide to read a fic.

I also tend to look at bookmarks on AO3 (I never read anything on ff.net). If a writer I like has bookmarks, I'll sift through them. Rec lists are also nice.

Sometimes a very long fic will have many reviews, but when I open it, I can tell it's just because it's been going on long enough to pull reviews over time. It's not always an indication that the fic is genuinely good.

As a writer, I can't get enough of positive reviews. They're incredibly gratifying. Critique isn't something I'm looking for on some wank fic I wrote on my day off, but I'm not mad about them either.

** As an author, i'm Not afraid to say I really like that notification. It means someone read what I wrote. I don't like people who review every chapter though that era tiring.

As a reader, I often leave reviews to encourage people to continue/finish unfinished work. It's helped me in the past and I have received thanks for it sometimes as well, kickstarting stories where the author gave up. In the first Hope Potter fanfic (I think by shinimagirl or something) I left a long review when she went completely off the rails in thb last couple of chapters, introducing a load of Green god characters nobody cared about and leaving everyone who'd been part of the first 50 chapters behind. It was as a huge shame and I tried to explain what had been great about the story and how frustrating it was for a second story to get shoehorned into the first. She's taken everybody's criticism onboard and now started a new fic, Serpent Tongue instead.

Generally my reviews are a paragraph at most though

** I look at the review count. I've never found a story that had fewer than 20 reviews per chapter that I actually liked. That said, I do screen the ones with thousands of reviews as well because I don't tend to like the over popular stories either.

** As an author, I love seeing reviews. I do, however, delete parts of threads that get too long. For example, one where I went back and forth with a reader who wanted me to change my entire plot to suit them. I left their first comment and my last comment out of about 8 or 9 total.

** I read a few chapters of the story and then read the reviews to decide whether the upcoming story is decent or not. But I also don't leave everything to the reviews. For example, things like sentence formation,vocabulary,character interactions,cliches etc., determine how much I like it.

And also, A small problem with reviews is that most of them won't know a good story even if they watched it come out of their a**. If you put some terrible 3rd rate sex in it, everyone will call it a great chapter.

** As a writer, only if you're actually going to give concrit. I don't want to hear how much you love my fic, because it'll only lower my opinion of you, and I don't want to hear that it sucks, because I already know. Either provide feedback or don't post. As a reader, no. Popularity, I find, is a /terrible/ measure of quality, especially in the world of fanfiction. Most people have shit taste. FFN readers /especially/ have shit taste. The website, i find, has a very hugbox culture, and I've been flamed repeatedly in the past for providing honest and helpful concrit which describes both what the author is doing well, and what they are not.
