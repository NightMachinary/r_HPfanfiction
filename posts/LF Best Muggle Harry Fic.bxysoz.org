I'm looking for the best muggle Harry fit with pairings with H/Hr, H/G, or H/LL.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a great fic, although it's not set in a totally Muggle AU. This world has superpowers that can rival HP magic.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

** I quite liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6964352/1/Against-The-Odds][Against The Odds]], even if some characters were a bit OOC, it still seemed believable.
