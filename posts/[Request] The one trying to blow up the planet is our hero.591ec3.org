So, in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/58vum6/mundane_power/][Mundane Power thread]] further down this page, someone linked to [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/The_End/The_End/][Draco664's 'The End']]

Basically it's a dialogue story where Harry talks to the portraits of headmasters of Hogwarts, telling them about how every single magical being and creature has been exterminated by muggles. Somewhat depressing.

I actually got to thinking while reading it; suppose a scenario where muggles did try to exterminate all magic on the planet.

If they're willing to do something like that, what happens if they ever meet aliens?

From that, I wondered about the possibility of a story where a wizard (or even a muggle), concerned about what would happen if his trigger-happy, genocidal species were allowed to spread throughout the galaxy, actively tried to blow up the Earth (and all its innocent fauna and flora) in order to save aliens he/she's never met.

Or, for a less extremist hero, someone who's trying to get to the moon so they can set up a moonbase and work to quarantine the earth from there, by capturing or destroying any spaceships leaving orbit. (Wasn't there a plot point along those lines with guns in the Gor books or something?)

Or, bonus points; take your classic wizards-vs-muggles, one side is trying to completely exterminate the other.

What happens when an alien race infiltrates Earth in the middle of the war? Would they try to negotiate peace between the two sides, or try and evacuate innocents from the planet? Would they try to take advantage of the confusion to use their own magic-like powers to take over the world? Would they be attacked and slaughtered, leading to military response from a galactic assembly?


** I think *The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig* and its sequel *This Crude Matter* addressed that scenario.

  Just before her death Sybill Trelawney makes one last prophecy: to prevent a magical genocide Harry Potter must leave the Earth, and find a new home for his people around a distant star.
