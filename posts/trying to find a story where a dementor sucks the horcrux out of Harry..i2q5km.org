I remember reading it once, Harry goes missing, and when he reappears he tells the listeners about going up to a dementor and when it was just about to kiss him he slammed his scar against its mouth. I wanted to reread it to remember what happened from there.


** "Hey kid, hold still; you have some smutz in that scar." (Licks dementor hankie.)

*** interesting. it does match my description, and looks like an interesting read but it isn't one I have read before. I'm lookinh for one where he is older and the encounter was intentional because he knew about his scar.
