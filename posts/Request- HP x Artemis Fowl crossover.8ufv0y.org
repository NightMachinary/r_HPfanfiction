I've seen a few HPxAF crossovers, but almost all of them are about Artemis going to Hogwarts. Anyone have one where Artemis is a regular muggle/Mud Boy and discovers the wizarding world the same way he discovered the People?

Bonus points: set after Hogwarts (because AF started in 2001) and Auror!Harry is assigned to the case


** That sounds fucking awesome. Artemis kidnaps a wizard and takes their wand, then tries to ransom them for gold. In exchange, he doesn't reveal everything about the magicals to the rest of the world.

Add in a couple quirks-- For example, The Fowl Family Manor has thousand-year-old anti-apparition wards or something-- and you've got something. That way you could put in some intrigue with Artemis and his bodyguards and such being a long line of squibs. (It's a good reason why Auror Harry can't just apparate in and obliviate everybody or put up a muggle-repelling ward over the whole estate)
