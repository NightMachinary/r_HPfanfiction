Looking for a good H/Hr fic that is before hogwarts, if anyone has any good ones it would be much obliged.


** linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader) comes to mind.

linkffn(Rule of Two, Dreams Come True by Darklooshkin) is another --- though Darklooshkin is an acquired taste.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

***** If I had read it originally thinking it was a crack!fic, I think I would have liked it. As a matter of fact I read quite a bit of it...because I wanted to find out what happened...but it just...ugh. For every bad thing that happens there is an insane amount of good to balance it. Babies ever after makes me puke in my mouth, and the whole pack premise was a put-off. The family itself is TOO perfect, despite occasional obligatory flaw. The prophesies are just awful and cringe inducing. And don't get me started on the dreamscapes and founders...
