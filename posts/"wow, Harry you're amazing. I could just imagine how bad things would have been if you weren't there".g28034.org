"yeah, it would have really been bad" Harry replied weakly as he thought of how many times he reloaded/reset to his last check point.

He shivered as he though of multiple accidental death when Snape arrived and a duel occurred , multiple ways he got mauled by were-lupin, times when he and sirius ended up in acromantula part of the forest and the many, many times he got kissed/killed by Dementors. It was worse than Chamber Basilisk fight.

(where Harry isn't lucky, he just had multiple tries and the cloak allows the user to reset after death and use it as a save point, until he transfers ownership)

*** I was thinking something along the lines of save points where old the one is overwritten.

Example. (my idea why lily and James died without fighting and wands) James had recently saved then 3 days later Voldemort comes. He kept resetting but 1) wormtail is already the secret keeper and went to hiding, sirius can't find him . 2) there's no time to cast a new one. 3) the only other place they can run to is the Longbottom which didn't work. 4) if wormtail is traitor they don't know who else isnt. James keep on save scumming those three days until he spoke to lily and transferred ownership. Lily tried to repeat the the now 2 days left until both Lily and James agreed only one will survive so they made sure Harry will. To stop them from stubbornly going back on their decision,They transfered the ownership to Harry and sent the cloak to dumbledore to prevent the urge to repeat those two days. With everything set, they knew the three of them are fated to die that day and the cloak can only save one, they chose Harry.

**** That's actually really well thought out. I'd love to read a whole fic like this. I'll have to look for it, but someone on AO3 is doing a Tom Riddle one where he has a similar ability (but full video game mechanics like) and then one day, enter player 2 appears in the air in front of him. It's only just started, but pretty good so far.

** So did James just not know of or have the ability to use it (perhaps connected to Harry being future MoD?)? Also how would the Cloak consider ownership? James just lent it to Dumbledore so we wouldn't consider it a transfer of ownership, but perhaps the Cloak wouldn't see it that way. Anyways, this makes me feel really bad for James lol, he got screwed over.

*** Nah. I totally imagine, James did that thing where you compulsive save but his most recent save was few hours(or days) before Voldemort and no amount of save scumming can save them. Kinda like when you load an old save and turned into an imminent death loop.

So he transferred ownership to Harry and lent the cloak to dumbledore until he's eleven because a little kid with save power may up doing a genocide run.

**** Problem is that unlike in games he has much more options. Unless he can save without the Cloak in possession, he has to have saved before lending the Cloak to Dumbledore. That means that any time he save-scums, he'll go back to a moment that's relatively safe, unless you can contrive a series of events that forces him to reach the same consequences no matter what. Because at any point in time if there's an option that can get past those consequences he'll be able to take them. And let's say he is forced into performing actions that will inevitably lead to the same consequences. Then unless James is dumb or again forced into a contrived series of events that lead to inevitable consequences, he would prepare Harry better too. Basically, unlike a game, James has nigh infinite options every step of the way unless you contrive something, which means that there's always a route out. Which leads to the conclusion that James didn't have the ability to save-scum, because he wouldn't have to die otherwise.

You could rewrite parts of canon to force him to die, but it takes a lot of effort. Change it so there's no escaping prophecies and force it to kill him. Make Voldemort much, much smarter and powerful so that the only way to kill him is to use or make something that requires more time than is possible, and remove Time-Turners from the story. You could make it so he doesn't lend the Cloak to Dumbledore, saves right as Voldemort attacks, dies, and the Cloak is taken by Dumbledore. That raises a couple of questions about ownership, though they're much easier to resolve than the save-scum problem in the first place. I guess you could also make him just give up, and choose to die, but that's kind of pathetic and I think not very in character.

** I read a SI gamer HP novel on WebNovel (I was bored, sue me). It introduced a hilarious downside to the whole save/load system.

He decided to go risky to make some money. Made a save point at the start of summer. And then he did his plan all over the summer. The ministry finally got pissed off enough to get ALL children in the area (there were other schools) interviewed by aurors. He had to save/load the interview a bunch of times, and then eventually redo the whole summer two or three times.

That's right, the natural enemy of Save/Load states is a bureaucracy driven investigation.

For reference, one of the most annoying ever save bugs was in the original UFO Enemy Unknown back in the 1990's. If you saved the game under certain non-fatal circumstances, the save slot, and any made as descendants, stuck you in a loop pf having to complete the previous mission infinitely. it was called the green text bug.. as that was what the player saw when the bug bit.
