I would love some recs that explore the complexity of slytherin house like the Changeling. I just hate how slytherin is treated in canon. Additionally anything about Snape as a student/ younger years would be super cool!!!

** No recs (sorry) but I'm kicking around an idea for an OC second gen Slytherin character who falls in love with a Weasley Gryffindor child. I hope to build a friendship group for her and show the house in a good light. My idea (kind of quashed by CC but whatev, it's not canon in my head) where the next generation don't really understand the house rivalries as much as their parents' generation did and don't get all the fuss. I think this character will be a muggle born or half-blood who doesn't know her magical father so she hasn't grown up hearing about the history of Hogwarts and the houses or even the war either.

I'm going to keep and eye on this threat because I'm interested in reading these types of stories too.

I hope this is something along the lines of what you are looking for. I really enjoyed reading this one, even though it isn't finished, it gets semi-regular updates and is one of the best Slytherin!Harry fanfics out there. But it is also a NBWL or WBWL story, so if that trope is not your cup of tea then you maybe should avoid this one.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
