Have I finally updated In the Bleak Midwinter, my cheerful time travel fixit that everyone's been demanding? No. But I did post the final chapter of Prisoner, my dark, canon-compliant tale of Remus's role in the first wizarding war. Enjoy, if you're into that sort of thing. The great thing about canon Remus is that no matter how bad your life is, his is always worse.

** I enjoyed what I read of Midwinter and while this is the first I've heard of Prisoner, I offer my sincere congratulations on finishing your latest story.

I'll add it to the list!
