I recently read the Changeling linkff(6919395) which is a story about Ginny being sorted in Slytherin.

Can you suggest something similar? It doesn't have to be about Ginny, just a different character going through Hogwards life.


** "Goldstein" linkffn(10847788) is an interesting in-progress fic about Anthony Goldstein.

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014.

** Check out this story that covers Percy and Audrey, along with some Bill and Fleur, a few others, canon compliant during the 7th year: linkffn(12181042). I think it's borderline crazy that it has so few follows and reviews, it's been a favorite of mine.

I think it's a great story with a clever explanation of how Percy may have been working on his redemption story all through 7th year. It's a WIP but gets pretty consistently updated, usually once a week, sometimes you get an extra chapter in the week.

  COMPLETE. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.
