** I think the Killing Curse would be a special case where CPR wouldn't work, but if something else caused the death and Harry or someone else acted quick enough with CPR before the soul goes walkies to the afterlife?

Yeah, I can sort-of see it.

*** Souls are famously hard to affect with magic. Why shouldn't the killing curse just stop the soul from communicating with the body for a few minutes, until brain damage makes the question of whether it can re-attach moot? It seems like a good shortcut or energy saving measure.

**** That feels like a bit of a cop-out compared to what it's implied to be, I guess, but there has to be /something/ about the Killing Curse to differentiate it from other spells and curses (being fueled by hate aside).

I wish JKR expanded on it a little bit.

** I've read so many stories lol, I know I've found this exact premise before. Harry and victor preformed it on Cedric after the AK and it did bring him back, and some people freaked out thinking it was unnatural and some called Cedric the second Boy-Who-Lived.

** I remember one story where Harry had his Horcrux removed by having his heart stopped in a medical procedure, and then being resuscitated with CPR afterwards. I think Dumbledore might have made a big fuss about it being unnatural and Harry needing to die in order for Tom to die? But I might be getting that mixed up with another story.

** Hmm. I'm not a doctor either but I went through some medical training. Unfortunately CPR doesn't bring anyone back. It's a temporary fill in that keeps blood and oxygen circulating through the body until you can get them to the hospital by manually pumping the heart for the person.

Maybe if someone drowned it might but that is more of a chocking senario, like the heimlich maneuver. But that could work for the prompt. A student falls in the lake. It would probably look like breathing life into the dead.

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.
