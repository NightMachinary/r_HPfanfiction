I'm looking for recs of severely traumatized, PTSD Harry. Preferably ones that deviate from the books, as I think the war was really underplayed. Slash preferred, but gen and really amazing het is fine. I mainly want to see his life post-war, how he recovers and moves on, or gets caught up in some other drama/war/etc. Crossovers with any other fandom are enjoyed and appreciated, but not necessary.

All suggestions appreciated!

Edit: Just to clarify, it doesn't have to be slash or a crossover. It can even take place during the war as long as it has a heavy focus on the brutality/how the characters are affected.


** This should kind of fit. Underrated story; from what I remember of it I enjoyed it and was a bit surprised it only has 270 reviews when I looked it up right now. But it is not slash and not a crossover:

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** The First Day was really good from what I recall. It starts straight after the war ends and works through people coping with the aftermath. Very well-written if I'm recollecting the right fic.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304714][Chrysalis]] has a very realistic depiction of post-War Harry with PTSD. There are some TWs though.

  In which Harry is a tad messed up after the war, but Snape gives him a run for his money. Or: an epic tale of PTSD, recovery and gay porn! (For detailed warnings, please see author's notes.)
