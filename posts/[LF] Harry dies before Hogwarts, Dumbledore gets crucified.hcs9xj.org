Has anyone stumbled across a story where Harry dies somehow, before his letter arrives, and Dumbledore gets in all the shit as a result?


** The only one I read that somewhat relates is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8495049/1/If-I-Die-Young][If I die Young]] by bookreader911.

  They never thought he would live after they killed him. They never thought ghosts were real, but Harry has never let that stop him from haunting them. Please Review! Warning: Abused!Harry Beware of unhappy ending.

  Sequel to Fixing Past Mistakes. Now that the past mistakes had been fixed what of the future? Will Harry be able to secure a growing legacy as he ages? Will Dumbledore find out who they are and make life uncomfortable or will he only realize who they were when they are gone never to be seen again...what about Voldemort? Has he already returned working in the shadows or not?

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

  One-shot. What if Harry Potter gave up on life just before receiving his Hogwarts Letter. What would happen to him and what would the repercussions be. Character DEATHS, Dark theme, language.
