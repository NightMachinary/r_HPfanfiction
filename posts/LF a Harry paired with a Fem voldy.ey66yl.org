  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

  When Harry and Cedric grab the Cup, they are transported to a graveyard, where Harry witnesses the resurrection of Lady Voldemort... who isn't quite what he'd expected. For one, she isn't trying to kill him. For another, she doesn't seem to like the Death Eaters either. Harry/fem!Voldemort.

*** As much as I love being recommended it's probably worth noting that this is not a romantic story.

While Harry Potter and Emily Riddle are the protagonists, for lack of a better word, and the story is told almost exclusively from their perspectives, they are not romantically entangled in the text. Harry crushes on her like...well a younger male presented with a cute, compassionate slightly older woman. And, depending on how you want to take it, this affection is...at best..one sided and at worst malicious.

***** I obsessively stalk the "Female Voldemort" and "Female Tom Riddle" tags on ao3, and I follow the comprehensive C2 in ffn, and the lack of good fics that fulfill those requirements is staggering. I'm writing a Harry/fem!Riddle fic of my own, but mine is focused on the diary horcrux, so I don't necessarily count it. After all, my fic's fem!Voldemort is acting basically the same way that canon Voldemort did.

I really do wish that more fics wrote a good fem!Voldemort

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
