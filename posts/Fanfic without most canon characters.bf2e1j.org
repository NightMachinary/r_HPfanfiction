Looking for one that takes place in the wizarding world preferably in Britain (I'm from London lol) and hogwarts. I would love to read come fanfics without Harry, Hermoine, Ron, etc., the common canon characters. Thanks you!


** I can highly recommend stuff written by the fanfic author Slide, whose early stuff was focused entirely around four Slytherin characters that she made up. Her writing is sweet and sly and clever and a ton of fun to read, and I've grown to love these characters as much as I love the canon HP characters. Their story begins with a series of one-shots called linkffn(Latent Anguis In Herba) , which takes place during books 2-5. Then some more plot-driven stories continue with Shade to Shade linkffn(3353818) , which takes place during Book 6, and Falls the Shadow linkffn(6726813) , which takes place during Book 7.

Also, she's from Lancaster, so her stories are authentically British.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  The sequel to 'Latet Anguis in Herba', set during HBP. The Slytherins return to Hogwarts under the shadow of the war and their own demons. But with the wizarding world embroiled in conflict, how are they supposed to cope with their seventh and final year? MASSIVELY RE-EDITED.

** linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) I believe it's called is completely au based on llevermony (no idea how it's spelled) the author does an amazing job of being similar to the books without copying it and being unique at the same time.
