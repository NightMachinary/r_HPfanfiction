I think this idea should be clear enough from the title.


** ...

"Professor Snape!" /Harry Potter,/ willingly raised his hand during his class.

This he just /had/ to hear.

Temporarily turning his attention away from bullying Longbottom, Severus Snape gave the worst thing to hit the potion's community since Pettigrew the chance to speak.

"What is it, /potter?"/ The brat didn't deserve a capital letter to his name.

"Have a snickers." Harry Potter promptly threw a piece of candy at him, an overhead, /quidditch-class/, throw at that.

Narrowing his eyes and wandlessly freezing the projectile in mid-air, he mentally made a note to deduct all of Gryffindor's points.

Opening his mouth to commit a crime on the English language, he found himself, to his /shock/, interrupted. The boy /daring-/

"You turn into Voldemort when you're hungry!"

"...Is that so?" He remarked through grit teeth, his feet steadily taking him towards James' insufferable seed. "Do tell, Mr potter, what part of my behaviour reminds you of You-Know-Who?"

"Well. He's a /dark lord,/ and you're an /asshole/." Harry Potter cheerfully gave him the +middlest of all fingers+ two-finger salute.

*** The middlest finger is more an American jester, In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, a two-fingered salute, the V sign, when given with back of the hand towards the recipient, serves a similar purpose.

**** That's funny, as someone living in the UK I've never met anyone who prefers the two fingered salute over the middle fingers

  The line; Harry gave him the two-finger salute. Would work.

  Picture someone giving a V for Victory or Peace Sign when they do that their palm is facing the person they are giving the sign to. When you give the two-finger salute your palm is facing you.

***** They say that the story behind the two-finger salute was centuries ago back before guns, England and France were are war and the French would cut off the index and middle fingers of any Brit they captured. Because you needed both fingers to fire the British long bow. Now the bows were made of yew wood and the act of drawing the bow was called plucking, so using the bow was called plucking yew. And so the british solders would shake their fists at the French troops with the two fingers extended yelling the that they could still pluck yew across the battle field. The yells go shortened to just "Pluck Yew" after a while and when said fast the sounds slurred into...

** I love the idea for a fic that has Harry really influenced by his horcrux when he's hungry. “Mr. Potter your cackling again, please have a snickers.”

*** "Here," Remus remarked, a nostalgic look to his face, he almost couldn't believe the striking resemblance before him."Have some chocolate, it'll help." He finished, standing up. His gaze turned towards the rest of the carriage. His wand ready on the off-chance a dementor chose to linger.

"Huh." Harry deadpanned, quickly grabbing his attention. " They warned you already." James's son /frowned./ "Malfoy was right. I /do/ have a problem." Lucius? Or his /son?/

"...You did punch him in the face." A bushy-haired girl, one of Harry's /best/ friends, if Dumbledore was to be believed, stated, a /tired/ tone to her voice.

...Remus was feeling /really/ nostalgic.

"I am surprised you didn't try to punch that /dementor/ in the face." The red-headed student , the other presumed best friend, snorted.
