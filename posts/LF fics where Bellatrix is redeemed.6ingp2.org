Can we exclude fics where:

- Bellatrix was secretly good / held under imperio / held under slave contract all along

- Bellatrix turns good for her baby/ some other baby

- Bellatrix was abused by her husband

- Bellatrix changes side because she feels insulted that Voldemort turns out to be a half-blood

Because I'm interested in whether there's any other ways to redeem Bella apart from the ones listed above.

Bellatrix has to be truly devoted to Voldemort before the redemption, but brainwashed/ cult-conditioned/ peer-pressured Bellatrix is ok.

Thank you very much!


** Based on the Bellatrix in the books, I find it incredibly demeaning that her actions are often explained in fanfic as being under the Imperius curse. It implies that she cannot possibly do horrible things out of her own volition, reducing and weakening her powerful character. I liked that there was a strong female evil character in the books, especially since HP is fairly male-centric.

I haven't come across exactly what you are looking for, but some "redeemed" Bella fics have it as a result of time travel, extreme punishment by Voldemort (technically Delenda Est kinda fits this), or mental illness.

Me too; but it felt cheapened that this human maelstrom of hate and ferocity, a terrifying combatant, was felled by a housewife who hadn't lifted her wand in anger for twenty years, if ever.

I agree, I feel it's a bit cheap to turn her into somebody else's mindless puppet and then rescue her. But I do realize that it'll be pretty challenging otherwise to turn her into a sympathetic character, so I understand why people do it.

**** I guess one way to turn her into a redeemable character is to have her feel some sort of emotion after something "bad" happens to someone she cares somewhat about, such as Narcissa or her husband as a result of Voldemort's actions or the Dark Arts. It would have to be a long and slow process but that's what makes redemption arcs good.

***** Pretty sure that's the reason people just put her under the Imperius or confunding marriage contracts. With Bellatrix's long line of mental issues (i.e. her sadism, violent tendencies, pureblood fanaticism) it's bound to be a terribly long fic to write. And let's face it, most authors get easily uninterested if they write too much of the same thing. That said, I'm still hoping KuraiBites doesn't bite the dust with linkffn(7755315) even if it's been a year already.

** Considering what Bellatrix is responsible for it's really difficult for her to be redeemed when not allowing for the usual excuses that you excluded.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7200246/1/Impossible]]) has a Bellatrix that changes sides. If I remember correctly her role in the worst atrocities is a little bit reduced though and it involves a sorta soul-bond, so your mileage may vary. Also I'm not convinced that she's really redeemed there, but as I said, not sure it's possible under your conditions...

**** You are welcome! In that fic, she is not actually redeemed for her crimes, instead her view of the world changes little by little. At first blood status then muggles then morals...

In Wind Shear, she is not really 'redeemed' at first actually. Only her object of 'worship of power' changes from Tom to Harry. She still has a thing for power, she still has her murderous tendencies and she still sees muggles as cattles.

She doesn't like Dumbledore because he is not willing to use his great magical powers against his enemies. Because he doesn't fight. She finds Dumbledore too passive. But she likes Harry because she watched him kill his enemies cold heartedly and it both fascinated and aroused her.

She still can not understand that Harry actually not enjoys killing or showing his powers off. She can not comprehend not wanting to fight just because you can. During the entire fic, she changes little by little. Later -close to end, after chapter 15, I remember- she starts to realise the error of her ways. And she starts to accept different perspectives a bit easier because she idolizes Harry.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
