Just read this [[https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/vbqw8j/my-quest-to-become-a-harry-potter-erotic-fanfic-writer][Article]] from Vice about a writer's first attempt at writing HP smut. It was a fun read!


** i never really thought about it but she's right, there's a ton of use of throbbing, folds, and glistening in HP smut

*** That's not just Harry Potter fanfics though. Pretty much any smut suffers from bad word choices, from GMMR and his "Fat pink mast" up to other fandoms' fanfics, nothing is safe.

*** It's really a shame that so many people fail so abysmally at that type of scene that it breaks immersion entirely.

Especially frustrating when the fic /isn't/ explicitly an excuse for slurpy sex scenes and therefore built expectations that it then undermines.

** "And then Malfoy flung his hands back over his head, sprawling as though he'd just fallen. His voice ratcheted into the falsetto range. 'Oh, Harry Potter! Take me! Take me like the slayer of darkness and the defender of righteousness that you are!'"

That cracked me up real good lmao
