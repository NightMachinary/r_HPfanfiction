** You might comb through it once more looking for improper homophones, but it's an interesting idea. I see significant homology to the Quibbler's Rotfang Conspiracy with various other 7/7 and 9/11 'truthers.' It would be nice to see a fic that treats Luna's dangerous lies as something more than 'just crazy.' Taken to a hyperbolic extreme, they threaten social order.
