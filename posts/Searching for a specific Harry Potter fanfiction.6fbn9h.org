Hi. An old girlfriend once told me about a fan rewrite of the entire Harry Potter book series that she said was absolutely incredible and is about 4-6 times as long as the original Harry Potter books, but for the life of me I cannot remember what it was called or who wrote it. But I'm pretty sure the author of the rewrite is female. Does anybody have a clue what I'm talking about? I'm sorry, I realize that's not much to go on.


** That's really nothing much to work with, but the first thing that comes to my mind is the Sacrifices Arc, beginning with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]. Length of the whole series is north of 3 million words.
