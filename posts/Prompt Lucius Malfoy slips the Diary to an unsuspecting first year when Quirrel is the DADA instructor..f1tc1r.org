It will be fun reading about Voldy trying to control his teenaged self who is drawing too much attention to him and hence is distracting him from pursuing the Stone.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

I know I read a story where he actually did it. I think he was in history class (because who listens to Binns anway), and Voldie is desperately demanding he stop. I'm nearly certain it was a time-travel story, but I can't really think of the specific one because I read my way through the search results for time-travel fics and my browser history is not being extremely helpful.

**** [[/u/Icanceli][u/Icanceli]] and [[/u/KonoCrowleyDa][u/KonoCrowleyDa]]: Finally found it again! It's in Harry Potter: Master of Malicious Compliance by Watermelonsmellinfellon. linkffn(13460508).

#+begin_quote
  The book talked!

  It introduced itself as Tom Riddle and asked how he came across it! His ink had disappeared and everything!

  And yet Harry... was still a kid. And sometimes he had urges to be a little prick to people /without/ being offended first.

  So instead of introducing himself, he just started doodling cartoon dicks all over the page.

  *What are you doing?*

  *Stop!*

  *Stop this at once!*

  *This is childish!*

  *STOP!*

  Harry broke down cackling at his desk. This was the greatest thing ever! Whatever the book was, it couldn't escape. He could keep this going for as long as he wanted.

  Whoever Tom Riddle was, he had no patience.

  To mess with Tom, Harry drew an ink penis on the meat of his palm first and then waited a bit, allowing him to think it was over.

  *Finally.*

  And then Harry brought the imitation stamp down in rapid succession, covering the page quickly in poorly drawn penises!

  After that, the responses stopped, but it was fun while it lasted.

  He tossed the book in the rubbish a few days later and promptly forgot about it.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.
