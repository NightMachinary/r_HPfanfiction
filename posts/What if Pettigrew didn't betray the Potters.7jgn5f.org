Secret keeper or not, fics where Pettigrew doesn't go over to the dark side.


** I've been sitting on an idea for a while which diverges from the end of Prisoner of Azkaban; when exposed, Peter claims that Sirius was the real betrayer, who gave him a choice; reveal the Secret to Voldemort, or die so that everyone who already knew the secret (Sirius included) becomes a Secret Keeper in turn.

Of course, the truth would be that Barty Crouch Jr. (or some other Death Eater) impersonated Sirius, to trick Peter into telling the Secret. I figure that given this concept, it might not have been Sirius OR Peter who blew up the street full of muggles, but a Death Eater assassin sent to stop Peter before he can warn the Potters (from looking at the timeline, the confrontation between Sirius & Peter and the deaths of James & Lily Potter are less than a day apart, not necessarily enough time for everyone to learn of Voldemort's death).

  He made the choice knowing full well what the consequences might be, but expecting death does not necessarily prepare you for hell. In 1981, Sirius Black ignored the dangers to himself and became the Potters' Secret Keeper. Prequel to Promises Unbroken,AU

** War would have gone on and on. Since it was prophesied that only Harry had power to kill him nobody else could have stopped him.

Dumbledore, even with Elder wand, barely kept Voldemort at bay.

There would have been lots and lots of deaths.

*** Voldemort made his mistake by listening to the prophecy, in my opinion he made a self-fulfilling prophecy. If he hadn't of listened to the prophecy in the first place say Severus never heard of the prophecy to give to Voldemort, then the fact that Voldemort would mark either Neville or Harry as equals would never pass.

And because of Voldemort doing the self fulfilled prophecy it's possible that he could have been killed sooner. (You know if Dumbledore actually looked for the Horcruxes and destroyed them). But of course this is merely speculation and would be great to have explored in fanfiction.

*** I don´t think Dumbleodore had any trouble in 1v1 Voldemort, the fight at the ministry clearly showed that Dumbleodore didn´t give his 100% and Voldemort was pissed by the effortless way that Albus was avoiding his spells. The thing is that Albus gave too much credit to the Prophecy, he clearly believed that Harry was the Chosen One, so he wouldn´t even try to do more than containment when it came to Voldemort.

Sure the war would´ve rage on, the thing Albus has a difficult of winning is in the ideology field, the idea behind Voldemort. He can´t quite make stop people of joining the D.E

**** Prophecy came after 8 years of continued tension and civil war. And at most out was functional only for 1.5 years, 2 years at most if you want to extend it thin, and yet Voldemort was successful in everything.

There is no reason in canon to suggest Dumbledore never have his full in any confrontation befire that. Even DoM was an equal affair.

Voldemort ram away not because he lost, was injured or afraud but because DoM fight marked failure in political game. He didn't want to confirm his resurrection but DoM fight exposed him to magical world.

***** Do keep in mind that according to Dumbledore in canon, prophecies have no actual binding power; the only reason the one applying to Harry & Voldemort comes true is solely because Voldemort believes it's true and attempts to sabotage it.

--------------

Incidentally, my personal take on the Voldemort war is that, Voldemort has it easy while he's on the offensive; apparation and portkeys and do-anything wands and stuff make for serious logistical power, and the Death Eater masks make it hard for the Ministry to identify their enemy for retaliatory attacks. Plus the Imperius makes for plentiful expendable minions.

In contrast, the Ministry has to defend key locations like Diagon Alley, the Ministry building, Hogwarts, etc, and all kinds of homes, and they can't use the Imperius to use innocents as cannon fodder like Voldemort's forces can.

So yeah, Voldemort would definitely win, at least at first. He did in Deathly Hallows in less than half-a-year after Dumbledore's death. But then he'd run into a problem; the remaining resistance would go underground, be able to attack when and where they want, use their wands for all kinds of things, et-cetera, all the advantages that the Death Eaters once had and lost.

I would also like to point out, that in the final battle of Deathly Hallows, taking place at Hogwarts, where Apparation and thus hit-and-run attacks aren't possible, the attacking force of Death Eaters, and even Lord Voldemort, are ultimately crushed.

Moral of the story, taking over the wizarding world is a lot easier than keeping it.

He can by blasting Voldemort out of his body. If Lily could do it then Dumbledore can do it as well. Or use all his impressive powers to wipe the Death Eaters from the face of Earth because he realised that appeasement is not the way you defeat power-hungry madmen. Chamberlain tried and look how well that turned out. Dumbledore is doing the same mistakes and his inaction is getting people killed. He had the power to stop the Death Eaters but he chose not to.
