**** My headcanon is that that is how things like the Statute of Secrecy is /actually/ enforced and why people take the class at Hogwarts. You might not be a great seer or have "the gift", but the basic mechanics work for everyone who half tries and isn't a bored, 14-year-old jock taking it as a blow-off class, or a stressed swot who can't stand what is basically a humanities/social studies subject with a very slow roll-up to practical and effective applications.

Get a good NEWT in it, get a straight out of school job with the Ministry, detecting and predicting underaged magic and spells used in front of Muggles around Great Britain just before or after they happen. Think the movie Minority Report. The prediction goes in when the event happens, so long as it isn't blocked by some protective magic, then the DMLE (not Aurors) show up and clean the scene, erasing memories and setting things back to sort-of normal.

Because otherwise, how would they /ever/ find people breaking the Statute before things snowballed out of control?

It also works for other things. Instead of magical accountants and actuaries using number to predict things like spending forecasts, you have literal magical forecasts for fourth quarter spending, in both government and business. Personal finance means knowing your birthday and the alignment of Jupiter to predict sudden expenses -- a reason Astronomy is an important class to take, maybe, making it a sort of home ec class.

So say your star charts say tomorrow isn't a great day to take a test, but you can't reschedule. Better warm up that lucky clover amulet and look to your tea readings to avoid the worst of it.

***** My headcanon:

There are "beacons" around the British Isles that form a layer over the entire land. If you perform any magic it warps it like planets and shit warp the fabric of space-time, and they can pick up on the general vicinity - if there's no known muggles living there and the magic is an effect occurring rather than cause and effect ("I want my teddy" rather than "Accio teddy") then you are investigated and marked as a muggle-born or something.

If you perform magic when you get a wand and there is no known mage living near you then you get a letter to appear before a hearing. How they know it was done in front of a muggle, I don't know (I can guess that muggle presence somehow affects magic after it's casting? Or affects the caster's magic?)

My headcanon for Divination without the /sight/ is effecting chance. One of the big things in my fic is that Divination is involved in smelling/aroma stuff which can make you more focused and . . . other stuff, I guess (really early concept right now).

I always figured Astronomy was important was due to some magical changes with the alignment of the other planets and that, with particular alignments being able to focus magic in very different ways, and change the very magic of the world, however lightly.

Interesting concepts to put in a fic anywaysss.

A spell exists upon all magical children below 17, which reports any magic within their vicinity to the Ministry, as well as whether the magic was accidental or intentional. The presence of an adult wizard deactivates the Trace.

**** I thought the whole point of Divination being useless in the books was to give support to the idea that it's our choices that make us. The part about the prophecy only coming true because Voldemort chose to follow it made this pretty clear. It also showed how Voldemort was wrong by believing in magic above all else, while Harry was able to kill him using a first year spell because he had human values rather than just valuing magic.

Divination might be useful in some circumstances, but for this story it's important that it not be.

  Merlin was born sometime during the medieval era. During his formative years, he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and was sorted into Slytherin House. It is possible that he was taught by Salazar Slytherin himself, given the time period Merlin lived in. It is said that Merlin's wand was of English oak (though his grave has never been found, so this cannot be proven).

  * At some point in his lifetime, Merlin became a part of the Court of King Arthur, assisting him during his reign. He was the enemy of Arthur's half-sister, Morgan le Fay, a dark witch.

****** Slughorn is a creep and a borderline pedophile with how he acts around kids. he also knows a lot of things about making horcruxes for a supposed decent guy...

Regulus and Snape were death eaters for many years (and thus committed several crimes while doing so). The fact that they wanted out for their own selfish reasons does not magically make them good guys. Snape especially is the biggest bastard in the series and definitely not one of the good guys.

Andromeda might be the only decent example you gave, but she is barely mentioned in the books and most of the evidence that she is a slytherin comes from other sources.

Merlin lived hundred of years ago! He isn't at all relevant in the story of Harry Potter.

****** I'd say these are more passable than good.

Slughorn was a selfish old bastard, not exactly dislikeable but sly and self-serving. Yes, he duelled Voldemort, but running away would have destroyed his reputation and career. Never saw him showing genuine affection where it wouldn't benefit him ultimately too.

Andromeda Tonks we never see/meet in canon so its hard to judge what kind of person she is. Not-prejudiced is more a bare minimum of human decency than a sign of being a good person.

Snape...I dont know, he has ups and downs. Formed by circumstances, definitely, but he still bullies children under his care and is a terrible teacher who turns his back on the bullying that goes on under his nose. His whole actions are motivated on guilt of allowing his old (one-sided) crush to be murdered. I pity Snape but I don't think that makes him a good person - and even JK goes out of her way to show how unreasonably nasty he is for 90% of the books. Not only is he a poor potions teacher but he also royally messes up his role to teach Harry occlumency.

Regulus and the Malfoys... we never really see them going against the prejudices of their families. No, JK never conveys the idea of a moral greyness or people being any less than essentially good (Gryffindor) or selfish (Slytherin). The closest she comes is showing certain Slytherins to be 'less-bad'; but characters' prejudices against the snakes are never called out or challenged and the overall impression is of Slytherin house being at best a corrupting influence and at worst a child picked for that house as a moral judgement. I also personally find it uncomfortable how many of the Slytherin characters are described or portrayed as physically 'ugly' - a further implicit judgement on their immorality.

*** you joke but honestly I would have liked both more grey areas and definition shown in Dumbledore. Even if it was shown after he died I think it would have added to show the wool coming off childrens eyes.

Obviously we learn more about his past with Grindelwald and some questionable leanings in youth and some regretful decisions. However to add to that - say he was in Slytherin. This would have been great because while I am not fond of manipulative Dumbledore he did sort of get Snape on board and led Harry to fulfill the plan and got people like Mundungus Fletcher on board and all sorts really. Also I think that would have worked really well with his past- being and outsider as "son of Percival Dumbledore, who scarcely a year previously had been convicted of a savage and well-publicised attack upon three young Muggles." from wiki. I think that combined with questionable youth would really have shown the impact of decisions and second chances make and what a good and powerful Slytherin might be like.

To add to that, more in the realm of my thoughts that common fanon ideas, I would like if it was shown why Dumbledore is the "most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters" or "greatest". The former coming from Elphias Doge, his oldest friend, and the latter from Dobby. I know he is powerful, intelligent, basically defeated two of the greatest evil wizards ever. I don't like the whole manipulative Dumbledore thing but wish it was shown or told in canon why he was a good headmaster and the import of the position etc. ex. Dumbledore says that his weakness is power and turn his life to teaching/education. He declines becoming Minister of Magic three times but is Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump- why? This isn't bashing I believe there are good and interesting reasons but becoming MoM isn't the same as being corrupted by Saurons ring so what are these interesting details? I won't hold heading OotP or becoming headmaster against him but IMO he provides a poor education for the children (a very poor teacher in a ghost, a barmy Divs professor for a position that close to being cut, a very skilled potion master with questionable teaching ability, not to mention a caretaker not capable of magic, and professors of the admittedly troubled position of DADA). I simply think these are opportunities for interesting world details. Some poor examples- Finances cut- options are either poor muggleborns like Creeveys get a free spot or their family gets some mind alterations to not notice 'incidents'/block self realization or pressure from ministry/board means that the replacement of a poor teacher would have far worse consequences like a Tom Riddle Jr. having free access to manipulate thoughts and attitudes of generations, and continued access to the vast knowledge Hogwarts holds etc.

Basically add things like why he did or didn't do this or that and the alternate even worse consequences. Similar too but /outside/ of some difficult but understandable choices regarding the Dark Lord- which has getting Snape to become Headmaster so that he can hold things together as long as possible and prevent the absolute worst etc. Snape and Dumbledores trust looks horrible in the publics eye but is then shown to be a good move. Things like that- just show and tell a bit more.
