I cannot find this fic and it's driving me mad! Please someone know what it is! This is what I can remember: • snape and fem harry • harry and draco are head boy and girl who get their own rooms • harry and snape fight together to save everyone in knockturn alley from the ministry and eventually become the dark lord and lady • they eventually seal knockturn off from the rest of the wizarding world
