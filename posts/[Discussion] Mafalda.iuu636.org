So there's this character who was supposed to be included on the books who was supposed to be daughter to a squib second cousin of Molly and a muggle. She was supposed to do the Rita Skeeter role before being scrapped in GOF.

I am thinking on using her. Not in the same role but as a background character. She is supposed to be "equal to Hermione in many ways"... But I imagine that she wouldn't be sorted in GOF. She would be too young to be compared to Hermione. Would it make sense to put her in Harry's year? Ron doesn't mention her on the train when he mentions the second cousin squib, but he might not have known he had a daughter coming to Hogwarts that year. Or would it be more in canon to put her in Ginny's year?


** I don't know anything about Mafalda, but if she was supposed to take Rita's role, wouldn't it make sense to make her older?

And if one of her parents was Molly's second cousin, that would make her Ron's third cousin. I don't think many people even know who their third cousins are. And Ron's family is already huge, and he's not desperate for more family like Harry. So Ron has no real reason to think much about a third cousin. At most, it might be a mild curiosity. And if purebloods families are as interbred as they are sometimes portrayed, Ron probably has several other second or third cousins at Hogwarts.

So basically, it makes sense that Ron wouldn't have mentioned her, even if she was in his year. If she was also in Gryffindor, then it would be more likely to have come up at some point. But if she was in a different house and/or year, I could see Ron easily never thinking about it.

*** She was supposed to take the Rita role of feeding info to the trio and the plot through eavesdropping on Death Eater conversations or something. She was supposed to be a Slytherin.

I do imagine that Ron wouldn't think too much of a third cousin, but if Molly said something then Ron's line in the first book would have been "Mom has a second cousin who is an accountant, I think he has a daughter starting Hogwarts this year too."

So more like the question is... Can Molly find out her second cousin has a magical daughter in the month between she getting the letter and Sep 1st? Not sure how gossipy are the Prewetts

Actually, we don't know much about Weasleys or Prewetts aside from the usual characters, and Bill's wedding was supposed to be stuffed with cousins.

**** If Molly knew about her and she was in Ron's year, then Molly might have mentioned her and told Ron to look out for her or something. If she was older than Ron, she probably would have told Percy instead, and Ron could easily forget or never hear about her. If she was younger than Ron, Ginny would be more likely to hear about her, unless she started when Ron was a prefect, but then she wouldn't be there in GoF.

Molly certainly could find out about Mafalda within the month, especially if she spends time gossiping with her extended family. But I don't think we see her interacting casually with other adults (other than Arthur) enough to get much of a sense of her personality when not in "mothering mode." So she could be quite gossipy, but we can't say for sure.

But Mafalda would almost certainly have first cousins or other closer magical relatives than the Weasleys. So she and her family probably wouldn't tell Molly directly.

There definitely were some Weasley cousins at the wedding. But there are no references, from Ron or anyone else, of other Weasleys at Hogwarts. That means that either Ron doesn't pay attention to cousins at all, or they weren't at Hogwarts during the books. The latter option is probably more likely (if Arthur's siblings only had a few kids, they'd probably be around Bill and Charlie's ages, especially if Arthur was one of thr younger kids), but either is possible.

It has also occurred to me that if Mafalda had existed, Harry/Mafalda would probably be a fairly popular ship, and Harry/Daphne might be a bit less common.

***** True about Harfalda.

Weasley cousins are weird case. We do know that they are all male, for Ginny is the first girl in seven generations. We also get from Malfoy in first year the "all red, more kids you can afford... You must be a Weasley" comment, which points to Arthur's brothers having many children as well.

IMO... JKR just tried to simplify things. It seems unlikely there weren't Weasley cousins at Harry's time at Hogwarts, even if most of them were older than Ron.

** I mean it depends on how much you want to change. The largest change would be if she was sorted in Harry's year, followed by Ginny's year. I would put her in the third year to avoid changing the background as much, but that's me.

I don't think equal necessarily has to mean knowledge. You can be someone's equal in personality or drive, for example.

*** Yeah, I get what you mean with the knowledge part but was thinking that the farther I put her from Harry's year, the less interactions she could have with Hermione.

I am planning on her being background. The trio knowing and interacting with her, but she don't affecting the plot in meaningful ways.

**** I think Mafalda was described as being very nosy and academically talented. I definitely think that you could have interactions with Mafalda eavesdropping on them or them meeting in the library. So all years could work.

Of course, the choice is ultimately yours.
