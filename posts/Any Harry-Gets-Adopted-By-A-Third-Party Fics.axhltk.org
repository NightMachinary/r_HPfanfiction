I LOVE these kind of fics, and I seem to have run out, sadly. Does anyone have any recommendations? Preferably complete or updated recently. Also, I can handle some bashing, but I don't really prefer it, you know what I mean? Thanks to anyone in advance for commenting!

Infant!Harry is spotted by a woman on her way home who, after an argument with Petunia Dursley, takes him in and adopts him.

Cue the power of the Frying Pan and the Rolling Pin demolishing all attempts by the magicals to get to Harry while a muggleborn policeman watches in amusement.

** I'm writing one where he is adopted by the Tonks family after a slightly different 3rd year. Not a lot of action, mostly just family and friendship moments. And since I'm going for a realistic divergence, Harry won't suddenly be a different person overnight. No switching to runes or suddenly being the top student in anything other than DADA. No bashing, but some shade at "incompetent adults".

*** I don't mind when adults are incomplete, I just don't like it when some characters' bad characteristic are so exaggerated that they are not even recognizable. I will surely read your story, it seems fun. I like it when Harry is, you know, "Harry". Thanks for commenting and writing this story!

**** The only character I really throw shade at is Pomfrey for not noticing how Harry had been treated before Hogwarts. But even then it is "she is incompetent" and not "she eats kittens for breakfast" even if in-story there are some thoughts whether it was incompetence or malice. Neville is a dick towards Harry, but it makes sense due to the small issue of Bellatrix Lestrange, Andromeda not particularly caring what her sister did and Harry being very grateful towards Andromeda.

****** Harry Crow is pure Gary Stu power fantasy. I mean he can do wandless transfiguration with a knife in his first year and McGonagall is so astounded she claims he just rewrote the basic theories of transfiguration or something stupid like that. In a later chapter Harry is literally wearing a full suit of golden plate armor in like 3rd year.

As I said, completely ridiculous.

******* I don't see how that makes it any less of a story. So what if something is fantastically ridiculous? Doesn't mean people can't enjoy it. The request was for HARRY BEING ADOPTED BY A THIRD PARTY. I'm pretty sure it fits the criteria, even if it isn't your cup of tea.

** surprised no one's mentioned linkffn(The Perils of Innocence) yet. Harry is abandoned at a sort of behavioral center for children at a young age by the Dursleys and is later joined by Hermione and Dean there. Hasn't been updated in a long while but the author says it's not abandoned so we'll have to see.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** Reccing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] in case you haven't seen them, but they get mentioned pretty often here.

Innocent is "what if Sirius escaped Azkaban early and adopted Harry" (and a couple other points of divergence: the Malfoys have two sons) with some interesting plot - Greyback is quite a compelling villain. Has several sequels, currently in fourth year, which are a bit canon-rehash-y but still enjoyable.

Accidental Animagus is White Squirrel's take on a Lord Potter fic (lots of pureblood politicking and the like) with the Grangers adopting Harry after he runs away from the Dursleys. He likes to take tropey premises and try to do them justice, so give it a chance even if Lord Potter isn't your thing.
