** Pedoships (Snape-Remus-Sirius/Hermione), and ships with people with completely different ideologies. Why would Hermione be with a DE? She wouldn't, you would need to make her completely OOC, and at that point you're better off making an OC instead of a HINO.

On the orientation side there are some characters that are too straight to make gay and vice versa, but I don't really hate those, I just think it's poor writing to use them outside of smut stories.

*** Yeah, I don't like those either and is a big reason why I dislike slash in particular.

Hermione is one of those characters that I can't really think of a ship for her that I like. Harmony is my main ship with HP, as tainted as it is by all the bashing fics that utilize it, but beyond that I just don't like a lot of them.

She's hard to ship outside of crossovers where you have a character that would go with her well in my opinion, Dramione, Romione, Pedo ships, none of them really ring true to me.

I do remember reading a decent Neville x Hermione fic once, but damn if I can't remember the name.

** Yeah, I have to agree with your list with Snape at the top. Just doesn't make any sense and the age gap is just ew.

** What a riveting discussion that gives this sub a welcoming,neutral,and not all circlejerking atmosphere.In all seriousness Snarry horrifies me and the fact that there are people who defend Harry/Bella here disgusts me as well.This sub's general attitude towards Drarry and stuff is understandable(these pairings disgust me too),but non stop one sided discussions get old and add jack shit.There's also the bashing of slash(f/f is apparently ok even the most is probably badly written hawt leasbian sex)to the point where /hundreds of people felt they needed a space to talk about slash without judgment/ I've only been here since November and this sub's general attitude has gotten incredibly grating.

*** Basically every slash fic is exactly like I described in my post in my experience. I have tried /so very hard/ to like slash, but unless the relationship is actually canon, they suffer the pitfalls I described because canon didnt do the heavy lifting for them.

As for talking about slash without judgement, I'm a proponent of "if your ship, fic, or idea sucks, I'm gonna tell you." I cant help it, I dont judge you for liking it, I like Femslash, I'm a hypocrite, but I will gladly tell you what is wrong with your fic/ship/idea, granted I try to do it in a constructive fashion.

**** The “slash is garbage” is correct as long as you acknowledge most het is poorly written garbage.You are objectively wrong by saying ALL slash is a dom/sub fantasy.

***** 100% agree with this, I started out with a het pairing and after reading all the good ones, I had a hard time trying to read new ones that seemed reasonably decent, so I stumbled on a slash pairing and suddenly had a whole new slew of great fics to read, sure I came across a few crappy ones and figured out what my threshold was, but any pairing can have fics that can be good or bad regardless of what the pairing actually is

** Snape/Anyone for any reason but especially Harry: even ignoring the age gap and generally shitty and abusive treatment that Snape gives Harry at every opportunity, he has creepy obsessions with both of his parents that colour every interaction the two every have. What even is the appeal? As for literally everyone else, he's a terrible person and any romantic partner would suffer for it.

Harry or Hermione (or really any of the protagonists, but those are the who get shipped the most, so here we are) with any blood purist: I shouldn't have to explain this. That shipping a character who believes that people with muggle ancestry are subhuman with people with muggle ancestry (or someone without it but who knows better) is stupid and incredibly fucked up should be self-evident. That hasn't stopped me from running into multiple 100K+ Hermione/Bellatrix stories.

Hermione/Malfoy: this gets a special mention because he's actively wished death on her because of her blood status since he was twelve. Maybe he became less of a scumbag in his adult years, but Hermione has no reason to give him the time of day.

Harry/Malfoy: again, special mention despite having broadly covered it already, this time because it's so bloody ubiquitous. Malfoy is a horrible person, and while Harry did some questionable shit over the course of the series, he's a fundamentally decent human being. The two are not compatible.

Harry/Hermione: I don't enjoy it and I don't see the appeal. I don't begrudge anyone for liking it, but I personally do not.

Harry/Ron: admittedly, this is a bit of a guilty pleasure. I prefer them as friends, but their dynamic is fun and the relationship being romantic doesn't detract from that, so I can live with it.

Harry/a version of Ginny who hasn't grown out of her crush: gross. Also tedious. Develop your characters, please.

Harry/old-snakeman Voldemort: gross. Gross on every conceivable level. And on some levels of which humanity can't conceive.

Harry/young, sexy Voldemort: honestly somehow even worse. With these you tend to get authors who seem to genuinely believe that it's a healthy relationship. If Harry and Riddle are in character, it's not. If they aren't, there's no point.

I believe I have exhausted my vitriol. Didn't know I had a finite amount, actually.

*** I agree with you on most these, I like Harmony simply because as a kid I always assumed they would. Until Half Blood Prince happened, I assumed there either wouldnt be any actual long term relationships, or Harry and Hermione would get together because Ron has the emotional range of a teaspoon.

** I'm not sure I'd go as far as calling it my most hated ship (mostly because hating something requires an emotional intensity that I lack), but the one I dislike the most is basically Snape/Anyone. The guy's basically a proto-incel who never got over his childhood crush on Lily Evans, nor the self-inflicted destruction of their friendship in their mid teens.
