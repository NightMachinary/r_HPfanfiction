Looking for A story where Harry is stuck in A time Loop similar to doom day. At some point in the story Luna is somewhere she normally isn't asking for a kiss from harry for practice but she isn't aware of the time loop as in she doesn't have all her memories from previous time loops. She knows a time Loop is happening though.

******* Yes but it is not the one i'm looking for i know doom day is somewhat similar in that respect. There is more than one version of a story you know.

  Harry and Hermione approached a distraught Luna after the Battle of Hogwarts. They made her a promise to not abandon her, a promise that turns out to be more than they bargained for. Will they come up with a way to fix things before they all go loopy? Time loop, long loops. HP/HG
