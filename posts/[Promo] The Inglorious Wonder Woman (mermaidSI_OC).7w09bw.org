** Could you perhaps say something about it. Because that's what a promotion usually includes.

*** I'm basically advertising for a friend's story! Her protagonist is a magical creature (mermaid) and I think the story follows her journey to understanding where she fits into the world, as she eventually goes to Hogwarts and gets embroiled into the stories of other characters. The first chapter/introduction is a set-up of how the mermaid came to be, and the next three chapters focus on her entry into the wizarding world and who exactly becomes her new family. I'd say bulelo writes really, really well and has some really unique characterization, including minor or secondary characters who I didn't think much about until now. Please check it out, thanks.

  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now. [mermaid!SI/OC, many odd couples]
