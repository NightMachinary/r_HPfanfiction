Ginny retains the parseltongue ability from diary, and Harry and Ginny have conversations back and forth. I can imagine Hermione being annoyed about not being able to understand what they were talking about. I don't know of any fics like.


** My first thought was this reminded me of Seventh Horcrux and Prince of Slytherin.

More seriously though, I think she retains the ability in Rise of an Alpha. She and Harry are part of a different trio as i recall.

** This happens in a soul bond fic I vaguely remember reading. They're good friends and use parseltongue to talk. It was decent, I think?
