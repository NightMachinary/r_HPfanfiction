** It's very unique, one of the most unique fanfictions I've ever read, but it's not really my type.

Nevertheless, good luck with your writing OP!

*** Oh, I know the Dragon!Harry genre isn't really the most popular of genres. I just thought it would be fun.

Truth be told, I don't usually write stuff as warm and fluffy as I'm expecting this to be, so it's rather outside my usual genre too. But my muse is in a giving mood, so I must write. üôÇüëçüèª

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?
