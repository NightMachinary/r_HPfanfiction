Harry realizes during his trial for 'under' age magic use in the fifth book that he should be technically 'of age' from the triwizard tournament. Deciding to go for broke he interrupts stating that as the winner of the tournament at least he should be considered 'of age'.


** Fudge then decides to also trial Harry for Cedric's death, and as Lucius Malfoy has the Wizengamot in his pocket, Harry gets sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss the next morning.

** At the start of OotP, Fudge was using every means at his disposal to attack Harry and Dumbledore. I'm pretty sure he abused his power when he forced the whole Wizengamot to gather for something as simple as a minor using magic, and he played dirty when he changed the date and place of the Trial without warning Harry and Dumbledore.

Harry being considered "of age" may erase the accusations that he used Magic as a Minor, but he would still be accused of Breaking the Statute of Secrecy by using Magic in front of a Muggle. And Fudge would probably used the fact that he is "legally" an adult to give him a harsher sentence, like a stay in Azkaban.

Also, it's a detail that can be ignored for this prompt, but in canon, Harry didn't become "of Age" when he was entered in the Tournament. The "Age Line" was only put by Dumbledore (with the agreement of the other organizers) as a precaution to reduce the risk of deaths during the Tournament, but it is not directly linked (both magically and legally) to the Tournament itself. Like, Harry (or any other minor) should not have been able to enter his name in the Goblet, but once it's entered, the Goblet doesn't care about the Age of the candidate, only its abilities.

**** Dudley is "only" a cousin to Harry, it is not impossible that, when the Statute was passed, only the parents and siblings were considered as family. But that's not the point.

Fudge want to put Harry in trouble, and is more than willing to be dishonest to do so, and ignore any element that does not fit his narrative. I mean, in canon, when he saw that the jury was going to declare Harry innocent, his first reflex had been to try to attack Harry on his accidental magic back in PoA, even though he was the one who cleared Harry of all charges at that time. And let's not talk about Umbridge, who was the first to call Harry a liar when he talked about Dementors, even though she was the one who sent them against him.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
