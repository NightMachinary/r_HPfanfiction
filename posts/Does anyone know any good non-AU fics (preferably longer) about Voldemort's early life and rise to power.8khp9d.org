I have been looking for a while now for a good fic about Tom Riddle's time in Hogwarts or between his graduation and the First War which focuses on his growth from an orphan boy into one of the most powerful wizards in England. There are a couple of fics out there but they all present Tom as the darkest wizard from the moment he steps into Hogwarts and all the pureblood privileged kids choose to follow this orphan nobody for reasons not clearly explained... these types of fics are a major turn off for me.

I would like to read something where Tom's evolution happens a little bit more naturally, where he needs to make use of his charisma, affinity for magic and intelligence to rise to power and only gradually discovers his interest in the dark arts.

I would also like to stay away from stories where one of the main series characters travels back in time and makes Tom fall in love or stuff like that but I am willing to overlook that if the story is really well written and romance is not the (only) major plot.

I would really appreciate it if anyone knew a story that fits my description above and would be willing to share the title.

Thank you!


** It's not really what you're looking for, as it's short, generally deals with pre-hogwarts, and (!) is an Avengers crossover. But it is canon-compliant, and I suspect you will enjoy it if you haven't read it before.

That might hold you while people come up with better responses.
