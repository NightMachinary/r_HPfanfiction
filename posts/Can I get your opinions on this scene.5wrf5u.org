Backstory, this is the sequel to a story I'm working on. Harry hunted this child kidnapper/killer, culminating in James being taken. He finds the perpetrator just as he's completing a ritual to send him back in time. It required the life of one child for every year he wanted to go back. Harry disrupted the ritual by jumping in the circle, but it was too late. The perp kills James and he and Harry get sent back in time. The sequel starts there. As the identity of the perp is a surprise in the first story, I have replaced his name with X here. (Also made some edits based on suggestions)

Souls in Reverse

"Harry Potter!" Harry's eyes snapped open, but they were unseeing. James. His darling boy. His sweet, innocent child. "Harry Potter!" The call came louder but he ignored it. Someone was jabbing at his side but he paid no mind. Then, suddenly, he heard another voice, clear as day.

"X, are you okay?" X. X. The man who killed James. The MONSTER who killed James. The-the

"BASTARD!" Harry roared, zeroing in on X, who took one look and leaped to his feet, wand already in hand. "X! I'm going to kill you, you bastard!" Without thinking he flung a severing hex that X blocked with a bookbag, the spell slicing it clean in half at neck level. Around them, people screamed and Harry took the opportunity to vault over the benches to chase after X, who had taken off out of the hall. He didn't even dodge the spells thrown over the bastard's shoulder, just summoned things in their paths, never breaking stride. "Come back here X! You're going to pay, you monster!" A harsh jab of his wand toward the floor and the stone rippled like a tidal wave toward X. With but a glance backward, the man-turned child transfigured the stone wave into a wall of ice so thick Harry couldn't see through to the other side.

Still, he didn't slow down as he launched a series of bludgeoners that shattered a hole in the ice. That was followed by a banisher that shot the ice shards forward, barely missing X who rounded a corner just in time. Harry snarled and took the corner at a full run, slipping on the ice and ricocheting off the wall. He caught sight of X's robe disappearing up a staircase and tore after him for a few steps. Then he noticed how X shimmered and growled in anger, spinning away from the illusion to track down the original. Upon turning, he blocked a piercing hex to the chest and responded with a sweeping flame spell that melted the stone in its path. A conjured tornado swept up the flame and Harry hastily removed the air in the area to snuff it out, throwing up a barrier to block a barrage of molten arrows.

"Give up, X!" He demanded, a summoning charm on the man's robe sending him lurching forward. X dispelled the charm and threw up a hasty barrier ward between them in an attempt to slow him down. Harry tore through it like paper and was about to follow when in a burst of flame, he was surrounded by teachers.

"Stupefy!" They cried as one. Harry gave a primal scream of rage, magic struggling to fight off the effects of the spell even as he raised his wand once more. He looked around, vision darkening, and caught sight of X hiding behind another teacher. He pushed one last burst of magic through the wand, the effort disrupting his attempt to resist the stunners.

"Sectumsempra!"

#+end_quote

The only thing that bothers me is the repetition of "bastard". I think if you cut out the repeat, it reads better. I'd also cut out the repetition of "x" in that paragraph.

*** The X in Harry's dialogue is the perp's last name and in the description it's his first. Does that make it better?

*** Oh yeah. Or as Dumbledore thinks, possessed by Voldemort. After all, Harry Potter doesn't know sectumsempra. But a death eater would (maybe. If Snape taught it to anyone)

** This is really great, I would love to read more. Poor Harry, everyone must think he has gone completely psycho. It would be very interesting to see his friends and teachers reactions. Also how Harry reacts to traveling back and seeing all the people who died again.
