I love Sirius Black, or at least Canon Sirius Black. He's very complex, he's shown as patient, being impatient, being kind, being cruel, doing stupid stuff, being very smart, being cautious, being reckless. Et cetra.

But with fanfiction it's: Sirius is a womanizer, "Be serious! I am Sirius" stupid pun, Sirius calling Professor McGonagall Minnie, Sirius hating authority figures, which from canon he doesn't at all. He's often written as stupid as well, just plain stupid, even though he helped creator the Marauders Map, became a Animagus to help Remus during the full moon.

He's incredibly loyal as well, in my mind he's a lot like Harry, thinking of his friends as family, instead of his actual family, he's also good at judging a person's character, which thinking of his friends as family, and a good judge of character, are probably reasons why Peter's betrayal stung, because he didn't see it coming.

He's also often seen as a womanizer, which I understand is probably because he spent 12 years in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, as well as spend like 2 years on the run afterwards, so authors want him to have some sort of fun, even though I personally don't consider him a womanizer, myself.

So yeah; it all boils down to: What are some of your favorite characterizations in different stories?

It can be set in the Marauder Era, the Golden Trio Era or beyond.

Bonus points if he ends up living, instead of dying, and getting a trial.

I'd rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

He doesn't have to be the main character, he can be a side or minor character, I just want a really interesting Sirius Black, then what we normally seem to get in stories.

It can be on fanfiction.net or any other site. I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femslash as well.


** The Black Sheep Dog series by izzythehutt linkao3(14800721) linkao3(15457248) has my favourite characterization of Sirius and the Black family as well.

The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety.

** For me Sirius has been a character, at least in the beginning, that is stuck living in the past. He gets out after being imprisoned for 12 years, and the whole world has changed. Most of his family, even though he didn't like them, are dead and half his friends are dead and he wants one of his other friends dead.

Canonically Harry loves him because this is another link to his parents and someone who actually cares about him and could be a guardian, but I think it would be interesting to explore the opposite in fanfiction. What if Harry doesn't like that link to his parents and Sirius just reminds him of pain instead of happiness. I think it would be interesting to see a conflict there and either Sirius or Harry would change if they wanted to keep their relationship or if they grow apart. Sirius is definitely a complex character for sure.

** I really liked Fractured Skies by Orphan Account - it features a deaf Sirius and the way signing is portrayed seems to really capture the poetry of the language. The story beautifully conveys the challenges of living on the fringe ... the otherness (not just Sirius, but also Lupin). Also, I loved how the Marauder's story was made mundane (not magical) with links to the original stories woven in. It is slash and has a sequel that is also good.

** Ok Sirius is one if my favorites, so hopefully you'll enjoy some of these!

linkao3(5986366) *Face Death in the Hope* where Harry time travels after getting hit by AK in DH, saves Regulus from the inferi and they go about destroying horcruxes two decades early. Sirius is a side character in this, but the writing of his and Regulus' relationship is excellent.

linkao3(11914698) *renascienta: from the ashes* is the first in a regularly updated series about Regulus, who did not die and instead hid in France until Voldemort is resurrected. One of my fave fics. POV switches between Regulus and Sirius primarily, but there are occasional other POVs as well. This is another fic that depicts Regulus' and Sirius' relationship very well. The authors also have a collection of oneshots called renascienta: between the lines that have several Sirius stories.

linkao3(20097676) *My Sun Sets to Rise* where Sirius has a preview of other realities after he falls through the Veil. Sirius/Remus pairing.

ficao3(12559768) *The Truth in Potions* is an AU and deals with the truth potions Sirius has taken throughout his life. Sirius/Remus pairing.

ficao3(14074770) *In the language of flowers* is an AU where Petunia is a witch and Lily is a muggle. Petunia/Sirius pairing, which works far better than you'd think.

ficao3(10869537) *The Marauder's Wagers* is a light hearted fic about the Marauders betting on quidditch. It's the first in a series called /The Rise and Fall of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,/ the stories in this series fall along the range of funny to quite dark.

And this rec won't work with the bot. It's called *Shifts,* and it's about Remus working undercover as a history teacher at Smeltings to keep Dudley safe during OotP. The story is quite old, and was written before HBP, so there are some inconsistencies (Sirius' mother's name isn't Walburga and Remus was bitten by someone other than Greyback), but despite that the characterization is very very good! It has a sequel without Sirius set during HBP, and sequel series on AO3 about Teddy Lupin. [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1]]

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

  Petunia drips magic the way she drips anger. Sparingly. Subtly. Nothing overt or obnoxious. Nothing that attracts the stares of other children or the suspicion of adults. Just things that help her. Her dolls line back up after the football Lily was kicking about ruins their perfect symmetry. Her bed makes itself while she brushes her teeth meticulously.

  So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.

  Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

** I'm 82 chapters into a Draco time travel story (It's called A Slytherin Through Time and can be found on FFN). It starts in third year and Draco and Neville find Sirius in the forest rather early during the year. Most stories I've read are either bashing Sirius and the Marauders and worshipping Snape or the other way around, I tried to avoid both. I struggled for a long time with the dichotomy you describe. Being smart but also doing incredibly stupid stuff. Being kind and cruel. For the longest time I struggled with the werewolf “prank” because I honestly couldn't see what Sirius wanted to accomplish with that aside from killing or turning Snape and subsequently getting Remus expelled or worse. But then I concluded that he is just super short-sighted. So I've written Sirius as smart but incredibly short sighted and impulsive. Not thinking of the consequences of his actions. Thus the werewolf prank isn't cruel or stupid anymore. It's just the result of someone not thinking of the consequences of an action. That's how I mostly explain his contradictory behavior.

Sirius does get a trial in my story and eventually (but that's really about 80 chapters in) even gets along with Snape. The story isn't finished yet, but it's close to, and believe me, after 3 years and 82 chapters I most certainly won't abandon it.

An excerpt:

"Why do you hate him so much?" Draco asked.

[...]

"I assume you have heard what Potter said... I nearly died during my time at school. It was due to a prank," he snorted at the last word, "Black played on me."

"What did he do?" Draco asked, anger creeping into his voice.

"He goaded me into the Shrieking Shack during a full moon," Snape replied coolly.

"Lupin," Draco gasped, realization dawning on him.

"That would be correct," Snape nodded his head.

"But- that's- Why didn't he get expelled?" Draco asked, feeling rightful indignation on his godfather's behalf.

Snape shrugged his shoulders. "It wasn't the only thing he did, but definitely the most relevant for my dislike towards him."

"But that was attempted murder!" Draco felt anger surge through him as his body tensed. "Once I have saved Sirius' ass from the Dementors, I'll give it a solid kick," Draco growled. For a few seconds, Draco was really mad on his godfather's behalf, but his anger was also mingled with confusion. Sirius could be an idiot, but a murderer? But hadn't he wanted to kill Pettigrew, his mind supplied. But then Draco thought about Sirius' impulsive behavior, the time he just appeared in his room over Christmas... his shoulders slumped, as he realized that that was just who Sirius was.

"Sir, I don't think he meant to kill you," Draco carefully began, knowing that defending Sirius might upset his godfather. "He is... just an idiot, he can't help it. A huge, bullheaded, intolerant idiot, but still."

Snape raised his eyebrows in surprise. "I thought, after trying to help him for over a semester, you would be fonder of him."

"Oh, I do like him," most of the time, Draco mentally added, "but he is an idiot. He never thinks anything through. He only thinks short-term, never long-term. And he is very impulsive. Typical Gryffindor, really. Got me in trouble a lot although I'm sure he didn't mean to. It is not that he did not care that I could get into trouble - or even get killed... He just... didn't think about it. It never even crossed his mind that his actions might have consequences. So, although his behavior towards you is inexcusable, and I will give him a piece of my mind once all of this is over, I don't think he actually meant for anything truly bad to happen to you. He probably didn't fully grasp the consequences his actions might have."

Snape considered this for a while.

"You know," Draco continued, "it might seem like a clever assassination attempt to a Slytherin, but a Gryffindor is just not capable to come up with such a cunning plan."

Draco thought he couldn't believe his eyes, when something close to a smile tucked at his godfather's lips. "Perhaps," he said, amused. "What kind of trouble did he get you in?"

"Tons," Draco frowned. "I didn't invite him to stay at my place over Christmas, he was just suddenly there! He never thought about how much trouble I would be in if someone found him. Or that my parents would have killed him - and then me - without a second thought had they found him in my room. And the Polyjuice thing -- obviously not my idea, either. I very nearly died of a heart attack when you visited us... And when he just broke into Gryffindor tower... without any kind of plan and a freakin' knife, I thought I would kill him myself."

Snape chuckled. "I can see what you mean."

"Honestly, I think the reason he didn't get sorted into Slytherin wasn't because he wanted to defy his family or any such thing, but because he possesses none of the qualities we value... But he is loyal. And brave. And smart -- I mean, he broke out of Azkaban and he became an Animagus, after all. These are not easy things to do. And he didn't do them for selfish reasons either. And he defied his family even though that meant they would throw him out and disown him. He can be a bully and an idiot... and he might need to see a mind healer... but he does have his good qualities as well-"

The thing that sucks is that I absolutely love the Marauders, but I also love Snape as well, and like you said, many either sing praises to the Marauders and bash Snape, or praise Snape and bash on the Marauders.
