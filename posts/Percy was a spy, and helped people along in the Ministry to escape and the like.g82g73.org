As it says. Looking for stories where Percy was actually a spy, rather Dumbledore's or his own, and ended up helping people on the inside, being a good person.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing.

Anyone can be the main character, it can be on ANY site, can have ANY warnings, can be ANY length.

Would rather not have character bashing, if at all possible.

No Lord Potter, Harem Harry or super smart Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable. (He doesn't even have to be in the story).

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

  They don't talk about what Percy did during the war.

** The Scarlet Pimpernel by AMarguerite

It's been taken down from the regular sites, but there's a PDF [[http://redhen-publications.com/pimpernel.html][here]] or a PasteBin of the text [[https://pastebin.com/cmQ7Ubcp][here]]

Percy focused, covering the time he's at the ministry, and it definitely hits "helping people on the inside, being a good person"!

Percy is spying on the Ministry, and works /with/ Harry. It goes into the super-smart Harry territory, but it's believable. No bashing (not if you read the whole thing).

Abandoned.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
