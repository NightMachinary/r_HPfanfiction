No Quirrelldemort or any romance involving Voldemort.


** Wouldn't we be getting the textual equivalent of a black screen for, like, 95% of the story with one incident of eating snowballs to the face and one incident of painfully dying?

It would be like the canon second triwiz challange written from a spectator's PoV, or at least have lots of boring canon repetition.
