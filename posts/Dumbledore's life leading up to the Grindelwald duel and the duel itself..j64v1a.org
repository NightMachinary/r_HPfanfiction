*CHAPTER 1*

*ALBUS*

Godrics Hollow, an ancient place full of rich history and deep magical roots, home to many famous witches and wizards. It is here that we happen across a humble two-story house located on a small hill, under the shade of a magnificent red maple tree, away from the rest of the village. Some people wondered if this house was built as if though to be hidden from prying eyes and they were not wrong. This was the home of the Dumbledore's. 

Albus Dumbledore was sitting in his study reading the Daily prophet when the door opened loudly.

“We need to talk” said Aberforth, The youngest of the remaining members of the Dumbledore's.

“Of course we do” sighed Albus, “and in your haste to talk about this pressing matter, you forgot to knock, I assume” 

Just a preview of what I've been writing, I'm thinking 5 Chapters leading into the duel. This will not be related to the movies at all, I'm not following the Fantastic Beasts story line. This will focus more on Albus and a bit about the Magical world as Rowling intended, going with the canon timeline according to the books. Will introduce some new characters.
