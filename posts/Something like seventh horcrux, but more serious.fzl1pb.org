*** This one is quite good. Tom often has his agency stripped from him, but that's because he's not yet grown into his power like Voldemort has, but he doesn't consciously consider this and keeps overestimating himself. The first part of this fic is also copied straight from canon, so it doesn't make much sense and is of much lower quality than the rest of the work.

**** Yeah, he's powerful, but not nearly as powerful as he thinks he is, which gets him into some bad situations. I figured this fit OP's request reasonably enough, since it's a vold-horcrux-becomes-MC story. And it's a good story!

Ever thought about expanding your bot to post HP links too?

****** Oh, I wouldn't know. But it's mighty convenient in the other sub. I think I've seen people summon the bot here just with the title of the fic, so maybe it isn't necessary.

By the way, since you seem to be well-versed in the topic, what are your favorite HP and Worm fanfics?

I always enjoy crossovers. Are you aware of any fics that bring a character from Worm or HP into the real world? I've only ever seen one, where a guy gets Bonesaw's power.

******* Hmm, just HP and Worm? Let me get out some of the ones I've enjoyed...

*Worm*

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/][A Bad Name]] is a gamer-fic done well. The game layer is actually explored as the protagonist progresses, and it actually shows character growth when it's linked to an improving intelligence stat.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/compulsion-worm-prototype.821228/][Compulsion]] is a relatively new story, and is a crossover with a setting I'm unfamiliar with, called Prototype. It's high-quality, intriguing, and switches between two perspectives. Taylor's actions aren't wildly OC like in many fics, and the Case 53 might be an SI, but reading his point of view doesn't make me roll my eyes.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-star-trek.787978/][Companion Chronicles]] follows the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Jumpchain][Jumpchain]] format, except done from the perspective of a companion instead of the original Jumper, and with a focus on characters more than obtaining the next Super Cool Power™.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/leaf-worm-stormlight-archive.790009/unread][Leaf]] is a crossover with the Stormlight Archive. If you don't know what that is or who Leaf is, the narrative provides the answers. The dialogue here is great, and the character interactions and development are top-notch.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shard-flight-worm-warcraft.793426/][Shard Flight]] brings Earth Bet in contact with the world of Warcraft. There isn't much content here yet, but it's a fun read and Taylor is a huge dragon.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/agent-of-cauldron-worm.345669/][Agent of Cauldron]] explores the wider world, and really brings up what Cauldron stands for. High-quality writing, but if you prefer street-level shenanigans it's probably not for you.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/copacetic-worm.283578/][Copacetic]] follows Taylor from where Worm left off. Well-written, character-focused, and shows how you can't be where she was and just go back to normal. Not for long.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/][El-Ahrairah]] is like Agent of Cauldron, but crossed with a lot of the elements in the latter half of HPMOR. I highly recommend this if you liked HPMOR.

*Harry Potter*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11666799/47/Minato-Namikaze-and-the-Destroyer-of-Worlds][Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds]] is crack of the best sort. In fact, pretty much everything by this author is amazing. This one is a crossover with Naruto, but you don't need to know anything about that setting to enjoy it. I didn't. This fic starts with a whole lot of ridiculousness, but then some of those absurdist elements stop being played for laughs and are actually investigated. This feels in places like a mix between one of Lovecraft's works and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], which I also recommend.

For the rest of these, I'm going to present without explanation as this takes a bit of time.

******** Thank you so much for these! I've read a few from each list, but I'll definitely check out the rest.

Here are a few of my favorite HP fanfics, as I'm sure you're already familiar with the Worm ones:

Seventh Horcrux was mentioned above, and Black Comedy is too famous for you not to be aware of.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom has Dark Lord Tom Riddle ruling the WW and mentoring Harry.

HP & Prince of Slytherin takes all the lamest tropes and reconstructs them to make sense in a story that's really fantastic.

Pureblood Pretense has the MC switch places w her pureblood cousin so she can become a potions prodigy under Snape (an HP version of Alana the Lioness, a YA series). This one gets really into potions theory and innovation, which is cool.

Hogwarts Battle School is basically the first half of Ender's Game with Snape as headmaster, in a world trying to prep for V's return.

In the Bleak Midwinter has Hermione go back in time to raise baby Tom Riddle Jr. along with his muggle dad, who pretends to be a wizard w the help of a house elf, and joins pureblood society and introduces muggle innovations.

Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is a hilarious story about a DnD wizard transported to the HP-verse. One of the very best fanfics out there, IMO.

Wait, What? is a series of little snippets that take situations from canon and explore the horrifying implications of them.

And you already mentioned Blood Crest and Imposter Complex.

Being who you are, I trust you'll have no trouble finding links :)

********* Many of these are neat, yeah. :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Natural 20]], I'm just waiting until it's done to pick it back up where I dropped it. The one I have problems with is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], which contains a lot of very dated humor. From an earlier comment I made:

#+begin_quote
  I wish this was good. The writing itself is pretty average, nothing to complain about, and it had a neat hook. I dropped it after a bunch of little plots were thrown out there and then never spoken of again. Also, along the way, there were some really iffy ‘jokes' that boil down to just being bigotry, really. You know, sexism and suchlike. It's really overt too.

********** I haven't read it in probably a decade, so that wouldn't surprise me. I don't remember if it was this one or not, but one fic I read a long time ago kept referring to a young wizard (either Sirius or Regulus or an OC) from that family as "the Black boy" and "the Black wizard" which... yikes. An author wouldn't call Harry, "the Potter wizard" so it was definitely intentional.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.
