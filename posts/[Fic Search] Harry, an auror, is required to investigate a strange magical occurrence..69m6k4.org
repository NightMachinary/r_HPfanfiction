From what I remember, Harry is ordered to investigate some magical phenomena. In his searching, he stays with Daphne Greengrass, who was some sort of child carer? They discover that she has some ability to do with sleep?

Harry and Daphne are then taken by a race of creatures they are descended from, where they stay. The story then goes into Harry's past, talking about his mother and father with some swords that were sworn enemies? The story culminates with some conflict in the Department of Mysteries?

Sorry if this is complete nonsense; It's a story I suddenly remembered out of the blue today, and I've been trying to find it to reread.


** Is it linkffn(Unatoned by SeriousScribble) ? I haven't read it yet but it is in my list and, from the description, it seems to match

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

*** I gave the ending a quick flick through - it doesn't seem like it, the last two chapters are very different to what I remember.

***** Yeah, it was completed. I'm not sure if it was categorised has a Harry/Daphne story. The pairing wasn't the main focus of the story.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?
