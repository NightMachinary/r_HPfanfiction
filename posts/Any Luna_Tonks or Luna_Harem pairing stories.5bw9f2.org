I love Luna. Shes by far one of the more enjoyable characters to read (and write im sure) about in fan fiction in my opinion. I also think it would be absolutely hilarious if she was paired with Tonks.

So, I am looking for any stories that have Luna/Tonks paired. They dont necessarily have to be exclusive to each other, or even be the main couple, but they do need to play a significant role in the story and interact in doing so while being paired in some fashion.

In addition I would be curious about any Luna/Harem stories. That is to say, where shes in control (or similar).

  They're so different that Tonks doesn't understand why it works, but somehow it does work.
