Irritated, impassioned and far from ready to take "No" for an answer, Harry marches himself up to Dumbledore's office and demands an explanation as to why he has to go back to the Dursley's. A specific one at that. Leaving the Headmasters office with the "Bond of blood charm" to research.

After it's discovery, despite being disconcerted at the requirements, Harry found himself knee deep in knowledge pertaining to blood magic and rituals. A branch of magic considered dark, morally suspect and even illegal in some instances. A branch of magic Harry desperately wanted to know more about, the results and possibilities blowing his mind.

But, despite his secrecy, Harry's candid and secret research was noted by an eagle eyed librarian (a woman who amusedly wondered if Potter thought he was the first to use an invisibility cloak to get into the Restricted Section). Now, her job as librarian was to kick him out, but her... other employers would be quite displeased that she was stunting the development of a potential blood mage. Especially one (from her investigations into Harry beyond her domain in the library) who was showing an unnaturally high aptitude for it.

Thus Madam Pince sent of a letter and kept an intrigued eye on the boy.

The summer of 1994 begins roughly for Harry, the Boy Who Lived separate from magic once again and very much dreading Aunt Marge's imminent arrival.

Until Vernon roars that a letter had arrived for him, a letter that had come the Muggle way. Fancy stationary, envelope sealed with wax, very fancy. Dubiously skimmed at first before truly engrossing the soon to be thirteen year old.

The writer was a man named Klaus von Reinherz, the head of the noble house of Reinherz, an American who had been made aware of his talent for blood magic and wished to develop it further. He was offering an all expenses trip to a little known city called Hellsalem's Lot and an apprenticeship in the man's organisation (for at least the summer).

Years on, Harry would wonder if his acceptance of the offer was a good thing or a colossal mistake...
