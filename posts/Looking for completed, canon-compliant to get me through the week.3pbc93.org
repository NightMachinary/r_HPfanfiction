Hey, I'm a working grad student surviving on only a couple hours of sleep a night, and this semester is especially rough. I would like something to read on the bus or in between classes. I have two requirements: completed and canon-compliant. Particularly in the mood for something a little more light-hearted. Like romance or family humor. Here is a list of my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2728200/silverfirelizard53][favorite stories]].

*** That one is way too dark.

Since Harry was drooling over Ginny's dot on Marauder's Map for hours each night, he would completely freak out if Ginny got dragged into the dungeon with the Carrows every night for two weeks, and they would never ever name their child 'Albus Severus'.

**** You think A Call to Arms is too dark?? I've always considered it a nice alternative to the ever popular yet seriously disturbing DAYD.

That's a good point about Harry watching over Ginny's dot, though. I hadn't thought of how he would react.

***** In addition to drooling over Ginny's dot, Harry and Hermione 'interrogated' Phineas Nigellus Black's portrait at least twice a week during that two months alone period, so they should have a pretty good idea about what was happening at Hogwarts. The most they could get out about Ginny was that she was not allowed to go to Hogsmeade. Even then, Harry was itching to go back to Hogwarts to join the rebellion.

As for DAYD, the characters were so OOC and plot so implausible (Krum saving Neville from the execution chamber, WTF?!), I don't even bother to take it as 'canon' at all.
