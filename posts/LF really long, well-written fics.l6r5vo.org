hi everyone! i just finished ATYD and am emotionally devastated but it was beautiful and so well-written i'm looking for a follow up. ideally, something really long (400k+ words) with writing on par or close to ATYD. i love wolfstar and drarry or maybe 7th year from ginny's POV (i've already read “not from others”).

(i've also already read “the debt of time” so that's off the table.)

something M or E rated though, please :)

thank you!!


** Hello! I have so many long, well written fics that I hunted out after reading ATYD so hopefully these will help.

linkao3(The Second String) - An adventure story where Harry ends up back in 1978 and falls into the war in his own way. Its absolutely incredible, i laughed, cried, was so tense. Brilliant brilliant story!!

​

linkao3(Dress Up In You by MsKingBean89) - You'll recognise the author =P. Its a muggleAU but with a similar ATYD wolfstar. Its adorable and brilliantly written.

​

linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian) - Everything by this author is just fantastic. They capture Remus and Sirius brilliantly and really open the world. Its a bit of Black Family things, bit of introspections, bit of mystery. Just overall incredible author. They can sometimes be dark.

​

linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) - This took me a minute to get into but I really enjoyed it by the end. Its a look into the 12 years between 1981 and PoA. It reminded me a lot of Remus/Grant/Sirius, those chapters of ATYD but its a much darker backstory and Sirius is a lot more interesting I suppose! High Rec!

If you want something completely different and very very dark M/E rating then linkao3(Manacled by senilyu) was brilliantly written but holy shit did I have to read a lot of fluff afterwards! Fantastically written story thats basically a Handmaids Tale inspired post war fic. Really tense, really dramatic, very gorey and harsh and dark please be careful. But i thoroughly enjoyed it!

I have a whole chunk more if you like? Just give me an era/style you fancy and I'll see what I can do =)

#+begin_quote
  A complete re-write of Book Seven:(mostly Hermione-centric, features other character POVs, and Harmony is the main pairing - though this fic is about more than just their relationship, it is a story about the war)‘So why are you still here?' Harry asked Ron.‘Search me,' said Ron.‘Go home then,' said Harry.‘Yeah, maybe I will!' shouted Ron, and he took several steps towards Harry, who did not back away...What could have happened between Harry and Hermione in the Deathly Hallows after Ron leaves.This story mostly follows canon but provides a different look at how the relationships in HP could have formed had Hermione realized that she and Ron did not fit well together and that Harry, her best friend, was really what she was looking for the whole time. Includes added subplots and a gritty and realistic view on the war.[Updates on Sundays +/- a few days. Things are crazy right now but I'm still trying for biweekly]**NOTE: this fic contains mature content, explicit language and is dark in nature. PLEASE READ THE TAGS**

** I hope you're still looking for recommendations! I saved this on mobile a month ago hoping to come back when I had time. Sadly, none of these are either Drarry or Wolfstar, except one. I have some in both those fandoms that I enjoy, but none that are over 400 thousand words.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is Drarry (hurrah!) but is only 373k words. That said! It is my absolute favorite fic of all time, 10/10 recommend, drop everything and read it now.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14454174][Manacled]] is a pretty heavy read. It's inspired by the Handmaid's Tale but set in wizarding Britain. It's 30k words short of your minimum, but I'd still recommend it.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072][A Year Like None Other]] is an oldie but a goodie. It was originally posted in 2004, so pre-horcrux, I believe. I've enjoyed it enough to reread it multiple times over the past 15 years. Anyway, on to the summary. Harry gets an unexpected letter from home that changes his life forever.
- Harry is too young in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296][Blood Crest]] to have a relationship, but it is 472k words and regularly updated. As a child, Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer.
- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214][Animagus-Verse]] is long and pretty regularly updated. In a fit of accidental magic, Harry turns himself into an Animagus. The world building in this one is great
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is the most unique fic I've read in my 18 years in the fandom. I honestly don't even know where to start in summarizing it. Excellent writing; I've even read a sort of AU of this one that takes place in the Naruto universe. I've never even watched Naruto! It's 430k words and still updated regularly.
- Finally, I know this one is controversial, but there are frankly not that many great fics at this length. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] has a continuous plot and doesn't feel like a serial from the 19th century newspapers (i.e., no threads that are brought up and abandoned). If you don't like it by the tenth chapter, don't bother reading more

****** Fantastic! Here are some more favorites of mine:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. It is complete.
- A new favorite of mine is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]]. There is a potions accident that causes Harry to be deaged to the age of ten. Draco has to take care of him. This teaches Draco quite a lot about Harry's childhood that he wouldn't have otherwise known. I'm not super familiar with the de-aging trope, but I have heard that some fics use the concept to inappropriately pair characters of vastly different ages. That is NOT the case in this one.
- Actually, I've loved most things by the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/lettered/pseuds/lettered][Lettered]] (same as Away Childish Things). My favorites are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22062673][By the Grace]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2780708][Another Mask Behind You]] (which is kind of an odd rec here because there is SO MUCH sex right from the start, but Harry doesn't know who Draco is), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1343047][The Fall of the Veils]] (after war with Muggles and Draco is ace), and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392764][The Pure and Simple Truth]] (Slytherins and Gryffindors are all grown up and off to pubs in various combinations).
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15834660][Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)]] is a great, nuanced look at an ace character struggling to come to terms with his identity and learn how to set and maintain boundaries.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408/chapters/1947158][Stealing Harry]] is an AU wherein Sirius never went to Azkaban (for reasons explained in-text). Harry spends his days going to Sirius' bookshop until Sirius discovers canon-level abuse and steals Harry away. There are consequences. Sadly, the author is unfinished, but they got up to year 3, so I think it's still worth a read.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603][Blood Magic]] is another old classic and one of the original Severitus fics. Harry receives a letter from his parents on his sixteenth birthday revealing that Snape is his bio-dad (not an affair or a rape, like I've seen elsewhere; this was planned). It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]] will keep you busy! It is complete. The first story in the series has 162 chapters. The main canon divergence in this AU is that Harry fell in love with Potions.\\
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11547009/chapters/25929084][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. It is complete.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057][All Life is Yours to Miss]], the consequences of Malfoy's petty act of revenge force him to actually engage with the world around him. Trust me. He hates it too. It is complete.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]], Harry gets a glimpse of a world where he made different choices. It is Drarry and epilogue-compliant. Complete
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar]] is a series of "what if" rewrites of Harry Potter (e.g., What if Harry was a squib? What if Dudley was a wizard? What if Petunia had turned Harry away so he grew up at Hogwarts?)
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075][Reparations]], Harry is training to be a Healer and rotating through departments. He ends up in Chemical Dependence (basically rehab). An old rival is currently running the department and Harry is forced to face old wounds. It is complete
- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]] series is touching. I love characters working through complex emotions. It all starts with Harry helping Minerva to deliver a letter to #4 Privet Drive. It is complete.
- The November Tales series are two independent stories set in the same universe. You can read them in any order. I'd recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-Nine]] before [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21492193/chapters/51221617][26]], but that's how I read it so I'm biased ;) They are by my absolute favorite author. 29 is the story that made me realize that Percy could be interesting. Summary: A story about murder, the power of writing lists, the interest of the press, the politics of the Department of Magical Transportation and the struggle of being Percy Weasley. 26 is also just lovely. Both are complete.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/chapters/45935500][The Devil You Know]] is super fun. It is a dark comedy wherein Harry's Head Horcrux wakes up and gives him some truly interesting life advice. WIP
- I loved [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12959277/1/Paradox][Paradox]] (same author as Modern Romance, but a very different genre). It's got stabby Hermione from an alternate universe, dimension hopping to a universe where Grindelwald rules, and an engaging plot. What else could you want? It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]]: The story you never knew you wanted. The year: 1987. The place: Muggle London. The situation: The Boy-Who-Lived is being treated horribly by his Muggle relatives. A young witch must take him in for the Ministry's good and his. The witch's name: Dolores Umbridge. COMPLETE.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] is complete. In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right. Harry has to be crafty. He can't rely on his power to win.

I have to break this up into two replies because of the character limit.

****** Part 2/2

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is the most recommended fic on this sub for a reason. It strikes a fine balance: it has the setup for a crack fic but it also has actual plot.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] is a Snape/Harry mentor story. I like this one because Snape is still a bastard, but he's not the kind of bastard that can watch a kid get abused (canon levels) and do nothing. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25925863/chapters/63012685][Realizations]] was one of the first fics that got me in the fandom. The author dropped it ten years ago and is coming back to it this year and reworking it. It was originally published between book 5 and 6. WIP
- I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778006/1/Smoke-and-Mirrors][Smoke and Mirrors]] in ages, but I remember genuinely enjoying it. Basically, Harry is a street kid who grows up in Muggle gangs. (complete)
- Practically everyone has read this, but I would be remiss if I didn't include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. It is almost universally beloved for its wit and originality. It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] was mah fave back in the day. In an ultimate battle, Harry is sent back in time to the Marauders era. Hilarity does NOT ensue. It is complete and has a sequel

I hope at least a few of them strike your interest. Happy reading!
