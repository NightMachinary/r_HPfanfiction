Like maybe Hermione mentions them and happens to have brought the series to Hogwarts. Bonus points if Tolkien was a wizard (maybe under a pseudonym, maybe not) and he based Gandalf off of Dumbledore after his duel with Grindlewald established his prestige even higher.


** Also probably what you not looking for since it was only touched upon lightly, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/8/A-Long-Journey-Home][Ch8 Of A Long Journey Home!]] an (muggle) OC points out that Dumbledore looks like Gandalf and Dumbledore understanding since a muggleborn gifted him the books the prior year.

** Well, it's not a major plot point, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HPMOR]] Dumbledore is aware of LotR and Gandalf. See chapters 17 and 62.

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.
