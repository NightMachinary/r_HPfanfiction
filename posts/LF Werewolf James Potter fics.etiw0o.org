I know there are some fics where Snape gets bitten by Moony when Sirius sends him into the Shrieking Shack, but I does anyone know of fics where instead of (or alongside) Snape, it's James that gets bitten and turned?


** Bitten in the Moonlight is the only one I know. It's not perfect but it isn't too bad and I enjoyed it. It's set in 7th year and if I'm not mistaken continues after Hogwarts graduation.
