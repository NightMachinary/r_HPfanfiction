** "Harry is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will... something you know very little about. I once saw him kill three men in a bar... with a sugar quill, with a fucking sugar quill. Then suddenly one day he asked to leave. It's over a woman, of course. So I made a deal with him. I gave him an impossible task. A job no one could have pulled off. The bodies he buried that day laid the foundation of what we are now. And then my son, a few days after his wife died, you steal his broom and kill his fucking owl."

** A disguised Harry Potter walked along Knockturn Alley, his eyes scanning the crowd for Bellatrix Lestrange and any other potential threats. He'd already seen one watcher in the Alley, a Healer on the streets near Gringotts. She wore Healer robes and her badge identified her as a Healer in training, but what tipped him off was the lack of eyebags and bloodshot eyes. Harry knew that Healers in training worked long, arduous hours.

At least the presence of one watcher meant he was on the right track. Since the death of Hedwig he'd began systematically assassinating any Death Eaters he could track. Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry was stalled with the sudden deaths of his followers. At one point in time, he wondered if he was able to take a life. After Hedwig, he realized killing wasn't difficult if you believe you have a valid reason. She was his first gift, his faithful companion since he learned of magic and the fucking Death Eaters killed her.

He noted the second watcher in Knockturn as he continued to walk, a beggar on the streets who's stench didn't match the ragged quality of his clothes. The Death Eaters were becoming more paranoid with over half of them being killed, and were taking necessary precautions when out in the open. Harry fired a Confundus Charm at the man after he saw Bellatrix and four men emerge from Borgin and Burkes. The man hadn't recognized him but it never hurt to be too careful. His wand in hand, he advanced towards the group, casting an Anti-Apparition Spell.

Harry began firing Killing Curses towards the group, hoping to catch them by surprise. Two of the men were struck by the curses, but Bellatrix was able to conjure a physical shield in time. The curse shattered the shield, the debris turning into knives with a wave of her wand and was sent hurtling towards Harry who parried them with his Shield Charm.

Harry flicked his wand, casting the smokescreen spell, preventing the Death Eaters from gaining line of sight. Another flick of his wand and the smoke began to reform as Harry defended himself from the onslaught of curses. Soon, seven bronze lions stood in front of him, and on his command charged towards the group.

The nearest Death Eater was mauled by the lion while Bellatrix blasted two of the lions into pieces. The fallen Death Eater screamed as the lion tore into him, before it was blasted away by the other Death Eater. A jet of white light was sent towards Bellatrix who attempted to shield herself, but as the spell struck her shield, a blinding flash of light followed by an ear-splitting explosion staggered the remaining Death Eaters. The remaining bronze lions rushed towards the disoriented duo while Harry unleashed a volley of spells to overwhelm them. His last lion tore into the Death Eater while Bellatrix was caught with a Cutting Curse which struck her on her torso. Sirius Black, Frank and Alice Longbottom and many others were avenged as Bellatrix met her end as Harry executed her with the Killing Curse

Bellatrix could've been taken in for questioning for information on the remaining Death Eaters but Harry knew from Karkaroff's trial that Voldemort split his Death Eaters into cells to avoid exposure. And while this was a complication, it wasn't one that troubled Harry too much. Eventually, the Dark Lord would be dealt with, in the same manner that Harry had dealt with so many of his Death Eaters after Hedwig's death.

** Harry stood before the group of Death Eaters with a blank mask for a face. Ironically, this was the perfect counter to the pale monstrosity that the six of his opponents donned like Halloween costumes. Theirs inspired fear by way of knowledge - knowledge of who they were, - but his caused dread to spring forth in those who recognised the look alone; it was the look of a hunter stalking its prey, so focused and so determined upon the hunt that it had no time, no patience and no regard for the safety of those who dared to stand before it. It was the look of an animal poised to strike, not for sustenance and not for fun, but because they had dared to take its companion away. Yes, animals killed for revenge too. Harry was obeying the rules of nature now.

In comparison, the Death Eaters were pale beneath their paleness, trembling as they stood before the Green Ghost. It was said that the raw power of the killing curse flowed through his veins, that his blood-lust was so powerful he had absorbed the deadly magic even as an infant. It was whispered in circles high and low that those were Avada Kedavra beams that shone through his eyes, that he could kill with a single look if so desired.

/"I saw him, once upon a time,"/ said Lucius Malfoy, as the goblet of wine shook between his hands. /"I tried to curse him for stealing my servant. Ever since, I feel that I have been the one who was cursed. He frightens me more than I should admit. I follow our lord because I pray nightly that he is powerful enough to destroy the evil known as Harry Potter."/

The Death Eaters remembered this tale as they stood before Harry now, and all of them were afraid. One pissed his breeches then and there. The legend had grown in the short months since Potter had started to unleash his fury onto Voldemort's forces. Now, none of them knew what to believe.

In truth, it no longer mattered. The reality was worse than the legends could ever hope to be.

When Harry merely blinked, the Death Eaters scrambled to raise their wands and sent a plethora of rainbow-hued curses in his direction. It mattered not what they cast, for their only hope of survival now was to hit Potter with something, /anything,/ that might give him pause. They peppered him with their spells, screaming and swearing, shaking and shivering in a swivel-eyed stupor.

But Harry, the Green-Ghost-That-Hunted, had already unleashed his deadliest weapon: the fear. It took them and made them sloppy. Even then, he danced through the spells with a terrible beauty and snapped his arms to the sides, which allowed the magically-modified Glock-17 handguns to slide into both hands beneath his swirling cloak. Each bullet had been refined with dark magic, cursed to hold a sliver of the killing curse. Bullets were faster than spells, guns more accurate than wands. His was a ruthless, but efficient spree, and this way none could check his wand for residue.

Harry slid onto his knees and brought the pistols forward, almost in slow-motion. Now, his facial expression changed for the first time; a dangerous glint entered his eye, but that was it. In that moment, had it caught a glimpse of him, a boggart would have fled.

The pistols were brought to bear, even as his shielded clothing absorbed the spells that hit him. He fired six bullets in all, plenty for six more of Voldemort's minions. The entire action had taken less than ten seconds.

And once those ten seconds were up, the cobblestones of Diagon Alley ran red with the blood of the once-fearsome Inner Circle.

Without a backwards glance, the Green Ghost holstered his weapons and pulled the cloak tighter around his shoulders. With a /crack,/ he had vanished, off to find more prey.

But those who saw him whispered that he had returned to the nether...

*** I've never liked it when writers put actuals guns into wizards hands in HP stories. I always assume that bullets would be one of those things that WW1 and WW2 would have make the wizarding world develop very good shields or even magical items that block most bullets or smaller explosions. Besides, I would love to read a wand and magical item selection scene that was similar to that scene in John Wick 2 where he was choosing his weapons. Also, that line: "The stories you hear about Harry Potter, if anything, have been watered DOWN".

I think you're responding to the wrong person, as I didn't use anything like that line. "The reality was worse than the legends could ever hope to be..." is substantially different.

** "Voldemort," he screamed out into the night. He could feel it, like he had realised something cold and slimy into the air. He knew they would come, and come they did. It was Rodolphus and Rabastian first, Harry had fun with them. The younger had done him no fowl, he got a simple entrail expelling spell. Rodolphus he took longer with, he'd have given a million pounds to see Bellatrix's face when they found what was left of her husband.

The Malfoy's were next; Harry thought it terribly poetic as he transfigured the blood they held so dear to mud. Next came Yaxley and Umbridge, turns out the dementers weren't too loyal.

Dolohov had a liking for a fire, he liked it less as he cooked and blackened. Snape was the most fun, Harry force fed him a rock and then transfigured into a toad in his stomach, it took a while but justice for Trevor next.

He also took great pleasure in killing the child murderer Greyback; Remus went first, then the Montgomery sisters, then so many others. His death lasted days, Harry had never heard a grown man beg for death before,

the others he didn't bother to remember, he had turned their fallen comrades into inferi and they fell from ripped out throats and bitten skulls.

Bellatrix fell last, he had gift wrapped her to Augusta Longbottom. he heard she died screaming.

Harry killed Voldemort, while Remus, and the others watched. Voldemort was less scary without his followers. He made his old foe watch his horcruxes be destroyed then he locked the man in a prison where he would die of old age.
