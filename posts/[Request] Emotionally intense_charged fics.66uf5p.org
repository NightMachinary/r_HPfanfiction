I'm looking for some really intense fics, the kind that you can't stop thinking about later, that sort of get under your skin and make your stomach twist.

Longer is preferred (as in, novel length), because when I read fiction it tends to take me a bit to get emotionally invested in the characters, and I've just never found myself especially moved by short stories (yes, I've read Cauterize).

I've read a looooot of fan fiction, and my tastes are pretty varied, but I tend to prefer things that are a little darker in tone. Really, I'll read most things though.


** These were very emotional for me.

linkffn(The Lions of Gryffindor by Lyrastales)

It's set during Neville's 7th year at Hogwarts and flashes back to Frank and Alice's lives as well. I loved this. It did more for me than DAYD ever did in terms of that last year under the Carrows. It's a oneshot but I thought it was very well done.

linkffn(Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love by billowsandsmoke)

These are two extremely difficult people to characterize and they're usually done very badly in fanfiction, but I thought the author did a superb job in developing Snape and Luna and I was in tears by the end. It's not very long but I personally can handle emotional charges in small doses so.

linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm)

A few issues with the characters but otherwise an emotional roller-coaster.

linkffn(This Is For Cassius by Sora Matasuki)

Quite nice. Based on the Tumblr debate of having a slytherin Triwizard champion.

[[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=5403]]

This one made me cry.

linkao3(the family evans by dirgewithoutmusic)

This one is lovely and a little sentimental as well.

linkffn(Across the Universe by mira mirth)

Personally my favourite dimension hopping fanfiction ever.

I hope you like them.

Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

Not really, he's a hypocrite that can't seem to understand his own flaws. He hates Harry because of his resemblance to his father, and if he had it his way, Harry and James would have died while Lily survived. He isn't a hero nor is he a good person.

Harry seemed to be very happy-go-lucky about magic before his first potions class. On the train, he himself stated that he had read most of his course books akin to Hermione, but hadn't practised any spells. After the first potions class, he seems to lose interest in magic. There's also the fact that he mind-raped Harry in the fifth year while calling his father a pig.

We have no evidence that he didn't grow out of that mindset. In fact, we have the opposite. When Dumbledore asked Snape if he had grown to care for the boy, Snape responded by throwing out a Patronus that likely resembled Lily's, showing that she is who he cared for only and not Harry. He was attempting to appease the memory of a dead woman that never loved him, by crippling her son emotionally. While I respect you opinion that he is your favourite character, I don't respect how you view him as a hero.

But in the books, he was literally the teacher that swept the rug out from under Harry when he was running, he was the teacher that allowed petty squabbles as a child to stem into something even more dangerous. He is not a good person by any means, nor is he a hero. Personally, without the movie renditions of the characters, I feel that many people will feel the same about Ron, Hermione, Snape, and Dumbledore, as I do.

********* yeah, i still think this is still a huge reach. you're going to have to detail how snape's actions, specifically, altered harry's entire view of magic. he was a kid who spent his life in a cupboard who was then told he was part of a fantastical world. his excitement on the train isn't a good point to gauge his approach to magic in the academic context that is hogwarts, once he realised what it actually involved- work. a lot of children are charmed by the idea of being, say, an astronaut, but unwilling to put in the work to become one. i don't see any significant change in his attitude to magic pre- and post- snape's class that can't also, more reasonably, be chalked up to his involvement in the mystery plot and disinterest in the tedium of academia. he's also still excited for the flashy parts of magic e.g. levitation in charms. potions is also different than other forms of magic, in both practice and execution. at best you can claim it put him off of potions. i also don't see where harry went through all of his course books, especially akin to hermione, when one of the things emphasized is how different his approach was to hermione's

** If you like things darker in tone I would recommend Reverse. linkffn(4025300) Canis Major is a one shot. linkffn(9896042) Across the Universe is great.

  Curses. Dark curses, rather, weren't very fun at all, and certainly not when Hermione keeps waking up in a different decade because of one. At least the company wasn't half bad. Oneshot.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C. Binns: A Personal History]] is very emotional. It's 13000 words, so not novel length, but longer than Cauterize.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]]: Novel length and very emotional in parts.

** I recommend this often, but if you're ok with slash, Danse Russe by Frayach is unbeatable. The quality of the writing is superb, and I'm still haunted by it long after I read it for the first time. Dark and very sexy.

Edited to add: After reflection, I would also recommend Chaos Theory by Tessa Crowley, also slash. For a long time this was my favorite rewrite/AU for the books, and I find myself returning to it for the intensity of the plotting. Books told from POV of genius!Draco who becomes committed to protecting Harry. Takes a very dark turn after the events of book 4. Wonderful take on Draco, though obviously somewhat OOC given the AU. Very sympathetic mentor!Snape. linkao3(1521479; 454721)

  True Love. Soul Mates. They're just words until put to the test. Harry and Draco have a bond that was forged in the hell of the post-war years and pulled them both back from an abyss of nihilism and self-destruction. Nothing can break it, or so they believed. But True Love can demand sacrifices too great to bear and deeds too terrible to justify.
