** I'm reminded of the fic, Reverse, sadly incomplete, where the bad guys are interrogating Hermione, and then the top villain comes in gloating that there's no need to continue the interrogation, since they already know blah blah blah, the big secret. Hermione is horrified, since at that moment, the bad guys finding out her secret was her biggest fear.

It was a boggart of course, not the actual main villain.
