I've been wondering about it for some days now. According to the dictionary, bane, in an archaic context, means “something, especially poison, which causes death.” So, was Remus killing himself for not accepting his wolf half (if you can call it like that) and of course, for trying not to hurt anyone?

Ps: I'm sorry in advance if there's any grammatical mistake, but English is not my native language.

Ps2: I took into account the archaic definition of the word because the “language” used in magic comes from Old English and Latin.


** Yes. Aconite, the main ingredient is poison for werewolves, canonically I think.

But then, most medicines we take all the time are also poison, or at least have poison as one of the main ingredients. I took several pills today that could make me just...stop breathing in my sleep at that dose, if I accidentally took too much of another at the same time (specifically meds that would change my brain chemicals); so wolfsbane is very likely a poison at the wrong dose, or if the potion isn't brewed properly, or even possibly taken at the wrong times in the month

*** I was thinking about this a little more and I think whether the potion is about harming the wolf I think is totally up to the author and how they feel like lycanthropy works. Is it a virus? is it a magical autoimmune condition? Is it a curse that involves some sort of spiritual component? These would all have different answers.

I think all we know from canon is that he has to take it seven to three days before the full moon every cycle, but we don't know much else I don't think, other than that Remus didn't take it before he changed on the day of, and was mindless and controlled by the instinct to bite when he changed, so apparently even though he had taken the other doses that week, it was all for nought, because he missed a crucial dose---which honestly sucks

**** Thats not Canon thats entirely fanon we see him get the potion delivered to him not knowing when he drank it and as we also see that the full moon is the next day we cN assume he took it right after harry left or the day of the full moon

***** Yeah, cool, so as I was saying, if you want to figure out how wolfsbane works you basically have to work out how lycanthropy works in your world

** Wolfsbane is poisonous to anyone, it's a type of nightshade, but they make potions from all sorts of harmful substances.

Obviously wolfsbane isn't harming him.

** This is one of those questions where, purely taking into account the real world, the answer would be a resounding "yes" - but then there are loads of unknowns and mitigating factors that that answer doesn't take into account.

IRL, wolfsbane AKA aconite is in fact a (highly) poisonous plant - it's part of the nightshade family.

But then, so are potatoes and tomatoes, and we cultivated the poison out of those (at least, the parts we use). It's very possible that all the plants wizards use in potions have been similarly bred to the point they are no longer poisonous, or at least not enough to be any danger.

Also, a surprising amount of medication basically boils down to "poison in a low enough dose to only affect the bits causing disease". It could be argued that wolfsbane potion, true to its name, is poisonous to the /wolf/ - it keeps that curse weak enough to not take over completely. From that point-of-view, he would probably be poisoning himself about as much as we lowly Muggles do when we take a strong painkiller or antibiotic.\\
The more resilient constitution of magical folk helps to lend credence to this explanation.

If we then add /magic/ into the mix, things go even wonkier - because the certainty of the chemical makeup goes out the window. The act of brewing could (and likely /would/, given the amount of confirmed poisonous potion-ingredients) have turned the poison into something entirely harmless, and conversely a set of entirely innocuous ingredients can be turned into a horrendous poison.

** Well after taking the potion... the wolf is not alive on a full moon. It's the human that's in control.

** If I have a bacterial infection, I'll take a poison that selectively kills bacteria. If I got cancer, I might be prescribed a poison that hurts cancer cells more than normal cells. Taking a poison that hurts what's hurting you more than it hurts you isn't a very surprising concept.

** The way I see it is that I would always remember that monkshood and wolfsbane are also called aconite, which is a mamber of the nightshade family, which are poisonous so yes. By taking poison, Remus was killing himself because he didn't want to hurt anyone
