I was wondering if you know of any good fics that use this approach to magic. Whether the magical abilities are provided by gods or the devil, but whoever does it always expects a payment in return in one form or another. This would actually be quite consistent with some parts of canon such as:

- Voldemort sacrificing his soul for immortality;
- Lily sacrificing her life to protect Harry's;
- Harry enduring ten years of torment in order to be safe from Voldemort.

Seriously though, I've seen this done in this weird crossover of Harry Potter and the Addams Family called *'Harveste.'* The sacrifices to the ancient gods happens in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6533730/1/Harveste-Addams-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix][Harveste Addams and the Order of the Phoenix.]]

I don't know where the author got her ideas in this fic because I don't remember them being in the Addams Family cartoons, shows and movies.

Here it is only the dark magic that works that way, not all magic.

  When Harry Potter has the opportunity to erase Voldemort before the Dark Lord can resurrect, he finds out that walking a fine line between his own morality and the good of this world is more complicated than Harry could have ever imagined. While unable to let go of his past, he discovers a whole different side of magic too, and a different side to the man who shows him this.

** There's an anime Full Metal Alchemist (I think) where alchemy is that exactly. A friend encouraged me to write a story like that, but I haven't gotten around to it. I've been working on another concept instead.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] by LessWrong. Has Harry with the mind of a scientist and a heart full of science fiction trying to apply the principles of science! To magic. Potions in particular ends up being this sort of sacrificial type magic. An excellent read anyway. Complete. FFNet.

*** Not sure why you're getting downvoted... your suggestion is consistent with my request. However I tried reading it and got very quickly impatient with its pace and Harry's personality. Thank you for the suggestion though.
