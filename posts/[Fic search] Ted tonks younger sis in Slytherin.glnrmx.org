#+begin_quote
  A college student is reborn as Ted Tonks's little sister. She is determined to learn all that she can in order to vanquish Voldemort before Halloween of 1981. At any cost, by any means. That intense ambition and utter ruthlessness has the Hat sort her, a known muggleborn, into Slytherin. _____________________I got tired of reading OCs and SIs and AUs that did nothing to change to the plot so here we are.
