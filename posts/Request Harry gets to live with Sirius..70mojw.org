Looking for stories where Harry gets to be raised by Sirius. Maybe Sirius never went after Peter or maybe he was given a trial after third year for Harry or whatever.

Any rating. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash would rather it be completed but if not then a bunch of chapters is fine.


** Linkao3(Stealing Harry) is the best, though uncompleted. Author gave a summary of how it would have ended though. It's a series starting from Harry at 8, then Harry's first to third year.

  Life, like the sands of the desert, are so quickly changing that it is hard to keep grounded. When his life changed without warning, he didn't fight or give in, he took the change and made himself stronger than ever. A chanced meeting changed everything for both of them, a letter surrounded by his desire to learn and a will that never saw light; will change the very sands of fate.
