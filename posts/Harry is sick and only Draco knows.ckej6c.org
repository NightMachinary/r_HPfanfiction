So i've read this fanfic a while ago and I forgot the title

The plot - I think it's set in eight year. Draco notices that Harry is acting off and stuff, so he starts watching him and it turns out that Harry has a terminal illness and is slowly dying. No one else really notices, they are kind off wrapped up in their own worlds. Harry starts hanging out with slytherins and makes makes a list of things he wants to do before he dies and Draco helps him complete it.

Thanks for any help :)


** OH FUCK I REMEMBER THIS STORY!! Is it the terminal disease no cure he made a, essentially, bucket list?? He made a snowman at one point??

*** Just finished this, holy fucking shit. This made me so angry and the dread I'd been holding onto for the last few chapters of this knowing that Harry was deteriorating is unreal.

  "Succorbentis?" Malfoy asked quietly, his face immediately hidden by that insufferable mask. "You have Succorbentis?" Silence. "You know it's an incredibly rare disease, right? You know it's incurable, right?" Silence. "...No wonder you're in denial." Ron/Hermione/Gryff Bashing

  Bella's a strong independent woman but where has her life really taken her? She's got a job, but no real life to speak of. No lover, no kids, nothing...Feeling lost and alone on her 30th birthday she drunkenly writes a list of things she's never done before but has always wanted to. Maybe life really does begin at thirty? Rated M for adult content.Originally posted under Jayeliwood
