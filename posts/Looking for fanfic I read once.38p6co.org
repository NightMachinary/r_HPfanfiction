It had Harry being completely overpowered, he'd built some kind of community around the Burrow and lived there himself (with Ginny? I don't remember) and he was doing a bunch of research like recreating the Room of Requirement. He also had a Phoenix, I can't remember if it was fawkes or not.

At one point he might have developed a new broom? Can't be sure about that one though.

Been looking for this for ages! Can't find it on google.
