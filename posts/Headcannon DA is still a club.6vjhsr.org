I was reading a pretty smashing fanfic, where there are even some Slytherin members in Dumbledore's Army, and got too thinking. Is it possible that after the war, the Dumbledore's Army actually became a legitimate club, for people interested in defence classes? The same people who were /in/ the DA during the original series would have had children, and told them about it. Same goes for the children re-entering Hogwarts after the school is rebuilt.

Now that Dumbledore is dead, it'd almost be like a tribute to one of the most influential, powerful wizards of his time to have a club based on learning the tenets of self defence. Would Harry or Neville or Hermione or Ron ever come back to the school to give guest lectures at DA meetings? Is it possible that other schools catch on to the idea, and start their own defence clubs? Students who are struggling in DADA class are encouraged to enter the club to pair off with more experienced students who can help them out.

I feel like it wouldn't be a club in the traditional sense of how it's used in most schools. People don't come in because they're good at something, they come in because they realise that they need help with it, and want to reach out to their peer networks, and get that help.

Would the DADA teacher be the staff sponsor for the club?

I want to think that Dumbledore's Army lives on, even after the war, so that people have a reminder that unity is important, and that helping each other become good at a thing helps you to become better at it too.


** I always considered it a possibility. Originally I thought maybe Neville restarted the club as a extra learning opportunity. Peer tutoring and the like with a Dueling Club portion for the advanced students and tutors.

But my views changed with extreme nationalist views entering the mainstream around the muggle world the past 5 years. The DA was restarted by someone from the next generation with help or guidance from Neville when pureblood supremacy, Magical First, or other wizarding prejudice group attains mainstream recognition.

I like to think the muggle and wizarding worlds mirror each other in someway.

** Yes, I think the Trio and Ginny were acting very rational after the Battle, in that the boys were trying to establish themselves at the Ministry, while sending the girls to Hogwarts. There would be NO WAY Hermione and Ginny were going to slack off after what they went through. They were going to organize the students and no longer let the corrupt Ministry bureaucrats decide their future.

**** Of course, the girls were also going to teach the boys what they had missed.

** Headcanon Approved. This is actually a really good idea... And something really helpful for the later generations of wizards.
