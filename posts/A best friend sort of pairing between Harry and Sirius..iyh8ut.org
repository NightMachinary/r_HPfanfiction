So, I'm lf fics where Harry and Sirius have more of a best friends relationship where they get up mischief rather than a father/son type of relationship. No slash. In case you have read it, A Black Comedy is the basic guideline of what id like the fic to be like. Preferably very long or with sequels. Thanks in advance.


** I didnt fully read your post and almost linked you A Black Comedy haha. Its great. Id love more of this type too.

** I mean, it's sort of friends? But it is more of a romance (No huge age gap however!).

It's quite literally a work of art, and one of my favorite HP fanfics thus far.

** Maybe linkffn(Oh God Not Again)? It's been a while since I've read this though. I remember them doing certain mischief-spreading things together but I don't remember how much of that there was.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
