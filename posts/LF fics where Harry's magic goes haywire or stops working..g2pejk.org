  Complete AU 7th book, Dumbledore is gone, the Ministry and Hogwarts in disarray, Harry and his friends are the only hope, but then Harry's Magic is gone. Some times it really sucks to be Harry Potter. HPHG eventually.

** If you haven't read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]], it definitely fits your request. It's a monster of a fic, and not for everyone, but one of the main plot points is Harry's screwed up magic.
