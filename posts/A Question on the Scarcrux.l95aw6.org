Has there been /any/ fic that has Harry casting an extremely light "curse" through the Scarcrux?

Reason I ask, is that I /just now/ had an image of Harry casting Patroni into and through it, causing massive damage to Tom who can't handle that sort of emotional overload. I think successive castings would either cause Tom's homunculus body to fall apart, or cause the horcrux to shatter. Not sure. Seems like the horcrux would break first, since it's being used as a targeting hex.


** I think this happens in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]], but I haven't read the entire fic.

*** As the author, I can confirm that yeah, that's pretty much the way that Voldy is defeated in Importance of Intent

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

** I've seen a couple where Hermione cast a powerful version of the /Finite/ at him. Once he got hit by accident and it knocked off several levels of spells and the other she cast at him while he was sleeping on the train and it only took off one (an aversion spell on the Dursleys, IIRC).

I think you could make a case for the Patronus, though. Could be an interesting story.
