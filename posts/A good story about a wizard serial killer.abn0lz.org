I would really like to see the depths of evil that can be explored with magic, beyond Avada Kedavra and Crucio.

A wizard serial killer sounds like a crazy concept. Maybe the ministry can hunt them? Maybe the muggle cops can take a swing?

Dexter crossovers and AUs would also be cool.

Thoughts?

*** Thanks! I would say that a common (and fair) criticism of my story is that there's not a huge amount of magic used - it's your standard police procedural with a bit of magic thrown in, so it might not fit OP's request. The sequel is far more magical in it's crime, but isn't finished yet (not long to go though).

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

** linkffn(Dreams and Darkness Collide) Harry's saving people thing warps into him brutally murdering serial killers that aren't brought to justice by the corrupt pureblood-run government. As a result, harry becomes a serial killer. All for the greater good of course. Don't become weirded out by the slash, it's barely there and not relevant to the plot.

linkffn(Butterfly Heart by the fictionist) Tom Riddle's serial killing is done psychotically into an art form with the purpose of messing up Auror Harry's psyche.

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned

  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him.

*** Ya. You can do all sorts of crazy stuff! Imagine a wizard/witch with a huge knowledge about the human body. What if there's a scene where (s)he transfigured organs while the victim was still alive. Like, bam, now your appendix is a hamster.

It would be so fucked up!

What if their serial killer's MO was ex-death eaters? Or people who specialized in the dark arts? What if the serial killer tracked down bad guys, ritualistically killed them, then turned their baddies into inferi? What if the killer was a necromancer trying to innovate the field of necromancy?

What if this serial killer was the main character anti-hero and Harry Potter himself was hunting him down?

I. Need. This. Story.

(Credit for the animal part goes half to my BF, he said snake intestines, but I think hamster appendix would be worse)
