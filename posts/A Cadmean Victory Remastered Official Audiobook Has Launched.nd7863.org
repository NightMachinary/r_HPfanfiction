Hello! You may remember me from my periodic threads about the ongoing Alexandra Quick audiobook project over the past couple of years. Now that I've completed that, Matt "DarknessEnthroned" Bradley and I have been hard at work for the last few months on an audiobook for A Cadmean Victory: Remastered, and we are finally at the point of rollout!

In addition to an audiobook-exclusive prologue that follows Harry's development through his first three years, five chapters of the fic have been released on the podcast feed so far, and *thirty-seven more* have been completed and are awaiting release.

** Awesome! Good work! Did the actual reading novel get remasters as well or is it just the audiobook? Inquiring minds must know

*** Hi, Sam is recording right now, so can't reply, but yes, the fic itself is also getting re-written, Sam's recordings are beyond the portion that has been released to non-patrons by now, though

Also, if you join the author's server right now, you can catch the recording ðŸ˜‰

**** Wait so the remaster written version is locked behind patron? Feels bad for those of us without a lot of spare money :/

***** No, it is being uploaded to FFN and AO3, but patrons get access to chapters earlier through the website. And Sam has already recorded all chapters that have been uploaded to AO3 and FFN and is now working through the chapters that are only on the website for now
