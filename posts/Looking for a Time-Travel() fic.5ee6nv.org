Honestly, I'm somewhat confused about what it was. it had Harry and others (Hermione, at the very least) discover a naked Luna a closet and take steps against the bullies. Can't remeber much ese, might've been a time-travel fic, but it certainly had Dumbles and Ron-bashing....


** No time travel but this has a similar scene. linkffn(7718942) chapter 22

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

** It was neither of those, nice find with Broken Chains, tho. I know Knowledge is power like the back of my hand, I read it SO many times...

No, it was a rather dramatic scene, and the steps they took against the bullies were of a more personal, hands-on nature rather than changing the rules to better protect the victims. Whelp, gonna find soone or later...

** First thing that came to mind was linkffn(8195669) in chapter 10, near the end. Though it doesn't have time travel or Hermione, so probably not...

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
