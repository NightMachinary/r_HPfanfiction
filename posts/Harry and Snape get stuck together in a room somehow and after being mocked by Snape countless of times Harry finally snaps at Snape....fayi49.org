I am in the mood for hating on Snape and i'd love to see Harry yelling at him for a bit lmao. By the end of the fic Snape can somewhat realize how wrong he is but he can also not realize it, i don't mind.


** This just reminds me of the time where my mom wanted me and my older brother to get along so she tied us together. He then proceeded to slam me into the walls.

** "You sir, are a disappointment." Harry says after a moment of silence.

Snape looks down at Harry ready to respond and verbally berate him for his gal but all he sees are her eyes and they look upon him with total disappointment, enough to stop him.

Nothing else is said.

** There are several fics I've read where Dumbledore locks them in together in an attempt to force them to 'get along'. The only one I could find after a quick search is A Place for Warriors.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore locks Harry and Snape in the Room of Requirement. Harry's magic works, and Snape's doesn't. Will they kill each other? No slash.

** There's literally an entire fic dedicated to Harry and Snape locked in the Room of Requirement together: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3625984/1/A-Place-for-Warriors]]

No, they don't kill each other. Yes, they learn to work together eventually. Dumbledore's brilliant idea.

Both Harry and Snape eventually united in their hatred of DD's "brilliant" ideas.
