Okay so. * *clasps hands* *

Some time ago I posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8qzdpm/the_incomplete_story_of_talash_academy/][this.]]

Some said it was good, some bad. Recently I decided to modify some of the world details and add explanations at the bottom.

I would really like to continue this story on my own but, I'm stumped and maybe I should listen to community suggestions?

Also keep in mind this is only a rough concept and largely incomplete and I have *ZERO* writing experience before this.

(oh and if the paragraphs are messy or jumbled, that's Reddit's fault. I tried to space it out on my previous post but the site wouldn't accept my edits.)

So here it is:

The Story of Talash Academy

Carved into a mountainside in a section of forest near what Muggles call "Nantahala National Forest" lies Talash Academy.

The cavern that would become the Academy was found by the witch Talash in 1698. She was born in America to Muggle parents Talon and Ash Stavros in 1680 as Janess, in what would become the British Carolina colony.

Her parents noticed her magical ability from an early age and attempted to hide it, creating a great source of sadness and frustration within her for many years. When she was 12, she was nearly caught up in the histeria of the Salem Witch trials.

Fearful townsfolk, remembering the strange girl hidden from the world came to the conclusion that the Stavros family

must be practitioners of dark magic. Janess' parents, hearing of this, told her to run and not stop for anything.

She escaped just before the cabin was surrounded and caught up in flames. Janess ran and ran, never looking back, and

collapsed when she became too exhausted to continue, losing consciousness in a wooded region. When Janess awoke she realized she had no idea what this place was. Foraging for edible nuts by day and sleeping in trees by night, she was barely scraping by. This way of existing could not sustain her and before long, she became too weak to continue. It might

have been the end but, one evening Janess awoke in a strange house of tree branches and animal hide.

Though she was in and out of consciousness, she made out the figure of a woman nursing her.

When she was able to maintain consciousness, Janess asked the woman her name and was surprised to actually

hear a response, And in English no less. The woman, only actually a girl a few years older than Janess

introduced herself as Shkona. When Shkona asked Janess her name, she hesitated, filled with sorrow as she was overcome with the sudden feeling that her parents were dead. She decided to make a new name for herself, combining her parents' names, and called herself then on as "Talash" .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Talash spent six years in the village of Shkona's tribe, the Tsoranalii, Shkona becoming a close friend, and the village

shaman reconizing the strong presence of Nuhodi (Magic) in her, subsequently taking her on as a pupil.

Talash absorbed the shaman's knowledge like a sponge to water, an in time became quite the medicine woman herself.

It was here in the valley of the Tsoranalii that she learned to "weave magic", through body and through wooden staves

made from tree branches. (Wands did not yet have an established presence in all of North America.)

As she explored the valley, she encountered a cave when she was 18. Inside the cave Talash encountered what the tribespeople call "Magic stones" or Nuhinuya , glowing natural stones in the rock with a mysterious energy. The stones appeared to speak to her mind with whispering voices, imparting knowledge upon her and fortelling her future. The stones told her she was destined to create a great place of magical learning, and that she should seek the myriad ways of the magic across the world.

And so she did for eight long years travel abroad, visiting many far flung corners of the world,

learning the knowledge and magical techniques of Wizardkind, chronicling it all in journals that would come to be known as the Nuhuya Odyssey. Accompanying her was her friend Shkona and in Scotland joined an outcast monk named Garth Black.*

Finally, in Japan, Talash learned of "Maho no kendo" , of which a rough translation is "Magic Sword Way" , which

allows one to temporarily encase any magically compatible tool in a sword blade of pure magic and, at advanced levels project a full magic sword without physical tools.

Before returning home, Talash realized she had neglected to see all of her homeland, and set off on one final short journey across its length and breadth. On this last journey, she learned of many magic creatures, but these were the one's she remembered most and so gave new names:

Lokerno - Large, Alligator-like animals with eight legs, razor sharp scutes and two prominent fang-like teeth.

(From Scots Gaelic for lake "Loch" and latin "Lacertus" which describes many crocodilian animals)

Nathar - Close relatives of the Horned Serpent, with two straight, short, backfacing horns near the backs of their heads.

They are sympathetic creatures for, they can use the same venom used to kill as to heal, depending on their moods.

(Name comes entirely from Scots Gaelic "Nathair" for serpent.)

Kiugenn - Liugenns resemble cougars but are the size of common house cats. Their sides and backs are covered in durable scales,

roughly matching the hue of their fur.

(Greek "Léon" Lion "Gennaíos" brave and French "Couguar")

(These things written in this section are only a summary of Talash's Odyssey. For full details, read a copy of the Nuhuya Odyssey.)

Thus after eight long years in 1706 did Talash return to the Village of Tsoranalii and the Cavern of Nuhinuya.

She delved back into the cave of long ago and communed with the Stones. They said one word: "Tsoraeno."

This greatly confused Talash. Pressing the Nuhinuya yielded only silence. Thus she brought her questions to

one who had been as a father and mentor to her: The old Tsoranalii shaman.

He knew of what she spoke and told Shkona to reveal the secret of this mysterious "Tsoraeno" .

Shkona led Talash into the trees, deeper and deeper, eventually coming across a gargantuan tree.

It had many hollows and outcroppings, all of them strewn with what looked like owls. Looking closer, she could see

many types of ornaments tied to tree limbs, and what she could swear were necklaces of shells and beads around

the bodies of the unusual owls.

*Should Garth Black become Talash's husband or lover?

Shkona - Her name comes from the Cheyenne word for Little Wolf, "Honiahaka" . I simply shortened it, moved a K, and added an S.

Tsoraeno and Tsoranalii - A little more complicated. One Cherokee word for owl is "Tsi-gi-li" . I didn't like how that sounded so I thought "what are owls associated with?

The Sky!" So I sort of combined the Cherokee word with the Japanese word for sky, "Sora" . As for the second part, it is taken from a Cherokee word for friend: "Unalii" .

I don't remember where the "eno" comes from. There was quite a lot of hybridization between these names and words.

Also, the Tsoraeno being sentient owls are partly influenced by Guardians of Ga'Hoole. Their appearance is like a hybridization of Barn Owls and Long-eared Owls.

Nuhodi - It is my understanding that the word medicine in many native cultures, beyond meaning something which heals,

can mean "great strength and power" . I looked on the official website of Oklahoma's Cherokee Nation and found the word for

medicine provided phonetically. "nv-wo-ti" , which sounded like to me: "Nahwoti" . I modified this word so as not to sound

entirely identical but definitely related. I also used the Cherokee words for magic: " u-de-li-dv-gv-di-a-dv-ne-lv-di " . It's quite complicated. But I feel it had a part in changing Nahwoti to Nuvohti to the final Nuhodi.

Nuhuya - Combined Nuhodi with the cherokee word for stone (nv-ya). Plura of Nuhuya is Nuhinuya from the word for stones (a-ni-nv-ya).
