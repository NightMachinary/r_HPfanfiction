I'm writing a fic set back in the Marauders Era, and as I've not done this before, I'm curious--what are things you hate seeing in these kinds of fics? What advice would you give to someone trying to write one of their own?


** Leaving Peter out of the story completely, or making him an inconsequential character.

Also another Peter related one. Whenever he does talk, it's always described as squeaking. "Blah blah blah dialogue," Peter squeaked.

Granted, I don't see that happening as much anymore, but that could just be because I'm much more selective with what I read now.

*** Oh, agreed. I'd noticed the 'squeaking' trope and been slightly amused, but it's not that clever. I think people often forget that he /was/ a real part of the Marauders, even if he never really fit the prankster type. He had some issues for sure, but they accepted him--he couldn't have been inconsequential or a complete loser.

** When Alice and Frank Longbottom are in the Marauder's year and Alice is Lily's best friend or one of them. This rant has been building for a while, so sorry :P Canonically, they were both 'well-respected aurors' and I don't think they would have had the time to become aurors, never mind well respected aurors, in the three years the Marauders finished school before Oct '81, plus have Neville, plus go into hiding for a year. It just doesn't add up. For the timeline to work, Alice would have graduated spring 1978, gotten pregnant some time in fall 1979 and gave birth July 1980. She would have only been an auror for just over a year, maybe a year and a half. I can't see her still chasing dark wizards after learning she was pregnant. After that, they probably went into hiding like the Potters. Frank might have had time, but I don't think it was enough. Tonks said it was three years of training and there was only three years between the Marauders finishing school and the events of Halloween 1981. There would have to be a lot of explanations for that to work out. I can buy Alice and Lily meeting in the Order and becoming friends that way, but not while in school.

I think that the two of them being pregnant together would certainly bond them, but only while in the Order--they couldn't have gone to school together for the timeline to work. The only girls we know of who are potentially in Lily's year are Marlene McKinnon and Mary McDonald, no?

I can't deny that I wish there was a bit /more/ focus on canon characters in there, but at this point I'm so sucked into the plot, and he's put so much into his OCs that I am totally okay with it.

(To be clear, I call it an "exception" because the OCs are pretty much first-class characters from the start, as well as having access to a...different... form of "magic" than the canon characters.)

** The Marauders aren't a group of equals. James and Sirius are the leaders of the group, they do things without considering the others a lot of the time. (Remus was visibly uncomfortable in SWM, they didn't even look at him/gesture to him, even though they know he doesn't like their bullying. They're rude to Wormtail, etc. They talk about Remus' lyncanthropy out loud, Sirius outs him to Snape).

Also, their relationship with Wormtail was clearly unbalanced. He openly hero-worshipped them, they patronised him, Rosmerta and McGonagall describe him as such.

They don't know that DEs have the Dark Mark on their forearm, or that Severus became a DE.

Remus and Lily weren't close friends.

** Not including Peter. He was just as much a part of the Marauders as the other three, even if Remus/Sirius would (understandably) prefer to retroactively minimize his role.

Making Lily a perfect angel rather than someone who is just as flawed as James. Also, making the Lily/Petunia thing completely one sided, where Lily is nothing but sweetly polite to her sister and gets hateful vitriol in return. Not that Petunia wouldn't be rude to Lily, but I doubt Lily would be blameless in escalating things.

When literally everyone is in Lily/James' year. There's no proof that Marlene McKinnon was in their year, and in fact, there's more [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3awc1c/marlene_mckinnon/][evidence]] to say that she's not. Marlene as Lily's best friend is so ingrained in fanon that I can let it go, but Dorcas Meadowes, Frank Longbottom, Alice Longbottom, and every single other character from that era is not nessasarily at Hogwarts with Lily/James. Dumbledore did not recruit the entire Order from the Class of 1978.

Don't forget that the Marauders are teenage boys, and should act like teenage boys.

Gratuitous nickname use. I can accept "Pads", and I can even accept the occasional shortening from Lily (she called Peter "Wormy" in her letter to Sirius). But Jamesie? Siri? Again, they're teenage boys.

James freaking out every time Lily is in the room. He's a popular guy with other interests besides Lily. Yes, he likes her. But he's not sitting around pining over her.

** I highly doubt any of the Death Eaters to be where "evil" while they were in Hogwarts. For example, a lot of people write Bellatrix as already being crazy and demented, which is silly. She was most likely somewhat normal (callous, cold-hearted yes, but still normal), and only went crazy in Azkaban (as anyone would).

Similarily Lucius probably wasn't as good as a schemer as he was in Harry's time, it takes a lot of practice and experience to become politically savvy, I highly doubt a teenager would be a political genius.

Also, marked Death Eaters? I'm not sure if this is canon or not (it is my headcanon at least) but Voldemort only marked his inner circle Death Eaters, and to get into the inner circle you'd have to prove yourself either by combat or cunning, no teenager would ever get marked... And yes, I realize Draco was marked but that was an exceptional circumstance since Voldemort needed to keep an eye on him (figuratively) during his operation in Hogwarts, as well as to punish Lucius for his failure.

** Making all known Death Eaters blatantly 'evil' during their school years, or conveniently *all* in the Marauders' year. Lucius was like six years older than them, for example.

Having James *obsessed* with Lily, instead of just having a possibly obnoxious crush. Also, having James make a complete personality 180 in terms of going from bully to Head Boy- there needs to be some progression there. Don't make the reason Lily.

Making Peter some little tagalong. He was their best friend until suddenly he wasn't. Make him change over time. Don't just give him one line every few chapters when the other three are always chatting. And don't make him comic relief. He was one of them, you know?

Lily isn't perfect. Nobody is. She may have been talented, but the woman needs some flaws. After all, she was a teenager.

Just because we have a bunch of kids in 'Lightning Era' doesn't mean all their parents went to school together. We don't know that Alice and Frank were the same year. We don't even know Alice's last name. Shoving everyone into the same year or two may be convenient, but it's *too* convenient. There needs to be some variation. Make someone a Ravenclaw or something.

They were troublemakers. Don't let them get away with everything under the guise of Dumbledore favoring Gryffindors and having a sense of humor. He may let them off *easy*, but there are other staff members, and there are rules. Them not getting into trouble is just frustrating and takes away some of the fun.

I've even read one seemingly well-written fic with good plot where James /rapes/ Lily. It's still in progress, so I'm holding out some hope for Imperius or something being involved(though even that is a flimsy excuse considering James /is/ Harry's father), but otherwise...even writing about it pisses me off.

** Ah, my favorite thing to talk about. Regarding Pet peeves, most people have said them. Include Peter, don't make him "squeak" all the time, don't make him look like a mouse (James doesn't look like a stag and Sirius doesn't look like a dog. Peter's mouse-y appearance, in my mind, is due to him being a rat for thirteen years). Don't make them call each other nicknames like Jamesie and Siri. Padfoot, Prongs, ect is ok but don't too much of it. If you want a nickname other than their already established ones, Pete works great.

My biggest pet peeve though regards James. He is a teenage boy who is very popular and very gifted. Please don't make him sit around complaining about why Lily won't notice him and have the other three roll their eyes because he's "always doing this". No. No x10000. He has a /crush/ on a girl but if he was to always talk about it, his friends would laugh and tease him. They would do this because they were assholes, but most importantly they were /teenage/ /boys/. Have him snog a few girls in broom cupboards or something and don't make him always talk about Lily in their dorm room. When I read fics that make James out to be a whiny loser who's in love with the girl who just won't give him the time of day (at the age of 15, might I add) I immediately can tell it was written by a thirteen year old girl who doesn't know how boys act.

Now, let's get into the fanon stuff because that's what I love to talk about. Let's talk about the maruader era in and of itself. I hate it. I hate how it's portrayed in the books because it doesn't make any sense. And that's alright for the books because the Marauder Era didn't have to make sense, it was simply a plot device. James has been a troublemaker with practically no respect towards authority. But you know, he's been really good the past couple of months, let's make him headboy. Remus spends every day with confidant (yes, that's the nice way of saying arrogant) people who stand by his side no matter what. He's always with them and they treat him as an important part of the group. Let's make him still shy and not remotely confidant after years of being friends with people like James. Oh, and let's make him prefect despite the fact that he misses school a lot on account of him being a werewolf. Sirius is a fun loving joker who came from a bad family and bad childhood who stands by his friends no matter what and is completely thankful to them for giving him a sanctuary. But let's make him forget all that to play a stupid prank on Severus by telling him that his friend is a /werewolf/. And Peter. Oh Peter is the worst of all.

The boys are stupidly popular. All four boys are incredibly skilled with magic. And yet Peter hero worships James and Sirius? Peter becomes an animagus to help Remus when he transforms, showing great love and loyalty to his friends. But he betrays them to Voldemort? Why? Because it moves the plot along, not because it really makes sense in reality. There are many ways where you can make it make sense by filling in the gaps left, such as maybe Voldemort threatened his family or something. But the books make him a coward, which in my personal fanon is dumb. Peter should not be a coward, Remus should have loads of confidence, Sirius shouldn't be a bonehead by betraying his friend, and James should not be a guy who is a complete asshole, and then magically not an asshole when he is given Headboy. The four should be fairly equal, not James and Sirius being the marauders and the other two being tag-alongs as Remus sighs and says "oh no" and Peter giggles and says "good one, James. Can I give you a back massage when this is all done?" Yes, James is the leader (that's what the symbolism of the stag is) but all of them are gifted, popular, and loyal. You know, until they magically aren't.

*** A lot of this seems like dissatisfaction with the coherency of the characters than actual flaws within the narrative.

All four boys weren't popular, nor magically gifted, nor equal, nor is that suggested anywhere. It was James and Sirius. Peter became an animagus, but you can beyond easily say he did it because J & S pitched the idea, refusing would seem disloyal and he's better with them than without. He has more reason to than not to. He betrays them to Voldemort because they can no longer provide him the protection they did at Hogwarts. You can say he never cared for them as people so much as what they could do for him, you just don't find that reading palatable, but I'd argue it's the most canon. Sirius is an asshole, and careless. Of course he outed Remus to spite Severus. He was also a dick to Kreacher despite the 'treat inferiors' speech. Again, it seems like you just don't like how much of a careless asshole he is. You're also saying Remus should have loads of confidence because of proximity, yet those same friends were careless about his lycanthropy.

#+begin_quote
  He did not approve of their relentless bullying of Severus Snape, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.
#+end_quote

Their relationship does seem like it would foster emotional dependency, if he's at least a little uncomfortable in this relationship where they're doing things for him. And Remus is relatively confident in most matters as an adult, just not his lycanthropy. Which he couldn't trust Sirius with.

Sirius loves and respects James for giving him sanctuary. He doesn't view Peter as an equal, though. And there's a power imbalance in his relationship with Remus.

'They were teenage boys.' I get what you're saying, but this is rationalising backwards i.e. you're trying to fill them in with a general mold as opposed to characteristics evidenced in canon. You can say 'Riddle is a teenage boy, don't make him release murder snakes', etc.

Aand, Sirius did say outright James ~always made a fool of himself when Lily was around. He was sketching her name in his paper. Severus found out at some point, which means he was talking about it. JKR contextualises his entire relationship with Severus as being in part due to Lily.

The Head Boy thing is ridiculous, though. Especially since we know they were pranking into seventh year. Though it's never mentioned anywhere else past from Hagrid, so you can say Hagrid's just an unreliable there.

Btw, I don't think canon is fully coherent. I just don't think some of your criticisms hold up.

**** oh, yes, you are correct. I actually tried to say that but I couldn't figure out the proper words. It is a dissatisfaction with the coherency of the characters more than flaws in the narrative. But they were popular, it was one of the things that Severus and Lily didn't like about them. The fact that they were such assholes and yet popular. At least James and Sirius were. The magically gifted part comes from the fact that they did become animagi. While there is no established method of becoming an animagi in canon (at least I don't recall there being one) it can be assumed to be a very difficult magical accomplishment.

The equals was part of my fanon bit, because I don't like that the fact that three individuals who became anamagi together in order to help a friend did not see each other as equals. A lot of things, as I stated, make sense for the story. They make sense as cause and effect and they move the plot along and add a little bit of background to the characters. But as a stand alone story, I can't see how it makes sense for the four boys to be as close of friends as they were in canon without some semblance of mutual respect.

The "teenage boys" part was about how James shouldn't be always pining and whining about Lily. That's just not how teenage boys are. Yes, they may do it every now and then, but they aren't constantly doing it to the extent that the boys roll their eyes and shake their heads like "oh, james".

"Making a fool" would easily be being a bigger dick to people. And Severus could easily find out without James being a.... I really don't know how to describe it because most fics make James do things that really no body does.

But yes, you are right that most of it is a dissatisfaction with how the characters were written rather than a complaint about the narrative. My main point was that some of their actions wouldn't make sense as a stand alone story as main characters. It makes a lot of sense for background characters that were written as explanations for actions already written.

Another example of somethings that doesn't make sense is Dumbledore in PS. It makes sense for him to not have done more because he would have been a Deus Ex Machina, but a lot of things happened right under his nose that probably would not have happened without the most powerful wizard alive doing anything about it in reality.

** Mine is Marlene McKinnon being a close friend to Lily and the Marauders, as well as being Sirius Black's love interest. Read Lily Evans' letter to Sirius Black and tell me that sweet letter about baby Harry's birthday with a brief mention of "The McKinnons" being killed is in reference to the death her BFF and Sirius Black's girlfriend, or even his ex. Lily said she cried all evening. If a friend was murdered, and you were talking about it to said friend's /love/, wouldn't it be a much deeper, more emotional letter and wouldn't you have been upset for more than a few hours? Would Lily mention his girlfriend's death in such a quick, callous fashion, not even referring to Marlene by her first name? Doubtful.

To me, the "McKinnons" were a family, older than the Marauders, and Marlene was the wife/mum in that family. If not, I still I imagine they knew her through the Order, and were not super close. Nothing turns me off a Marauder's Era story faster than seeing Marlene McKinnon as a main character.

Also annoying - Sirius acting like a dippy pre-teen, even when he's seventeen and has been disowned by his horrible family. Also the assumption that because he is attractive, he must be sleeping with everyone in the school. There is nothing in canon to suggest this - in fact, in the scene with the girl admiring him during OWLs, he is oblivious to her.

And writing Peter out of the story bothers me, as well. We know he's a jerk, but they didn't at that point, and he's a major part of their story.

** Generally it boils down to three things:

- Know your timeline and the age of characters. Know who was and who was NOT in the same year as them. Frank, Alice, Lucius, Narcissa, Bellatrix, Molly, Arthur etc are all too old to still be in Hogwarts at that time. So don't include them.

- Their relationship with Lily and Snape. They did not bully "a poor and defenseless Snape" for no reason at all. Snape gave as good as he got and was actively dabbling in the dark arts in a time when Voldemort was killing Muggleborns. Portray it as such.

- Peter. It is my headcanon that Peter did not join the death eaters till after Hogwarts and even then he never did it because he believed their bigotry. So don't paint his as the death eater he will become but rather as the fun loving prankster he was back in school.

Did he? No doubt he /wanted/ to, but from the first moment on the Hogwarts train, it's two against one (yes, Lily was there, but James and Sirius weren't targeting Lily), and in school it's four against one - or three, if you assume Remus usually sat on the sidelines pretending he didn't notice what was going on.

And yes, Snape was already dabbling in the Dark Arts, but it's reasonable to think some of his motivation was revenge and a desire to defend himself. No, he wasn't defenseless, I agree, but it's likely he was always outnumbered, and even if there were reasons to dislike Snape (his lack of social graces and his interest in the Dark Arts), the Marauders went after him mostly because they were bored and it was fun to torment another student - with the implication that Snape was vulnerable because he was poor, ugly, a loner, and didn't come from a powerful family. The Gryffindors were dickheads in that respect.

Snape wasn't a likable kid, but he wasn't always a Death Eater, either. I'm pretty sure the parallel is to the popular boys singling out the weirdo, confident there would be few, if any, consequences to them.

However - yeah, I don't think Snape would come out of it a more sympathetic character; it would just make him more vengeful and vicious with each passing year.

**** I agree. I doubt Snape was equal to four others, especially as a child! Neither side should be white-washed.

  Their relationship with Lily and Snape. They did not bully "a poor and defenseless Snape" for no reason at all. Snape gave as good as he got and was actively dabbling in the dark arts in a time when Voldemort was killing Muggleborns. Portray it as such.
#+end_quote

Snape wasn't a poor and defenseless victim. He was prejudiced, enamored with dark spells and kept the wrong company. But he was still a victim and the Marauders were bullies. James and Sirius attacked and actively humiliated Snape for their own amusement. A quote by JKR:

#+begin_quote
  Remus functioned as the conscience of this group, but it was an occasionally faulty conscience. He did not approve of *their relentless bullying of Severus Snape*, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.
#+end_quote

See? Relentless bullying. The fact that Snape wasn't a good person and later became a bully himself is irrelevant. There are no excuses for what what they did to Snape in his school years.

So, yeah, pet peeve: Portraying the Marauders as lovable pranksters that could do no wrong, and making out their dislike of Snape to be righteous when it was anything but.

(Of course, Snape centric fics show James to be as evil as Voldemort and as stupid as a mountain troll, and that it an equally ridiculous perspective of events. I think for all its faults, /Delenda Est/ handles their dynamics well for the most part. Most fics are biased to one side or the other.)

**** Snape may have been a victim when they ganged up on him but Sirius states in OOtP that Snape gave as good as he got. I'm sure if he caught one of the Marauders alone he took full advantage of the fact. JKR may state something but that doesn't change canon, because if that's the case Ron and Hermione and Harry and Ginny got divorced and Harry and Hermione got together. So the quote on "relentless bullying" doesn't change canon that Snape would/did retaliate. Sure make them bullies that get punished for it but Snape wasn't JUST a victim.

***** Yeah, but Sirius is probably the last person whose word I'd take about anything Snape did in school. Sirius thought that tricking Snape into facing a werewolf was a mere "prank." And not just any werewolf, but a friend of his who probably would have been sent to Azkaban and the tender mercies of a Dementor's Kiss if he'd killed a 15-year-old boy while in beast form. I'm sorry, but Sirius' moral compass and perceptions are skewed when it comes to Snape. And we never see Snape seeking out the Marauders and attacking them in canon, nor is he referred to as a "troublemaker" by any member of the staff - although I could just be forgetting the relevant passage. I totally believe the feud raged on both sides - but I doubt Snape would have carried it on alone if the four Gryffindors had left him in peace.

(Sidenote here: I've always been curious about Snape's dueling skills and when he learned them. In response to his Marauders problem, perhaps? Because I can't really see Snape as an aggressive attacker on par with James and Sirius. Defending himself, yes. Losing his temper, yes. But otherwise, I'd expect him to use subtle spells, potions slipped into pumpkin juice, rigged jinxes that couldn't be easily traced back to him. A hex while someone isn't looking. But even when he's got Black and Lupin cornered in the Shrieking Shack, he doesn't hurt them, even though, as far as he knows, he's got an excellent reason to blast the shit out of Sirius. As a student, he's a brooding, scrappy, unpleasant child who's used to being attacked but isn't physically coordinated or strong or confident. He's not a jock; there's no evidence he played Quidditch. So you could say he studied dueling to get better at disabling his opponents.)

Back on track: on the other hand, I've always assumed that Snape created the Sectumsempra curse with James and Sirius in mind. The annotation "For enemies" implies as much, and it literalizes the kind of revenge fantasy you'd expect of a beleaguered kid who daydreams about cutting his enemies to pieces. I could see Snape being that kid, indifferent to potential carnage. Like Sirius, he wasn't big on understanding consequences.

****** Fair enough, but James one of Snape's bullies, saves him from the werewolf, and Snape later gets Lupin fired over a childhood rivalry. And Lupin may not have been innocent but why did Snape feel the need to get him fired? I'm not saying Snape isn't a victim. But people make James and Sirius into these ridiculously brutal bullies, yes they bullied him but he retaliated held a childhood grudge so is he's only slightly better then the Marauders. And we never see how The Marauders could have matured with James dying at 21, and Sirius being locked up at 21 for 12 years, if they had normal lives they may have changed.

******* Oh, I agree. I'm not happy about James or Sirius-bashing at all, but I've seen too many fics where the Marauders' treatment of Snape is downplayed and shrugged off as "boys will be boys." Usually it's implied Snape deserves it.

Sirius, like Snape, is a complex character, and both of them have fairly extreme flaws and tragic fates. Sirius' life is basically destroyed, and his fortitude in surviving Azkaban is phenomenal, but he emerges a very damaged person. James - well, we have to take canon's word for it that he became a good man, even though we don't get to see it on the page.

And yes, James did the right thing in the Shrieking Shack incident, but I'm not clear how much he risked by doing so, since he could have changed into his Animagus form, in which (I think? not sure about this) he acted as a non-human companion to wolf!Lupin. But it was brave of him no matter what, and a sign that he hadn't crossed the moral boundary line that Sirius had. On the other hand, according to internal evidence in the books, Snape's Worst Memory occurs /after/ the Shrieking Shack, which means the Marauders continued tormenting him. Tormenting a boy who'd been traumatized by a close encounter with a werewolf and been forbidden to talk about it to anyone (great counseling skills there, Dumbledore). No wonder Remus didn't want to get involved.

Personally, I think Dumbledore was off his nut to hire Lupin as a professor. No way should a werewolf have been teaching kids, even with Snape on hand to provide Wolfsbane. The risk wasn't worth it. And Lupin /did/ forget to drink the potion. I could see Dumbledore arranging for him to receive a stipend while working for the Order, but the Headmaster violated the trust put in him by parents and students by hiring a werewolf. Also, he knew Snape and Lupin's history; Snape had good reason to be tense and angry in Lupin's company. IMO, Dumbledore's utter lack of respect toward Snape all through Prisoner of Azkaban would have justified Snape giving him a two-fingered salute and Disapparating the fuck out of there. Teasing him about wanting an Order of Merlin and condemning him for trying to get Sirius sent back to Azkaban - when Dumbledore himself hadn't done a thing to stop Sirius being railroaded into prison without trial and hadn't lifted a finger to prove his innocence in the 12 years following - doesn't really highlight his moral superiority.

But then, I view Harry as an unreliable narrator (because he's a kid who's denied access to crucial information), and I tend to look for clues about the motives of the adults - the behind-the-scenes story, as it were - by shifting the perspective around, because that's how I get ideas to write fic. I may be susceptible to over-interpreting.

******** Definitely both sides agitated the other and kept the mutual dislike through school.

Sirius was childish and never had a chance to grow, majority of his classmates believed he betrayed his best causing his death, went to prison at 21. And when he comes out he sees Harry as a replacement James and wants to be friends instead of a guardian.

James had to have changed for McGonnagal and many others to state he changed when/before he got Lily, does that mean he became a saint? No but he grew up some.

I believe the books say James stopped him and pulled him out before he saw Lupin.

But was it any different then having oldest friends replaced with a Death Eater and placing students under the Imperius? Lupin left the school around the time of the Full Moon. Snape tormented harry around potions which I assume is equivalent to chemistry. And was then allowed to teach students DADA where a cutter to an artery could kill? Sorry I'd take Lupin.

But this is supposed to be Harry's story as he knows it, no different if it was any other student.
