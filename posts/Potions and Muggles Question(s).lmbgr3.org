** Yes, potions work on muggles. As said already, Tom Riddle is a canon example. But also JKR when writing the Potter family history, created Linfred of Stinchcombe whose muggle neighbors came to him for medicinal remedies.

** Just to add, the whole concept of "magical cores" in fanon anyway. It doesn't mention medical cores anywhere in canon.

** I think you have already answered the question yourself. To my knowledge the “muggles can't use potions” is entirely fanon and never stated in any canon reference (feel free to prove me wrong). The only canon incident where a potion was used on a muggle was on Tom Riddle Snr and it worked perfectly well.

*** There was also the ton-tongue toffee that worked on Dudley just like the Weasley twins expected.

** Why would they? The Magical World tends to keep to itself, most of them are bigots or indolent anyway, and even the good guys either misunderstand muggles entirely or look at 'em like creative children. Similarly, as someone else mentioned, converting our money to theirs would be a hassle. I'd also add that there's not as much economic pressure on them - magicals can transfigure a lot of what they need and double the amount of most other things. The Weasley's can feed their entire family plus one on a poorly-funded Ministry Worker's salary, after all.

Plus, I imagine the ICW keeps an eye out for violations of the statute and that would probably ping their vision for at least a bending of the statute, so it'd probably be pretty difficult to get okayed to do it or to do it without getting caught.

*** It wouldn't be all that difficult to get around Gringotts. A witch or wizard could use their muggle money to purchase things like jewelry, charm them to look a little more wizard made in design. Not just Jewelry, but other things Wizards see as high value that aren't easy to get in the wizarding world. Then they could just sell it to a pawn shop or maybe to other wizards.

**** Again, why? My point isn't that they couldn't do it, but that they probably wouldn't bother or have the motivation to take the more difficult route than just doing it 'locally' in the Wizarding World.

Anyone good enough to make stuff that isn't easy to get in the Wizarding World (which is basically just enchanted or specialised magical items - brooms, potions, etc) is probably good enough to not need to go to the Muggle World for capital.

If you know how to make brooms, you join a broom company. If you're good at making brooms, the broom company will probably work to keep you. Selling potions to the Muggle world, buying brooms from them, then enchanting those is just a lot more work than most Wizards would ever bother with when there's an easier route to take and no real reason to do otherwise - despite two wars in the last century, most wizards apparently couldn't cast a decent shield spell to save their own lives (literally - they had to buy hats from the Weasley Twins due to that).

***** Because it's an easy way to make extra money in the simplest way possible. Plus not everyone who wants to work in their chosen profession will be good enough to, so making cheap or muggle based versions might be a hobby or the best way to make money off something they love.

*** In linkffn(Mutant Storm by Bobmin356), Harry buys exclusive rights to market a number of potions to muggles, because the wizarding world won't remain hidden from muggle surveillance much longer, and he figures that selling potions to muggles is a good way of keeping them from killing all the wizards. The fact that it locks up the market for him is a side benefit.

I remember reading another story some years ago that took a somewhat opposite position, stating that one of the reasons for the Statute of Secrecy was because there weren't enough of the magical ingredients to supply muggles as well as wizards.

**** That is a fair point on the latter. Unless the Dragon Sanctuaries are secretly factory-farms, there's probably not a hope of providing enough of their various harvested bits for mass production. And I really hope there aren't fields of Mandrakes out there. :D

  why hasn't a modern (20-21st century) magic-user tried to sell potions as alternative medicine?
#+end_quote

I remember reading somewhere that the Ministry of Magic is said to keep an eye on magical folk who do business in the Muggle world. Once you start introducing magic to the setting (or, heck, just getting lucky in the Muggle world), chances are that /someone/ from the Ministry would take an interest in you.

Who knows if your next supposedly-Muggle customer happens to be an undercover Ministry-worker, irrespective of how discreet you try to be? Is it really worth the risk of getting fined or, worse, having some International-Statute-of-Secrecy law being used against you?

Witches and wizards are probably hesitant to place themselves at risk for the sake of helping random Muggles -- or any Muggles, for that matter. Hell, I'm not even sure if the Muggle-borns would put themselves at risk once they've become accustomed to their new world. Perhaps they'd slip their close family a potion or two and ask them to keep quiet about it?

Also, who knows how quick the potions-as-alternative-medicine scenario could spiral out of control?

** Likely, some people have done it at the small scale. They'd be the village wise woman that trade "holistic remedies" for barter. The ministry would probably crackdown on anyone attempting a more ambitious business model. There is a second issue at play as well. The muggle and wizard economies are pretty disjointed. Most wizards and witches have no use for muggle money and regularly converting it at Gringotts would quickly out them to the ministry.

** I would say *some* potions work on Muggles. Nobody is selling the cure for common cold in the Muggle drugshops, so it is probably not working for us.

Although, that would be a nice prompt: Vernon Dursley when finally hit by that heart attack also completely changes his heart figuratively, finds the errors of his ways towards Harry, both him and Petunia honestly apologize, and all three try to work on their reconciliation. As a sign of peace-making, Harry gives Vernon the Cholesterol-purging Potion, which completely cleans his veins of Atherosclerosis.
