** Sweet mother of venus, this is the story I need to write.

"Gee Draco, what do you want to do tonight?"

"The same thing we do every night Pansy, try to take over Hogwarts!"

/Malfoy and Pansy, Malfoy and Pansy/

/One is a prick, the others a bit dim/

/They're Slytherin Prefects/

/Their ambitions are defects/

/Malfy and Pansy/

*** Not bad, but I think I'd prefer this one:

"Gee, Crabbe, what do you want to do today?"

"The same thing we to every day, Goyle... endure Malfoy, then plot to STEAL ALL HIS MONEY!"

/They're Crabbe-y and the Goyle,\\
Yes, Crabbe-y and the Goyle,\\
One's not intelligent, the other's not loyal!\\
They're henchmen to a jerk\\
Who drives them both berserk,\\
They're shabby,\\
They're Crabbe-y and the Goyle, Goyle, Goyle, Goyle,\\
Goyle, Goyle, Goyle, Goyle,\\
Goyle!/

/Inside the magic school,\\
Their scheme is quickly told:\\
They'll make Malfoy look a fool,\\
And take off with his gold!/

/They're Crabbe-y and the Goyle,\\
Yes, Crabbe-y and the Goyle,\\
They continue to toil\\
For a plan that won't spoil!\\
They're gonna make a splash,\\
And then get all the cash!\\
They're grabby,\\
They're Crabbe-y and the Goyle, Goyle, Goyle, Goyle,\\
Goyle, Goyle, Goyle, Goyle,\\
AND MALFOY!/

**** I was mentally concocting a thought that Malfoy and his goons and such were basically killjoys for the rest of their yearmates in Slytherin and that's why we don't see hilarious shenanigans from Harry's view, but your idea is much better. And so are your lyrics.

What is the source for this meme?

**** Pinky and the Brain. Really good cartoon from the 1990s about two white lab mice who keep trying to take over the world.
