What are some things in fanfiction that don't really ever change? For example, in all my time reading fanfiction, Fred & George are either

A) Only mentioned when they talk about the weasley family as a whole

or

B) Super good guys.

There aren't really any asshole Fred & George fics that I can think of.

But yeah, what are things in fanfiction that you NEVER see changed?


** All the good guys just love Luna. Most of the cases it is insta-love. It generally goes like thus: Character meets Luna -> Luna says /something something/ nargles /something/ -> Character be like "Y U so weird" -> Luna says something something super duper perceptive -> Character be like "Omg this makes so much sense! U so amazing!"

It really makes no sense whatsoever.

She always has to be shoehorned into any AU fic set at Hogwarts, regardless of whether it makes sense of not. Even the most no-nonsense and amoral of characters just /have/ to like Luna.

Of course, then there is seer!Luna, but I'm not even going there.

*** there's really only two viable ways to go with luna, amp up the crazy or explain it away as a defence mechanism. fanfics tend to go straight to best friend when anyone displays any emotional depth beyond snape-level. mature harry gets this all the time, like the 'books are people' conversation with hermione you always get.

** The kitchens at Hogwarts. I think everyone just loves the canon kitchens so much (elves that will give you whatever you want!?) that they don't change the description at all. If we're honest though, this would lead to crazy amounts of childhood obesity. Maybe they should change the kitchens lol.

To be fair, I'm willing to bet most of the students don't know where the kitchens are (between being in an out of the way place and the fact that you have to tickle the pear I don't see many students outside of those who like to explore everywhere finding it)

** On the Way to Greatness and The Lie I've Lived feature Fred & George who are antagonistic to a problematic degree.

I believe it was Retribution by justcourbeau wherein the twins butt heads about product testing strategies. Fred is for a moderate amount of testing, focusing on using their products as intended; George, supported by Hermione, is for more thorough testing, even though it's more time consuming. Not exactly "super good" on Fred's part -- a bit reckless.

*** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/Well Groomed Mind/]] during his “Hogwarts is a very low quality educational establishment” rant to Umbridge Harry mentions how F&G made the human testing of their products on (especially low year) school children a part of their business model and how unhappy he is with that.

(spoilers) In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][/Sitra Ahra,/]] IIRC, F&G have a major Face--Heel Turn and break Harry's trust, after which their personalities switch from chaotic tricksters to evil bullies who just happen to also find cruel prank-jokes amusing. They were kinda being mind-controlled though, so this example may be inapplicable.

Do you mean the stupid finish each others sentences "twinspeak" or the realistic almost sixth sense silent communication that's been documented between actual twins in real life. Because the first is way overused due to one or two times it happened in canon but the second one is ingrained from twins knowing each other on a deeper level than most people can ever hope to achieve and being able to read one another's body language almost perfectly in any situation.

** One with evil!pervert!fred!george is Harry Potter and rejected path. But don't bother with this fic, I read few chapters because recommendations until I gave up as that fic is almost pure smut.

** I've seen a few asshole!twins story. I always assumed they were written by people who were either bullied or loudly proclaimed themselves to be sjws because they're so poorly written. I've seen a couple where harry or hermione calls them out as bullies and in one they have a hard look at their actions but i don't remember if there was any sort of resolution on that one or where i read it.
