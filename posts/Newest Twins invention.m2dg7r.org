It's the start of sixth year and even when they are now out of Hogwarts, the twins planned their biggest prank yet, even bigger than the swamp. They made use of their contacts to the kitchens to get the house elves to put a potion in the welcome feats, effectively making the whole staff and students drink it.

The potion can be any number of things you want, but it works best with something speech-based:

a) The drinker of the potion has to promote WWW every now and then (Imagine Snape doing so halfway through class)

b) The drinker starts talks nonsense stuff every now and then (like DUmbledore's start of term words)

c) THe drinker swears every other sentence (Especially interesting on Hermione, McGonagall or someone like Cho...)

d) Good ol' Veritaserum, the drinker has to tell the truth in everything he says (Harry and Dumbledore would struggle here... and you can add Romione, or any number of pairings with the typical admit feelings subplot)

You can say... "Meh, this has been done before"... and you would certainly be right... or, will you?

Of course there's a catch! The potion is permanent no way, find a cure or reverse it, at least not quickly... unless... you apply the safe measure conceived by the twins. A single thing that can cancel the potion, which, even when simple, does set doubts for more than one. In order to get free of the effects of the potion, you need to slap Malfoy. Yes, that specific. The twins got a hair of him as an ingredient or something.

And I am not talking a simple slap. It has to be HIMYM level. It requires to be given with all your strength.

So you have McGonagall growing rather annoyed with the potion, but not considering the cure for principles. Dumbledore who would be on the same boat if the potion was something silly, but if it were Veritaserum, would try to find a way out desperately. Draco growing paranoid about his fellow housemates eyeing him in every corner. And of course there's Snape, who made a vow to keep him safe and want to slap him, but can't. McGonagall sending detentions to anyone who turns suddenly cured of the potion.

Bonus points if the day after the potion Ron walks calmly not affected by the effects of the potion, and Hermione questions him annoyed. At which Ron answers lightly that he went to slap Malfoy at first time that day. (Could swap Ron for Ginny)


** When a Death Eater's kid writes home about the prank, it reaches also Voldemort's ears. He finds it really funny so he decides to have Draco killed as soon as possible so that no one can cure themselves of that potion's effects anymore. Of course this is a massive PR failure for the twins with angry students and angry parents so either their shop is burned down and the twins get lynched my an angry mob in the case of an excessive effect or they go bankrupt in case of milder effects. This way Voldemort also gets his revenge for the U-No-Poo joke.

*** If they thought of that, they probably would change the cancel clause to probably something along the lines of not only slapping Draco, but pretty much any Death Eater or change it to have someone do something else?
