I was just reading a recommended Harry adopted by Grangers story and then out of NOWHERE, THIS POPPED UP!!! WHY?! JUST WHY? How did all of FANON get the same idea to make Tonks into a pedophile?! Why was this even fucking needed? Why put this in there? In the most INNOCUOUS fics ever, if Tonks is in it, COUNT ON HER TO MAKE SEXUALLY PREDATORY REMARKS TO AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD BOY!

[[https://imgur.com/a/ANnfvAp]]

Yes seriously, what the helling fuck shit?

Authors who write this fucking sick bullshit, WHY do you do it?

And why did MULTIPLE AUTHORS across the fandom decide to do this to her character?

Do you seriously think this is her character?

There was another one where Harry is literally caught by Snape being statutory raped by Tonks, and then another one where Harry goes to live with Andromeda and Tonks starts fucking creeping on him immediately too!

WHY?!

It isn't cute, it isn't funny, it's disturbing and creepy! It doesn't make Tonks cool or quirky, it makes her sick and fucking creepy!

And I do not want to hear double standard fucking defense bullshit!!! Even if it's not a twenty year old man doing this to an eleven year old girl, it's still fucking creepy and uncomfortable!

I WOULD KNOW! My mother made remarks like that to me ALL THE TIME, along with actually molesting me at nights. It's not FUN, it's not COOL! I think people who write this shit don't even know what it's like to be on the receiving end of a bigger, stronger person leering at you and commenting on you and touching all over you! Because if they did they'd know it's not cute or funny to go through!

SO STOP PUTTING IT IN YOUR FUCKING FICS LIKE ITS FUCKING CUTE OR FUNNY!!!!!!!


** Authors often fail to do the genderbender check: swap the genders of the characters in a scene and check if it is still funny or has become creepy.

*** Agreed! If something is not ok for men (and in this case/scene the man would probably be up on charges of (sexual) harassment!), then it's not ok for women either and no amount of arguing will make it so (no, women aren't allowed to hit men either, especially if men are going to jail for hitting women!)

** I haven't read the rest of the fic you screenshotted, but being called a “cute kid” by an adult in isolation doesn't seem like a predatory remark, and /without knowing anything else that happens in this fic/ I would probably assume that the description of Harry blushing and whatnot is a result of Harry reading too much into a comment from a girl he thinks is pretty.

Its probably a strange form of author wish-fulfillment; the author remembers when they were a kid and had a crush on an older girl, and then they write a fic where such a relationship happens without thinking too hard about the real life consequences and why that would be really unpleasant. There is a lot of that kind of thing in fanfiction, but I try to remember that it's just a free story about wizards I'm reading online and just because something cannot happen healthily in real life doesn't mean it shouldn't be written about. For me, when I encounter that kind of theme in fiction treated unrealistically, it's like a thought exercise to imagine the implications of a world where various aspects of our understanding of “consent” magically do not exist.

** So was I the only kid at weddings and such where people would call me cute and have me blush. That's a thing right. I am not crazy. It's not gross, to me this seems like a normal interaction with an older lady (early 20s) my girlfriend does it to my cousins all the time (minus the wink). If later she actually tries anything then yes she is gross, but at the moment it just seems like a playful complement.

** Not to defend this, but Tonks was predatory in canon too. Not necessarily to kids, but that scene in Half-Blood Prince where she grabs Remus, shakes him, and tells him it doesn't matter that he keeps saying no, she's going to keep pursuing him, puts her firmly in the domestic abuser category. It doesn't seem out-of character that a person who did that would also prey on kids.

I'm not opposed to fics with dark themes, but yeah, I hope the writers understand that they're writing something dark, and don't make light of it.

I'd like some numbers/statistics for this! Yes, I know that cops often cover for each other (that's why "Internal Affairs" shouldn't be staffed with cops, but by the public and every case should be made public, so that no dirty cop can dodge/hide behind the testimony of other cops etc.), still:

****** People have this weird thing where they forget that Harry Potter is written by a person who can make mistakes, and that the characters in it aren't real people that would respond to situations like real people would. That scene was meant to show how Tonks was devoted to Remus and that his being a werewolf didn't matter to her. In canon Remus wants to be with her but doesn't think he, as a werewolf, deserves her. Their canon relationship as a whole was meant to show a man who thought his disease meant he didn't deserve her or love in general, and that she wanted him to see that was wrong and that she loved him regardless.

But hey context doesn't matter so Tonks is an abuser and Remus' hangups on accepting love don't matter /s

** Tonks has always been a bit.. I don't know if dodgy is the right word, but she definitely lacks the stricter morals you'd normally find with professional Aurors.

I think the reason there's so many Harry/Tonks ships is because out of all the Harry/Older Woman ships there are, thats the one that could most realistically have happened in canon. Now, whether or not in she was actually as ‘dodgy' as she appeared or if it was just a flirtatious/tomboyish act I couldn't say. Personally a lot of my irl humour is flirting-based so I could sympathise with that, in fact I'm inclined to believe such is the case for Tonks since that aspect of her personality seemed to calm down after getting into a relationship.

Also, I don't know where OP is from so this could end up being irrelevant, but in the UK the age of consent is 16, which means from Order of Phoenix onwards (where Tonks was introduced) it isn't pedophilia.

*** Maybe that comes with the territory? I mean Tonks can basically be anybody (we don't know if she can fake being male 100%, but even if she can't grow testicals she can otherwise still appear male!) she wants to be...maybe that does screw with ones morals and look on life etc.?

I mean I do loath thieves normally, but if I could change my appearance like Mystique (from X-Men) or Tonks can? You bet I'd probably steal stuff because no camera would enable them to catch me easily (just switch appearance!)

Okay, you're either trying hard to troll/ shitpost or really need help. Help that you probably won't get from an internet forum about fanfiction. I've never used one, but as far as I understand it there are phone lines for children you can call anonymously and get help. Or visit a psychiatrist if you're an adult.
