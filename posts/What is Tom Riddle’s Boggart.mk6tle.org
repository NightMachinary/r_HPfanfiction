His own corpse?

How would you represent Death in a compelling way?

*** Yes, I suppose I should have worded it differently. I'm writing a Tom centered fic around his Hogwarts years.

Tom's afraid of more than death (IMO) he's terrified of being /nothing/, being /irrelevant./ Or perhaps in his earlier years of being /not special./

Now that I think of it more, there's a lot of available character growth. It would be really interesting if Tom's boggart (in say his 2nd year) was himself, but unable to perform magic.

Then in later years, it was his own corpse. Maybe during WWII? During the Blitz?

I'm sorry to be so long winded but it seems terribly strange that Tom would fear death at such a young age unless he'd lived through something terrible.

Most kids wouldn't choose that, even Ron after nearly dying in PS/CoS doesn't fear petrification/death or even the chess piece that nearly killed him- but spiders.

***** Maybe, but that's very singular. He's afraid of what the bomb /represents/. The bomb might kill him but so could the /cold/ in winter when London burned less fuel so their lights wouldn't be signals blaring their position to the Luftwaffe.

He's likely never /seen/ a bomb in person, but he's heard sirens ripping open the night, and felt the /dread/ of having to sit in shelters and /wait./ Knowing tonight might be the night you don't see the morning. Feeling helpless, alone. Knowing if you were older, better, smarter, more powerful- that none of this could touch you.

Or at least that's how i think of it lol.

****** Air raid siren, or honestly... even an airplane. Years ago, I saw a Christmas special for... I want to say The Waltons? ... which had a couple British orphans from London in America during the war. They saw a plane flying overhead while out for a walk to find a Christmas tree, and freaked the fuck out: ran and cowered in a ditch.

It stuck with me, and I feel like something similar would work for Tom. It's death, and helplessness, and fear wrapped up in resentment because the Headmaster sent him back to a war zone during summer holidays.

An unrelated idea would be his mum telling him that he wasn't actually wanted.

****** I'm laughing in my other post because a bomb was what I used in one of my fics to represent Tom's boggart. Well, not "a bomb," but rather the concept of bombs. I actually think the concept of bomb doing what bombs do would have been a fitting visual and auditory representation of Tom's greatest fear at the time of facing a boggart (assuming that's third year or close), rather than not being representative enough. Yes, the fear was borne of the waiting and the not knowing what was going to happen, and also knowing that he had magic but realizing it probably wouldn't save him from a bomb. But what /caused/ it in the first place was the idea that a single thing - a bomb - could end everything, regardless of his power or ability. It was a representation not only of the reason he had to suffer through those nights in the shelter, but also of the weakness he still possessed at the time, which should have, by then, been lessened by his being a wizard. The Boggart would want to manifest itself into something that would create that fear that was also a visual representation. So, in my fic, I have both an explosion and the atmosphere that occurs during/afterwards (the sound of sirens, the smoke, the smell).

****** I imagine he was bullied and hated for at least the first year because he was assumed to be Muggleborn. And he studies and learns and plants the seed of doubt in some people's heads- “well, I don't know who my parents are. But if I'm this powerful, could they really be Muggles?” and thus uses their own prejudice against them. If they thought Tom was Muggleborn then they'd have to admit that Muggleborns could be powerful so he /forces/ them to see and acknowledge his power so they have to assume he's pureblood or else abandon their belief system. Maybe the purebloods point out his aristocratic looks- “I'm sure those are Black cheekbones, that's a Greengrass nose”- and they speculate which Pureblood man they think had an affair and dropped his bastard off at the orphanage.

And then he reveals his Parseltongue and he's revered. This explains the power he's had all along, to the purebloods this is proof that they're right. His lack of parents almost becomes an advantage then because he can plant any rumour he likes- hell, he could say that Slytherin himself grew him and left him in stasis until “the time came to make the wizarding world great again”, he could say he's prophesied to rise up and rule.

******* Exactly my thoughts as well! I don't imagine that Tom's first year was much fun for him, a “mudblood” in Slytherin, worse a /poor/ mudblood with no family to speak of?

It would have been a trial by fire. I do love your idea that they all saw bits of themselves in him, after Tom had proved his magical ability. And, as you said, his features are aristocratic, Harry always notes how /handsome/ he is.

And he's charismatic, /knowing/ people and how they think really can't be underestimated.

** If it's early in his Hogwarts career, the kids at the orphanage who tormented him, or possibly Dumbledore setting fire to things.

If it's late in his Hogwarts career, it would be a bomb or a German bomber jet, because as other people in the fandom have pointed out, Dumbledore forced him to return to the orphanage DURING THE BLITZ. So Voldemort, in spite of his LARP as being a pureblooded Lord, is presumably perfectly aware of muggle weapons and how dangerous they can be, because he was traumatized by them as a teenager.

If it's when he's an adult, it would definitely be his own corpse, and I'm pretty sure Rowling confirmed that somewhere.

*** I understand where you're coming from with the other children at the orphanage, and while they certainly impacted him I don't think that it would have been to the extent that they would be his greatest fear. i think his superiority and sense that he was above them gave him some needed distance to remove himself from the situation to some extent.

**** What the children at the orphanage did to him was impactful enough that he chose the site where he got his revenge as a hiding place for a piece of his soul. They absolutely WERE that impactful. Obviously they aren't his greatest fear after he becomes a teenager, but they absolutely were when he was still a child.

I stand by what I said. His childhood boggart would be the children who tormented him at the orphanage. His teenage boggart would either be him as an utter failure or some representation of the Blitz, depending on when it happens. His adult boggart would absolutely be his dead body.

E.g. being a small ugly child with dirty rags covering his body while begging people for money/food. Or maybe the Boggart can take a form of that mutilated Horcrux baby as it was described in the King's Cross limbo.

Personal experience talking here: to make it compelling, make sure it's a case of Tom not wanting to face the wrath of someone else. Kinda like an eye for an eye situation. You can do so many things with it, all the way to him being quite the killer in the Muggle world as well

**** A good way to phrase it is he is either blamed for a death he didn't do and is threatened, or someone knows he killed person and swears that they'll kill him in revenge.

You can do a lot with the guilt of him being blamed due to his own negligence or whatever or that threat being followed through

** I think his greatest fear would be more of a root of his late fear of death, which is not so much to do with death itself but what it represents. I think to him the connotations of death are a sort of failure of sorts - that he has failed in proving others assumptions of his mediocrity wrong , and that through death he has no choice anymore in how he is remembered and what his legacy is. He needed to be above the orphanage boys who taunted him to distance himself from them and try to dissuade himself from acting over their infantile taunts. He was an orphan and so he had nothing to lose and all to gain. He knew his strengths and he was confident of his future place into he world, so I think his greatest fear would be normalcy and mediocrity, two things which he could not tolerate even from a very young age as a copining mechanism from his hard, and traumatic life (from bullying, being an orphan, ww2, being "different ", poor living conditions, etc)
