I never really cared for anything with creature inheritance, The Most Ancient and Noble heir, or extremely manipulative Dumbledore, but sometimes I'll give a fic a shot with those attributes and find myself pleasantly surprised.

linkao3(The New Trio And The Philosopher's Stone) caught me off guard. I was looking for Hermione/Fred fics and they're very much a side item but I found it charming regardless and keep hoping for an update. It has all three things I normally dislike, but somehow it works for me.

What's your exception to the rule?


** The Rise of Wizards has almost all of the tropes I hate: Manipulative yet way too idealistic Dumbledore, Weasleys getting money from Dumbledore, King Harry, bashing, overnight OP Harry, etc., but I think it's such a fun read.

*** Forgot about that one! Back when I used to read manipulative Dumbledore/Super Harry that was one of my all time favorites. Since you like that, you might want to check out some of Colt01's works since they have similar strengths (and weaknesses).

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

** linkffn(The Reluctant Lord by SmallBurnyThing) has the distinction of having all the tropes, cliches, and fanon that I normally despise, including, but not limited to, powerful!Harry, "magical power", lordships, harem, submissive!occasionalDamsel!Hermione, manipulative!Dumbledore, treacherous!Weasleys (including amortentia!Molly and inept!Ron, but OK!Twins), declining wizarding world, and probably many others; but it does so in such a rich, imaginative, and entertaining manner that I was genuinely saddened when the author posted a chapter officially abandoning the story and outlining what he or she had planned.

  After successfully managing to gain custody of Harry, Remus and Sirius have raised Harry well. He knows that he's loved, and well-treated, and he's friends with Ron and Neville. However, a visit to Gringotts on Harry's tenth birthday to get him confirmed as the heir to the Potter and Black Houses proves that Dumbledore has done something awful to Harry, and they realise they must remain cautious of him.This leads us to Harry's very well-known first year at Hogwarts, but this time with Draco, Neville, and Hermione by his side.~~~~~~~~~~~Just a note: Most of the relationships will start to happen in the third book. It's my plan to work through all the canon books. This first one starts out echoing canon very closely, but will become quite AU after the first few books.Also, I'm cross-posting this on Wattpad under the username Dazla98, because why not?
