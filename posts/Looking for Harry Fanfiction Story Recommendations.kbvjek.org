Hello to any and all that read this post, and thank you for stopping in ;) Now that I have you here, I am looking for some story recommendations, but specific ones. You see I am looking for ones that are similar to Batsutousai 's Xerosis & Shivani's Fes2. I love these 2 stories, and would love to read stories that have the pairing of Harry/Tom and are similar to these to stories, don't have to be exact, obviously, ;) but similar (do-over, Harry is not so gullible, Harry/Tom pairing, etc)

So if you know of any stories out there that meet these criteria, please let me know, because I am always into reading new stories. (also please if they can be completed, or regularly updated ;) that would be nice)


** Again and Again by Athey (Athy? One of the two spellings.) It's one of my favorites.
