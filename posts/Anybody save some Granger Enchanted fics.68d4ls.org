It was a bit of a niche market but I was very put-out when I discovered it went under (like a year late, I know, I've been out of the loop).

Does anyone have any of those stories saved? Especially by author "FlowersBecomeScreens," she has a few posted up on ff.net but not some of my favorites.

Also, anything 20k+ words that's passably well-written.


** There's a Facebook group called Granger Enchanted Survivors where people post alternate links to the stories. Usually most of the authors are on the page and can share copies of their stories if they want to.

*** This is the only time I wish I still have a FB.

Would you happen to know if they're making another website?
