On that topic: after Neville becomes Herbology professor, who becomes the Head of Hufflepuff (assuming he becomes Head of Gryffindor)? Is there any fanon on this that people tipically enjoy?

I'm not sure if I should create new characters for these or pick existing ones to teach. Wanted to hear how you guys feel about the topic.


** I think new characters are generally the best option, since you've got all sorts of possibilities with them. Or take some very minor characters. I think it's strange in fics when half the staff is from the DA

Depending on when you're writing, you might also want to retire some of the other professors. Slughorn probably wouldn't keep going for too long, as the main example, but others might too.

**** Eh, then I guess I better work out which kind of character should take that seat as well as possibly become head of Hufflepuff.

** McGonagall can still teach transfiguration, even as Headmistress. It isn't as if being headmistress prevents her from teaching. I for one never understood why Dumbledore never taught any classes. Both the Principal and Vice Principal in my school taught classes.

Muggle Studies and Defence against the Dark Arts can be taught by anyone qualified.

*** Thing about being Headmaster is that it often requires them to represent the school in many outside affairs, specially for the Ministry, which would result in a need for a frequent teacher substitutions, that being far from ideal. In either case, another staff member would be necessary.

*** The headmaster and deputies at my school still taught, but far less than the regular teachers. Hogwarts teachers are already overworked. I could see her having time for NEWT transfiguration (or, alternatively, the first years), but not all the other years

** I've read some fics where Bill Weasley ends up teaching (either DADA or something like ancient tunes, which he would have used as a curse-breaker).

For potions, I've read one where Draco Malfoy ends up teaching that, and it works but kind of feels like a cop out.

I guess the thing to remember is that a lot of the professors at Hogwarts were characters we never met and who were rarely even named. Who taught Arithmancy for example? I think Hermione maybe says Professor Vector's name once or twice in passing. So you don't necessarily need to have a professor developed as a character for every subject - just your main plot point ones.

That said ... a former Auror would make sense for DADA, transfiguration could be an OC (or older student not ever really mentioned in canon). I definitely think Muggle studies would need to be a Muggleborn (or at least a half blood who spends a lot of time in the Muggle world) - probably OC.

*** I do like the idea of Bill Weasley teaching DADA (specially since I too am writing about a curse-breaker) though I really thought it be funny and ironic to have Arthur Weasley teach Muggle Studies... to my muggleborn character lol. I'm just not sure if it'd be appropriate to have Weasley father and son teaching at Hogwarts (specially as Bill would eventually teach for his own children :/)

Other than that, Transfiguration is really the seat I'm most indecisive on. I'm doing a scan on canon characters who could perhaps fit the role because I'm really out of ideas for a teacher OC lol.

**** My work-around for that has sometimes been to pick a surname you know is canon but create an OC. So like someone from a family you know exists so you have a bit of background of what they might be like but can create them from new.

****** Doesn't have to be adult characters. Maybe Katie Bell has an uncle whose great at transfiguration! Things like that.

But also some suggestions of other names we know: - Cattermole (the guy Ron polyjuices into is Reg Cattermole) - Chang (Cho's family) - Clearwater (Percy's girlfriend was Penelope Clearwater) - Davies (Roger Davies dates Fleur and Cho at various points) - Jordan (as in Lee) - Johnson (as in Angelina) - a ton more! Here's a list: [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_characters#Characters_by_surname]]

For Muggle studies maybe someone like Arabella Figg? A squib whose lived in the muggle world could be a cool teacher for that!

** New characters all the way.

Mugglestudies? A muggleborn. Or a muggle parent of a muggleborn/halfblood graduate. I'm more partial to the parent one though. It forces the class to interact with a muggle, and the muggle will clearly know what the hell they are talking about.

As for the heads of house, why not recruit graduates on a term by term basis. It gives the story some flair, and prevents a lot of the crap that happened in canon. Snape couldn't be impartial to save his life, Flitwick couldn't spot systematic bullying in his own house against one of his own. And McGonagall was barely doing her job as head of house, if she was at all. I can't think of anything against Sprout. This would give students someone to talk to if say... Voldemort was after the stone. Or they were being tortured by a ministry stooge. Or if they were homesick. It would literally be their job. And they can't be "too busy" to do it.

Assistant Headmaster: Make it a full time position. Do not make another McGonagall. Hell, you could make them the final arbiter for complaints against staff. You could even make them a pure administrator. Percy would love this job.

Headmaster: No other full-time positions. Don't want another Dumbledore.

As for these changes? You could have the trio grab a bunch of signatures to force them to do this. That could be a chapter by itself: "It wasn't that bad" "I was tortured. You told me to keep my head down." "lolwut?!"

** From existing characters:

Tonks might be good for DADA

Since the Weasleys are empty nesters now,and I'm not sure if they ever rebuilt the burrow. They could decide to teach.

Mr Weasley could be muggle studies, but I'd write him enthusiastic, but not terribly good at it.

Mrs Weasley could be transfiguration.
