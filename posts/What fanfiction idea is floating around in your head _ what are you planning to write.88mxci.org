For me, I'm still planning on writing a pirate / exploration age fanfic, especially since I spent so much time working on a US American history based academic paper. I still have yet to write it though.

I also want to play around with Ginny and create some slice of life fics. I want to write a fic which does not revolve around her being the sister to 6 brothers or the love of Harry.


** Lupin runs into Hagrid at the Leaky Calderon, gets it in his head to see Harry, and heads down to Surrey. He accidentally kidnaps the kid, and then ends up asking Mad-eye what to do. The old Auror tells him to get the kid out of England, recommends he apply at Durmstrang. All is (basically) well until Sirius breaks out of Azkaban and catches Peter. Lupin and Harry go to Hogwarts with Karkaroff and the tournament hopefuls to visit Sirius.

With an angry godfather, an overprotective werewolf, and a former death eater in his corner a very different Harry Potter takes on a very different tournement.

I just need to figure out what has happened at Hogwarts while Harry is at Durmstrang.

**** Harry is not the catalyst for those events they would still happen. The question is how would things play out without Harry there Voldemort still possesses Quirrell and goes after the stone, but maybe Hermione dies from the troll. The dairy is still sent to Hogwarts to avoid it being found in a raid, but Ginny dies and maybe Hagrid isn't let out of Azkaban. Sirius still sees a picture of Peter's rat form in the paper and escapes, but without Harry and Lupin there he manages to take him alive and turn him over to say, McGonagall.

Also the 'reason to be there' is to visit a newly exonerated Sirius. The whole reason I want to write this is to contrast how the 'evil' people from the 'dark' school would stand by one of their own.

***** Harry doesn't get to travel with a delegation of 7th years just because he wants to. That isn't a reason.

As for the canon events happening despite Harry's absence, you're wrong. It's simple chaos theory, you change one thing, you change everything. You can still have some events happen if you want them too, author privilege, but to expect things to have happened because they did in canon is ridiculous. Especially things that are happenstance like Hermione being upset on Halloween.

Ultimately this is your story and you can write what you want. However you'd have a much better time writing about a 17 year old Harry competing in a tournament than a 14 who isn't suppose to be there, but is.

****** I've never heard anyone want to write a version where Harry is the proper age for the tournament, before you. It's the opposite of all the OP Harry wish fulfillment fic out there. But it doesn't sound fun to me.

And yes things like Hermione being in the bathroom could change, it doesn't have to happen that way. Like I said I'm still deciding what happens at Hogwarts. The only thing I know for sure is that Sirius will escape and get Peter, and turn him in.

But fiction needs to make more sense and be more believable than real life. Fiction can't run on chaos. There are things that happened, and would happen, because they were not influenced by Harry's presence. It's a lot easier to figure out why Harry is there (He and Remus tagged along with the delegation to see the newly exonerated Sirius), then explain why nothing happened while he wasn't there. Harry is not the catalyst for the events of the first three books. Nor is he the real target of the plot in the first three books. Things would happen. Not the same things, but not nothing. Like Hagrid getting the dragon egg will happen, but without Harry and crew it won't just quietly be whisked off to the preserve.

******* You're correct, fiction has to have an element of belief. The problem you're not seeing is that an early divergence means that nothing is the same. Or at least nothing has to be the same.

Maybe you want Quirrellmort to still happen, you can. It's perfectly acceptable that it would, but it needs to be relevant to your fic. Dumbledore needs conformation about Voldemort's lingering presence, or whatever. What isn't important is how it played out in Harry's absence unless it effects the story directly, and there is no reason that it should. Hagrid has a dragon, who cares? Dumbledore at some point finds out and sends it away. Maybe Hagrid has to do some remodeling. What the hell does that have to do with Harry years later? Or Hagrid never gets the dragon egg at all, it doesn't effect the story so it doesn't matter. Things can happen the same as canon, but to expect them too is ridiculous and bad writing.

On the matter of Harry traveling to Hogwarts 4th year. We've already agreed on belief, and Harry a 14 year old, going on a school trip that is for only 17 year olds, is not such. It doesn't matter why he wants to go. Unless Harry is leaving Durmstrang to attend Hogwarts than he has no reason to be there. That is why I suggested older. People in this fandom become so fixated on canon that they ignore the fact that they can change things wholesale.

--------------

I'm done arguing this, since the effort has long since eclipsed my interest. My point is simply that just because things happened a certain way in canon is no reason to expect that they happened in your story that changed things early on. Even if there isn't a direct line between the events.

**** I have a few directions plotted. But here's the gist.

1. Dumbledore would know almost instantly that Harry Potter is different. The small sneers when he spoke to the boy, the anger and annoyance. He would quickly place it as Voldemort. He would not act, knowing that Tom, while a psychopath, was getting the better deal and would not openly attack while at Hogwarts. He ignored Tom and would focus more heavily on Voldemort, who would be his Harry. He would have insane hope that the boy would tear the Death Eaters down from the inside.

2. Tom would parade around in Harry Potter's body, using his fame as a conduit to syphon followers. He realises really early on that Harry Potter had the same, if not more, political clout than he had. He uses Potter's memories and acts like him, slowly amassing a bunch of Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor followers.

3. Harry would be instantly disgusted at what he was. He knew all of Voldemort's memories, his torture sessions, his crazy rituals, making a Horcux, what the Horcruxes were and where they were located. He would halt the attacks on Muggles for as long as he could, lying about bigger, grander things. His pacifist route would fail after a few weeks, the Death Eaters wanting chaos. He would protect his title, for reasons unknown aside from pride, and he would get lost in that.

I have a few more things to plan, but Harry would become the villain. No dark magic addiction, or the Death Eaters being good guys. They would be world class evil. P.S: No redemption, either. I hate redemption. ;)

I could use someone to bounce ideas from, but this fic probably won't see the light of day for another 6+ months! xD

Using Keacher, he manages to get a hold of Harry and his friends after Christmas in his 5th year. Voldemort demands Harry join him or watch his friends die.

It's going to be a extremely dark three book series. I'm currently on chapter 8 of 18 for the first book. I'm planning to write the entire first book before posting it.

My second idea is Harry is convicted of the murder of Cedric and sentenced to Azkaban. Desperate, Dumbledore demands a unbreakable vow from Grindlewald in exchange for his help at breaking into Azkaban and saving Harry. It will be a fic of Harry, Dumbledore and Grindlewald and their adventures in Europe as they flee as public enemy number one.

** 11 years old femHarry travels back in time after a stranger in the streets gives her a small orb called Kaleidoscope. She's found wandering by an old man named Fleamont who happens to share her surname. Later, she learns he's actually her grandfather, and that her parents are very much alive.

The story mostly focus in femHarry's relationship with her paternal grandparents and James, who's torn between being happy about the fact he managed to marry Lilly in the future and devastated that femHarry doesn't know he's actually her father, meaning that something bad happened to him.

I like the idea of a pre-Hogwarts femHarry travelling back in time since she doesn't actually know anything about Voldemort or who's responsible of her parents' demise. Therefore, James doesn't actually know how to avoid getting killed since the gap between him then and the date of his death is too wide. Plus, I decided to make Harry a girl because I find a father-daughter relationship to be more interesting to write, and that the innocence of a girl at her age is more touching. Oh, and that Euphemia always wanted a daughter, so she spoils femHarry rotten just like she did with James.

** I have two fics that have been in my mind for a long time. I've got outlines and wrote a bunch of short scenes for both. I'm just having such a hard time bringing it together. Not giving up though.

1. SG1 crossover. The veil is a one-way transportation device deliberately modeled after the Stargate during Ra's rule on Earth. After the war, Kingsley discovers veil research carried out during Voldemort's regime. He authorizes a team to go through. Harry takes the lead, already fixated on the veil because the Ressurection Stone couldn't reach Sirius ande struggling as his auror duties are continually hindered by his fame. (Ginny, Dean, Luna, and Lavender are also on the team.)

2. Post-war fic dealing with the social and political consequences of what happened. Mostly follows Harry, but he's dealing with a bunch of new people and situations as he figures out who he needs to be in a community close to collapsing.

** I have a bunch of ideas for stories written down, but the only Harry Potter fic I've been seriously contemplating writing is a crossover with the first Dark Souls. Very limited appeal, I know, but I can't control what gets stuck in my head.

It'd take place near the end of the First Wizarding War, starting with Snape overhearing part of a /very/ different prophecy than in canon. The part Voldemort obtains would seem to paint his victory as certain, speaking of the coming of an immortal dark lord whose subjects "shall be known by [[https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Darksign][their mark]]". The remainder that only Dumbledore hears makes him think Riddle's redemption is possible, as it describes this dark lord as a savior. Unbeknownst to both the prophecy would actually be referring to the Chosen Undead who'd just arrived on their world, and this misunderstanding (and their actions due to it) would cause huge problems for every side in the ongoing war.

For the Dark Souls side of things, the basic idea is that since time and space become... /malleable/ whenever the First Flame is about to go out (this is the in-universe explanation for how co-op and NPC summoning works in the game - you're literally pulling other heroes from alternate timelines), one potential Chosen Undead decides to (ab)use this warping in an attempt to travel to a world where they've managed to break the cycle and learn their secret, but instead ends up on a world where the cycle never happened in the first place: the Earth of Harry Potter. The Dark Souls side of the crossover would be him trying to figure out why Earth never had an undead problem, meanwhile he and his companions are gradually sucked into the wizards' war.

The problem that's keeping this fic as just an idea for now is that I have no idea where to go plot-wise. I have an ending in mind for the Dark Souls side of things, but 99% of the story will focus on the wizarding world so that's not much help.

On the other hand, I really want to write it because while I have very little /plot/ written out, I have several character-driven scenes that just won't leave my head. I'm only bringing in two other Dark Souls characters, [[http://darksouls.wikidot.com/ingward][Ingward]] and [[http://darksouls.wikidot.com/quelaana-of-izalith][Quelana]], and each has scenes planned that I absolutely love. That, and the opportunity to write the Marauders in their prime, before the prophecy and treachery broke them.

** So, I rediscovered another an old plot bunny/story of mine.

It centers around the best friend of the niece of Professor Sprout named Kathryn or Kat. Her best friend is named Tabitha or Tabby

Get it TabbyKat?

They are/were the same age as the Marauders but Hufflepuffs.

The backstory is that during their sixth year in an attempt to make Lily jealous James asks Kat to go on a few dates with him. She agrees knowing he's close with Remus and she's fancied him from afar. Although, nobody but James, Kat, Tabby and eventually Lily will know about this arrangement and the secret will die with Lily and James while Tabby doesn't interact with Remus enough. Obviously, this upsets Remus.

This story was originally going to start in Harry's third year with Kat and Remus reuniting with a lot of more bitterness from Remus. Though, instead, it could begin in the Marauders sixth year and end maybe 1982.

I should've mentioned that most of my stories focus on OCs and romance.

** I've been bouncing around an idea for an Eclipse Phase crossover for quite some time now. My current outline involves future!Hermione sending back technology and knowledge (and just that, no memories or souls or what have you because [insert technobabble]) to prevent The Fall (think robot apocalypse secretly caused by mysterious aliens, if you don't know EP).

Hermione would receive the package shortly after getting home from her third year (no longer under Hogwarts' wards, and covered in temporal magic from a year of time-turning seems like a great target point for that kind of spell).

Armed with foreknowledge and a catalog of transhuman tech, Voldemort and his Deatheaters should be relatively easy to deal with. Which is good, because the real challenges were always going to be dragging the Wizarding World kicking and screaming into the modern era (and the open), keeping the mundane world from making the same disastrous choices it did the first time round and figuring out/dealing with the ETI that turned the TITANS against us and made them wipe out 90%+ of the species.

I'm not sure if I'll ever actually write this though, to be honest. It would basically be off the HP rails from the word go, the plot would involve a shit ton of of OCs and large scale socioeconomic changes once it broke out into the wider world and I'd have to create the ETI basically from whole cloth because the players are never really meant to interact directly with them so the EP rulebook only gives a couple of different vague ideas about what they could be up to for GMs to pick between.

** In progress: Tom takes over when Ginny tries to discard diary halfway through chamber. Left with no option, he attempts (and fails) to use Ginny's soul to reincarnate prematurely. Left with no other choice, he instead takes controller of Ginny's (now soulless) body.

Tom then refashons himself "Ginevra, Basalisk Slayer and Lockheart vanquisher", a new, more independent and confident personality. Then goes on misadventures including politics (Now a pureblood and not having to hide his heritage), deciding that Voldemorte is insane due to horocruxs (and he is the real Tom due to having 50% of a soul) and a quest to reintegrate them (including dating Harry Potter to get at the one in his scar).

I do have a ending in mind too :p. Just need to set aside time to write. And I haven't quite decided if I want the final resolution to be tragic, cliffy, or something silly like babies-ever-after...

Backlog concept: World where muggleborns get the short thrift by magic (similar to wildflowers in Magical Diary, families magically forced to 'forget' them and discreetly enforced loyalty to the magical communities). Second generation magicals are protected from this via their parents/family magic.

The magical bloid wars were really more complicated ('Evil' side wanting to isolate/remove muggleborns so they don't get magically enthralled, good side wanting to keep things as is). In particular, Tom being shown more sympathetically during his gathering forces phase. Then going insane because of horocruxs.

First is a shorter story called happy ever after with your generic fluff probably with a generic h/hr pairing to make people think its going to be just another pointless shit story. Then at the end of chapter one have Ron or x main character get hit by a bus and just die.

From there have Hermione's family die via a home robbery turning violent. She and harry track down the robbers but she freezes and they shoot her and she ends up dying. Harry struggles to deal with it for a little while, drinks too much and then kills himself.

No redemption, no second loves, no anything positive. Just a sad look at how real life goes sometimes and is not written about often.

** The second of my ideas an AU setting where the killing curse is an unforgivable because when you use it to kill another wizard you gain some of their knowledge or powers. Furthermore it is addictive not only for being dark magic but for the greed of gaining more power/knowledge. I am unsure if i want to have family magics be a thing in this story or just knowledge being closely guarded.

I want hogwarts to be a thing that used be a grand center of learning that is whispered about as a sign of how good things used to be. Diagon alley would not be a happy amazing place but rather something heavily guarded by the ministry.

The ministry would be heavily invested in hunting down people who use the curse.

Schooling is done at home with books and families passing down their magic.

For the main plot i want to have harry captured as a teenager unaware of magic after wondering too close to a wizarding pub that gets attacked. The attackers would round up everyone and put them in holding cells until they decided who kills whom in order to get powers. Harry hears them casting the spell over and over A scuffle happens when the gang members disagree over who gets a certain person to kill and harry manages to grab one of their wands and uses it to cast the one spell he knows and then escapes.

He struggles with learning about the new world and his need to cast the spell again and ends up using it on a mugger in london but it doesnt give him any relief as it was a muggle he kills so he sets off searching for the magic world and more wizards to kill.

** My third idea is probably not something that would be popular at all, a crossover with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emberverse_series][Emberverse series by S.M. Stirling]].

The date of the change would be pushed back 1 year to 1999.

Harry has opted not to go back to hogwarts or take a job with the ministry, instead he wants some time to clear his head and dumbledore's portrait suggests the old custom of a world tour after graduation. He starts in canada and works is way down into the states in the pacific northwest when the change happens.

Since electricity, guns and other forms of high energy density dont work I plan limiting wizarding powers somewhat as well. With the world going back to a somewhat pre industrialized state i want wizards in england to help rebuild and serve as a court wizard.

For the rest of the world I plan to mostly have them die along with everyone else with small groups surviving here and there. No large enclaves of wizards ruling everything.

Harry's storyline will have him meeting up with the bearkillers very early, possibly at the time of mike's plan going down. He will stick with them and hide his powers for a while but end up letting himself be known to the leadership when they are fighting the cannibals. He knows no real healing magic for serious wounds and the guilt of not being able to help those who die could be an issue.

He will eventually take up with the mckenzies for the most part possibly also joining the rangers.

A second storyline will be Hermione who has opted to also not go back to school, to the shock of many, but instead spends time looking for her parents and plans to live there with them for a while. She has recently found them when the change happens. This storyline will either be told in some flashbacks later on or only touched on rarely during the early story. Hermione will help her family escape the dying and make it down to new zealand. She ends up on the ship that picks up sir Nigel on his escape from england and also makes her way to Oregon where she meets up with harry again.

I sadly am not imaginative enough to change the big picture too much in terms of geopolitics in the pacific northwest and so would follow some of the canon of those books.

That being said its not another HP rewrite following that canon so i think people who chose to read it would not be too bummed about it and it would help anyone who has not read both stories follow what is going on.

*** *The Emberverse series*

The Emberverse series, or Change World, is a series of post-apocalyptic alternate history novels written by S. M. Stirling. The novels depict the events following a mysterious---yet sudden---worldwide event called "The Change" that occurred at 6:15 pm Pacific Standard Time, on March 17, 1998. The Change altered both the course of history and all physical laws when it caused all the electricity, gunpowder, explosives, internal combustion engines, steam power and most forms of high-energy-density technology on Earth to permanently no longer work. Most of the action in the series takes place in the Willamette Valley of Oregon in the United States.

** Harry Potter and the Fiendfyre Trials; basically, due to technicalities, Harry is stuck into a hardmode!Triwizard Tournament.

The Goblet Itself /enhances/ the Tasks for him - his Horntail becomes like three times as big, forty times smarter, and also breathes Fiendfyre. Harry has to kill it. Everything in the Lake wants Harry dead and dismembered including like eight semi-satanic Giant Squids with razor-sharp spines covering their tentacles and underwater firebreathing and lots of poison. Whatever path Harry takes through the maze becomes made of fire and infested with Dementors, Lethifolds, Nundus, Quintapeds, and Dragons. And they all want him dead.

After Harry wins (by being a total badass) he learns that the Goblet was created at the Fall of Atlantis, and holds the Secret of the City (the ancient precursor to the Fidelus) along with all the magical power it collected over the years as a secondary prize. It was a last hope for their civilization, as they accidentally screwed up their city and its overrun by demons and stuff. The Trials were the original competition of the Goblet, to see if there was ever a competitor Worthy or Capable of unearthing their fallen civilization.

Harry gets expelled fifth year, and decides to use his new knowledge and power to unearth the city. Dumbledore sends him Tonks and Bill I think and the three of them basically purge the city of thousands of semi-satanic Merlin-teir wizard-demon things. They fix up the enchantments on it and fly the city to England where they beat the crap out of Voldemort.

**** Sadly, it's already starting to wither and has been at it for a time now. This fandom was nothing like it was before. But it makes sense: Everything that has a beginning reaches maturity before it declines. Harry Potter is the same. It's matured and now is in a decline. Soon, even this reddit will cease to exist and all that'll be left are stragglers like [[/u/pumpkinsouptroupe]].

***** That's not how fandoms work. After canon works stop being released, fandoms diminish but they don't go out of existence. They reduce down to a core of dedicated fans. Just look at e.g. Star Trek.

In the HP fandom, we seem to have reached roughly that "core" already, with many smaller sites closing down and then coming to a kind of equilibrium. This subreddit, for example, is pretty new - its popularity post-dates the release of Deathly Hallows significantly.

And on top of that, new canon is now being released. The HP fandom isn't going anywhere fast.
