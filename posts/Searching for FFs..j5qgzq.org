I am searching for fan-fics in which the hallows play a big part. Could someone recommend a few please?


** I recently read linkffn(8864658) By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept. It's Petunia-centric and the Hallows do not get the centerstage but they play a bigger role than they did in canon.

Not to spoil anything but at one point there is a three-way showdown wherein the three combatants held a Hallow each. There's also a sort of discourse on Hallow vs Horcrux vis-a-vis the defeat of Voldemort.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
