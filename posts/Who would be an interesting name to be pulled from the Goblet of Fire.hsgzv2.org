I recently started reading StellaStarMagic's Lavender Brown: Hogwarts Champion Extraordinaire and it got me thinking - what would be some interesting names to see pulled from the Goblet of Fire?

Any names you've got, from and for any school (I myself particularly like the idea of the names being the same, but mixed up, so Harry ends up being Durmstrang's champ, Fleur is for Hogwarts, Victor for Beauxbatons, or adding in more schools like the Illvermorny Champion one, etc), and feel free to go cross-over if you like.

I'm just interested to see what people come up with. :)


** Poliakoff instead of Krum.

That would wipe the smug, favouritism smile from Karkaroff's face, and maybe he'd show some more respect to the boy.

**** He's one of the Durmstrang boys, and who Karakaroff insults for messing food down his (Poliakoff's) robes.

That scolding happens just after Karkaroff displays a soft, fatherly side by offering Krum some wine in the Great Hall. Poliakoff then says that he would like some, but Karakoff immediately switches to completely cold Headmaster and insults Poliakoff's lack of table manners.

In other words, blatant favouritism.

** Depends on if you are asking about the more absurd, the most satisfying or the one with the greatest chances for an interesting story.

If I were to take a guess the most absurd would be someone along the lines of Pigweedgenton, Griphok, Hogwarts itself or Peeves, it would certainly create some much unneeded chaos. Most satisfying would be to put someone universally hated and with no chance of succeeding, Umbridge and Flich would be prime candidates for being turned into dragon dung, but the one I would choose would be Vernon Dursley, besides the tournament itself it would be hilarious to see him having a constant breakdown over being in a school of magic, seeing him being overbigoted by Draco would be priceless, to say nothing of Harry being free to curse him to his hearts content and Dumbledore's reaction to actually having to interact in mild-term bases with him.

To the most interesting plot I would say Dumbledore, Grindelwald Voldemort and Harry, while Harry's defeat would be obvious it would still be fun to see the contrast between three of the most powerful wizards alive, all with huge spell repertoires, power and knowledge to someone outclassed in everything to do with magic and so having to be creative in using what he has. Plus it would be a great way of comparing morals, experiences, and ingenuity between the three powerhouses.

*** I'm curious - how would you do Hogwarts? The 'Lady Hogwarts' holo-projection route?

Vernon could definitely be interesting, I'll agree with you there. I've never actually seen 'Dursley Family goes to Hogwarts' done all that well, so a good one would be interesting on top of the interesting plot/character interactions.

I have actually seen one of the last one! I think two other people were involved too, because I remember there was a crafting competition where three pairs competed. Can't remember who exactly, but I think McG might've been one of them?

**** While the projection route would definitely work I personally feel it would open a whole can of worms considering the plot and adaptation of cannon. But if done well could be cool, even more so if Hogwarts have a blue-orange morality, taking offense at the most ridiculous things while encouraging/doing some very messed up and straight up evil things, like killing a whole town to make an army of inferi to search the lake during the second task.

Personally I think it would be best using the omnipresent route, with the castle itself participating of the tasks, like sending suits of armor/statues to steal the egg; using the plumbing to drain the lake (maybe into the chamber of secrets); controlling plants and/or parts of the building (the moving stairs) to get the cup at the third task. Probably many more ways the castle could use to compete, but this are the ones at the top of my head.

“I have actually seen one of the last one! I think two other people were involved too (...)” sounds interesting, send the link if you remember?

Oh yeah, The Dark Lady is a mess 😂 first thing I ever wrote and still not done yet, despite another 19 chapters waiting to be re-uploaded. There's still so much more to come for this one.

And my Lav-Lav fic, it's my second favourite because Lavender is so much fun to explore. My pride and joy is A Different Perspective though.

And thank you so much! 🥰

Yeah, you definitely make her a far more interesting character than just 'Won-won' and 'Blonde-with-boobs-and-face-scars' a la canon.

Both! It's incredibly fun to write and I have reached the point in the plot I desperately wanted to reach. A 20-chapter-setup does wear you down a bit, lol.

That's not bad. I mean, you're currently rather significantly more prolific than several actively-publishing novel-authors I'm a fan of (and I'm not even including Pat Rothfuss or GRR Martin :D), so you probably haven't reached the 'still not done yet' stage quite yet. :D

Heh. Yeah, it's a shame. Sad, but understandable, I suppose, given that's basically all she is in canon. Guess it's another case of Sturgeon's Law, only instead of 'crap' it's 'uninteresting'. :D

Hopefully you publishing LB:HCE again will poke some other people into following your lead and fleshing her out. :)

Ooof. Yeah, I can imagine. At least you got there, but dang. Great that things managed to stay fun through 20 chapters of getting-the-story-to-where-you-wanted-it-to-be though. :D

For some reason I'm struggling to word this question, but did you come up with the point in the story you wanted to reach first and then add the story set-up you've been writing to get there, or did you come up with the plot point midway through writing, or was it something else entirely?

Gotta blame JKR for that one. Still, it's even sadder that basically non-characters like Daphne Greengrass are getting like a gazillion different interpretations and Lavender just...you know, is getting what she gets. Which is nothing. I sure hope that, once I get back to that fic, I can motivate some more people into making Lavender more interesting.

At first, I just had the general premise inspired by another fic I forgot the name of. Basically, Harry dies in the BotM, falls through the veil and discovers he is actually a girl. I changed the manner of the discovery up a bit because I didn't want to go to the whole "Goblins are Harry's secret allies"-trope. I kinds of pantsed it up until chapter 10 I think, then I outlined it with my then-Beta. He had some great ideas (like the Rose/Cedric-pairing) and together we worked on the rest of the plot, bouncing ideas off each other, closing potential plot holes. Really helped me a lot. I love to just pants fics (the entirety of The Dark Lady is just me pantsing), but sometimes you got to outline. 💁‍♀️ So, the premise was the start. The rest is all me and my beta working together.

True. I think it's possibly the tropes the characters are connected to. Daphne gets Lordship Tropes, Good Slytherin Tropes, Manipulative Dumbledore Tropes, etc. Lavender just... doesn't really get much, except occasionally 'Harry gets popular with girls' which happened in a fic I forget the name of where the two date for awhile (and even that's completely surface level "Wow, she's got tits!" type romance and nothing more).

A beneficial beta bounce-board is a blessing. :)

Thanks for the detailed answer. It's always interesting to peek behind the writing curtain. Especially for people who plan and 'pants' stories both. Do you have everything in your story outlined now, or is there still a lil' room in there for pants-ing? :D

Goddamnit. Now I forget the name of that fic. It has terrifying-crazy Aunt Cassiopeia Black in it, doesn't it?
