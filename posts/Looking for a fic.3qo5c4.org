I dont remember to much about it but It is a H/Hr fic and I think it has to at least be 5th year because I specifically remember there being a vanishing cabineteseque link between harrys room at grimmauld place and hermiones house. Any help is appreciated!


** This is perhaps the most vague request post I've ever seen.

That's not exactly uncommon for Harmony time-travel fics. Can you remember any other details?

** This is familiar to me, I know I've read that in the past year. I agree with you, I don't think its a Robst fic. I can't remember anything else yet though, I'll need to dig through some bookmarks.

  A post HBP book seven substitute started well before DH. It is a HHr book. Ron and Ginny stay likable. I try to stay with the canon as much as possible and will eventually explain all actions and abilities. Please read the intro for more details.

** I am 95% sure that was a robst fic. Possibly linkffn(in this world and the next by robst). If that's not it linkffn(knowledge is power by robst). For people that judge me; i was young and naive:(.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
