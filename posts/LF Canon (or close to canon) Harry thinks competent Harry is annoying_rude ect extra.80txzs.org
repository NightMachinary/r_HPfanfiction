Looking for stories where Harry meets a competent/more serious version of himself, (doesn't matter how) but feels like the competent/more serious version of himself forgot how to live, is really annoying, rude, a stick in the mud. Ect Extra. And maybe even tries to help the more competent/more serious Harry learn how to have fun.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but any other pairing is okay.

Would rather the story be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is okay.


** That sounds like Canon Harry meeting Harry potter from the methods of rationality and agreeing with my wife that rational Harry is an asshole.

** Et Cetera. It's Latin for "and the rest". Etc. Is also acceptable, but you put the T before the C.

Ect Extra doesn't mean much of anything.
