:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying really hard to remember this fic but all I remember is that Harry goes back in time, messes with Dumbledore, bribes/is mentored by (kinda) flamel, gets a phoenix, he pulls Excalibur at the glastebury tor, and eventually it turns into a Stargate crossover. If y'all don't know it either thats chill ðŸ˜‚. But I've been going insane trying to find it.
