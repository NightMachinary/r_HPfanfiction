I always wondered why there never was a fic that combined the two worlds beyond simple "Harry has Sharingan cuz magic". If Harry, a Potter, can 'awaken' the power of the Copy Wheel Eye, why can't other families get their own bloodlines. I especially like the Dead Bone Pulse for the Bones family, or Mokuton(or a weaker version of it) for the Green grass family.

Not only that would escalate, and give a chance for a side plot, for the Muggle born Vs Pure blood thing, it would give a lot of leevay for lore and other things.

So, anyone, please, write it...cuz I'm too lazy.

P.S I know the fic Called ffn(Moon and Shadow) but it's just not the same.


** would the potters have the exploding clay technique?

** Honestly, i think in such scenario Black family would have Sharingan. Malfoys Byakugan etc. Harry would get saddled with being a jinchuuriki lol. Voldemort would function more or less as Orochimaru mixed with Madara tendencies :) Dumbledore being a weird form of Jiraiya
