I enjoy H/F - my favorite pairing by far. But most involve Harry and Fleur getting together during Triwizard, or Quidditch World Cup. What about stories where Bill/Fleur are together, and then something drives them apart? Maybe death, maybe marital problems, anything.\\
The longer the story the better.


** The only story I can think of off the top of my head, it's post war Harry and Fleur become closer after Fleur catches Bill cheating, but then they get thrown back to the Triwizard Tournament with all of their memories of the future.

  While chasing the last remnants of the Death Eaters still loyal to Voldemort, Harry is unexpectedly thrown back in time to the start of his fourth year of Hogwarts. This time round, things are going to be a little different. Harry/Fleur pairing.

**** I don't know if you'll find to many. Harry/Fleur are usually abandoned. I think I read one were Harry was supposed to start dating Fleur in his 6th after Fleur and Bill broke up but it was abandoned. I think there was one more were they broke up in Harry's 7th year, and after the final battle Fleur takes Harry to France to relax and rest after the battle. But that one has 2 chapters and hasn't been updated recently, may be abandoned.

Edit: the second story is linkffn(Relief's Herald by Conso Anima).
