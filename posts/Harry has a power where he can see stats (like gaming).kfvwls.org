:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello everyone,

I hope you are staying safe.

I am looking for a fanfiction where Harry died when he was young and one of the gods gave him the power to see stats of everyone. He sees stats of himself as well and works to improve himself making him magically powerful.

I would be very grateful if you could point that fic to me. I remember reading it in ffn.

Cheers.

  The Fates of the MCU have written for Harry Potter to die during a failed Obscurial Transformation. A drunken conversation between the heads of the Marvel verse has changed that and Harry has ended up with Gamer powers among other things. Watch Harry go through Hogwarts, Kamar-Taj, and Xavier's institute as he learns to use his powers and level up. Contains a Flerken. Harem by Arc3
