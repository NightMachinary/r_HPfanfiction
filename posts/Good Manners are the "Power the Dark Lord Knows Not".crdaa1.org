Harry getting through things where he should really die, by being polite. When Harry talks to the Basilisk, he's really respectful and polite, so the Basilisk bites the Diary for him and slithers off. He asks the Dementors kindly to capture Pettigrew and not hurt Sirius, so they do (But he escapes, Incompetent Ministry or whatever) He asks the Dragon "Please can i have the Golden Egg" so the Dragon gives it to him. Asks the Mermaids for the Hostage, and asks the creatures in the maze to touch the Portkey with him because it all seems too suspicous, so Wormtail vs Skrewt/Sphinx/Boggart/Acromantula, and Voldemort dies.


** /The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. Nothing happened .../

/Let it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone wrong .../

/And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn't see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapour hanging in the air ... it's gone wrong, he thought ... it's drowned .../ */please/* /.../ */please/* /let it be dead ..../ /^{- Excerpt from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}/

Then suddenly an inhuman scream echoed through the graveyard. A black shadow rose from the cauldron and flew away into the night sky. The steam settled and Harry could see clearly again. The cauldron was still there, the liquid inside sat calmly. To the right, Wormtail was lying on the ground, motionless.

Huh...that went well, Harry thought.

** That's, like, every Good!Goblins fic out there. Harry minds his Ps and Qs with that one goblin whose name he remembers from that one time years ago, which warrants a meeting with the Greatest Warrior Goblin King "Ragnarok", who's then so impressed by a snot nosed child with the kind of manners drilled into toddlers that he puts the entirety of his billigerent, war-like, wizard-hating "nation" at Harry's disposal, who then take over the plot, defeat all of Harry's enemies, cure all his ills, and then thank him for the privilege.
