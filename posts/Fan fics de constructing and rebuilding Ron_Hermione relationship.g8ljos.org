I've finished reading HP books again and decided to check out fan fics. I found a few good stuff but none entirely what I wanted.

Ron/Hermione is my favourite and I really want to read about their relationship post Hogwarts War.

There are tons of those, but they're usually a bit.. uncharacteristic and a little too..angsty.

I feel like people are ignoring Hermione's violent reactions to Ron and Ron's insecurities.

So I'm looking for fan fics that de constructs and examines their relationship and builds them back up to what I'd consider one of sweetest pair in fictional history.

Thank you so much for the help.

Don't even get me started ðŸ™„

My recs?

Anything by Pinky Brown. They've written humour, angst, and more, but my favourite is linkffn(Six Foot of Ginger Idiot by Pinky Brown). Best Ron POV I've ever read. Faultlines and Biscuits, A Love Story are also good.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9094981/1/]]) is another good one. Alternating Ron/Hermione POV.

  Or, Ron Weasley's Year Six Diary: the whole of Half-Blood Prince from Ron's point of view. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to shake him. Winner of "Best Humour Fic" at the 2008 Reviewer's Choice Awards on FFnet.

  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.
