...Pretty much what the title suggests. Harry/Theo is one of my favorite slash pairings in fanfiction, but pretty much the only story I've read with them together and actually liked enough to favorite is /Gaining Freedom, Losing Innocence/ -- linkffn(10145048).

The only requirements that I have is that the fic 1) have Theo as the bottom (I've tried reading /There Be Dragons, Harry/ multiple times and...yeah, Theo as a top just doesn't do it for me) and 2) if the fic is less than 100k, that it be completed (if it's longer than 100k, I don't care if it's completed or not).

If you have any Fics to rec, thank you in advance! If not, I hope you're doing well, what with how things are currently, and that you have a good day!

  HPTN slash. AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically. Amoral Harry, seven parts. COMPLETE.

** Doesn't QUITE fit your criteria: not yet finished, and not quite 100K (it's at 98.4K, so one chapter away). Relationship is still building, so I can't even promise anything on the top/bottom issue, but I'm enjoying it. Harry's Questions by Time Artist linkffn(11579634)
