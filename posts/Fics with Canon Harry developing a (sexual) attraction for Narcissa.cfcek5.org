It doesnt matter if he is a single, with Ginny or even having a Family. Maybe having his own Kids with Ginny but divorced with her. So through his ongoing life at some Point he starts getting attracted to Narcissa (somewhere around epiloge, maybe later). Maybe she comes to him to ask for help and through this Process it happens. The attraction would only be one-sided. I dont mind if she has something for him either, but i would prefer it only being on Harrys side. Whether she finds this out or stays oblivious wouldnt really matter, but i think it would be exciting if she knows, or atleast thinks about this.

I know that there is the "What are you doing in my house?" fic or something like that, but this doesnt fall into my categorie, since both of them fall for each other in the process and she gets Pregnant. I would like no real Love between them, but only attraction. I wouldnt mind either if they get intim with each other.
