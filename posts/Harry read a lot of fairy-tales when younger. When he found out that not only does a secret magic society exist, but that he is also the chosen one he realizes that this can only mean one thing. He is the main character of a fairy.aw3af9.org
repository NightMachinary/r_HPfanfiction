I have read an incomplete story with this premise called Storybook Hero and loved it, hopefully this can inspire someone else to write something similar. Or maybe one of you knows of another fic with a similar premise.


** It's a cool idea. Though I'd add that it would be better if it was written in that whimsical Lewis Carroll or Roald Dahl style but have every other character except Harry speak in normal, every day parlance just to add some humour.

** This reminds me of (linkffn)Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them. Harry realizes the strange things happening around him aren't aomething normal humans have and decides he must not be human. After eliminating other possibilities he decides he's an elf and it snowballs from there. Great story

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
