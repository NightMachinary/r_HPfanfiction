:END:
I can only remember this one scene...

Harry and Draco are adults, not together yet but that has been copious flirting. Harry, desperate to see Draco, comes through his floo. There might have been a misunderstanding of some kind. Anyway, Harry is wearing joggers and a t-shirt, he's also got Sirius's jacket on. He didn't have time for shoes so he's barefoot.

That's all I remember. I literally remember nothing else from the fic but this scene stuck with me so hard!
