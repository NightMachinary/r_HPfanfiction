I've never read any HP fan fiction before, and have just finished reading all the books. I'm aware there is decades worth of content out there, but I don't know where to start really. I'm not even sure what the best platforms to look on are, or if there's any tricks to weeding out the bad stuff. Does anybody know a master list of the best fics to start with? Or perhaps people could drop their top faves in the comments?

Some points to help maybe:

- I'm not a snob, but I do value some kind of written skill/character development/plot. Happy to invest in chaptered stories.
- I have a soft spot for Remus/Sirius, and know there's a lot of content in that area. Any good ones that aren't pure smut or wildly unrealistic?
- Generally I prefer the idea of stories set pre-books (Marauders era, original OOTP, the first war etc.) or post-books.
- I'm actually totally cool with stories that are entirely OC too, if the content and story is interesting.

Thanks in advance! :)

** It's been so long since I've been a newbie to the HP fanfic world, but a couple helpful things to start you off with is an awareness of both [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org][archiveofourown.org]]. Both have heaps of HP fanfic, however I personally 100% prefer ao3 due to the ease of navigation and tagging and the ability to exclude tags. As you read more you will find out what you do/don't like and ao3 gives you more of an ability to filter out those works. However, if you do end up looking for HP fanfic on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], the search tool/site [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]] helps a ton.

Something you might also find worth taking a peek at for recs is the tvtropes page for HP fanfic, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotter]]. I personally don't read sirius/remus stuff or many pre/post book stuff, so I don't have many specific recs.

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String]] is a great fic. It diverges from the Dementor attack in OotP, Harry travels to another dimension's past after he's Kissed.

There will be an epilogue and the author said it will be the longer chapter yet, so I am pretty excited (and trying to keep from rereading /again/ until then).

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

This one. Read this one. Tits the best one. Trust us. It's the best writing. Best characterisation. Best character development. You'll cry you'll laugh you'll cry. It's just wonderful. Canon enough that it's not to jarring to read if you're new to fanfiction but just different enough to be interesting. It's brilliant.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** The pureblood pretense and it's sequels aren't pre Hogwarts, but they are very AU. They are also among be the best written stories on the site. The description does not do it justice, and I could not help but recommend it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

The only other that beats it out, for me anyway, is Basilisk Born. Once again, extremely AU, and written amazingly. It is pre Hogwarts...kinda. If I could only recommend you one fic, it would be this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]]

Note: both of these are a work in progress, however they are both still very much worth it, and are being consistently updated (if rather slowly).

​

Finally here is a small list of popular Fics that I have read, and many people seem to like:
