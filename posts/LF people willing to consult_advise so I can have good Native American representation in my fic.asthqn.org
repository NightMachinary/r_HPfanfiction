I could go on a rant about Rowling and the word on high about Magical history and peoples of America but its depressing and that's not what I'm here about. Fan fiction writing is a hobby but it doesn't stop me being passionate about representing as well as I can. I don't have money to hire researches, sensitivity readers, or consultants (like Rowling should have done) so I'm hoping to find some help here on reddit. Native American culture specifically isn't going to be a huge focus of the story but American Wizarding Culture does come up and I do want a Native American Witch in the story who may not have a large part in the over all story in terms of word count but she is important. I want to get it right.

​

So please, ff your willing to be a sounding board and help me I'd really appreciate it. I don't want to post spoilers to the story here her in the question so I will start a thread down bellow where I explain what I plan on doing.

​

Thank you for your time and whatever help this may bring.


** If your story is going to mention leprechauns, you might want to involve an Irish person as well, to make sure you're not being culturally insensitive on that front too. And while we're at it, any mention of dragons should probably be run past someone of Chinese descent.

Come to think of it, I'm happy to volunteer my services as a British person. The Harry Potter series uses all sort of British mythology and we wouldn't want that mythology to be misrepresented in some historically inaccurate way, or appropriated for the purpose of entertainment. That would be wrong.

*** I have a bad sarcasm filter so I can't tell if your being genuine or trying to take the piss. I'm going to hope its genuine cause that's the kind of person I am. So that being said, there are already plans for Irish characters and I put out a call for someone to Brit pick but I don't have anyone official yet. The only time leprechauns are mentioned is a one line reference to leprechaun gold as a call back to the hp canon. Dragons aren't going to have any real part in the story beyond being the focus of Charlie Weasleys life's work.

** My story is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13077441/1/Harriet-Potter-and-the-Meddling-of-The-Fates][Harriet Potter and the Meddling of The Fates]]. It's a crossover with the MCU. As those of you familiar with the MCU will no a good deal of the action takes place in America and because of this I need to write about American Magical society and magic. Personally I have so many issues with the canon structure and facts it makes me a little sick. I am hoping to get some information and ideas about

-How do you feel American Magical culture would have actually evolved in terms of native culture before colonization, then colonization, then immigrants coming in from all over the world?

-What kinds of Native American legends, stories, and magics would you like to see integrated into the HP Magic and how. Also, what "magical creatures" would you have like to seen represented. I will be needing a few in the story.

-And lastly my Native American character. At some point my Harry is going to need to interact with an American Wizarding authority about the things that are happening. I want to take this opportunity to have some native representation since the bulk of the characters are either British or established MCU cast. Would making them the current Magical President seem like too much? Too pandering. One thing that has really bothered me in the Fantastic Beast Films is that we are shown a black woman as President but every other person in a position of authority we are shown seems to be white and male. Would it mean more to see this character as say a head of law enforcement or another equally important department? I had also thought it might be nice to bring up the fact that many (perhaps all, please help reduce my ignorance) Native American peoples did not have a binary view of gender and have the character represent that by using gender neutral pronouns with people they aren't familiar with.

​

If there is anything else you think it is important that I know or think about please let me know.
