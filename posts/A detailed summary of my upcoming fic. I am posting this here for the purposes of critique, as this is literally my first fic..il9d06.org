OK, here we go.

​

The fic starts off in 1996, at the height of the Second Wizarding War. The event which diverges from canon are the attacks of October 24th. The organization known as the Army of True Humanity had set up several cloaked satellites in orbit, which now unleashe a devastating orbital bombardment on the globe. The ATH desires the extermination or enslavement of all life on Earth that does not meet their ideas of 'perfection', which pretty much mean having no physical or mental imperfections. The attacks prompt the world's nuclear powers to launch their arsenals at the satellites, after conventional explosives fail to damage them. This succeeds and the attacks stop. However, much of the world had been devastated by the bombardment, with multiple nations almost wiped off the map.

The ATH broadcast's their intentions to both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. The ATH is made up of Wizards and Muggles who have perfected eugenics.

The ATH unleashes their armies on the world, conquering Eastern Russia, China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and India. They enslave the populations of these regions, although several resistance groups survive in these areas.

In response, the International Confederation of Wizards abolishes the Statute of Secrecy, and joins with the United Nations to form the Grand Alliance of the International Confederation of Wizards and the United Nations, or the UN-ICW Alliance.

Also in response, the Order and Death Eaters agree to a ceasfire, both groups joining the Alliance Military(Those who are fit for combat, that is).

Wizards in the military form specialized battallions, similar to Medics, MPs, and Special Forces. They use guns as a replacement for AK(Since AK can be blocked easily, and has short range), and for ceremonial purposes. The Death Eaters become the 2nd Magical Support Battallion, attached to the British 5th Armored Division, while the Order is attached to the British 11th Infantry Division, as the Fifth Magical support battallion.

The war is at first one-sided, until the Alliance captures ATH technology, reverse engineering it XCOM-style.

Here's a summary of the two governments:

UN-ICW Alliance:

Full name: Grand Terran Alliance of the International Confederation of Wizards and the United Nations.

Government type: Militaristic Semi-representative Multi-Party Global Alliance.

Commander-In-Chief: High Marshall Norman Swartzkopf.

Heads of Government: Supreme Mugwump Albus Percival Brian Wilfred Dumbledore(I think that's right), and Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

Legislature: General Assembly.

Miliatry: UN-ICW Allied Forces:

UN-ICW Allied Army.

UN-ICW Allied Navy,

UN-ICW Allied Magical Investigation Committee.

UN-ICW Interior Bureau

UN-ICW Allied Airforce.

Army of True Humanity:

Government Type: Miltiaristic single-party eugenicist Oligarchy.

Commander-In-Chief: Supreme Commander William Singh.

Head of Government: Jake Ludendorf.

Legislature: Supreme Assembly.

Military: The Army of True Humanity is effectively an army without a state, but its divisions are:

ATH Army.

ATH Navy.

ATH Air force.

ATH Magical Commission.

ATH Suppression Bureau.

The war lasts for 25 years, during which time the world is completely devastated, almost unrecognizable due to the ATH superweapons used on the world. The population drops from 8 billion magical creatures and humans, to just one billion creatures and humans. I cannot describe the devastation I have planned in my head. Its like...if the battle of Verdun was over 50% of the Earth, with a few major cities dotting the landscape.

Any critiques/comments/questions? Sorry for the massive wall of text, but my head is filled with ideas.


** Not my thing. It sounds very far fetched. It sounds like a load of militaristic wank with poor characterisation. There are ways to do wars well. This isn't it.

You also need to stop using so many acronyms. It gets very hard to follow if they're not intuitive.

My other idea is a fic set in the world of The New Order: Last Days of Europe, a mod for HOI4 with a strong narrative element. I personally like that one more. It's a very dark world, where the Axis won WW2.

My thinking would be that Grindelwald was never born in this timeline, along with Roosevelt dying and Bukharin winning the Soviet election. This results in German wizards joining with Hitler, due to the anti-semitism ingrained in German Wizarding culture(Wizards went underground back when anti-semitism was far, far worse than it was in the 20th century). The Axis win WW2, and the Wizards are exposed to the world, due to the ICW's conference being destroyed by the German wizards. Tom Riddle leads a British Resistance against the Axis, as apart of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance.

MACUSA joins with the United States Government.

In the mod, there is a nation known as Burgundy, a nation so bad I really don't want to even think about it. They are like Nazi germany, but far, far worse. Its like if Orwell's oceania had a baby with the SS. In fact, they are run by the SS, and plot to destroy humanity in nuclear fire, so that the 'pure Aryan race' can survive and inherit the Earth.

What do you think about that?

**** Another load of wank. It doesn't sound well researched. It doesn't sound respectful of what the holocaust was actually like for Jews. It sounds like a load of gratuitous violence with no thought given to the human element.

Making Voldemort the good guy? What? That needs some serious explanation.

It doesn't sound like a strong narrative. I can see no mention of any kind of characterisation.

So far as I can tell, house of Iron 4 is a fairly niche video game. Most people haven't heard of it. Those that have probably aren't interested in shitty Harry Potter fanfic. Your potential audience is tiny. It's fans of house of iron who are also Harry Potter fans who would read fanfic. In other words, just you.

Come up with an idea that meets the basis of a good story. Actually read some dystopia fiction before trying to write it yourself.

***** Its just a general summary. 'Characterization' is for the outline. 'Doesn't sound respectful of what the holocause was like for jews' how exactly? Again, its supposed to be grimdark. Its not going to be gratuitous violence with no humanity. It will be grimdarkness with a happy ending. They won't have to be fans of HOI4 to like the fic. TNO is very narrative-heavy, to the point where its almost like a book with a video game portion. I really feel like your definition of 'wank' is quite broad.

******* Firstly, let me just say this: You have all the knowledge of mankind at your fingertips. Secondly: You're sounding more and more like a troll the more I read what you say. Other folks have said its a good idea. If you think this is 'militaristic wank', please explain why. I don't want it to be, I want it to be a Cold War-style fic. Those have been written before. If you don't like it, fine. I am not trying to appeal to you.

******** By using acronyms for games most people have never heard of, you make your post sound confusing. You're talking about games when thinking about a written story. Try reading some books before you start writing. Books are not video games and they need different things.

From the description given, you have no real characters. To get people to read, you have to have interesting characters at the forefront. Without well developed characters, you have cardboard cutouts fighting for no reason.

I describe this as militaristic wank because that's exactly what it is. It's gratuitous violence and weaponry purely for the sake of it. What little plot there is is buried a mile deep in a post apocalyptic landscape. There are no characters.

Try reading the Hunger Games. Why did people like them? There were distinct, rounded characters. Katniss was a flawed, but real human. We know what motivates her to do the things she does, her baby sister.

Try reading 1984. Why do Julia and Winston rebel? Why is it one of the giants of English literature? Because the characters are fantastic and the story is cleverly plotted.

Your summary meets none of those things. Scrap it entirely. Come up with a character and explore from their perspective. Have you ever read a story without characters?

********* So I should start with characters? That makes sense. Well, lets start off with Voldemort, or Tom Riddle as he's known in this timeline. What motivates him to fight is seeing dozens of British Wizards killed by German wizards, and being put into a Labor Camp for several years. This gives him a burning hatred of Germany, and a distrust of the United States, due to its cowardice being the reason behind the Allies losing the Second World War. Or, what about the MACUSA President? They, whoever they are, fight because they are trying to redeem MACUSA after its security forces failed to prevent the assasination of the ICW General Assembly. This sound good?

*************** 'Read actual literature'. Apparently the Hunger Games is more real literature than Star Wars books. I am not looking to be the next Tolkein, just write a Military Fantasy story people enjoy. Character development is character development, no matter where it originates. It could be in a book, a movie(Golden age films did this very well), a tv show, or even an immersive theater experience. The Star Wars novels, WERE books before they were movies, atleast the non-novelizations were.

** To resummarize the comments I made last time - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i7t0j8/why_are_there_no_fics_about_a_mugglewizard/g14nag5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]], I don't think there are inherent issues with a muggle-wizard alliance.

However, I do see issues with the magic in the story. Wizards using guns is incredibly off-putting to me, though this is subjective.

What is more odd is that you would base a story around wizards and muggle cooperating against an external threat and reduce the magic (the key part of being a wizard) used in the story. This is more of an objective criticism.

I'd note that I'd take a spell that can be silently cast where aim is based on skill with magic that instantly kills over a weapon that's difficult to master, can jam, and has far less stopping power. Hell, even blasting curses, inconsistent in canon, are probably better choices than a gun.

I think your main issues are going to follow a similar pattern, where your themes and storylines clash with each other and amongst each other.

There's a massive focus on this "Army of True Humanity" and technology, and while that's fine approach, it definitely nerfs magic, and honestly existing muggle powers as well, especially if mundane forces can actually threaten magical protections (which we know override mundane nature in canon). It really feels like this story will be its own story with Harry Potter characters and a little magic thrown in for spice.

I'd recommend really taking a second look at Harry Potter and strengthening the elements of it in your story. This really feels like something I'd find on HFY and technology-wank. This isn't bad, but I'm really unsure that Harry Potter is the best medium for this.

*** Well, its actually magitech. The ATH has somehow fused magic and technology together. I understand your concern about guns, so I'll limit it to ceremonial uses only. The magic only SEEMS to be reduced, because there just plain are fewer magicals than mundane in the HP universe. The ATH must be apocalyptic in terms power, while the muggles also have to have a role here as well. There just plain are more muggles than wizards, but magic will indeed have a major effect on the war.

*** For instance: The ATH has a rifle that's literally a rapid-fire, long-range Avada Kedarva, and a BFG-9000-like version as well. They also have various other magitech items, all of which are reverse-engineered by the Alliance's scientists and Scien-Wizards(Their term for research-oriented wizards).
