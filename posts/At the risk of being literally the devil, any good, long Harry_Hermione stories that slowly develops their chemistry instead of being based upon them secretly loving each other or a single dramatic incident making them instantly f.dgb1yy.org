So uh been like yeeeeears since I've touched the fanfiction scene but I remember that even mentioning you liked this pairing was enough to trigger some bad arguments so uh my apologies if that's a thing.

Real talk, when I read the first book I thought they were being set up to be a couple in the future but basically by book 2 I was like "Oh okay yeah not happening" and it didn't really make sense for what their characters became. Still, I gotta admit I'm still mildly fond of the pairing based on my (mistaken) initial impressions of the series allllll those years back. My issue is that most stories I run into are all about how they have been in love all along or a minor event makes them realize their feelings and so on, which tbh much as I like the pairing doesn't super work for me.

I'm ideally looking for a super long story that like starts from book 1 and just slowly changes who they are as people with minor touches here and there until they develop into characters that resemble their canon counterparts enough to feel in-character but also feel different enough for a romance to be believable.

Since I might as well have asked for a real life unicorn, I'm more realistically just looking for a slow burn story with focus on the two's relationship, starting with friendship and progressing somewhere.

Somewhat more realistically, really just toss me any readable Harry/Hermione story and I won't complain :P I know I probably won't find anything along the lines of what I'm looking for but hey, no harm in trying right?

Thanks in advance guys!

**** I just want to see the character arcs that the first book set up. Not Rowling's shoehorn ships and the sledgehammer school of character development she uses to make up for forgetting a character exists for three books.

Harry's pre-Hogwarts schooling makes him sound like, if not some kid genius character, at least a good student, who's very interested in learning about magic. Both of which have previously been stolen from him by the Dursleys. Meanwhile Hermione's character arc in the first book, among other things, has her realizing that there are more important things than grades.

Then all of that gets reset, and reset again several times after when you'd think they'd have reason to change like after abusing the time-turner for Hermione or after the tournament for Harry, because at that point Rowling has mentally typecast Harry as a slacker quidditch jock, and Hermione as an obsessive nerd with no sense of boundaries or self-care.

Then the whole Hermione-Ron shoehorn ship happens, despite never bothering to progress their relationship beyond Ron being someone Hermione mostly tolerates because he's attached to Harry.

If I wanted to see more shoehorn ships I'd /read the original damn books/.

  This story starts at the end of Harry's third year, and continues thru his seventh. There is action in many of the chapters, but I believe the overwhelming focus should be the main characters.

****** Thanks for recommending Moments in Love. I'm only at chapter 6, but I like how it's handling things.

I don't object to Harmony in principle, but I think a lot of stories try to suddenly pull "it is you I have loved all along" out of the air, and it grates. This one does it much more believably, going back to first principles and adjusting the Golden Trio dynamic to make it work. And the author may be on to something with the claim that Harry changed a lot after meeting Ron.

I'll see how the rest of the fic goes, but I'm optimistic.

And it's also the nineties, so, people aren't exactly as accepting of the LGBT community. Plus, Wizarding Britain is said to be stick in the Victorian Era, where appearances were everything. Name a single canon homosexual relationship in the Harry Potter EU. Harry's biggest desire was always to be accepted and loved, so of course he/she would be angsty and afraid. Hermione isn't a social outcast by choice. Hello, troll incident of Halloween '91? And then we all know Molly Weasley, a woman both Harry and Hermione revere, is rather conservative, I'd even go so far as to call her one of the most conservative characters in the series. And the first section of the trilogy, based on title, I'd say takes place during the Triwizard tournament, where Rita Skeeter ran rampant. Eh but what do I know.

True, neither truly gave in, but public opinion has always been fickle when it comes to Harry, Hermione had the odds stacked against her from day one, and coming out could potentially lead to them becoming blacklisted in magical society, with the only place even potentially willing to hire them being the Quibbler (Can you see the Lovegoods caring about lesbianism?). We still have pride marches and gay rights activists where I live in America almost twenty five years after this story is set, can you honestly say a much more bigoted and restrictive society such as magical Britain in the 90's was would be better? I can't see 15 year old Hermione commiting social suicide less than a year into her relationship, and like I previously stated Molly Weasley, Harry's only real maternal figure, often adopts a very conservative viewpoint.

** Story: What We're Fighting For [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1]]

I'm not really a fan of the pairing, but I really liked this story. It's a very AU 6th year fic. Hermione is a friendless outcast at school and Harry has been home schooled before this year, with no experience at dealing with people his own age. The two of them meet on the train ride and slowly become first friends and then more.

If you mean well written works that have a Harmony pairing, this I can do!

linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar) was really fun, though dark and while it's not very Harmony focused, it is there. Harry doesn't get to save Ron on his birthday. The sequel is linkffn(Echoes in the Fog) which has Canon!Harry LackofaBezoar!Harry and there respective spouses and friends sent to a universe where Voldemort won and Evil!Harry is his 2nd in command.

linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) Harry lives, Harry dies, but /when/ he comes back to life isn't fixed. Kinda like a Groundhog Day/Harry Potter crossover where Harry's resets are not fixed in time.

********** She's fine, it's just, I think everyone is like "Harry looks like James, therefore he should be with a redhead who's stubborn and feisty." My problem with this is James had a mostly sheltered life: Harry was mostly the opposite. Also, I feel like trying to look at him as a replica of James, the canon Harry, is impossible. He isn't a braggort or even extroverted-heck you could say he's the opposite. He plays Quidditch mainly for the feeling of freedom, and as a outlet to ride his broom. He has a small group of friends, mainly I'd say due to Houses, and him not knowing where to start really. In short, he's not a replica of James or of Lily, either in personality or looks. Rather, he's a mixture. A Harry and Ginny pairing really just sounds bad, especially when you realize how stubborn and unyielding Harry is regarding personal things, and how Ginny wouldn't back down as she's to stubborn to do so. Throw in the Weasley temper, and you've got a intense argument every time something actually serious and not superficial comes up. This is why I despise the Harry/Ginny pairing. Canon Harry would need someone with patience in spades, a caring attitude, and overall a warm personality at the very least. This is my perspective on the situation of Hinny in canon. Make of it what you will.

You have to remember, up until the end of fifth year, Draco took his father's word and beliefs as gospel, and was a total bully, spoiled brat, and all around dick. Wasn't much better in sixth year either. He specifically targeted the golden trio, and 5 years of hate and 15 years of brainwashing can't simply be washed away. So, to compensate, the authors use utterly ludicrous plot points, such as Hermione being the daughter of Voldemort or a high ranking death eater, Harry and Ron abandoning their best friend so she goes dark, the mudblood slytherin, sudden and immediate forgiveness, or my personal least favorite, it was all an act.

  Harmony is only popular in the lower echelons of HP fanfic quality

That's what I meant by gatekeeping. Don't knock Harmony if you haven't really tried it. Both pairings can be done well, but the majority of the fics are bad.

******* That person is advocating Hermione/"the racially motivated terrorist who committed countless war crimes and advocated a genocide since he was twelve" in the same breath. That had to be trolling.

****** I said it was only POPULAR in the lower echelons of HP fanfic quality, never said it was nonexistent in the upper echelons. Why do people always latch onto the most minute misinterpretations of everything and ignore the defining details of any given statement? If that's not being a shit human being, I don't know what is.
