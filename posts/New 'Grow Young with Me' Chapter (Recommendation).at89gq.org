I think a lot of us have enjoyed Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19 even though updates have slowed to nearly non-existent (I think the last one was about 9-10 months ago). Anyways, for those who gave up on Following/Favoriting the fic, just thought I'd let you know a new chapter was released today.

** Indeed it was a great chapter. I'll add that if you want update from her writing she has a Tumblr on which she's active and answer readers as well as give update on her writing and also some little Random Facts about the fic; not the writing process but more additional information on characters or funny "out of story" moment.

To those who like the fic and are worried to know if it's abandoned or not you can get news [[http://taliesin-19.tumblr.com/][there]].

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** Yeah it really is a joy whenever she posts a chapter... I'd love some faster chapters, but i try to keep in mind these are real people with real jobs, as long as she keeps writing I'm happy.

** If people care about a fic they have followed/faved it, these posts are pointless.

*** Well just thought I'd throw it out there- plus there may be people who have never read it and it inspires them to give it a go.

My post was certainly less pointless than your comment.

**** Even then, take a look at the other posts on the sub- there have been multiple posts about it since the update, which was more than a day ago. Including [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/asmeoa/psa_grow_young_with_me_has_just_updated_she/][this highly upvoted post.]]

It was fine to post at first, certainly. But I've seen three repeat posts about the same thing since the update (some of which have since been deleted) and it's been a day and a half since the update.

***** Sorry I missed it, and for some reason I missed that it was yesterday and not today. Been a couple busy days at work and I wasn't on FanFiction.Net or reddit much yesterday.
