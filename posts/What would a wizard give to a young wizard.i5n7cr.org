Something akin to Shanks giving the straw hat to Luffy.


** In One Piece, Luffy doesn't really care about the hat itself (no matter its history both shown and hinted), but rather about the fact that it was given to him by Shanks, and represents a promise between them. Going with that logic, your adult wizard could probably give anything to the young one and you could still create a similar situation, yet I feel like just giving some clothes would be lacking in the HP universe.

A wand would probably be out of question since your adult wizard need to use it (and there is the whole "the wand choses the wizard" thing to take into account). Though your adult wizard could still give another wand to the young one (his dead father/ brother/ wife/ child . . . wand that somehow fit the young one).Another item that has some cultural significance it the watch, but it's usually given at the 17th birthday. You could explain the gift by saying something along the lines of "Here's your 17 birthday in advance because I fear I won't be there at that time" but it would take some work to put this into a story.

Finally, you could just use some unique magical item (like Harrys cloack or Dumbledores deluminator). I think this option is probably the best one, and the easiest to use into a story.You just have to chose a magical item invented or found by your adult wizard (an eyeglass that let you see magical traces, a whistle that make sound in the distance when used, a quill that can imitate someone else writing . . .), have him use it some times in the story (to show its power and its significance to the adult one), and that give it to the young one. It's may be best if the item is inconspicuous (so he can keeps it one him) and with an "usefull" power (so the items doesn't rot into his pocket) but you are free to do anything you want.

*** I agree that a magical item is the best way.

I just wanted to hear other people's ideas for clothing items.

**** Oh in that case, one of the main characteristics of of Luffy in OP is that he always wear the hat given by Shanks. Considering the wizards fashion, your options are rather limited if you want to create a similar scene.\\
Robes are probably out ofr a number of reasons (why would an adult give a robe to a child, wouldn't the kid become too big for the robe with time, would he wear the same robe for years . . .), and I also think that shoes are not good choice.\\
It leaves hat, scarf, and potentially gloves. All 3 of them can be worn for years (the hat and the gloves may become undersize for years, but nothing a spell can't fix), can become a specific trait of the character ("Oh X always wear that"), and can even be spelled to be something else that just some clothing.\\
Finaly you have the jewerly (necklace, ring, bracelet . . .), but it falls more in the magical item idea than clothing.
