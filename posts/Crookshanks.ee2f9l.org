The Potters once had a fat orange cat that James got for Lily as a birthday gift. It was the only cat that was ever happy around Sirius and was incredibly intelligent as a half kneezle. When the Potters were attacked shd was hit with a spell that smashed her face inwards. She recognised Peter as the traitor and waited in the pet shop where dhe was safe. She helled Siriua to catch Peter and chose Hermione because she smelt like Harry.
