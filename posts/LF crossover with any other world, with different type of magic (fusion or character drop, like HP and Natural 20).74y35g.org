The title says all. I'm looking for a crossover story with any other franchise that has a different type of magic than HP. For instance: D&D, The Elder Scrolls, Shadowrun etc.

It could be either world fusion or simple character drop, either from HP world to the other one, or (preferred) other way around.

And like I said in the title, "Harry Potter and the Natural 20" is a good example.


** linkffn(5846162) features a chakra-wielding harry. It's really a cool story, even if it loses steam as it goes;

linkffn(9596404) less cross-over and more inspiration, but still a good read.

    can be considered a crackfic because the OC (Harris) is OPed and doesn't take anything seriously in the story.

    there isn't much from Buffy in this story, Xander and Willow talk more or less like their original selves, but that's it.

    Xander invents magical phones, a mirror to broadcast TV from elsewhere, creates magical wands, has a familiar direwolf

    The main plotline is pretty much the same up to and including year 4. Not much originality in that direction.

    There are some interesting thoughts on magical theory but very little.

    - Harry doesn't use his full potential as a wizard.

    - The story plot isn't very original, it's basically the main questline for the first ME.

    - There is no continuation for the story.

    - subplots and challenges get solved through “cheat codes” like the Dobby AI or Harry's powers. There isn't much of a real challenge in the story, except for the cases artificially constructed through IdiotBalls.

    marysue-ish protag, too many clichés and boring slice-of-life scenes and dialogues, which seem to be building towards an eventual harem ending

    admittedly, the plot gets more interesting right before the story reaches its unfinished state

    plot (total spoilers): Harry saves the /SW: Clone Wars/ series' protag from a group of headhunters, hires a hacker to search for any information about S. Black, saves the wookie planet (twice), retrieves the now-dead hackers' infodump, uses the infodump to find a hidden planet on which the last 2 sith lords were cloning force users. those clones that were of dead force users were gradually being "awakened" --- the old souls were somehow coming back into those clones.

*** by-the-by, I believe you're confusing the trope of a "Peggy Sue", (which refers to a situation where a character travels back to an earlier point in their timeline with their memories intact) with a "Mary Sue" (which is the sort of overpowered type of character generally assumed to be a blatant author avatar) - you used the former when I think you meant to use the latter

** Warcraft has a relatively big set of options and instance as far as I know.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8933408/1/Wizard-Runemaster]]) Has Harry still be pretty common wizard and not learn new things other than use a BIG ASS SWORD. Later on, however, is referenced that WoW's mana and Harry's magic is the same, as he can 'recharge' with mage's water.

Then there is simplistic linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7071900/1/Just-one-more-level]]) where he just goes into the game ala SAO for a bit, almost, and learns a bunch of WoW-magic to use for real.

Similarly linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5520882/1/Wizarding-Warcraft]]) has both Harry AND Dudley decide their magic should work like they want it to work, and they decide to go for WoW-like casting.

Is that the kind of thing you are looking for, regardless of if you are not much into WoW?
