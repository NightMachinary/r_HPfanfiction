I remember reading a bit of a fanfiction about a world where it was more likely for witches to be born than wizards, and that for this reason, families with more wizards were more powerful. Witches were more drawn to powerful wizards and they tried to 'bond' with them to secure a mate. I remember reading the early chapters where muggleborns were given an intro to magical life. Any help would be appreciated.

***** Emotionally heavy though, especially later on. Marris sure knows how to stress you.
