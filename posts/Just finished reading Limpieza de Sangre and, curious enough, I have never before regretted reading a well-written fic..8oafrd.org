** LDS is a unique concept with good execution up until around 4 or 5 chapters from the end. It sort of went off the rails from there. I agree completely that the ending was not fitting and far from satisfying.

** Thanks for the info, this is the only reason why I haven't started reading LdS, I'm always wary of TE7's ending, from that garbo that is the epilogue from Pureblood Princess to Vitam Paramus. The dude has a wonderful hand for writing, is extremely funny when he wants, develops his characters masterfully, but just can't make a god forsaken ending.

Sad about it though. I was hoping this would be a good one.

** With the lack of quality in fan fiction these past few years I think any talented writer should be celebrated regardless of their flaws. I think that the ending of LdS is more like the ending of a television show season or a movie than that of a book. It clearly sets up the next arc. I won't lie that most of the time I am waiting for a fic to update it is one of TE7s because they are talented and consistent.

Also VP was fantastic.

I don't really see a problem with the ending. If this fic was a self contained story, the unresolved plot points would be a problem, but a few chapters from the sequel have already been posted.

LdS is a straightforward, maybe to the point of it's detriment, coming-of-age story who's arc was completed during the scene when Harry makes a decision to leave Hogwarts and travel. All the unresolved plot issues set up in Voldermort's house, the park, or the few during Hermione's POV are foreshadowing for a different story. LdS is one of the few fanfics out there that bothered not only to use foreshadowing, but use it well and frequently. Considering the frequency in the story, readers could be expected to have become acclimated to be introduced to new facts, plot points, or bits of dialogue that were only going to pay off at a later date.

The only improvement to the Epilogue story wise could be that it would have been better to end on a cliffhanger during the start of the interview scene with Hermione noticing that someone was apparating in. As they are written, the older Harry sequences fit better as the first chapter to the sequel than as the end of the LdS epilogue.

*** If your story has a lot of unresolved tension, it is not a good story. Foreshadowing for sequels is fine, and when done well even great. Setting up a bigger arc is totally something you can do.

But your story should also work as a piece on its own. If it needs its sequels to be a good story, those sequels shouldve been part of your first story.

The epilogue serves as a prologue to the next story instead of an epilogue of the story it's a part of lmao. The epilogue was Grindy breaking out of prison, right? It's a pretty good story, but really? Literally the entire epilogue was unresolved.

****** The Grindelwald escape/rejuvenation was around a 1/6th of the total epilogue and the final POV of the chapter. The epilogue spent more time covering who Hermione and Harry turned into and what they were doing a decade after the events of LdS, resolved the lingering question of their romantic relationship at the end of LdS, explained the political landscape due to Voldermort's resurrection then second death at the hands of Harry, the state and future of Hogwart's educational staff, the fate of the important secondary characters Fudge and Percy, what Avery had been up to and his status as a fugitive in Wizarding society, and even mentioned a bit about the third member of the golden trio. That is pretty much a satisfactory epilogue as one could reasonably expect.

What else do you and everyone else think was unresolved or missing? Secondly, how is an epilogue like that more of a prologue than epilogue?

** Yep. I'm still reserving judgement for LdS until I have read the completed sequel.

But for that, the individual ranking of the story fell many spots from me. Reminds me of Delenda Est's second half derailment. But in contrast to that slow trainwreck, I pretty much got whiplash from the sudden change of pace.

All that being said, it was an interesting and (IMHO) a clever way of bridging the two stories and resolving the missing Harry plot line from the end of LdS.
