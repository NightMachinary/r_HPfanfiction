Prompt inspired by an earlier discussion, where I expressed annoyance at the fact that divination at Hogwarts seemed to be exclusively dedicated to fortune telling, when generally, there is more to divination than that in most other universes that involve magic.


** "Then why do we study fortunetelling so much?"

"Well, that's the flashy stuff, for one," said the Professor. "If I show you that I can divine the contents of a sealed box, you might say 'but you packed the box to begin with' even though I didn't. The other part is that Divination requires the seer to tune into the observations where hints can be given. It isn't a voice from the ether saying 'you left the keys in your waistcoat pocket', but it can guide you to where those keys are left, if you're paying attention to what isn't random when it should be."

"What I don't understand," chimed in a rather haughty, swotty, sort of witch found in nearly every first year Divination class, "is how anything /can/ be divined. Predicting the future assumes that it has already been determined, but even if that were so, certainly we can change it using magic."

The professor turned to inspect the witch, unusual eyeglasses reflecting a convenient sunbeam into her eyes. "Either it is or it isn't, is that your view? Well, let me assure you that magic can gather guidance from times beyond the present, but that doesn't mean it is immutable. The path of a river is predictable overall, even if predicting the path of a leaf floating in it is not. And yet, the leaf is unlikely to turn upstream, either.

"That said, you're missing the true importance and value of Divination, which is not to find out where things are going, but to determine where they are now, and where they have been."

*** Yeah. This is more along the lines that I was thinking. There is typically a /lot/ more that can be considered divination than is attributed to the subject in canon. I think even the “Point Me” charm, especially as it's used in fanfics(“Point Me Harry Potter!”) could technically be considered divination.

**** Read a fic where the diagnostic charms used by Madamn Pomfrey were technically divination. Many of the useful divination spells got rolled into charms class.

** Harry knew the class was bad when even Hermione had walked out of it. If the girl who was complaining about wizards believing muggles still dumped their filth in the street yet stayed in Muggle Studies thought a class was bad. Well, he wasn't the brightest student, he was more than willing however to follow the brightest student in thought. If not action, he after all didn't have other classes to fill up his second slot, dropping wasn't an option for him.

So he mustered up his thoughts and decided to look through the library. There had to be more on divination, perhaps it was simply the teacher who was bunk and not the art itself.

Ron had been interested enough to agree but not enough to dig through the library. Ron was not a book learner, he learned through doing. Asking him for help would just mean he would find Ron soon frustrated and soon they would be doing something else.

He really didn't like his divination teacher and refused to believe that she was a true expert. There had to be more to this! It was an important enough class to be taught at Hogwarts!

There had to be something here, he just was missing it. There was a rather large section of divination in the library he found. It was amazing to see how much more there was covered in the section than the bits they had learned in class.

Until he had started reading the books that was. No wonder Hermione had given the subject up as bunk. The books were vague at best and would contradict themselves sometimes in the same page!

He refused to believe there was nothing to this though, there had to be something in this mess that he could use though.

It was as he was skimming a rather long-winded book that a single line stood out.

"I once again find myself having to use my talents to divine the issue wrong with someone at the new Hospital, without my power to see what was wrong with the person the so called healers would have never found the issue."

The woman had then went on to complain about a need for money as her services were rarely being called on recently.

He read back to the start of the chapter far closer and thought he had figured out the basics at least.

Divination was simply seeking out information about something outside yourself. Most thought, he had as well, that meant seeing the future or the occasional spell to find water. A spell branch rendered useless with the water charm.

It could also be used to find information about people. Information such as what was wrong with a patient. Divination experts had been frequently called on when St. Mungo's had been first opened it seemed.

So what did that mean now? Why was there not other references to this in any of the books he had read?

He had a lead now though, somewhere to start proving that divination was useful and not a totally bunk practice.

It took him some time to find the section pertaining to healing. It was a catch all grouping of disciplines like defense against the dark arts. A little charms, some transfiguration, potions, and here was the winner, divination.

The library was arranged by idea and type. So looking for information was always a challenge though it could be found. It didn't help the library was gigantic and he had gotten fully lost a few times.

He had finally gotten help from a nice Hufflepuff who had told him where in the labyrinth he would find books on healing. It was set in an alcove that was easy to miss, so easy he had spent ten minutes wandering the area trying to find it.

It was a nice sized reading room with a good showing on the number of books. He scanned the titles trying to see any that would match the idea of divination for learning about injuries.

"Looking beneath, a guide to seeing under the skin."

There! He then began looking through the books near it to find that it was a large section overall. There was one that seemed the most introductory and he began with it.

Taking a seat he set it on his lap and began reading. He was well satisfied to see that he had been right!

Divination was an integral part of healing! In fact without divination magic it was nearly impossible to sort through the many possible magical problems a patient could suffering from.

He was truly fascinated with what he had found and was soon entranced. Just the introduction section explained how to use the various abilities, powers, spells, and rituals of divination to solve some of the greatest dangers the wizarding world had faced.

The shrinking snivels no longer threatened the aged with growing smaller with each sneeze. A cure had been found through the information gained through divination.

So entranced was he that he never noticed the two new occupants of the room as he grew more excited with the wonders of divination healing.

Madam Pomfrey had been reading a recently published healers journal when the 7th year Hufflepuff Smithson had arrived in her office. He was apprenticing during his NEWT years as a healer and was showing he could handle to work.

"Madam Pomfrey, Harry Potter was asking around the library for the healers section. I gave him some vague directions to give me time to find you as he looked for it."

Everyone in the healers program knew the boy was in far more terrific accidents than anyone else. If he was looking for something to heal himself with that meant it was likely far more than his usual near life ending problem.

Nodding at his wisdom she thanked him before getting her on call staffer to watch the wing as she walked off.

Calling for a house elf to inform the Headmaster of what was going on she strode to the library with purpose.

Albus arrived soon walking along with her.

"While I am glad to see he is going out of his way be self reliant I fear what is so dangerous that he is looking for healing magic by himself."

Pomfrey could only agree completely at Albus's comment. The boy attracted injury worse than someone under a curse of foul luck. Huh, that would be something interesting to see. If there was something about him that replicated the effects of a foul luck curse.

They made their was quickly to the healers section and looked into the reading room to see what the boy was doing.

She turned to see Albus had an eyebrow lifted as they both noticed the title. It was an introduction to using divination in healing. It took him a bit to make the connection.

Casting a silent privacy charm he began speaking to Poppy.

"Miss Granger has recently quit divination class entirely. I believe Mr. Potter has taken into his head to find proof that divination is in fact a useful course."

Poppy nodded, there was one student every few years who would find the healing section through a chain of events similiar to this. It was not any easy to find trail though and she would have to track down yet another book most likely and remove it from the divination section.

The use of divination in healing was something that had been decided to be kept quite centuries ago. When Octavius Ranchilde had used the skill of divination and healing together to kill off over a quarter of London with a plague in 1666. That had been the snip that cut the crup's tail as it were.

Now, healers were bound by a rather restrictive oath and were carefully vetted before they were even allowed to learn healing. The healers section was restricted even and kept a careful log of all students that entered it.

They talked for a few minutes before coming to an agreement. Either Harry would accept taking an oath as required or he would have his memories removed of the event. Of course that would only be after they got the name of the book, or person, that had led him to the healing section from divination.

They knew he would likely have his memory removed, even Albus was sure of it. The strictness of not doing harm to others was nothing something that Harry Potter, enemy of Tom Riddle, would be able to survive.

That strict oath was well known, as well as the curse attached to it. Any witch or wizard foolish enough to attack a healer would find the Curse of Mungo wrought upon them. To never taste or smell again. For all color to fade from their sight. That all sounds were flat and dull without range. All the senses were numbed greatly, no joy or happiness would ever be theirs again. It was a cursed existence that found most withered away within weeks. Dead inside of a month as they simply lost the will to live.

It was a truly horrific curse for those who would dare attack those bound by oath to never harm others.

/BREAK/

Harry sat down at the table that night at the great hall and saw Hermione look up from her meal.

"Well admit it now will you. Divination is bunk Harry, you have to change it! I promise to get you caught up if you take any of the other classes. I am sure Professor McGonagall will understand!"

Harry had to laugh at her antics. Waving her off for a second he began filling his plate as he answered her.

"Already dropped the class this afternoon Hermione. Spoke with the Headmaster even about it. Don't worry it's going to be fine."

Hermione was surprised that he had agreed with her so easily. He had spent the last week in the library determined to prove her wrong. Still she was happy to see he wasn't going to waste his time on such a useless thing such as divination anymore.

"So what elective are you taking up Harry?"

"I have to drop Defense and Care along with Divination for my new course. The feeding portion of Care and spell practice in Defense make it impossible for me to take them."

Ron wasn't the fastest book learner but he was rather sharp in his own way. He looked up from where he had been half listening in and looked at Harry in awe.

"Bloody hell Harry, you're going to be a Healer!"

Of course Ron had the tact of a flobberworm so he yelled it. The hall quieted down as the word soon spread.

The boy-who-lived had entered the healer program, a full two years early in fact.

Smiling Harry looked up as he answered.

"Yes, it's going to be great!"

** Technically any magic that has something to do with information can be divination. So magic used to gather information is divination but magic that is used to change or hide the information is also divination.

So things like scrying, leglimency or seeing the pasts of objects/peoples/locations is also divination.

Fidelius, Oclumency and such are also divination.

Even the Taboo can be considered as divination since it is used to track down information.
