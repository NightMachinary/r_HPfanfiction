So that basically means that Harry Decides to get some help from the underworld to wipe out Voldemort and his followers. He plans to kill them to the last babe.

And not just men, but the women and children too.

Said denizens look like this:

So basically Voldemort is just someone cute and adorable compared to Harry and his followers.

** I know there's BWL-Meets-IMP (though it doesn't seem to be going in this direction) as a Helluva Boss/Harry Potter crossover, I kinda want to see Harry hire IMP to kill all the Death Eaters/Voldemort.
