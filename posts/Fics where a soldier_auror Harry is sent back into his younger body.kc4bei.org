Along the lines of Whiskey time travel, but where hid mind is sent back into his younger body, start of sixth year or earlier. I just think it'd be really interesting to see how everyone would process the contrast of a child/teen acting liking an adult soldier.


** Linkffn(from ruin),linkffn(I'm still here),libkffn(I'm back) all are pretty similar

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  Rose is just born and Al is due. But after finding an ancient mirror, Harry, Ron, Hermione and baby Rose are sent back into their 11-year-old bodies the night before they first met. Trapped in the past and wary of the Wizarding World, they seek to kill Voldemort as soon as possible. Together Harry, Ron and Hermione shall show the past who the Golden Trio really are.
