[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.]]

I absolutely adore it, it's an AU on the size of the Firebird Trilogy with just as good worldbuilding. A personal favourite is General Riddle of Slytherins armies who's soldiers were so loyal and fierce they earned the nickname 'Death Eaters' along with the Weasley's famous fighters who send their many sons to fight earning them great respect for their bravery.

It's really cool, the house system is rebranded into castes and you get your house symbol tatooed on your left arm, muggleborns have no caste and are unworthy of going to Hogwarts (usually).


** Normally the reader should not be calm when a character is in a room full of Death Eaters.

The Order is genuinely mysterious, complete with legends (Tonks!) and secrets. I like it.

Harry starts a bit /less/ mature than in canon, and Hermione's maturity is thoroughly justified, so there's a friction between them that canon never had. I don't count this as a fault in the story; stories need conflict and character arcs.

** Great worldbuilding and generally good characterizations, but for two very central characters. But the Hermione glorification is strong in this one, and Riddle explaining his entire agenda to an eleven year old seemed entirely too stupid to me.

** It's all right, I guess, or at the very least interesting. Hard to tell where it's going -- they're not even half-way through first year. The world feels like it could be quite special, but with all the inconsistencies and contradictions I can't be sure.

The characters are a very mixed bag. Dean and Justin aren't really defined in canon, so they seem perfectly fine. I can see why Harry and Neville are the way they are and if I squint hard enough the same goes for Ron. A selfishly ambitious Hermione is a bit harder to accept, but sure, why not? Intelligent and cunning Draco makes no sense and is jarring to read. This version's basically an original creation anyway, so give him a different mother and a different first name and be done with it. As long as I have to compare him to his canon counterpart he just seems unbelievable.

I'm already quite bored with the war games, so I hope they'll get relegated to the background soon. I'm not going to wait for every update, but it seems worth returning to once the story is further along.

*** I agree with your ideas on the characters. Hermione moved on way too quickly and tbh I think it would have been better having her taken at 7/8 and then deciding to work hard for the CATS and time skipping to halfway through the first chapter. Just to give a reason for the changes. Totally agree about Draco though, they author would have been better not having him there and using Nott or another not fleshed out character or just drop that side of the story and leave him more canon compliant.

I still think the war games make no sense. If Gryffindor's are the ones fighting why is everyone involved? Surely it would be better to have a Slytherin commander who gives orders from above with a Ravenclaw researcher or something? I don't hate them though, they could definitely be done better but if they are made more like Quidditch in the books (big early establishing presence then fade) it would be better.

I thought the games worked pretty well: everyone has the same classes anyway; showing off how good at magic, clever, and athletic one is is good for social standing regardless of one's caste; in the real world, castes can be very flexible, with some Serpents taking pride by fighting at the front (e.g., Weasleys) and others having to fight off assassination attempts; and anyone can be drafted and sent to the front if the war goes badly enough. Lack of age-brackets is a little weird, though.

Yeah, Draco got a bit an upgrade, to his HPMOR level; I think Slytherin's takeover made /everyone/ a bit more cunning and ambitious. And yet, in the RotS world, I don't think there's room for a character like canon Draco. At the very least, he'd have to act a lot more dignified.
