** Y'know, I think both extremes are wrong. With a few exceptions JKR tends to associate physical unattractiveness with evil/unpleasant characters, or at least ones with notable negative traits.

*** I think it's more the fact that she's really good at writing from Harry's point of view. Harry doesn't like Snape: he won't think positive things about him.

It's the same with other characters. Look at how Harry describes Hermione (bushy hair, large front teeth, bossy voice) versus how he describes Ginny ("she dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun." (CoS, pg. 43), bright brown eyes, flaming hair). There's all these descriptions of characters that are really written from Harry's point of view, rather than how they really are.

Having said that, though, I still think Snape was nowhere near some fanon descritpions in "reality". Harry wasn't nearly the only one to describe Snape as greasy haired throughout the series.

**** Looking at the linked image, I think things like "gaunt" and "overlarge nose" are probably accurate whereas saying Snape was twice as ugly as a gargoyle seems more like Harry editorializing. Reading how JKR described him, I don't think Alan Rickman in character as Snape is outrageously far off. Greasy hair and uneven teeth don't necessarily make someone hideous. Whenever I see interpretations of canon Snape, they always draw him as the crypt keeper and disregard that fact that he was only in his thirties.

**** True, though I think the trend still exists when adjusting for Harry's bias. For example, fat characters are disproportionately bad.

****** Vernon and Dudley, for sure, plus Marge. I don't know if OP was referring to JK or fanon, but Neville was plumpish, and nervy/timid, and inept at first. Later on he'd lost his puppy fat along with his inhibitions. Slughorn was a bit ambiguous, what with being probably the only fence sitter I can think of - self preservation came first and foremost, and he was essentially a sort of Lockhart, really, except Slughorn was genuine. A survivor rather than a fighter who always put #1 first, and in the Gryffindor/British world that's a negative. That Smith lady Riddle stole the stuff from was a negative. ETA Pettigrew, and I'll never forgive her for Scabbers

Mrs Weasley is a good exception, except that it's reduced down to matronliness. Madame Maxine is an excellent example of someone on the okay side. Can't remember, but I think Madame Pomfrey was plump as well, which was also part of the matron persona. Don't know much about Sprout, but Hagrid wasn't fat as much as just half-giant.

I can't think of anyone else, apart from the Rotund Reverend, who was an inept nonperson, the Fat Lady, who was comic relief, and the various stocky Slytherins. It's not a hard and fast problem, but for the first few books she follows the cliches. In fanon, fat people are usually either stupid, Hufflepuffs, or nasty.

** One error on the canon side: Snape isn't described as having facial hair, and JKR's own drawings show him clean-shaven (well, sort of - she gives him some stubble).

And because that's the way I roll, I prefer the Snarry version of this:

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1634][Canon vs. Fanon Snape]]

Incidentally, if Rowling based her physical descriptions of Snape on John Nettleship, the chemistry teacher who was probably her biggest source of Snape-ish inspiration (and authorial revenge), then bring it on. Nettleship may not have been everyone's cup of tea, but he wasn't ugly:

[[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/artwork/John/John_27-9-1976_Beachley.jpg][John Nettleship photo]]

Of course, that's probably irrelevant, because it's more likely that JKR piled on the ugliness to reflect her character. She was writing a children's book, after all, and everything was exaggerated accordingly.

**** True, true. Snape's... I don't think we ever get a good height, but he's a few inches shorter than Sirius in book five, who know how tall Sirius is though. And Snape's definitely +skinny+ not shredded.

Edit: And you'll never hear anyone say their friend saw Snape in the shower.
