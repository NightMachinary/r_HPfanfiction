You know when you find a finally good fanfiction hoping to read about your favourite characters but then you find them so misrepresented that you wonder if these people even read the books you did? Because Sirius in fanfiction is just so misrepresented and OOC that I can't keep quiet about it anymore.

*Sirius is a sugar-high man child who always makes cringey name puns*

This contradicts his entire canon personality. This man has gone through a lot. He was an outcast at home, he grew up in a war and later went on to fight in the Order, got imprisoned in hell on earth, spent two years on the run and a year in captivity, only to die later on. Oops. Even at school, when he was happy with his friends, Sirius had issues, he wasn't a giggly teen who spent his entire time painting his nails and braiding his hair, so concerned about it. He was 'carelessly handsome', he didn't spend four hours in front of his mirror. Also, he didn't whine to people, nor did he call McGonagall Minnie to her face. He was popular, and that wouldn't have been seen as cool. He was also not as different from his family as he thought he was:

#+begin_quote
  'Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass, looking rather *haughty* and bored, but very handsomely so'.
#+end_quote

Rather familiar description for a certain family. He was just like any other Black, except with better morality and a sense of humour. Sirius also was NOT born with an open mind. He grew up in a racist household, he'd have prejudice even as a first year, no matter how open-minded he already was before that. His friendship with the others would have gradually made him detach from his family.

Sirius likely didn't lick people in his human form, thank you very much. Ew. He also wasn't a highly energetic puppy who couldn't sit down. His sense of humour was dark, even cruel at times. He sent Snape down the Whomping Willow knowing full well what could happen. He showed absolutely no hint of remorse later on, even saying that Snape deserved it. That boy and the sugar-high excited giggly idiot in fanfiction aren't the same person. But Sirius also isn't stoic, serious and withdrawn either. He was always up for a bit of mischief. He was a Marauder! He had a flying motorcycle, how cool is that? He also isn't flighty nor impulsive. When it comes to keeping Harry safe when he is in a stable mood, he is actually extremely responsible. He was extremely cautious in Goblet of Fire, especially of Harry, to the point where he was annoyed by it after leaving the cave.

He's also kind, not sadistically cruel. Dumbledore himself says that Kreacher was an exception, and Sirius was kind to house-elves in general. That doesn't excuse his behaviour but he didn't kick them around wherever he went.

Sirius also doesn't stick his tongue out at every authority figure. He doesn't follow their rules and is extremely reckless, but he doesn't stick out his tongue at his professor and then run up a flight of stairs, giggling along the way. I'm cringing just writing this.

Sirius also wasn't 100% extroverted. It is canon that in his depressive episodes he would get all withdrawn in Buckbeak's room, so he didn't always want a cuddle or a cry as Molly or Remus comforted him. He wasn't a people's person all the time. He was also human and everyone loves getting some time alone sometimes. He's human. He had a tight circle of friends at school and was loyal to them, especially James. I don't think he was that close to Lupin but that's a topic for later.

*Sirius as a womaniser*

Other than the posters which were hung up to piss off his parents, there is no indication of him having a girlfriend every other day, or multiple at once even. Or being even a pervert. Also, pedophilic!Sirius. I won't get into that. There was a girl eyeing him in OotP, but he was oblivious to her. It could go either way, but there's no solid proof of him being a womaniser. Also, James was the one who kept eyeing the girls at the lake, not Sirius.

*Sirius being a talentless idiot*

Where the /hell/ did this even come from? If I remember correctly, Sirius was set up to be an incredibly powerful and talented wizard, and if you don't believe then check /these/ out:

#+begin_quote
  'Both very *bright*, of course - *exceptionally* bright, in fact.'
#+end_quote

Minerva McGonagall, PoA, page 215

As far as I know, bright is a synonym of intelligent, NOT dim-witted. Lets fetch a dictionary, no?

#+begin_quote
  intelligent and quick-witted
#+end_quote

Synonyms include:

#+begin_quote
  clever, intelligent, sharp, quick-witted, quick, smart, canny, astute, intuitive, acute, alert, keen, perceptive, ingenious, inventive, resourceful, proficient, accomplished, gifted, brilliant
#+end_quote

Nothing here includes stupid or drooling mess.

Then McGonagall finds it necessary to reinforce her statement and add exceptional to the mix. Now, exceptional means:

#+begin_quote
  unusually good; outstanding.
#+end_quote

They were unusually bright, unusual is out of the ordinary. So he wasn't even ordinary, or moderately bright or talented, let alone below average, he was /outstanding/ in a class that included people like Snape and Lupin/./ Now, this isn't Fudge, or someone easily impressed, no this is the fandom's queen, the holy woman raised on a pedestal. And now we're not going to take her word for this, why, because it's Sirius and James? McGonagall isn't someone who's easily impressed, or a sugarcoating woman who will tell her students that it's 'amazing! Wow, here take a full mark lolz'. Note that McGonagall here isn't speaking to Harry about his father, so no glorifying for his parents, no she's sitting in the Three Broomsticks talking to the Minister of Magic about an insane mass-murderer. There's really no room for glorifying such a man. And no, McGonagall isn't someone who will bend to social pressure to remember Harry's parents in an entirely different light.

And then you've got to take into account McGonagall's own accomplishments. There is no denying that she is a phenomenal witch. This entry on her wiki alone is solid proof of her talent, and it's just the beginning of describing her:

#+begin_quote
  Magical Mastery: Minerva was an i*ncredibly powerful and talented witch*, having achieved *top grades* in her [[https://O.W.Ls][O.W.Ls]] /and/ N.E.W.Ts when she was at Hogwarts. Minerva mastered magic at such a young age, becoming the recipient of several /awards such as Transfiguration Today's Most Promising Newcomer Award at the time of her graduation and even trained under/ */Albus Dumbledore personally/* /whilst at school/. As an adult, Minerva still continued to prove she was a very powerful witch and an inspirational teacher, having studied hard and rose to the top of her classes in her youth.
#+end_quote

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall][Wiki]]

She received official rewards for her talent. Enough said. And Dumbledore, who is also a transfiguration prodigy by the way, taught her personally. Another proof of his ability is this:

#+begin_quote
  'Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air'.
#+end_quote

PoA, page 400. This guy just:

1. Performed complex transfiguration
2. With a wand that is not his own
3. And he had NOT won over
4. Was out of practice for 12 YEARS

Some synonyms for exceptional, by the way:

#+begin_quote
  outstanding, extraordinary, remarkable, unusually good, special, especial, excellent, phenomenal, prodigious; unequalled, unparalleled, unrivalled, unsurpassed, unsurpassable, unexcelled, peerless, matchless, second to none, in a league of their own, first-rate, first-class, of the first order, of the first water; top-notch, tip-top, stellar
#+end_quote

Nothing here says moderate. To support this, the guy even became an animagus when he was only 15 (which is considered extraordinary by DUMBLEDORE, who might only just be the most powerful wizard in the world), and he started when he was just about 12! McGonagall achieved this after graduation and was aided by Dumbledore. Sirius on the other hand wasn't aided by anyone. In fact, /he/ and James were aiding Peter.

#+begin_quote
  'An *extraordinary* achievement'.
#+end_quote

Albus Dumbledore, PoA, page 454. This is the most powerful wizard in the world, and he calls their achievement extraordinary.

Then we have dear Slughorn making a comment about the dead Sirius:

#+begin_quote
  'Shame, he was a *talented* boy! I got his brother Regulus when he came along but /I'd have liked to have the set/'
#+end_quote

Horace Slughorn, HBP, page 59

This is Horace Slughorn, the man who taught Potions to Snape, who altered his own potions. He also taught Lily, who was supposed to have also been good at the subject. He doesn't have low standards.

Definition of talented for those wondering:

#+begin_quote
  having a /natural/ aptitude or skill for something.
#+end_quote

Sirius had a natural aptitude for Potions, so no, he likely didn't fail the subject. Remus said something prior to this that makes me believe that he was near the top of the class behind Snape in potions, but the top in almost every other subject, but I'll include that later on. Synonyms for those doubtful:

#+begin_quote
  gifted, skilful, skilled, accomplished, brilliant, expert, consummate, master, masterly, first-rate, polished, artistic, adroit, dexterous, able, competent, capable, apt, deft, adept, proficient; informal: crack, top-notch, top-drawer, ace, wizard
#+end_quote

And if you take Rowling's words into account, Sirius could have EASILY been the person to brew the Animagus Potion. It's a possibility, and it isn't confirmed, but it's there. There is no record at all of Slughorn saying anything about James's ability in potions, so he could've been just average, or slightly above so. I also doubt Peter brewed it since he 'needed all the help he could get'. We also know Remus was bad at potions, he himself admitting as such. That potion is NO easy feat to be done, just have a look at what the wiki has to say about it:

#+begin_quote
  This potion is a key step to becoming an animagus, and is very *difficult*, *complex* and time-consuming to brew correctly, with frightening consequences if done incorrectly.
#+end_quote

It's difficult, and complex. It's not just any potion to be brewed. It also requires focus to brew a complex potion.

#+begin_quote
  It is possible that James Potter, Sirius Black, or Peter Pettigrew did not have to brew the potion because one of the other two did it for them. However, they still would've had to have held the Mandrake Leaf in their mouths for a month.
#+end_quote

I guess that person could very easily be Sirius. But that is all just speculation, however, Rowling rarely gets anything slip between her fingers when it comes to details in the books (I feel ridiculous saying this after Crimes of Grindelwald but I digress).

That's three Professors boasting about Sirius's talents so far. And then Dumbledore also calls him clever after his death but he had just died and Harry was in shock, so we'll let that one pass. His Pottermore page says that he is talented in non-verbal magic and charms. This man co-created the Marauder's Map, which is an impressive piece of magic. And it even bares a close resemblance to Riddle's Diary by having their personalities in the map itself. And Dumbledore calls the diary brilliant. Yes, it was a group project but:

#+begin_quote
  The Marauder's Map is lasting testimony to the advanced magical ability of the *four* friends who included Harry Potter's father, godfather and favourite teacher.

  The magic used in the map's creation is advanced and impressive; it includes the Homonculous Charm, enabling the possessor of the map to track the movements of every person in the castle, and it was also enchanted to forever repel (as insultingly as possible) the curiosity of their nemesis, Severus Snape.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-marauders-map][Pottermore]]

Yes, the four of their ability in Charms, including Pettigrew.

#+begin_quote
  Performing spells non-verbally is very *difficult* and requires a good deal of practise
#+end_quote

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Nonverbal_spell][Harry Potter Wiki]]

Another testament to his ability in Charms is the fact that he did manage to summon six bottles at once, with a single spell:

#+begin_quote
  He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry.
#+end_quote

OotP, page 441

Sirius also hung up posters with a permanent sticking charm before he ran away from home, so between 15 and 16 years of age, in the summer of his Fifth Year. He also has his enchanted motorcycle, which is very similar to Arthur's flying car, which Dumbledore himself said was a neat piece of magic.

He also managed to duel so fiercely that his wand was 'just a blur'. He defeated every Death Eater he was battling up until Bellatrix, who he was battling until he got too cocky. I won't say he would've defeated her because we've got no solid proof he'd have done so, but he could've held his own, definitely, until Dumbledore arrived at the very least. They were equals up until then and Bellatrix managed to go through Kinglsey in a shorter amount of time than Sirius, who prior to this was duelling three Death Eaters at once. This is taking into account that Bellatrix is:

1. One of the most formidable Death Eaters
2. Was born in 1951, so had graduated before Sirius even entered Hogwarts, and had eleven more years practice and experience than he did being personally trained by Voldemort as his top Death Eater, as she herself said.

He then took to the field duelling her as her equal, if that doesn't prove talent, I don't know what does?

He himself comes from a powerful family, just look at Regulus who was also insanely smart, Bellatrix, Narcissa and Tonks. We don't know anything about Andromeda but it is safe to assume she wasn't a slouch either. He was also quite good at Care of Magical Creatures. He lived with Buckbeak as his best friend, in his depressive episodes he prefers his company over Harry's. He also got along well with Crookshanks and managed to get control Pig.

#+begin_quote
  'We were young, thoughtless - carried away by our own cleverness'.

  'Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school'.
#+end_quote

Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs, PoA.

#+begin_quote
  'Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did'.
#+end_quote

OotP, page 618.

That's Remus talking, but how reliable the last statement is is not very clear. Snape was also extremely talented. However, I have no doubt in mind that Sirius would have been just as powerful as Snape had he lived properly and never been imprisoned, with the knowledge that Voldemort could be back any second and it was his task to protect Harry.

That's my rant, and you might not agree with me, which is totally fine. We all have our own interpretations =)

** To add to your comment:

I have a version of Sirius in my mind, that is often not displayed in fanfiction. In so many stories I read he's a womanizer, I do not see him this way, I think the reason a lot of people do, is because the guy spent 12 years in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, so they want him to have some sort of fun, even if it comes off as womanizing.

I see a character; who hates his parents, and defy them at every turn, however; I also see someone who loves and cares about his brother Regulus, but after Sirius gets sorted into Gryffindor, and Regulus gets sorted into Slytherin, Sirius is uncertain how to talk to his brother, and so they drift apart.

It was also funny the first time for the are you serious? I am Sirius! Joke, but after the 100th time it's gotten old.

Kind of similar to how the Weasley twins often talk one sentence after another, it was funny at first; but now it's gotten old, I have different personalities for Fred and George, and while they might do the complete a sentence thing every now and then, it's not every time that they talk. (More often than not; it's to annoy their family).

Like that, Sirius likes to joke around, but he can in fact be serious. He cares about his friends; and in my headcanon; like how Harry looks up to his friends, and likely considers them family; Sirius looks up to his friends, and think of them as family.

(Probably one of the reasons why Pettigrew's betrayal stung him so badly; he hadn't expected someone he considered part of his family, to do that).

*** The “womanizing” is such an odd point in fanon because it's generally so poorly handled. I think post-Azkaban, it's as you said, people want him to have fun. I can respect that, so long as the inevitably thirteen year old author realizes that one night of mediocre sex does not cure twelve years of torture and fourteen of isolation (spoiler alert: they generally don't).

There's so much room to run as an author with pre-Azkaban Sirius because we know next to nothing. But fics tend to just lean on the womanizer fanon portrayal like it's canon, when it's anything but. The posters may be a sign of a horn dog, excuse the pun, or it may be that he wanted to piss off his mom. He may have loved to sleep around because he was an uninhibited guy, or it may be that (as I conceive it) he never got serious with anyone because he didn't have the healthiest view on intimacy following his upbringing/didn't think he /could/ get involved with anyone because who would marry into his family/didn't want to reveal himself so deeply when he had James and the others for that. Or, maybe his loyalty showed, and he was actually the biggest romantic and most dependable boyfriend in the world. All of that gets left unanalyzed in favor of: Sirius is a canon hottie = so he sleeps with anything that moves.

**** For the posters I tend to think it was more to make his family (more importantly his, mother;) mad, and maybe a little bit was because he was attracted to them (but he was a teenager at that point, what straight male teenager wouldn't be?). I'm a female and even I know that.

But yeah, pre Azkaban Sirius is normally such an eye rolling experience, because the author goes with the typical lazy Sirius, who wasn't good at school, with the incredibly lame are you serious? I am Sirius joke, who was also a womanizer. It gets so unbelievably old and not how I see pre Azkaban Sirius at all.

If anything; I go with the opposite; of him never having a girlfriend, or only ever having one girlfriend (In that case; it's normally Marlene McKinnon), but with the no girlfriend case I tend to go with, a lot of it is because of what his family stands for; and the girls might like the way he looks, but tend to not want anything to do with him, as a person.

** Nice analysis. Sirius is a tricky character to write because his in-canon self is so contradictory. He can be very cruel, but there are also moments when he's shockingly kind and open-hearted. He's very serious, brooding and haunted; he also calls himself “Snuffles” without irony. He's arrogant but seems to lack confidence that others care for him, self-involved but puts his friends (and most especially Harry) unceasingly first. And the list goes on. It's one of the reasons he's such an interesting character, perhaps Rowling's most complex, but is so easily flattened and can read OOC when one trait is built up at the exclusion of others. You have to touch on all of this, and more, or you don't properly have a Sirius in your story.

His humour is also horribly done in fanon. It's such biting, sarcastic wit---again, a reflection of his intelligence (and anger)---but people always go for the “Serious?” “No, I'm Sirius!” pun which sets my teeth on edge. I can't imagine canon Sirius ever once laughing at that, to be honest.

Where the hell the sugar high child in fanon came from is beyond me...

*** I honestly thought it was incredibly shitty of Dumbledore (and I defend Dumbledore sometimes) to basically put Sirius on house arrest and how his death panned out. I think his storyline would have been more interesting if Dumbledore, who still had a fair amount of power before the end GOF, threw his wait around and got Sirius a trial---maybe even abroad, as he was head of the ICW.

Dude was wrongfully locked up in a prison for over ten years, not only is that a human rights violation, but it's even worse by the standards of the prison. Then he gets out and sees that Dumbledore got off Snape, a marked death eater who was up enough that he interacted with Lord Voledmort, completely off and found him a job, that Lucius is walking around home free, etc.

I can't imagine being wrongfully locked up, and seeing the people who actually committed crimes, walking around free would drive anyway half mad and bitter. Like imagine someone locked up and wrongfully accused of being a nazi and tortured for ten years, and then they get out and see SS officers strolling around, with complete freedom. I feel like canon Sirius should have been more furious.

Anyway, I think canon Sirius would have been more interesting if he was free and managed to build a life for himself in a few years (and had counseling), but died in the final battle. It would still be tragic, but not the tragedy porn that JK concocted. But I think she wanted Teddy to parallel Harry, hence killing off all the Marauders.

I could write a Ted Talk on Dumbledore and Sirius and that would be its conclusion.

Dumbledore steamrolled him in every conceivable way; it is amazing to me that Sirius ever showed him respect. It's one of the reasons that I have such a tough time with fanon!Sirius who rebels for the sake of rebellion against any and all authority figures, because his canon self decidedly does not. I don't know what custody rights look like in the wizarding world (is there a similar concept to legal guardianship?) but if they even remotely parallel the muggle world, Sirius should have trounced Hagrid at Godric's Hollow, snatched Harry, and ridden off into the sunset with his middle finger waving down to Albus. Harry was /his/ to raise; Dumbledore be damned.

Rowling seems to have no idea of the character she created. There's an interview where she essentially expressed shock that people were upset at his character death because she found him to be only a “brooding presence” in the book. It almost seems like she didn't know what to do with him and his arc could have gone somewhere much more interesting if he got to build a life. It would have been nice to see him have at least one year that wasn't unmitigated bullshit.

***** Yes, I sort of thought at the end she really only wanted to focus on Harry, Snape, and Dumbledore and sort of let the other characters development by the wayside. Like Ron, Tonks, Remus---I thought they became rather thinly sketched. I always kind of assumed Sirius was in total shock when he handed Harry over, which makes it even worse on Hagrid and Dumbeldore's part.

Haha, no, I'm not the FFN writer...I didn't even know there was an FFN with a similar name. I actually picked it because it means eagle, and I like birds and figured there were a million eagle handles and few altairs, and that it also the name of a star in my favorite constellation. I later learned that it was apparently a common name in various video games.

*** His contradictory nature is exactly why he's my favourite character! He's one of Rowling's most complex characters and I don't think she herself even realises that at all, she sort of did throw him under the bus, so to speak. She did underuse, a lot. People really like to cheapen one of her most interesting characters. Now when most people say that Sirius is their favourite character I wonder if they mean the Sirius from the books or fanon!Sirius.

I wasn't even sad when he died, just angry and I'm still salty about it. I think he should've died in 6th year, that way the plot could progress as much as it did in the original series and he could've had a little bit of happiness.

**** Absolutely. He's my favorite too (for canon, as well as his fanon potential). He's an endlessly fascinating character to me. In the right fanfiction author's hands, I as easily see him as the grizzled Minister for Magic at the end of the Second War as I see him sitting in Buckbeak's room, muttering, slapping nargles from his head by HBP. He is /complex/ and /smart/ and I'm so appreciative of your post that highlights that. Anyway, take a gold and thank you for joining me as a missionary for our lord and savior Sirius Black 😂

(You're right, an eleven year old Sirius may have laughed at anything that came out of James's mouth. He does have a dorky humor at times. I guess I've always just pictured him as a bit self serious about things that tie him to his family, like the astronomical names. I could easily see him go full Walburga if someone were to laugh at it: "but that's my name? It's a constellation? What are you, stupid?" and never giving the joke a second thought)

***** I wonder what sort of person Sirius could've been if he got to live normally, with his friends still alive and well, living up to his greatest potential, both character and ability-wise. I can also see him sort of like a magical equavilent of Indiana Jones, just working independently away from Gringotts. I mean, imagine him tumbling through some ancient temple looking for a lost artifact or something?

I've actually noticed something else about Sirius's name! The star is also sometimes called Lokabrenna by Nordic people, which means 'Loki's torch'. Loki is the God of mischief and Sirius was a marauder who was always up for some adventure. I don't think it's a coincidence.

Thank you so much! =)

It's funny you mention that. I'm attempting to write a fic now set in the period between POA and GOF, when he's off hiding somewhere warm. In my story, he's in a jungle and that's exactly one of his thoughts: that when he was a kid, he wanted to do this; to be an explorer of sorts, hunting treasure or cool animals in the wild, and it was another thing in his life he never saw realized. So I, too, see him that way.

(Story is slow going though because I'm trying to do justice to his dark post Azkaban mood and I can only write so many words before I'm depressed myself. I'll probably never finish hah)

******* I haven't read many of those, if at all actually. So I'm actually really interested in your fanfiction, especially because you've got a good grasp of Sirius. I always thought Sirius had loved to travel, but not as tourism, rather like some sort of an opportunity to cook up more mischief and have a little bit of an adventure.

Good luck on your fanfiction! I hope I can read it when you're done with it. How long are you planning to stretch it out? Up until he arrives in Britain? When the Order reunites? I actually also love fanfictions where the Order reunites and everyone learns about his innocence. I often wonder about the reactions and how Dumbledore came about to tell them. They've had this version of the truth in their mind for almost two decades! And suddenly they're provided with a very long and borderline ridiculous story.

** Fanon Sirius fascinates me. He runs the absolute gamut from sparkly dumbass happy-go-lucky Sirius to cruel, sadistic, cold Sirius. And those are just in the fics that are TRYING to be canon-compliant, not AUs where Sirius had a happy childhood or something happened to make his terrible life even worse.

The happy-go-lucky idiot was covered in great depth here, but I think the cruel humorless bastard is just as inaccurate.

That's not to say he can't be cruel. The werewolf prank, and his lack of remorse even after he'd had years to consider what it would have done not only to Snape but to Lupin? Cruel. His treatment of his family's slave? Cruel. (If mitigated slightly by the fact that said slave is a symbol of everything that made his abusive childhood a misery and constantly pushes his buttons down.)

But I often see it written in fic that "Blacks don't apologize or forgive." I don't mind seeing Narcissa or Bellatrix describe herself that way, but in the very first set of scenes in which Sirius speaks, the words "forgive me, Remus" cross his lips unprompted. And a second later when Remus asks for forgiveness in return, Sirius not only says "of course" but "grins." (The grin may be related to the fact that he thinks he's a heartbeat away from murdering Pettigrew, but still, there's literally never any indication that he doesn't actually forgive Remus for the next two books, no matter how many fics insist that a truly in-character Sirius would kick Remus to the curb instead of moving Remus into his house.)

He continues to show remarkable patience and emotional maturity in GOF. The scene where Harry finds himself "talking more than he had talked in days” to Sirius about everything that's happened for two hundred pages of story while Sirius “let Harry talk himself into silence without interruption" just isn't indicative of someone who makes a snap, self-centered judgment every single time. (Those scenes in GOF are also another testament to Sirius' intelligence, since he comes very close to unraveling the entire plot with very little information.)

He's also self-aware enough to call his 15-year-old-self an idiot, while simultaneously loyal/generous enough to try to protect the reputations of not just James ("he was a good person... he grew out of it") but Remus ("not Moony so much... you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes").

His sense of humor has some broadness to it beyond namecalling. (However: "Snivellus" is actually a clever heat-of-the-moment creation for an eleven-year-old.) Re-writing Christmas carols to be about hippogriffs is funny. So his nicknaming his 30-something self "Snuffles." And I'm not sure I come down with those who are absolutely certain he never made the Sirius/serious pun since it's canon that he spent his adolescence infuriating his parents and the house-elf by constantly claiming that the House of Black is "getting blacker every day, it's filthy."

Sirius may be a character that no one fic writer can recreate to the satisfaction of a significant percentage of the fandom. We see him be patient; we see him be impatient. We see him be cruel; we see him be kind. We see him be cold; we see him be warm. We see him be callous; we see him be generous. We see him be careful; we see him be reckless. We see him seeking isolation when he's pulled under by depression; we see him vibrant and outgoing. We see him be humble; we see him be arrogant. (Tangent: I love that moment in the OotP flashback when he says he's going to get "at least" an Outstanding on his OWL. Yup, he's so damn bright they're going to invent a new category of scores for him.)

I sometimes have a hard time resolving the person we see in GOF (cautious, rational, lecturing about how a man should treat his inferiors) with the one we see in OotP (reckless, frequently said by other characters to be too lonely to be reasonable, antagonizing Kreacher). No wonder fanon's all over the damn place.

*** While I think it's objectively wrong to make Remus the "genius" of the group, I think there was so much brilliance to go around that who was the most intelligent and magically gifted becomes almost irrelevant.

Peter, who everyone involved agrees was the weak link in the quartet, still managed to complete the animagus transformation at 15/16. Yes, he had help. He still did it. He then proceeded to outmaneuver James, Lily, Remus, and Sirius simultaneously when he betrayed the Order, and then outmaneuvered Sirius again to get him sent to prison. Then, after a decade-plus as a rat, he managed the magic needed for Voldemort's resurrection. /And that's the group moron./

Remus, meanwhile, somehow managed to keep up with his classes despite missing a few days to a week every single month for seven years thanks to his super-secret illness. And he did well enough to end up performing all sorts of magic-- from Apparition to Patronus Charms to duels with Death Eaters-- that we're told many wizards can't manage. I don't know that we can take his own commentary that he's "not an expert" or "not much of a potions brewer" or "James and Sirius were sooooo much brighter" as gospel because of his own mindset. (He tells Harry that he's not an expert regarding dementors and Patronus charms, that turns out to be essentially untrue. Okay, so Remus' father was the world's leading expert in all of that. Remus still appears to be an expert compared to, oh, everyone else we meet throughout the books.)

James and Sirius' intelligence has been covered at length in this thread. But even accepting them as the brightest in their year, they obviously chose to round out their gang with other very bright boys... even if they were more problematically and less obviously bright.

It kind of feels... unlikely (or more like incredibly author driven) that pretty much everyone from that generation was a lowkey super intelligent and gifted wizard.

All the marauders, Lily and Snape are made out to be very exceptional wizards, and it always came across to me like an author who has to make all of their favorite characters super special.

I do understand why it frustrates people who are very into canon compliancy, but for me it's always been immersion breaking when all of them are treated like they're geniuses.

That being said I enjoy reversals of expectation. So for example if Peter and James were the two overtly smart/gifted ones, I'd find that quite interesting.

A lot of people make her skim her lesson and suddenly become a magical savant, entirely forgetting that Hermione too worked extremely hard. So I believe she was a hard worker but less so than Hermione, she had a social life as Rowling confirmed that she too was popular. She was also mischievous. Basically, I see her like a Harry who worked hard and /actually got support from people he loved./ Lily thankfully had loving parents so i don't see her that obsessed with reading and studying and being on top. She was more chill. James wouldn't love someone too uptight.

I find that a lot of the times where people dumb down Sirius and James are also when they want a 'Lily = Hermione' moment, and no, thats not how you do it. You don't make someone dumb so another one comes off as impressive.

Do you have any specific headcanon about which characters are genuinely standout in terms of their talent and capabilities?

As a secondary question:

I'm working on an AU and whilst I feel I understand the differences between the fanon and canon versions of most of the main cast, I'm very shakey on the Marauders + Lily. You got time for a sparknotes breakdown of your interpretation of their canon selves?

I'm obviously going to take certain liberties when I write my AU versions (because of changes like Voldemort never happening and none of them dying), but I think it's important to know the canon version before you veer off.

  Do you have any specific headcanon about which characters are genuinely standout in terms of their talent and capabilities?
#+end_quote

I have a headcanon that their year didn't exactly have dim people or downright failures. But I do believe Sirius and James were at the top, with Snape. Lily among the top girls, not necessarily the first and Remus and Peter behind those. I mean there's other people we don't know as well, these aren't the only characters after all.

I already covered Sirius in the post. But Lily is NOT a stick in the mud, or Hermione no. 1, far from it actually. We see her breaking her mother's rules in the very first memory of her, sneaking around he sister's room with Snape. Slughorn later calls her vivacious, which also means bubbly and extroverted and a fun loving person. He also calls her charming, so she isn't a socially awkward person, nor does she have her head in a book 24/7. She's also cheeky, which again hints at her mischief. However she wasn't rude since Slughorn fondly remembers her as such. She's also funny, and really passionate about standing up to her friends and people of her kind as evidenced by SWM. Slughorn later calls her brave, and a very likable person. Rowling also calls her really popular and well-liked. She befriends the outcast and defends him until he crosses his boundaries, so she doesn't let people walk all over her.

You can tone down her passion about muggleborns in the fic, since Voldemort never existed! She can be more in the background or takes it upon herself to manage bullying around the school.

Lily is really more defined by her amazing personality rather than her abilities, so I'm always surprised when people go out of their way to assign her traits that she was never hinted to even have! If anything, Lily isn't like Hermione as nearly everybody likes to claim but more like Ginny! Of course, she isn't a carbon copy, but the similarities between their personalities are far more than Lily and Hermione. Bottom line is that Lily and James were extremely similar people, not drastically different. Or the perfect example of opposites attract. There's actually a post that addresses this perfectly, I'll try and find it for you!

Dumbledore also says that Harry's deepest nature is like his mother's. So he's not outright like her, but he's more like her than he is to James. So I believe she does have a saving people thing. Another thing that interests me is the fact that the hat barely touched her hair and she was immediately placed in Gryffindor. I truly believe she was the perfect example of a Gryffindor so you can look at their traits, and add them to Lily in a very blatant way. Also, Gryffindor flaws would be interesting on Lily. She could be extremely reckless or hot headed. She already shows recklessness in the first memory, when she jumps off the swing. She was also a normal girl, she was actually very emotional and open about her feelings. We see her crying twice, get all passionate once and we also see her provoking her sister and if I'm correct, she was from those bunch of giggling girls. She also had a group of friends, so she wasn't a loner. So she was 'just like the other girls' which is a concept that I hate, but I guess you get what I mean?

As for James, he isn't a suave jock who charms his way around everyone! In the first memory we have of him, he is doodling his crush's initials, keeps ruffling his hair around her, keeps looking at the girls at the lake and then actually makes his voice deeper when Lily talks to him. He then not so obviously sulks at the fact that she has stated she actually hates his guts. This guy is a dork. A dork who's potentially the top of his class and a fantastic Quidditch player. You can make him the goofier of the James-Sirius duo, and also the more light hearted. I like how he's portrayed in Promises Unbroken but he was really stressed with wartime, so I don't picture him like that exactly all the time. His character arc is mainly someone who gains some maturity, whether it be the war or his parents or Sirius running away, something forces him to mature and I find it really unfair that people think it's only because of Lily. His entire life does not revolve around her. I also think as a popular guy he didn't just walk up to Lily and ask her out. Every. Single. Time. He did make a fool of himself whenever she was around, but not directly to her. Like remember what he did to Snape? He could try to gain her attention through multiple different ways. James also befriends the outcasts, like Lily! Lily befriended Snape and James befriended Sirius, Remus and Peter. Again, they're extremely alike.

As for Peter, he's not a dumb brick who's always eating cheese in the background. He was a talented wizard, just not outstanding and overshadowed by his friends. He's extremely likable in the Unbroken Universe and was. A guy who turned to Voldemort because he was winning and hoped he could offer protection to his friends. I like this motive, which makes Pettigrew appear more human. He was cool enough for the other three Marauders to hang out with him, so I do think he had a sense of humour and mischief. He seemed to be the one who could blend into the background, so he could be a wonderful liar who gets his friends out of tight spots. We don't have much about Peter but he could be anything.

As for Remus, he has a very dry sense of humour, he's also witty and is actually also up for some trouble. In his first lesson, he turns boggart Snape into Augusta Longbottom and hurts Peeves. He seems to be quiet and his strength comes from that. He isn't brave or strong in an obvious way but he's just as strong as Sirius and James. He also has a lot of self loathing that makes him think he isn't worthy. Something that I find interesting about him is that he uses all the opportunities he has, he's resourceful. Dumbeldore admits him to the school so he works as hard as he could for his education, we see him studying so he's obviously grateful for the people in his life and those small chances he has, so he uses them to the best of his abilities. He's also a prefect and the conscience of the group, so he could be the sensible one but NOT a stick in the mud. Remus's kindness is also very strong and apparent. There was a wonderful write up on Remus in one of the rank downs actually and I have it saved. Wait I'll link it for you. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4fb9ri/remus_lupin/][This one]] reminds me why I LOVE Remus and that's it there when I want to cry.

  Peter, who everyone involved agrees was the weak link in the quartet, still managed to complete the animagus transformation at 15/16. Yes, he had help. He still did it. He then proceeded to outmaneuver James, Lily, Remus, and Sirius simultaneously when he betrayed the Order, and then outmaneuvered Sirius again to get him sent to prison. Then, after a decade-plus as a rat, he managed the magic needed for Voldemort's resurrection. And that's the group moron.
#+end_quote

I never saw Peter as untalented like lots of people would like to believe, McGonagall called him slow, but that might've just been transfiguration, for all we know he could've been a genius at charms or arithmancy, maybe even ancient runes. He's not moderately talented, but above average, however, I believe he and Remus were overshadowed by Sirius and James. He managed to kill twelve juggles with a curse and he was still the weak one in the group, as well as managing to bring back Voldemort, even if it was under his instructions. This just makes the other three much more impressive.

So when I see a fanfiction where Peter cannot even cast a first year spell I immediately click out.

The number of actual "pranks" F&G do can be counted on one hand. The spider bear one with Ron, I think that was when they were 5 and Ron was 3 - you could excuse that as not being intended as a prank. Children can be just as cruel as anyone else.

The Montague one, though, that's assault. The guy gets trapped in the vanishing cabinet for days or weeks. F&G were over 17 at the time.

The first reason is Alan Rickman (although I do love Gary Oldman, but he wasn't the perfect Sirius by any means), and the other reason is that casual movie-watchers love a good tragic 'romance' and that was exactly what Snape had, so they'd sympathise with him.

*** Thank you! =)

I really love this idea of Sirius rebelling but in outrageous ways, or sometimes just subtle ones. No in-between. There's the everyday subtle disrespect to his mother by yawning whenever she talks and then the other ones like the muggle posters.

I LOVE Blvnk, her art is all gorgeous and she deserves all this popularity. I always wonder about that too. Imagine that drastic of a change, not just physically but emotionally and psychologically where he'd sometimes just sit and reflect about his life and how he's changed. I've never actually seen a fanfiction dealing with all the psychological drama of Sirius adapting after Azkaban. He never even had a chance to do so.

Tonks did describe him as still handsome so, that's a plus I guess. But he would be significantly less so. Sirius would have just gone from 22 to 34 really quickly and just adapting to all that change would be draining. But I do agree he was very fixated on Harry to take care of himself, which makes me even more upset.

I just wanted a happy ending for him, he just died though. And it wasn't even a dramatic send off!

I did that point you mentioned in an edit, actually! It just makes it all the more impressive. I never really understood the Sirius = Ron parallels. If anything, he's more alike to Harry than Ron.

#+begin_quote
  I wonder a lot about how Snape's and Sirius's relationship in potions classes
#+end_quote

I wonder about those too! Sirius could've been extremely good as well, but as good as Snape? I mean, he was correcting textbooks. I like to think Sirius was somehow this good, but in Charms or Transfiguration.

As for fics, there's the Unbroken Universe, it starts with linkffn(Promises Unbroken by Robin), I really love it, although it isn't perfect. Someone already recommended the Black Sheep Dog series, but other than that, I don't have any. There was this one too, linkffn(the ones left behind) but I read it a really long time ago, I don't know if it's as good as I thought it was. Im always looking for good ones so if you too know any of them, please tell me, thanks! Edit: linkffn(Renascentia) is also a really good one

#+end_quote

You know, now I'm actually thankful those don't exist, the last thing I want is a Sirius letting his heart out and weeping in Molly's arms at an Order meeting because he was sad ;(

#+begin_quote
  Oh yeah, but I meant - he doesn't really care if other people view him as attractive (he couldn't care less if anything), it's more about how he views himself. 22y-old Sirius probably put a bit too much of his self-value in the way he expressed himself aesthetically, so losing that would be... very strange.
#+end_quote

I get what you mean now, I also believe he used his looks to charm people, but in less malicious ways than Tom Riddle. I think his flamboyancy was expressed through his looks, but not 70spunk!Sirius. I don't see him dressing like that, but it probably factored in his being 'carelessly' handsome.

#+begin_quote
  Again, overall he doesn't really care about it that much. It's a minor issue. But I do figure he kind of, mentally cringes a little bit whenever he sees his boney-skeleton-like face reflected somewhere in Grimmauld.
#+end_quote

And to be honest, who wouldn't? It's a drastic change, however apathetic to such issues you are. I can also see him sort of not truly taking in how much time he spent in Azkaban until he sees his reflection for the first time and then it truly sinking in how much time has gone by, so his looks also would sort of remind him of what he's lost; not just his looks, but his best friend as well.

#+begin_quote
  It would be interesting if Slughorn started favouring Sirius a lot during the first years compared to Severus (despite Snape being much better), since Sirius is 'obviously from a prestigious family and evidently talented'. He doles out a ton of personal feedback to Sirius, but Sirius doesn't really care that much about potions compared to eg. Charms/Transfiguration. He's interested, sure, but not enough to really utilize Slughorn's help as much as he could.
#+end_quote

What's interesting about Slughorn is that he looks into charisma as much as talent. Dumbledore says to Harry after meeting him that: ' he used to handpick favourites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent'. I think people often forget this and just see 'talent' and go on from there. Apparently charisma was also an important factor for Slughorn and while Snape might have been more talented than Sirius, Sirius was way more charming than Snape, for sure. So Sirius has brains, talent and charisma. Snape has brains and talent, even if his talent outweighed Sirius's at potions. I think he wanted Sirius, but he refused. There's also the unspoken factor like you said, coming from prestigious families or having famous relatives.

Snape was more talented than Sirius in potions and there's a strong possibility that he was more talented than Lily as well, but Lily had charisma. I mean, half of Slughorn's praise for her is about her personality too, not just her talent for the subject. Who would've thought washing their hair and displaying a bit more of his house;s traits would have made him a bit more worthy in Slughorn's eyes? Certainly not Snape.

#+begin_quote
  I could imagine that kind of favoured treatment really provoking Snape, especially since Slughorn is his head of house, and should if anything at least treat him fairly.
#+end_quote

And that just supports Remus's statement that Sirius and James were the 'best in everything' although they might have not been at Potions.

#+begin_quote
  Of course, Sirius just happens to have read a book in the Black library about this, and he just shuts Snape down. It could be an interesting minor thing to have added to the build-up of the whole marauders/snape feud.
#+end_quote

I like this, but is the Black library actually canon?

#+begin_quote
  (But it might be a bit OOC for Slughorn, since he's supposed to be good at spotting talent?)
#+end_quote

Like i said, he also spots multiple other factors. Lily might have had natural talent for it, as well as Siirus, but Snape might have had the brains and wanted to upstage them, so he just wound up being prodigious at the subject and better than the both of them by researching the subjects and wanting to impress Lily and upstage Sirius, so he started altering potions by hard work.

But my entire headcanon actually doesn't have any of them actually talented at the subject. Fleamont Potter was supposed to be old and we know Slughorn was too. So Fleamont and Slughorn might have been in the same year, and potion rivals. They both became extremely successful potioneers and Fleamont taught at Hogwarts for a short while before Slughorn did, and among those he taught was Eileen Prince, who had natural talent and he helped her with it more until she became as good as him, if not better. Or he might not have taught at all and she was just someone working with him.

Then Eileen had Snape and Snape and Lily would go to his house and look through her old potion notebooks and see all these alterations and shortcuts and ingenious ideas, so they adopt them and go to Hogwarts with these tips and instructions and use them in class. They just sort of have a look through Eileen's book for each year and bring those along with them, making copies of the book. On the other hand, James has Fleamont's help and later Sirius does as well. So the two duos just wind up being rivals at school, but Slughorn doesn't acknowledge James's 'talent' because he wasn't exactly friendly with Fleamont Potter.

So the real potion geniuses were actually Fleamont and Eileen, not Snape, Lily, Sirius or James. It's just a fun little headcanon though and I don't know if it makes sense or not.

******* I always wondered about why they live there as well. Apparently they're a very old family I think, so I believe that their house has been there before the neighborhood was built, and they just decided to remain there.

I love your headcanon, do you have a name for that family? Also, on an unrelated note, I find it extremely hard to find 'magical' surnames and even names. I don't know why I struggle with it so much, and how Rowling manages to do it. I doubt there's a Wizarding family called 'Spencer' for example. It just seems... off. Do you know what I mean?

What if Grimmauld Place was sort of a 'store' for their magical artifacts before they moved in? I mean in the books when they were cleaning the place the house was flooding with odd trinkets and artifacts. I wonder what a cursed robe was doing there. I just think of them as a generally mentally unstable family. For Sirius, he gets it from Walburga. I think he and his mother were far more similar than he'd like to admit. Regulus is more like Orion.

You know, I never got the interest about Arcturus. I don't even know who he is and where he came from. I'm pretty sure he was never mentioned in the books. Either that, or I really need a reread. I also like your second headcanon. But I like to think sometimes that the Blacks lived there across many generations and eventually killed off every family that moved in these houses, so it gets a vibe of a haunted place. Every time the families die. So I think by the time Sirius and his family were there, there weren't actually many neighbours. But after Walburga died and Sirius was imprisoned, the stigma died off.

I see the Blacks as sort of a family that's extremely feared for mental instability/intelligence but also ridiculed because of their belief that they are royalty. Also, racist in a way that even most purebloods would think is mildiy ridiculous, even for pure blood supremacists.

I like the Leaky Cauldron being the backdoor! I actually really love Diagon Alley, it's one of my favourite parts of the books. It always gives me the warm, fuzzy feels when I reread them so I find it sad when it isn't really explored or skipped over. Do you have any other headcanons about it? I see it being sort of a quirky alley (duh) with a Victorian era theme. But I think it's way more colourful.

I feel you, I actually wrote this post before school started again. I was sort of not taking school seriously before and now I'm just so stressed out and I really regret it, I don't do anything I love or browse this community anymore. I just sleep, eat and study. Repeat cycle. When I do visit the subreddit, the good stuff and discussion has already passed. So I'm sorry for the late reply, I was just stressed out with school. I also have four huge books lined up in my shelves... still unread. I also don't write or watch anything anymore.

I actually found the Slughorn dialogue really creative and brilliant, which is why I asked if you wrote fanfiction. It was sort of colourful? Does that word make sense? English isn't my native tongue so I don't know if it's right. But I guess I need to apologise for the Fleamont/Slughorn/Lily/Eileen/Snape waffling that was going on there

Edit: people like to think Sirius spoke fluent French. I know name origins don't mean anything anymore but Walburga's is German, so I just entertain myself with the idea of Sirius speaking German instead or romancing people with French.

  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  He defeated every Death Eater he was battling up until Bellatrix, who he was battling until he got too cocky. I won't say he would've defeated her because we've got no solid proof he'd have done so, but he could've held his own, definitely, until Dumbledore arrived at the very least. They were equals up until then and Bellatrix managed to go through Kinglsey in a shorter amount of time than Sirius, who prior to this was duelling three Death Eaters at once.
#+end_quote

Considering that this exact thing happens again with Bellatrix in Sirius's role and Molly goddamn Weasley in Bellatrix's, I'd say that it's pretty likely. Not taking your opponent seriously gets you killed in wizard duels even if they're far below you in skill and power.

** This isn't a rant, it's the gospel truth. Hyper, overly joke-y Sirius absolutely grinds my nerves, because he clearly has a dry, cuttingly sarcastic, and occasionally dark brand of humor.

Truth be told though, the things you describe about canon Sirius is precisely what makes it difficult to for people to accurately write about him. He's a character full of contradictions, and we see both the best and worst in him in the short time that we know him. He's a genius but hindered by his circumstances and mental health. He cares so genuinely and fiercely for the people he loves but is prone to uglier fits of temper. He's mischievous and witty, but is sobered by the burden of 12 years in Azkaban on top of 2 different wars. He's renounced his family and their ideals, but can't avoid the fact that he was raised/indoctrinated in that environment for a significant portion of his life. It's a lot of complexity to tackle, but I think it's a shame that more writers don't try to, because it's so interesting to think about and unpack.

Regarding him being actually similar to his family, I really have to thank The Black Sheep Dog series for putting the idea in my head that Sirius didn't actually make that clean of a break with his family, and that his family probably groomed him with a lot of effort prior to Hogwarts. It makes sense too with Sirius's response to James's comment about Slytherin in the train---like it really comes off as this understated "excuse /you/" tone haha. I'm sure Sirius was naturally a rebellious kid, but I bet his family probably chalked it up as a personality quirk until he actually started picking up pro-muggle views at Hogwarts.

** I 100% agree. If anything, Sirius started out as a bit of a Draco Malfoy with, perhaps, more charm (for an 11 year old boy, anyway). As you've stated, he was haughty and proud and, as the first male Black of his generation, would have been groomed as the future patriarch. The only thing I would add is the scene where James, Sirius, and Snape meet for the first time, because I think it says a lot about Sirius as a child:

#+begin_quote
  "Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, Wouldn't you? James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.

  "My whole family have been in Slytherin," he said.

  "Blimey," said James, "and I thought you seemed all right!"

  Sirius grinned.

  "Maybe I'll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you've got the choice?"
#+end_quote

[As an aside, this scene is supposed to mirror the scene where Harry and Draco meet for the first time and Draco says he'd rather leave than be a Hufflepuff. I think we can deduce a lot about how male heirs of pureblood houses are raised between the similarities in Draco, James, and Sirius's behavior as children.]

Sirius didn't go on rants about how much he hated his parents and Slytherin. He even seems almost offended by James' statement against Slytherins. But, using his charm, he quickly diffuses the situation. Sirius on the fence - he is aware of his family's legacy and doesn't mind it (yet), but he also possesses that familiar rebellious streak and the desire to be his own man. /Maybe I'll break the tradition/, he says with a grin. It's lighthearted. James and Snape are so serious about their houses, and Sirius does not care.

I find that Sirius more interesting than the fanon Sirius who somehow developed a strong, distinct, polar opposite moral compass as a child in spite of the company he would have been around most. I think it also adds an interesting layer to Sirius's hatred towards his mother. It's not just that he disagrees with his parents, but that he feels betrayed by them. They kicked him out - the heir they doted on - showing that their love was conditional. In retaliation, he lashes out by being the most pro-Gryffindor, anti-Slytherin person he could be, to Snape's detriment.

I do have a soft spot for fanon Sirius. I loved reading one shots that had a cheerier, alternative version of Christmas break than the one we got in OotP or AUs where Harry grows up in a happy home, but it's frustrating when you want a nuanced, more canon-compliant version of Sirius and he's no where to be found.

** It seems I was rather lucky because I didn't encounter these extremes. Well, Sirius as a womanizer is definitely fan's favourite thing. I've seen the author trying to explain this by saying how his family didn't love him so he kept jumping from one girlfriend to the next in search of affection. I actually heard from a psychologist that a man's relationship with his partner depends on the kind of relationship he had with his own mother. There's also that terrible abuse thing, where his mother beats him so much that he has visible injuries and has to move carefully. I think fans blew this one out of proportion. For some reason I'm always annoyed when authors choose to portray Sirius as having a special bond with Remus. I don't know why, but I can't stand it.Maybe it's because I believe Sirius prefered James over Remus, and with that whole prank business, any kind of special bond is destroyed. So that's my rant, a bit late, but better late than never.
