I've been away from Fanfiction for a little bit, and am looking for some resent, fanfiction that has Hermione in any other house then Gryffindor.

Thank YOu!


** Here are all the ones off the top of my head plus my brief thoughts

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). Pros: long, some very amusing portions/lines. Cons: Pushes a cultlike, crazy philosophy that pushes Bayesianism haaaaard. Much better story if you view it as crack and not a serious tale. Hermione in Ravenclaw.

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) Been awhile since I read all the way through it. I'm finding the most recent chapters to be not anywhere near as good as the earlier stuff. Hermione in Slytherin.

linkffn(The Green Girl by Colubrina) I don't know why I'm telling you about this one, because it is terrible. Hermione in Slytherin.

linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI) Amusing, but not great. The Lupin focused sections are better than all other sections. Hermione in Ravenclaw.

linkffn(Great Things by redfoxrabbit) Still a fairly early fic, though it is the only Ollivander raises Harry fic that I know of. First year feels kind of canon-rehashy, but I feel like that is going to change after this. Hermione in Ravenclaw.

I don't think I've ever read a Hermione in Hufflepuff story.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

  When Harry was left on the Dursley's doorstep, Petunia quickly realised he couldn't stay. Where else to leave him but with the very person who'd first lured her sister into the magical world all those years ago? With a very different upbringing on Diagon Alley, it's not exactly the same Harry that arrives at Hogwarts ten years later.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

**** Myriad issues.

The near automatic acceptance of Hermione by the Slytherin purebloods because of Slytherins protecting their own.

Rampant bashing of all things Gryffindor (Harry, Ron, Dumbledore, etc.)

When becoming a Death Eater, being so oh-so-special that her Dark Mark is not a magical tattoo/brand but a fucking necklace.

Horrible characterizations, yet somehow clings to canon despite the massive changes the characterization changes should/do cause.

Lack of any significant challenge/conflict for the protagonist.

*** I was about to say Hermione would make a terrible Hufflepuff but, well, she /is/ hardworking and loyal. Hmfp. Not very patient or a believer in fair play though. I also don't think she's very kind, at least not in the selfless sense. (Not that she's selfish, mind you, but she isn't likely to help a stranger if there's a chance it could be detrimental to herself, loved ones, or education- not without a failsafe, anyhow.)

**** Hufflepuff could teach her those things? I think that the Sorting Hat may have some divination capabilities to decide where to sort people. Maybe it's based on what they are, what they value, and what they could be. Like Neville. Wasn't particularly brave, yet he valued bravery and the Hat knew he had it in him to be the Nagini-Slayer.

Or something.

***** Fair enough. I would be interested in reading a Hufflepuff Hermione fic, but she would definitely end up having quite a different sort of personality as she progresses through her years at Hogwarts. I wonder how her house elf campaign would go if she developed more patience and emotional understanding early on.

******* I think house-elves were a special case. They were not truly independent sentient beings, but more like magical inventions.

In a few years, some of our drones and robots should gain enough intelligence to reach a similar situation. The question would be: do you grant robots full human rights, keep them as our property, or give them some special status?

******** If they are sapient as humans, they need to have human rights. Slavery is wrong, and how house elf slavery is treated in HP is one of the most fucked up, sick things in the whole series. That it took Hermione 10 years to convince the Wizards to stop owning sapient people shows just how rotten the society is.

Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically.
