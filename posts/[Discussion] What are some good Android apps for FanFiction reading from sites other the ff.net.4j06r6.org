I currently use the FanFiction.net app and it works great for their site. Unfortunately it only works for them so my reading material is limited. I have tried Pocket but it is just a hassle to have to constantly save new web pages for reading. Any suggestions?


** Ao3 doesn't have an app, but it does allow you to download entire fanfics in Mobi, ePub or PDF format. I find that reading a Mobi or ePub fanfic in iBooks or the Kindle program is quite nice, honestly. Especially given that with Kindle you can highlight bits you like, just as you can with a regular eBook.

** I really liked moon reader as an all around eBook reader. I especially loved that I could set it to scroll automatically, so if I was in the gym I could be hands free. (May have been a pro feature, idk.) It also had *great* night mode themes that I think were customizable.

Save whatever you need as a PDF or in eBook format and open in the app.

** I use Kindle. I just download the FF via a site that does FF or Book downloads (or a FF site itself if it offers downloading), and then dump them strait on my Kindle (provided they are already in the right format - if not its easy to convert).

The only downside to this is there are some sites that it seems impossible to download from so you would have to physically copy/paste. But I dont think any Android apps would help with those sites anyway because they are also limited in the sites they can pull from.

** I always found Chrome quite useful for that.
