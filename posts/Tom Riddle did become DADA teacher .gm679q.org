So basically any fic where Tom Riddle is the DADA professor when Harry gets to school and has been since he tried to get that position way back in the day. Or when the marauders get to school its fine if they the focus and not Harry gen.

It doesn't have to be a good! Tom Riddle AU but if he is being evil he likely isn't known as Voldemort maybe Voldemort is a alter ego or something. And he didnt loose his body trying to kill the boy who lived so there likely is no boy who lived. Its fine if its like a time travel or parallel universe story.

No major character/OC ships No major character/self insert No character of harrys gen / Anyone of the Marauders gen or older No next gen characters/ people of Harry's gen or older

being critical is fine but preferably no bashing

preferably No Draco/Hermione

No sex swap aka any canon character being a different sex than what they are in canon like for example fem!Harry or male!Hermione ( trans characters are fine i dont consider sex swap trope to overlap with that)

Apart from this any other ship is fine slash, fem slash, whatever.

Though no ships are also fine and I actually prefer friendship focused and/or plot focused.

It doesn't have to be complete but I prefer long fic

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  Death is omnipotent. As such, it should be of no surprise that they're able to retain the memories of various universes, or multiple timelines and lives lived. Because of this, everything is different, and yet very much the same. Death will only allow one mortal to Lord over them. It just so happens that this universe's Harry Potter needs a more...hands on approach. ----aka that AU where Death becomes a parental figure for a young mute Harry.
