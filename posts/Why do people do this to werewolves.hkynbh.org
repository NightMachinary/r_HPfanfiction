In most fanfics involving Harry becoming a werewolf they always have him eventually "master" the curse by having him "accept" his inner wolf and doing some Naruto/Kurama mastery bullshit where he gets all the benefits and non of the drawbacks of the werewolves curse. All the while Remus gets bashed on for not accepting his inner wolf or some shit like that.

It irritates me Lycanthropy is a CURSE for a reason. This isn't Skyrim where you get benefits for your curse. This is Harry Potter where the transformation hurts the person transforming and the wolfs bane potion is something recent that lessens the pain and makes you lucid enough to not fucking maul the nearest person to you. It isn't some cure all that makes you some bad ass wolf man, it is something used to treat the symptoms to a sickness that will never go away that people inflicted with it suffer from every day.

This is up there with death eater apologism and "Snape is actually a good guy who was just bullied by those nasty Marauders so of course he sided with Hitler" as something I can't stand in fanfiction


** I could see the werewolf curse having SOME benefits. Sort of like how sickle cell anemia sucks, but it comes with a boost to malaria resistance.

That said, if benefits exist, they should still be well and truly outweighed by the suck. They should be the sort of blessed-with-suck perks where you would never, ever choose to become sick just for the sake of gaining bonuses that could be achieved some other way anyway.

Eg - imagine werewolves have a high tolerance for booze. Remus could theoretically drink anyone else under the table, never had a hangover in his life etc etc. Bonus...but a completely useless one, and one that in no way compensates for how much lycanthropy has wrecked his life otherwise. It might even piss him off, since if he WANTED to get blackout drunk (trying to knock himself out before moonrise so it didn't hurt him as much?) he couldn't do it.

Blessed with suck? Maybe, if it's well handled.

Skyrim werewolves where it's more like a superpower? No thanks.

***** It'd be interesting if werewolves could eat just about anything. Assume that food that would make a normal human sick - undercooked meat, say, or slightly too old milk - does nothing to them. Whatever it is, however astonishingly dodgy it is or awful it might be to ingest, their digestive tract will figure something out and use it to fuel them SOMEHOW.

...but of course, the only way you'd ever test that and know it for sure is if you ate the garbage food regularly enough to see a pattern. Which in itself suggests there's a problem. The adaptation only exists because the curse needs the carrier to stay alive long enough to pass it on.

****** Honestly that'd be a good explanation for why werewolves are so hyper aggressive the curse is like the Hunger Gospel from Marvel Zombies, it wants to be past on to others so it forces the werewolves to target humans as aggressively as possible. It'd also be a good explanation as to why animagus and other magical creatures are generally ignored by a werewolf if they aren't actively threatening said wolf.

******* I'm sort of imagining what would happen if you gave a human wolfsbane potion...

If a human drank wolfsbane, I imagine they'd vomit almost immediately. In copious quantities and unable to help themselves, barely even able to move, just helplessly rejecting how foul it is and how awful it makes a human feel. In real life aconite poisoning includes vomiting and inability to move, so dial that up REALLY high. A full week of dosage would probably kill them.

If a werewolf drinks it...it's still atrocious, but their body figures it out. They don't puke it back up. Instead they just feel sluggish and stupid, and maybe get a bit klutzy/unable to move as easily as usual...which might be part of why it works on the transformed wolf.

** I blame too much influence from other settings where getting control over the transformation is canon. I find it to be a more interesting way of approaching werewolves and so I enjoy it leaking into HP fanfiction. Canon HP honestly has one of the more boring takes on the werewolf and doesn't spend much time exploring it in depth. If you want to go more in depth, there is always going to be some degree of benefits needed just to add some nuance even if it is overall undesirable.

Now, just straight up bashing Remus for doing it wrong isn't good writing. The good ones get into the nuance for how Remus dealing with it and even if Harry gets some sort of OP control over the wolf they show actual reasons why Remus doesn't. There was one crossover I read where it was canon in the other setting that someone with enough raw magical power who got infected would gain more control over the transformation to the point where at the upper end they didn't transform at all. The fic then had the same thing happen to Harry and mostly explored how he fit into the werewolf culture of the other fandom. The scene where Harry finds out he won't transform actually has him disappointed because he wanted to join in the pack and not transforming made him feel a bit left out. When the fic eventually gets to Remus getting involved, the fact that Remus still has to transform is treated more as a "Yeah, that's how it is for most people" while Harry is just a special case along with a small handful of others worldwide (only one being shown).

*** HP canon isn't bad, werewolves are basically living biological weapons who willingly side with Voldemort and unleash themselves upon his enemies (aka the general populace).

It's the "social issues" fanon which sucks. Werewolves are the manifestation of primal fear, their mythological origin had them feast on corpses and murder entire villages. Turning them into a pity party which needs the MC to fight for their rights turns an awesome antagonist into a meek, boring group.

**** I would have preferred them as a separate minority like the Centaurs or the Goblins, only that their rights and identities are a bit more muddied because they were once wizards. So any measures to take their wands was met with difficulty because anyone can become infected, and noone in the government wanted to lose their wands. However, they could still discriminate, either targeted (if you are a werewolf, you may be denied housing) or passive (Leave is only permitted in blocks, only four of which may exist in a year). This discrimination eventually drove the werewolves to found first their own communities, which were subsequently raided and destroyed for bogus reasons (like homeless encampments in the US are raided to raise property value), which then resulted in them moving to hidden communities deep in the forests, far from any civilisation. Nobody knows where they live except them, and any incursion into the forests turns up nothing as the invaders get turned around and are misdirected. This has also caused the rumors of werewolves to spread into the muggle world, as these forests are their hunting grounds on full moons.

You could worldbuild a little like this, make it more interesting. But most people aren't that creative.

***** I don't like that kind of narrative because it makes the werewolves nothing but victims. And that matches neither canon (basically biological weapons who voluntarily joined Voldemort) nor the mythological background (rabies, the personification of primal fear, basically the Eastern European version of a vampire with all the grave robbing and blood-drinking).

Any attempt to make them likeable fails due to their canon behaviour, because no matter what was done to them, it does not justify unleashing themselves on the general public. All Dumbledore asked from them was neutrality, but they chose violence. IMO any attempt to depict them positively is akin to a Naziwank.

****** It's not like every werewolf in the world chose to join Voldemort's side. The ones that joined were only the local packs, and the fact that they were living in packs in the first place likely means they weren't exactly holding onto their humanity. I imagine them as the dregs of society, half-feral people who have been completely chased away from normal life and have no steady jobs, no homes, and no prospect of a brighter future. Wizarding society doesn't view them as human; most of them probably stopped viewing themselves as human too. Then, someone shows up and promises them a brighter future and a way to pay back the society that cast them out. All they have to do is help kill some of the same people who hate them and made their lives miserable in the first place.

It's not exactly evil. It's desperation and anger and years and years of being told that they are the scum of the earth. It doesn't excuse them from joining Voldemort, but it sure explains their actions.

I know JK Rowlings writings outside of the seven books aren't really considered canon, but I like the backstory she gave Fenrir.

To avoid Azkaban after being brought in for questioning in the deaths of some muggle children, he once pretended to be a confused muggle tramp that was amazed at the wizards and magic in the room. The Werewolf Registry was so poorly maintained that they had to let him go because they couldn't prove that he /was/ a Werewolf and not a muggle that happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Lyall Lupin was one of the committee members that wasn't convinced by his act and tried to persuade the rest to keep him in custody until the next full moon, but they ultimately let Fenrir go after Lupin called all Werewolves "deserving of death" and they thought he was too prejudiced to be able to be impartial. Fenrir had an accomplice on the inside that helped him avoid being memory charmed and then later, to taunt Lupin for his victory, Fenrir bit his son Remus the following full moon.

A lot of fanfics I read make Fenrir into Voldemort's single minded attack dog but I really like the idea of him as more clever than that. It makes him scarier as a villain if he might outsmart you as a man, and tear you to pieces as a beast.

** Well, people have different likes - and some people just like the idea of having badass werewolves, I assume. If that's their jam, good for them!

However, I've read some fics that handle it pretty well - because it treats the wolf aspect as a bit more 'natural'. Not that it's all positives - but coming to accept it as a part of themselves can be a nice positive evolution of the character. Eg, linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) has a section that has Lupin traveling to America to meet with a commune of peaceful werewolves - which I think fits pretty well into the universe, at least in my opinion.

Lets you get the 10,000 hours with feedback from other fans. Explore your writing style, figure out what you d like to do with your own work. Borrow someone else's sandbox and make it into something that makes you happy, cause that's worthwhile in itself.

Look, dante's inferno is basically self insert bible fanfiction. Going "but what if I just fixed that little thing I don't like and did this instead" is not new.

.....says the writer with 2 novels in progress and an addiction to writing Dragon Age fanfictions she never finishes. I'm 20 pages into a self indulgent au version of a fanfic au. My brain decide to scream about "what if that thing from my one fic was true in this story and their MC found out after chapter whatever." Prolly not gonna post that one, but if I write it, it'll be out of my head. I'm writing it just cause I wanna read it anyways.

** Because having your character be like you describe isn't cool.

Something like that can only serve to create angst. The werewolf curse in canon is basically an angst machine.

And yeah, it can make a very interesting angst/drama/horror fic. But what if you want to write an adventure fic? A gen power fantasy fic? Canon lycanthropy would only hinder the MC and to be honest, it's quite boring in that context. It has 0 positives and just makes your life shit.

On the other hand, if you change it, allow people to "master" it and give it more substance other than "dude painfully transforms and goes into rages" it's suddenly a lot more interesting.

And why do they go into crazy murderous rages anyway if there is no underlying substance? It doesn't really make sense. Kurama made Naruto go into crazy rages because that way the seal weakened and he would eventually free himself. What reason do HP werewolves have?

"Because it's dark magic, duh" Well, yeah. Maybe. Probably the intended canon answer. But it's not really all that interesting, is it? On the other hand, if you change it, give it more substance and something relatable (ex, a semi-intelligent semi-sentient wolf thing) it's no longer just "dark magic". It's more interesting.

The problem is that there simply aren't that many good writers that write about this. As such, you get a lot of low-quality fics that try to do this but can't manage to do it nicely due to lack of experience. And that kinda stigmatises the whole premise.

‚Äã

TL:DR Canon Lycanthropy is good only for angst focused stories (where the MC has to deal with it). People change it in order to make it more interesting for other types of stories (ex, Adventure, Family (with packs) etc.)

I can understand where Rowling was coming from, but this is fanfiction and I don't want that in my stories. I dislike canon lycanthropy in Harry Potter because it took a badass looking power and turned it into an incurable illness with no benefits.

**** Oh, I agree. But at that point, why make him a werewolf? It seems to me that it's to add drama and angst into the story, otherwise what does "being a werewolf" add? Canon lycanthropy, as OP noted, is a curse. An illness.

If a character is a badass werewolf, but them being a werewolf has nothing to do with them being a badass, what other point does the character's lycanthropy have other than to drag them down? To create social and psychological problems that the character has to overcome?

Even if the character grows strong, in spite of it's lycanthropy, that doesn't change the fact that their lycanthropy only existed to create angst. Giving a character lycanthropy is, as you said, similar to giving them a disability.

But unlike a disability (the fic Blindness being an exception), lycanthropy has so much more potential in it. By it's abstract concept, it can lead to so many other things rather than just another fic where a character overcomes a disability. And that's why, I think, people change the way werewolves work.

In my opinion, nothing ruins a character as quickly as being a flat personality. Even the most successful people alive have struggles. Simply going from success to success dulls the story.

Above all, though - because disabled people are people too and don't exist solely to cause angst. Para-Olympians, for example, are far fitter and more talented than the average person. They're not around to be pitied and don't want people to pity them.

** I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) actually has a really good angle on werewolves.

Werewolves are persecuted because they all inevitably fall to their inner wolf at some point and become crazed killers like Fenrir Greyback. There is a very good reason why absolutely no one would want to be a werewolf. While transformed they're unbelievably fast, strong, regenerative, and spell resistant. They also radiate an aura of fear that's so intense it can give you PTSD just being in one's presence.

Wolfsbane is a highly restricted and experimental potion that would be hideously dangerous to give to werewolves at large because they'd use it to be more efficient at biting people.

Remus Lupin is unique in being able to resist his inner wolf, to the point of being an object of study; it takes him a ton of effort to do it and there ends up being a good reason why he can.

Other bullet points get in to spoiler territory, but overall I thought it's take on werewolves was brilliant.

** To be honest, I don't really care where people have fics where Remus "accepts" his wolf and stuff, but I do agree that if he becomes like super badass with all of these plusses then it's stupid. As you said, lycanthropy /is/ a curse.

The only thing I wouldn't mind is if Remus meditates and accepts that he's a werewolf so he's much calmer (and obviously struggles), the transformation doesn't hurt /as/ much but he's still a little sickly and ill before and afterward, his wolf form looks more like a wolf rather than a weird practically furless maned wolf, and he's not as aggressive on the full moon.

  Lycanthropy is a CURSE for a reason.
#+end_quote

Yeah, and getting blinded or struck by lightning or bitten by a irradiated venomous spider are terrible things for a reason, but plenty people love seeing that kind of thing used to grant superpowers.

Perhaps they simply prefer the portrayal of werewolves where it's a superpower with maybe some downsides, like Underworld or whatever. Maybe they like seeing Harry portrayed as someone special. The Dumbledore/Voldemort/Merlin/whoever of his generation who accomplishes incredible, unbelievable things - y'know, an incredibly common preference in the fandom.

So he gets this terrible curse and all logic dictates that he's going to suffer for it his entire life. But he's not just anybody, he's /Harry Potter/; prodigy, epic hero, chosen one, and the equal opposite of the greatest dark lord to ever live. Through magical skill or sheer willpower or blind luck or whatever else, he turns a incurable crippling curse into a powerful magical advantage.

This is fanfiction. One of the main points is to change things for entertainment.

I've seen this in maybe a couple of fics before, and they were each somewhere between really bad and fucking awful. Not because of the werewolf thing in and of itself, but because of how poorly it was executed. Just like most premises, the problem isn't the premise itself. It's all in the execution. Honestly, I'd like to see the idea done well, but I doubt I ever will.

I don't think anyone writing a fic where Remus "accepts his inner wolf" are arguing that this was a possibility in canon and that Remus is dumb for not doing it, they just think that a piece of nature magic is more interesting to write than monthly murder aids allegory.

**** Maybe, but there was also the fact that he was a halfblood. If there was less of a rivalry between Slytherin and Gryffindor, perhaps Snape would have been less than willing to fall in a crowd that looked down on him for having a muggle father.

****** Just imagine how different things would have been had Sirius and Severus realized how much they had in common with their home life. The only real differences were the fact that one's abuser had magic, and the other didn't; and that Sirius was able to escape but Severus was trapped.

******* I think one key difference though is after the event with Remus. Sirius at least Is implied to try and change while Severus digs in his heels and doubles down on his path. But that's also because Sirius had James to tell him how fuckin stupid he was while Severus had no one, Lily didn't know what had happened and was a house away so he didn't get the smack in the back of the head he needed

******** Imagine for a second there is no recourse for a student almost killing you. Prank or not, accident or not, Sirius almost caused Severus to die or be mangled by a werewolf, one that which Dumbledore knew about. How would you feel if there was no punishment for that?

It's very easy to say "Severus shouldn't have been that way" without going through the mental exercise of pretending like you're in his shoes. It's easy for people to pretend like they would have been different in the same situation, when chances are they would have been the same/ close to the same.

Snape wasn't a great guy, he wasn't a good guy. He was a flawed character who ultimately tried to do the right thing, in warning Dumbledore about Voldemort. Even when trying to do the right thing, Dumbledore manipulates him. Imagine if Snape was actually evil and said something along the lines of "Nah fuck off let them die" to Dumbledore when he asks, "What will you give me in return Severus?"

** I read one good one where Harry was like every other werewolf out there but he got pregnant (yeah it was Mpreg) and he was such a powerful wizard he was able to hang onto the baby for a few months until they eventually deemed it safe enough to have a c-section on him. It was amazing and it wasn't the whole ‚ÄúRemus didn't accept his curse‚Äù theme.

** I don't mind it, but only because the curse seems stupid. It's obviously man made, and does have great benefits outside the actual changing into a Werewolf. Not to mention whats his name that bit Remus seemed to have some degree of control over the curse. So there is a precedent there. I feel that it maybe didn't start out as a curse, but some powerful Wizard/Witch of the past cursed someone/family to change it into a curse. I don't read Werewolf Harry stories often, but one I do like is where he got bit young, but the mixture of Voldemort's Horcrux, and Lily's protection, kind of changed it into a gift. He could become a Wolf at will, and got an overall physical upgrade. The curse fought against the Horcrux, and Lily was trying to protect Harry. Thus Voldemort's Horcrux was destroyed, and the curse weak enough that the protection altered it's use.
