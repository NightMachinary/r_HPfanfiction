As the title says , HP/Last Airbender crossovers. Other than no smut fics, I don't mind what's recommended.


** I tried writing one years ago where Harry was the Avatar after Korra, that was going to follow the Last Airbender structure of three books, each dedicated to a different element, which would cover years 5, 6, and 7. In it Hagrid was his Earthbending teacher, Ron his Firebending teacher, Dumbledore (who was actually Tenzin in disguise) was his Airbending teacher, and Tonks was going to be his Waterbending tracher.

The story I had developed was that the world of Avatar was separate from the world of Harry Potter, but Korra discovered a way to travel between them using the Spirit World. Her travelling to the Harry Potter World caused bending to form as a part of Magic, there are no Muggle benders, but not ever wizard is a bender either. Korra was killed by Voldemort who saw her as a threat, and he tried to kill Harry because the prophecy foretold he was the new Avatar.

Around the time Harry was meant to start at Hogwarts, Hagrid chose to take him and start training him in Earthbending. Hagrid would also take the newly hatched Eagle-horse Buckbeak who would become Harry's animal companion. They would return to Hogwarts at the start of 5th year.

Harry would quickly befriend Ron, a naturally talented firebender, and would reveal to him that he is the Avatar and recruit him to teach him firebending. Some backstory for Ron is that after accidentally burning one of the twins when he was young, Ron dedicated himself to mastering firebending so that he would never accidentally hurt someone again. The first book would cover Ron teaching Harry while they deal with school and Malfoy, the focus would be on them at the start, but would slowly shift into the more serious stuff, culminating with Voldemort attacking Hogwarts to get to Harry. Dumbledore would reveal himself as Tenzin and they would escape while the school falls to Voldemort.

In book 2 Tenzin would train Harry in Airbending while Ron and Hagrid rescue their friends and family from Death Eater camps. Harry would finally connect with Korra in this book who would reveal the Horcruxes to him as well as the presence of the one in Harry.

Book 3 would involve Harry tracking down a Waterbending master, eventually finding Tonks. Working with the Order they would slowly take back control of Magical Brittain, working their way to Hogwarts. There Harry would face off against Voldemort, and use a combination of energy bending and Unalaqs spirit control to force Voldemorts soul to piece itself back together.

I outlined this and tried writing it between Book 1 and 2 of Korra, so there are some changes I might make. Some of these would include not making Tenzin and Dumbledore the same character, although Tenzin might have trained Dumbledore, and including Raava.

Here is a list of who can bend what.

Earth:

- Harry (he is the Avatar of course, but following the cycle earth is his natural element)

- Hagrid

- Neville (as per the prophecy, he might have been the Avatar)

Fire:

- Ron

- Arthur

- Bill

- Charlie

- Fred

Air:

- Dumbledore

- Trelawney

- Flitwick

Water:

- Tonks

- Ginny

- Molly

- Percy

- George

- Sirus

- Bellatrix (bloodbender)

Non benders:

- Hermione

- Remus

- Malfoy (major jealousy issues here)

- Voldemort

** There was one that had some interesting world building. Basically starting by transplanting Hogwarts characters and setting into the world of Avatar. Taking place quite some time after the events of LoK. London is like Imperial City, Bender-Nonbender tensions are high. Some mysterious group has been following the avatar cycle and killed them as children. Harry is the avatar but doesn't let himself know it. Pretending he's just a firebender instead. The changes to Hogwarts structure using the elements for the houses and interhouse bending tournaments read really well.

Unfortunately abandoned before anything major really happened. Just a bunch of really engaging set up. Really felt like things were just on the cusp of kicking into gear.

If you are okay going into it knowing that it ends abruptly without any closure it does give you 15 chapters of a merged HP/Avatar world.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.

** The only one I could ever think of is deleted now it was a GOF story where during the first task the Horntail escapes and attacks and Breaths fire onto Harry, he passes out and wakes up in Southern Water Tribe Territory, found by Katara and Sokka he becomes a founding member of the Gaang and a Firebender who is learning his own powers alongside Katara and Aang. Harry could Summon black flames when angered. In the last chapter we saw the Other 3 Champions were also in the Avatar world and were benders as well, Krum was either a water or earth Bender, same for Cedric and Fleur was a Air Bender. All three like Harry seemed to have powerful Bending abilities while also having features of another Bender type (Harry was originally thought to be a Earth Bender, Krum likewise was mistaken as a Firebender)

** Ninja Wizard linkao3(10824855)

Book 3 is Harry traveling to another dimension for a vacation. He lands in Avatar-world and joins the Gaang early in their adventures.

In Book 4, Harry realizes that magic is leaving Earth and tries to convince everyone to move to Avatar-world.

Book 5 is about the magical colonists settling in as the fifth nation of Avatar-world.

The series does have good guy Tom Riddle, which some people find irritating, but it's completely justified by the existence of this exchange:

#+begin_quote
  Harry: “Now, are there any questions?”

  Death Eater: “Yeah. Who died and put you in charge?”

  Tom: “That would be me. Do you have a problem with that?”

  Death Eater: “Uh...n-no. No, milord. Not at all. Glad to have him, really.”

** You don't mind what's recommended? Well I hope you don't mind this because it's the only one I've read that I like. It's ongoing with sporadic updates. I've been reading it since it came out. The writing at the beginning is decent if a bit clumsy. However, as the years pass, the author has developed better writing skills. Each chapter is written better than the last. That alone makes it worth it in my opinion.
