Basically a Moriarty!Harry. This and " The Art of Self Fashioning" are both in my top 5 faves.

  How different would Harry Potter's first year of school have been if the Dursleys had successfully suppressed Harry's natural curiosity? This NARRATIVE shows what could have been.

  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.

** Linkffn(9057950) Not completely sure this is what you're looking for since I haven't read the story you mentioned. However, this Harry is very much a loner and only gets a few followers and acquaintances through the entire story.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

***** It's been years since I read it - and the start was kind of awful, so I did the thing where I read a random chapter in the middle of the story and go forwards and backwards from there - but here goes.

You begin with your standard ignored!Harry in favor of his boywholived!brother. There's also a sister in play that's also ignored. Then something happens to that sister and Harry vows to heal her, no matter the cost.

Random things I remember from this story:

- Harry is a complete sociopath. He cares about almost nothing or nobody apart from healing his sister.

- He really is though, he uses dangerous magic on his classmates without a care in the world, kills people, tortures and maims.

- There is an actual reason Harry and his sister were ignored, though it's not explained till the end of the story.

- Although the first few chapters are of poor quality, the writing impores /a lot/ later in the story, to the point I went back and re-read every chapter carefully.

- There is quite a bit of lore regarding magic and many novelty magics are showcased.

- The story alternates between a normal carefree tone of a neutral!evil Harry going through school and being so grimdark it veers to the absurd, or even humorous sometimes.

- I liked the ending a lot. It was sort of poetic.

- Overall this story left me with mixed feelings. I was glad I finished it -- I don't think I've read a story like this before or since -- but there were plenty of moments where I went "WTF AM I READING".
