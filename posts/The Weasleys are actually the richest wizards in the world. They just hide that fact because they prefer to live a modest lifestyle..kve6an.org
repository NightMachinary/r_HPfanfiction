When a Weasley child turns of age, the Weasley elders tell them about the money, but tell them to be careful with it. How else did the Weasleys always manage to pay for everything?

*** On the other hand, if they've grown up poor and learned the need to budget and plan their finances to make the most out of what little they had...aren't those the best kind of people to handle larger amounts of money?

**** Not really. Growing up without money doesn't mean they know how to budget, exactly, it just means that their parents do. There are plenty of people who, once they get money in their hands, splurge because they finally had it. I grew up poor, and after a month or so after getting my first paycheck (just extra money, we didn't need it at that point) and debating whether or not on spending it because I've never had money before and been able to keep it, I splurged on random stuff (mainly yarn and knitting/crochet stuff). I've only just managed to convince myself not to spend all of my money.

***** True, that's another way of looking at it. Some people are poor because they don't know how to plan their finances. And others are poor because if they didn't plan their finances, they would be downright broke.

It all depends on the type of poor they are.

**** You can't transfigure most of expenses, food, clothing, maybe something more and it would be propably very annoying to transfigure dishes and home interior regularly. And magic world economy(and wages of course) should also consider that worker's minimal needs are lower because of magic

Doesn't Molly charm objects to take care of the home? The dishes were constantly washing themselves, the clothes were ironing themselves, etc.

Well, it only takes 7 galleons to purchase a wand, and we see random schoolchildren have more than that. Why couldn't the Weasleys afford it?

****** The increase food one is a little curious. According to Gamp's law you can't conjure food so how are you able to increase it? Eg you have 1 lb of food sitting on a table. You wave your wand and now you've increased it to 2 lbs of food. The question is how? You didn't conjure it, you didn't transfigure it (if I remember canon correctly transfiguring non food into food gives you no nutrition. Of course, if I'm wrong then we have our answer ie you just transfigure non-food to food. However that puts a twist/kink to the horcrux hunt tent scenes). So where did this additional 1 lb of food come from?

******* I think this is more Rowling is rotten at math and applying that to her worldbuilding.

She's a superb plot-smith, but the technicals of her world leave much to be desired.

******** I would agree that this is one of those technical details that got away from her such that at different parts of the story we have completely opposite effects that we were told can't happen. Plus again, these were children's stories now being looked at with adult eyes.

For instance, on the Horcrux Hunt I always wondered if they didn't want to call on the elves why they didn't simply Accio some food. For instance, the streams and rivers that run through the Forest of Dean are known for barbel, trout, and salmon (at the right time of year). So Accio trout or salmon or even rabbit would have at least gotten them some meat.

She still gave us a great world to play in and all of these little issues give fanfic authors lots of things to use and see where the story goes when they change something.

*** I'd like to know what the Weasley's costs/expenses are. Really, they have a decent bit of property, with magic and a bit of planning it isn't like they couldn't grow/craft anything they need.

Heck, if I ended up in their world I'd get a couple expanded sheds or whatever and produce anything I needed. If I could get my hands on a house elf that wanted to work with me I'd be set for life.

** Hmm...alright, here's my idea; instead of human tradition, the Weasleys follow house-elf tradition. Wealth isn't all that special when you can have virtually anything you want with magic, so instead of accumulated coin and land being prestigious, the Weasleys consider kindness to others to be prestigious.\\
 \\
Starting with Arthur and Molly in Hogwarts; Molly is worried about her future and goes to the Hogwarts house-elves for help learning life skills, while Arthur is entranced by foreign cultures muggle & magical and ends up going to the same house-elves to learn about them.\\
The two cross paths in the Hogwarts kitchens, find kindred spirits in each other, and during their ongoing learning (Molly and her self-sufficiency skills, Arthur and his cultural studies), they slowly end up discovering that they just find the house-elf way...easier.\\
 \\
...Bleh, I've got writer's block. Something something, raising the kids to value self-sufficiency and making stuff and kindness to others, learning to save money for good causes, big inherited fortune that they let people believe was squandered by their grandparents and more money from working and discreet investments besides.\\
Secretly bankrolling the Order of the Phoenix, anyone?
