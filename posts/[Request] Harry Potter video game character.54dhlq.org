Denizens of the reddit, I summon thee from your deathlike torpor with blood and power.

Hello.

Heres the Set-up: I recently burned through all the Harry Potter as a video game character fanfictions I could find that were of decent length. Harry Potter The RPG, Adventures of HP The video game, Gaming Wizard Extraordinair(Which should have an e at the end), Gamer Wizard, and a few others that slip my mind. I culled them from an old reddit thread about these sorts of fics. However it was 7 months old, and also led to one two years old. I also checked the HP Video Game plot community over at ff.net, but it hadn't been updated since December 2015. So.

Heres the request: Are there any new ones that don't suck(Of course that caveat is a YMMV.) out there? Most importantly I'd prefer they not be crossovers any more than necessary. Absolutely no Naruto. Finished products are best, but I can't exactly afford to be picky. I know one of you was working on one currently, but I cant find you or the fic. So if you're around...you know. Throw up the rec.

Thanks in advance.


** The Video Game, Exploited is the best. Also, Harry Potter and the Natural 20.

** I know you said no Naruto, but the best videogame fic I've ever read(and I read a buttload of them) is pure Naruto, and an SI.
