There are a wide variety of ways that the goblin race is portrayed. Hating any and all humans, hating any and all humans bar the main character, doing anything for a bit of gold, etc. are some of them. How do you, as fanfiction authors think the goblin race should be written? How do you, as readers, like it the most?


** Goblins and Wizards are supposed to constantly be at odds. They've been fighting on and off for hundreds of years, and I don't think that the Goblins should start acting all nice to Harry just because he remembered one Goblin's name.

** Doing anything for gold, and hating everyone at the same time. Goblins are conniving, evil little bastards that seek only to profit wherever and however they can, using technicalities and loopholes in arrangements to screw everyone out of money just because they can.

I want goblins to be portrayed like this more often, rather than the blood-testing, god-tier-investing, heirloom-retrieving, basilisk-harvesting simpletons who immediately follow the protagonist's every whim because they were polite once. I'm sick of goblins being given pivotal roles in driving the early sections of many plots forward through acting as the wizarding world's only solicitors, notaries, registry office, estate managers and whatever-the-fucks rather than just creatures that hold money and make weapons/jewellery.

By all means, they don't have to be pushovers - I like it when goblins get a bit violent, but I want them to be more than just cardboard cut-outs for the protagonist to use for help.

Otherwise, I don't want them in the story at all.

*** While I agree that they shouldn't be a one-way trip to OPness just because someone is polite to them (I mocked the idea in /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/), I take issue with the idea of lumping them all together as "evil little bastards". The idea veers dangerously close to racism in my view, and I feel like what you describe in the first paragraph is how people like Malfoy perceive them, rather than a fair description of who they are.

Do they act this way in front of wizards? /Yes/. The banktellers of Gringotts find wizards annoying and, because of the hundreds of years of war between British Goblins and Wizardkind, they aren't inclined to show a kinder side. But I don't think it's at all a good idea to portray them as inherently villainous --- it's all a cultural thing, and I'm sure they don't act that way towards one another.

If they were, would he not be as well? That's not to say they can't be confrontational and greedy, just that it's not an inherent part of their genetics.

While "given legitimate cause" has arguments both for or against, I believe not /explaining/ their dislike of wizards, while simultaneously not holding that they are genetically evil, would just be poor worldbuilding. Every villain who wasn't born a psychopathic sadist has a /reason/ for what they do. That reason may not be based in /sound logic/, but it's a reason.

The Death Eaters don't go after muggleborns just 'cuz --- they go after muggleborns based on their erroneous belief that muggle-borns pollute their bloodlines, and also more subconsciously to reassure themselves and give themselves back the power they feel to be their birthright, in a society that listens to them less and less. This is a perfect example of /explaining/ an antagonistic group's dislike without giving it at all legimitate cause.

In Goblins' case, going per canon, their antagonism against wizards seems mostly rooted in how wizards denied them the ownership of wands, combined with their general status as second-rate citizens (at least in Britain). For all we know, maybe wizards were only forced to resort to such measures because Goblins were a menace /first/, but clearly, to the /modern/ goblin's mind, those are the perfectly legitimate reasons why they should screw humans over at every possible opportunity.

******* You've made an eloquent argument, and yet I have no interest whatsoever in finding out what grievances the goblins have against wizards. I am happy to assume that they hate wizards /just because/, or for reasons that don't need explaining.

If the story were /about/ that conflict between wizards and goblins, or they played a pivotal role in the plot, then by all means, such things should be explained and in such a case I actually agree with you, as it makes for better storytelling to have motivations and reasoning behind characters' actions.

However, if these are just goblins featuring in a story that has little or nothing to do with them apart from background mentions, then I don't feel that anything is gained by world building here.

**** The problem is that every example of a goblin that's presented in canon, including the background ones like the debtors who are after Ludo Bagman in /Goblet of Fire/, are /all/ conniving, evil, money-minded monsters.

People like to espouse goblin values but in canon, they have only two - make money, and viciously protect said money.

Unless the portrayal of goblins is important to a story, I prefer them to remain thoroughly as a footnote. If it /is/ important, I stand by what I said, in that I most definitely prefer a close-to-canon portrayal of the goblins, in that they really don't like or care for wizards save for making them money or obtaining valuable artefacts, and have the potential to be vicious little buggers if they need to be.

In truth, I'm really just sick of the nice!Goblins trope, and am only happy with goblins being portrayed as neutral or worse from there.

****** Well, I don't know about you but I'm not really interested in seeing a goblin-centric fic, original that idea might be. So from a wizard's perspective, and in how the goblins deal with wizards, they're conniving little bastards.

Although that principle is cool, the goblins use that rule to take stuff 'back' from wizards. The ownership rules are never seen used for any other purpose than taking things that they /believe/ belong to them, regardless of the cost. In the case of Griphook, he takes the Sword of Gryffindor and ends up dead not a few hours later, but because of his greed he would never have let Harry keep the sword for a couple of days to destroy the Horcruxes with (not that it mattered in the end anyhow), and maybe ended up alive and one sword richer (because canon Harry would definitely have upheld his end of the deal).

The whole way Griphook behaves - ruthlessly pursuing profit regardless of the risks, refusing to acknowledge mercy or services rendered (Harry and Dobby save his /life/, after all, and instead the pointy-toothed twat wants the sword as a trade before he even /considers/ helping Harry /save the world/) is indicative to me of how goblins will generally behave.

******* A completely goblin-centric fic /can/ be great (I'll point you to linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone)), but even if the story is not, I think it would be very easy for a little surface-digging to come up in a fic. The same Hermione who started SPEW would, I think, only need a little push to start campaigning for equal goblin rights or something of the kind.

On the ownership principle and Griphook's behavior --- it's always possible it's mostly an excuse to get expensive stuff from wizards, but isn't it more fascinating if it's really one of their core values? As in, it's /not/ about how much the object is /worth/ --- what if the "the original owner is the only one who has a claim" principle is as essential to goblin morals as "don't rape women in the street because they're attractive"? Any moment he kept the Sword in Harry's hands, Griphook would have been failing to uphold a core axiom of morals he'd been laboring under his /entire life/. No wonder he'd slip. Indeed, Griphook's actions make no business sense at all; a skilled banker /would/ have correctly assumed Harry would give the Sword fairly in the end, and bided his time; and that's precisely why it makes more sense that goblins, who are known for their cunning, would genuinely believe the Sword should return to its rightful owners immediately, as opposed to it just being an excuse.

Also, even if you disregard all fo the above... note that Griphook is a /banker/. It stands to reason he'd be greedier than average. Few would argue that some /human/ bankers are the same sort of greedy.

******** You present an interesting hypothesis, for sure, but that's what it is - a hypothesis.

We don't know why goblins are like what they are in canon, only that they /are/ that way. Griphook might've been having a moral crisis, we don't know. What we do know is that he was happy to sabotage the best chance for the entire world, his species included, at freedom and prosperity for the chance to get his grubby little hands on a sword he would most certainly have gotten if he'd waited. Without creating fanon explanations all we have is a greedy, small-minded, pathetic little bastard who is prepared to let everything go to shit for a piece of shiny metal.

Your explanation might be more interesting or well thought out, but in terms of how I like my goblins represented in stories, I say, /like canon/. As in, like Griphook, Bagman's Debtors, all of them.

** linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone)'s worldbuilding of inner, non-wizard-related Goblin culture is so good it has become my go-to headcanon. As for their dealings with wizards, I think the banktellers of Gringotts, for the most part, are annoyed at wizards' inefficiency. There is no one on Earth more obnoxious to the typical goblin's mind than Minister Fudge --- fussy, bumbling and never getting anything done. The Gringotts employee, above all, strive to be practical, no-nonsense and efficient in their work.

This annoyance at how slow wizards are, together with the patronizing, racist attitude a lot of the purebloodists show to them, is an explosive combo that makes most of the banktellers grouchy and cutting in their dealings with wizards. Politeness /certainly/ isn't going to get you anywhere with them, because it's only more useless babbling that wastes their valuable time.

Goblins, of course, play their part in the constant misunderstandings between them and wizards --- though their leaders might not be, a lot of goblin workers are just as racist against humans than wizards are against them.

All this being said, they keep working with wizards because #1 wizards have all the gold, and #2 it's the best they can do to avoid complete genocide at their hands anyway. In light of Option One, yes, goblins would do just about everything for some more gold, and combined with #2 this means that they are willing to dabble in illegality off-the-books if it means more gold at the stupid wizards' expense.

Goblins are /not/ warlike, rough though they may appear. Their culture is built around craftsmanship, and fiercely defending the products of their craft once they are done. Their dragons and axes and Dark Goblin guards are all born of their almost Scrooge-McDuck-like, paranoid need to defend their possessions against any attackers or thieves --- not a holdover from ancient warrior ways.

*Not every Goblin works in Gringotts*. Though a vast majority of the British population does, there are, of course, indepenant goblin workers who farm or some such.

** Paraphrasing from someone much smarter than I am:

Deep underground, the Goblin people have records that go back to when most of the other races were learning about fire...the racial memory of the Goblins extends to days beyond reckoning. At least, beyond reckoning to anyone who isn't a Goblin. Goblins keep their records chiseled into stone and preserved for all time with mystical might. While the spellbooks of the Wizards eventually crumble into dust, the Ledgers of the Goblins will stand in mute testament to their triumphs and failures for as long as day follows night and night follows day.

The Ledgers of the Goblins measure in exact terms the location of all the cool things that the Goblin people have found, they give tips for dealing with problems that Goblins have overcome in the past, and they record in excruciating detail every bad thing that anyone has ever done to the Goblin race. The fact that sometimes humans commit atrocities against Goblins means that each and every Goblin child grows up reared on vivid and gory stories of generations of conflicts with humans -- and humans really don't. From the human perspective... nothing is happening at all. Even Wizards -- who are, unlike muggles, currently aware of the Goblin people -- don't live nearly as long as Goblins do, and that means that they don't have an ongoing war with Goblins on any timescale that they can appreciate.

This discontinuity leads to Goblins being much better at the eternal war they are fighting with the humans than their opponents. That's because no-one else really has the perspective to see that it is an ongoing conflict... really, the Goblins keep winning because they are the only ones playing.

So life is pretty weird for a Goblin. As a Goblin, you know that you are in an eternal struggle with the Wizards, and humans in general, really. You also know that several times in your life, Wizards are going to behave towards the Goblin people as if nothing was wrong and have flourishing trade relations instead. But you also know that once every couple of Wizard generations (which is to say, several times in your life, if you happen to be a Goblin) some warlord or bureaucrat is going to arise and send hordes of Wizards to destroy your family. So if Goblins come off as being intolerant jerks, that's why.
