It had everything,

- Powerful Harry

- Smut

- Great Plot

But, I got bored around the point where [[/spoiler][Fleur's father dies or something.]]. I think, but I am not sure, I haven't read it in a while and just recalled it.

Because after that point the author introduced a new race of magical creatures with a lot of lore about them which made my interest go away.

So, you know anymore stories like this? ie have great plot and finish it without creating a comprehensive guide on a new race.

*** Is it the principle where most writers have NO IDEA how to write smut? Because that's why I skim most steamy scenes in HP stories.
