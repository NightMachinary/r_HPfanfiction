Hi All!

I'm outlining a new SSHG story that includes magic/tech hybrid smartwands, which cast spells but also count steps, allow you to take selfies/post to magical social media, etc. (other uses will occur to me as I write). I know I'm not the first writer to have had this idea, so I wanted to ask if you knew of any SSHG pieces that feature hybrid tech wands like this. I haven't been reading as much in the ship lately, and I don't wish to inadvertently copy anybody. Since I'm quite early in the writing process, I can easily adjust how the tech works/looks at this point.

Many thanks for your help!

BS

*** Thank you thank you thank you! The snartwands aren't at the center of my story per se, but they're enough of a distinctive plot point that I reckoned I'd rather be safe than sorry.
