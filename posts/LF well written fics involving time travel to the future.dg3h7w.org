Double bonus points for somebody from main book 1-7 era jumping to the Epilogue era. But the time traveler(s) can be from any era as long as they jump to the future.

I've read a bunch of fics where a character time travels to the past but have yet to read ones where a character goes to the future (the various Horcrux!Riddle awakens stories don't count). I'm sure they're out there, so send 'em over! :) No ship restrictions. AUs are fine too.


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6780275/1/The-Last-Casualties][The Last Casualties]] Voldemort tries to do a Samurai Jack and sends the Potters (minus Harry) 13 years into the future so he can show them the future that is +Aku+ Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9310847/1/][Future of Ruin]] The fight between Harry and Voldemort in the books isn't the first or last time they fight, they are reincarnating immortals and the fight goes back millenia. About 500 years after a nuclear apocalypse Harry comes across a time rift that spits out a ~25 year old Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10418925/1/][The Voyage Home]] Harry gets flung 300 years into the future, He ends up serving in starfleet. Features a Hermione/Harry/Hermione pairing, it's probably only enjoyable if you like StarTrek and have watched most of StarTrek Voyager.

And here is a few past threads on the subject.

I've seen few episodes of Voyager, but not even a whole series, though your comment made me though the Hermione/Harry/Hermione ship has me a bit confused. How exactly did there end up being two Hermiones? And are they in separate relationships with Harry or are they also in a relationship with each other?

edit: and thank you for linking all of the other fics from the other threads to this one, that's a pretty nifty trick! Was it the link sub command or the ffn ! bot directlinks that did that?

**** It was the linksub command that links everything from a past thread. ffnbot ! directlinks parses any hyperlinks to fics in the post (so I don't have to use the linkffn command, I find it helps make my posts look cleaner).

Harry gets trapped in the future, to help himself walk through the grief he makes a holodeck simulation of Hogwarts, the Hermione from the sim becomes self aware (as any intelligent AI is tend to do in Star Trek). I think the two Hermiones are involved with each other, but it's only really implied at the end of the fic.

  Despite his impoverished circumstances, Tom Riddle always knew he was destined for great things. The ability to travel back and forth through time was a bit of a surprise, though. Also a surprise: the bushy-haired little girl he meets in the future who possesses powers to match his own. Eventual Tomione; starts pre-Hogwarts.

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, he doesn't want to die

** I've read two but can't remember the names.

In one, after Harry is accidentally sent back in time and comes back to present, Tom Riddle and some friends follow him to the present from the past where they had befriended Harry.

In another, Tom Riddle vanishes in his 7th year and reappears during the seventh year of Harry and co. Turns everyone dark in front of Dumbledore throughout the story.

The second one you mentioned sounds vaguely familiar, but I probably didn't read enough of it to remember the name.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
