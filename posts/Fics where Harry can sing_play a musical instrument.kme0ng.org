I would like the way the author describes Harry's talent like You get what you give by watermelonsmellinfellon. So like: 1.Where Harry incorporates it into his schedule 2. Has to work hard 3.Muggleborns know who he is

  Harry is sick and tired of always being kept in the dark, of being lied to, and of being protected. He's had enough and he's going to take control of his life. Takes place at the summer before sixth year. HHR. Slight HBP spoilers. Some Dumbledore bashing.

I really love this series. It has Wolfstar and Harry Potter/Bill Weasley and Harry Potter teaches music and performs. He grows up with Sirius and Remus and it's very cute
