Especially would like fics where they're still at Hogwarts/hook up earlier in canon. Smut's fine. And again, please no bashing. Thanks!


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] It's an AU without magic, where Hogwarts is a school for James Bond-style superspies. Hermione has a crush on Ron early on.

*** Just finished reading this. Great fic, great writing. Just wish the events diverged more from canon and that there was more H/R.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Looking for the same thing, it's really hard to find. Though tbh, I might have found some but quit reading because of first person POV.

Anyways, here's two Ron/Hermione fics (not set during Hogwarts) I've read and liked enough to remember. linkffn(7562379) linkffn(9094981)

There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/KariAnn1222/pseuds/KariAnn1222/works][KariAnn1222]] who has written at least two stories where they get together earlier, it's very smutty though. linkao3(480373) linkao3(479063)

#+begin_quote
  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.

*** KariAnn's was somewhat promising, even if I was disliking the characterization of both Ron and Hermione, but I stopped reading the moment "abortion" became a dirty word. I'm sorry but this is Britain and not America and Hermione is a feminist. Anyway, rants aside, do you know anything at all similar where they get together during Hogwarts? FPPOV is fine with me.
