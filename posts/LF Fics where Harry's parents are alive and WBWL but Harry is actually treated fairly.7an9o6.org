I don't get why so many fics where there is the wrong boy who lived have Harry's parents neglect him. Out of all these fics I've seen perhaps one or two actually had him treated decently. I've forgot the name but one these two was where Harry decides to go to Durmstrangs. Any other fics?


** Probably this is the Durmstrang one you're talking about. I think I've read at least one other where they treat him like normal parents, I'll go see if I can hunt it down.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

***** Its one of the most recommended fics out there and is mostly deserving of that. However, unfortunately it is not complete and probably never will be.

  How would Harry have grown up if James and Lily had been smart and prepared for their encounter with Voldemort? Harry has a twin brother, but what if his brother's love and support is the 'power the Dark Lord knows not' Smart and supportive James and Lily; Harry/Daphne
