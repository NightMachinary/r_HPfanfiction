:END:
Do you know of any fics where all champions get severely injured or die?

(for example in the first task because no one told them about the dragons or something)


** I cant remember the fic as I never finished it but all 4 champions get transported to the graveyard and Voldemort attacks hogwarts as soon as he gets back and when harry and the other champions get back the entire weasley family had been killed.

** Not the Champions, but in book 4 of the Cupboard series Barty Jr causes chaos when he lets loose the Horntail. Dozens dead and named characters suffer permanent injuries. Hagrid has an arm bitten off, Flitwick is paralyzed.

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5101357/1/The-Potter-Family-Grimoire][Potter Family Grimoire]] a lot of things go wrong for the champions and the people around them. Over all it's a really good one shot.

** This chapter in the one shot collection has the First Task go horribly wrong, with a lot of students, dragon handlers, Hogsmeade townsfolk and the entire Durmstrang contingent die because the dragons get free.

It's a bit excessive and unbelievable coz the dragons wouldn't be that dangerous if the wizards weren't so bloody /incompetent/ in that story.

** This one is kind of interesting, but it definitely strays in powerful!Harry territory, so if that's not your thing, don't read: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3014973/1/]]
