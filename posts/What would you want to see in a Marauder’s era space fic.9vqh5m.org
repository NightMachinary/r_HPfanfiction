Continued from my plot bunny post three days ago, what would you guys want to see them doing aside from building a spaceship? Or more specifically, how do I avoid massive timeskips without making reading boring? This is my first non-oneshot project, so I'm a little stuck on how to plan out a plot.


** I want to see the relationship between Peter and the rest to understand where, exactly, he fit in. He's pretty glossed over in most fanfic, or he's the dumb sidekick, or "gazing adoringly" at James and Sirius.

*** I always pegged him as like Harry, in that he stayed out of Slytherin by asking for Gryffindor. He's the common sense and pragmatism and cunning that allows the pranks to actually come off as funny instead of mean, or land their targets. Keeping Remus from spending dinner in a book, or Sirius from snarking off at teachers too much, or James from deafening everyone with fireworks; the grounding force.

** One of the things that is sometimes overlooked is that they went to school during war time with a lot of their classmates supporting pure blood supremely. There should be tension in school which goes beyond house rivalry. Also people are going to loose family members either to the death eaters or aurors. Basically not everything is going to be carefree and even if the marauders play pranks they are, especially when they are older, not just pure goofballs. So what I'd love to see is the boys, like the twins did, use pranks and jokes to lift up the mood but realising the situation around them. In their last school years it should be getting more serious and reflect that they are already starting to fight on the front lines of war. (after all they joined the fight against voldemort right after graduating) Also the dialog between the students should reflect the time period and their upbringing. Old and rich pure blood heirs aren't going to sound like muggle teenagers in 2000.
