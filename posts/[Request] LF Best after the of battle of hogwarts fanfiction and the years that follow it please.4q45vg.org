I have just finished the books again and everytime i get to the last chapter before the epilogue, i just find myself wanting to know more and read more of what happens in the first year and years that follow and that lead up epilogue.

I am hoping to find some good fanfictions or at least 1 to read and to add to my to the list to re-read eveytime i start again.

Post any that you find good please.


** little0bird and Northumbrian are two authors who continue the story after the battle.

*** Northumbrian's stuff is the BEST! Extremely well written, almost feels like canon to me.

**** My only complaint is that he has too many unfinished (and incredibly promising) fics in the series.

***** He just started a new story too, I saw it on SIYE. I really like his stories, but they tend to be really long winded with description, which can be really nice, but it's frustrating if you're not sure if he'll ever finish it.

** If you're okay with slash, there are two great fics that fit your request and are better IMO than little0bird and northumbrian.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/852061][Kiss the Joy (Until the Sun Rise)]] is a beautiful fic where Harry and Draco both separately seek refuge in the RoR after the war and slowly heal together. Weirdly, it felt very in character even though it was slash - of course they hated eachother at first and the progression was slow and believable. At the end, it wasn't even clear that Harry is attracted to guys, he just needed someone and Draco was there. And the plot device of what/who was "real" was heartbreaking, original and beautifully done.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879835][Salt on the Western Wind]] is a fic where Harry, Ron and Hermione go into hiding directly after the battle for their protection until all the Death Eaters are rounded up. IIRC, Narcissa collects on Harry's life debt to her to get them to take Draco into hiding too. Also a great fic and everyone is written really well.

** /Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation/ starts after the final battle. It is *absolutely not* epilogue compliant, but it's fantastically written and the voice with which the story is told is absolutely inimitable. Unfortunately, it was abandoned after 50-some chapters.

** While not post-battle of Hogwarts, Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is a really good in-canon fic and the author also has some post-battle fics in the same universe.

**** I think the original fic is absolutely great, but I do not know the sequels. I know the author is caught up in a lot of drama and appearantly narcissistic and nobody you should look up to, but his work is fine.
