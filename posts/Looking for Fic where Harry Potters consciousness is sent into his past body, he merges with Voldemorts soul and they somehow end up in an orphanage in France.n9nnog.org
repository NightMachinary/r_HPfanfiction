:END:
I don't remember the details very well. But a seventeen year old harry somehow ends up in the body of his younger self. Except the Horcrux in him is conscious and he ends up merging with it for some reason or another. He becomes both Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort, but not as split personalities. As in he is Voldemort as well as Harry Potter. Personality traits, beliefs, memories, everything transfers over. There's some magical reason for their merging mentioned but I honestly cannot recall. I just know it was a necessity and Harry's reluctant do it.

At some point he ends up in an Orphanage in France (or some other foreign country, pretty sure France) under an assumed name. I'm pretty sure he burns down an orphanage with people still inside at one point in this too.

And for whatever reason I'm half convinced that the last chapter I read had a woman who was a vampire becoming some sort of mentor to him? I'll honestly be pleased with anything remotely along these lines cause I'm wondering if my mind didn't just accidentally combine a few older stories I read.


** I feel like those are separate fics but I could be wrong.

Harry and Voldemort merging sounds a lot like /Tread softly/ linkff([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1847353]])

This is one is a other AU fic: basically what if Harry acted like a Horcrux in Tom Riddles mind. Ending with a twist Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11244426]])

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).
