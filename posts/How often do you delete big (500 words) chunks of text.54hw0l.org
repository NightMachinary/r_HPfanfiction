As in, you write a big part of the chapter, yet when editing it the next day you realise that you character would never say or do something like this and rewrite it completely?


** All the time.

I keep a file just for prose that didn't make the cut. Around 60% of it ended up there because of subplots that went nowhere, 30% for changes to the main plot that necessitated deletions, and 10% because a character wasn't doing a good enough job of communicating with the reader.

*** This. If I wrote it, it meant something. I try to get it down to a distillation of meaning, then leave a note relating to context alongside the cut section in another document.

**** Yes! There's nothing worse than realizing that a passage doesn't work, but not knowing why. My 'rubbish bin' file has really helped me improve as I only have to look in one place to see all of my former bad habits.

**** I agree, it's interesting to have a record of your writing development.

** Not often. I usually rewrite parts or whole chapters completely and only delete little parts. I am too much of a hoarder to permanently delete anything so my computer gets fuller and fuller with useless files. Sometimes I wish I could delete writings on my computer like I shred them IRL. OFten it are just duplicates with only a small thing altered, such as the tense or perspective.
