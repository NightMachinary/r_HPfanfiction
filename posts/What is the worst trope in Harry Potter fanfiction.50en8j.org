** Just, stop. Wait about 6 months or a year. Try again then.

** Harry Potter is starved, raped, lashed, etc. At Dursley's.

Most of their abuse began after he entered Hogwarts due to Hagrid giving Dudley a tail, Dobby ruining Vernon's promotion, Harry blowing up Marge, the Twins assaulting Dudley, the Dementor's assaulting Dudley, etc.

According to the books, The Dursley's and Harry avoided each other as much as possible for the first eleven years.
