I checked out the other thread that had a similar name to this one and read most of the recs but, er, I did not find them to be very good. The best one is The Best Revenge which is excellently written even with the boring ship.

Ships I don't mind: Drarry, Snupin... Eh, just rec me some and I'll let you know if I'm uncomfortable with the pairing.

Thank you :)

*** That's the one.

I didn't like the Snapes and a few of the Harrys I saw. Now I know Snape is a bastard but I like seeing a Snape who can change, an adult Snape who begrudgingly bonds with Harry.

As for Harry, I like seeing him portrayed as a bit smarter or at least more pragmatic. Someone who can change a well.

Another example is Secrets by Vorabiza, that had some mentorship as well.

I just really want to see them understand that each other are suffering, sad, and that they can relate to that and despite all things can work together to take down Voldemort and maybe even be happy.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

***** I did not realize this was 96 chapters long. Hoo boy. I'm going to say, some of the Harry-Snape parts are great but the other characters seem lacking. Hermione is downright bizarre.

I'm at chapter 17, I'll keep going but I dunno if I'll finish, we'll see what the plot does. Thanks for the rec though, I really need to read more Severus stuff. Bit of a craving really.

****** She does calm down some, and gets more screen time later on, though the focus does stay on Harry and Snape.

It's a long read, and if you do decide to stick with it there's a completed sequel and another in the works.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]
