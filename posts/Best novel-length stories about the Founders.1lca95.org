Sorry if this already exists, but I haven't found anything about them!


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3233631/1/Founding-Hogwarts][Founding Hogwarts]] is one I'm familar with.

Summary: The Founders of Hogwarts were brave, witty, loyal and cunning. They were also drunk, besotted, sarcastic, proud, lustful, jealous, conceited, baffled, cursed -- and on speaking terms with an inebriated Glaswegian hat. Read the bits history missed out.

It's complete and logs in at over 100k.

** I really liked [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=368287&i=1][Legend by celticbard]] - saw it rec'd on here and gave it a try. It's fairly action/plot-oriented and very well-written. Like [[/u/orangekayla]] said, this one also sort of becomes a world of its own, but I think that's to be expected in these fics!

  There is legend. And then there is truth. In 9th century England, three wizards band together, not to found a school, but to concoct one of the greatest lies ever told.

  And thus began the history of Hogwarts.

Another one that has some references to the founders is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run by Tojours Padfoot]]. It's not ABOUT the founders, and they play a fairly minor role, but they do appear and there's some reference to their backstory (the story is about the village of the dead and events therein). It's also one of my favorite fanfics, period. Insanely good worldbuilding, really original idea, all of the canon characters I want to read about...I'd highly recommend it.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=275890][This one is truly an epic.]] This one chronicles the lives of the four founders, and their world at the time. However, I forgot I was reading a HP Fanfic when I was halfway through it. It seems to be a world of it's own. But wouldn't you expect that 1,000 years in the past?
