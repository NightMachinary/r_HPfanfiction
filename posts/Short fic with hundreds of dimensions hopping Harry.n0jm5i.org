:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have been searching for days for this one dimension hopping fic I read one time that stuck with me. It is the usual Harry has finished off Voldemort, has nothing to live for so does ritual to go to another dimension.

The difference with this one though is that he doesn't stick with one hop. The fic starts out like he's going to stay at this one place but there was something wrong with it so he hops to another. The hops are numbered and further in it's like hundreds of hops he's done. From what I remember, it wasn't a very long fic, possibly only one chapter but I can't remember if it was because it was incomplete or if that really was all the author wrote.

Does anyone know what I am talking about? or did I just dream it all up?


** Is it the one where Hermione puts a bracelet on his wrist - which is what's causing the dimensional hopping - and he can't get off? If that sounds right, I'll look for it in my calibre library when I get home.

*** No, Hermione wasn't in it. I think his original universe everyone had died. Although now that I think about it, there might have been a time limit to his jumping, like he had to decide within 24 hrs or he would be stuck there.

*** No, it's not this one because it starts out like you didn't know he was going to be multi jumping. It isn't until much later on that the jumps are numbered. The hook to me was that it was presented like it was a singular jump, and then he finds that his family/friends are all blood supremacists so he keeps on jumping. There was one dimension where the whole world was pretty much destroyed and he loots his family vaults but he keeps going. It's a bit darker in tone, not very light-hearted.

I thought it was Parallels by bobmin cause it kind of started like that, where he took everything with him in dimensional compartments but that was just a singular jump.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

  Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr
