As I title said I want harry to be shown in hogwarts teaching. I want him to be a mixture of McGonagall flitting and Dumbledore. (Stern/funloving/knowledgeable and powerful) i cant believe this hasn't been done. (This might have turned into a rant sorry) anyone know why this hasn't been done? Because I see a lot of people wanting it, yet no one actually doing it.


** There's a really depressing one shot where he becomes headmaster but that's the only one I know besides cheesy time travel fics.
