** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]] by Annerb. Ginny is sorted to Slytherin, but she's still Ginny. She's just a Ginny shaped by different events. I think the author does Ginny and Harry really well, and gives Slytherin much more depth than in canon. Also largely avoids the "stations of the canon" trope trap without abandoning the canon storyline.

Its really well written, and involves no bashing, an intelligent and likeable snape (which is hard for me to say because I despise canon! Snape) and ia an amazing fic in general.

Ao3 links are in the format of: ao3.org/works/unique_story_number/chapters/unique_chapter_id

The chapter id being the way it is allows authors to go back and insert chapters earlier in the story (or split up formerly overlong chapters into two smaller ones), while not breaking any links to existing chapters.

But linkao3 only cares about the unique story number, since it's linking to the story as a whole rather than to a specific chapter.

Questions like...what would have happened if more/fewer people would have believed Harry after GoF? How do the new allies affect Harry and the war effort? What does Harry do if he finds himself utterly alone and ostracized (more so than in OotP)?

One fic I thought of was "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6311215/1/][The Lion Tamer]]" where Harry is approached in the hospital wing by a completely random character who expresses her crush on him. linkffn(6311215)

** Ok, I know this has already been up for a while, but I just came across this one (it's pretty popular so you may have already read it) and I can't put it down.

The only divergence is that Harry was in his crib laying down instead of standing, so he gets the curse across his eyes, effectivly blinding him.

Not sure how to use the bot, but I'll try\\

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** IMO, /New Blood/ doesn't really have a single point of divergence. It brings in too many setting elements that we would have heard of had they actually been canon.

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is probably the closest thing we have to a single point of divergence Slytherin!Hermione---though Lockhart's character has been rewritten and one of the Creevy brothers has been aged up a year.

linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth) is a good single point of divergence fic for Slytherin!Harry.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** There is a strong argument that Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin meets this description, although from what I can tell it is a bit controversial in these parts. It is a WBWL fic where Harry is sorted into Slytherin, but it is by far one of the best (if not THE best) ones that I have come across. It is epic, it is funny, it is clever without being pretentious, it sticks to the general outline of the books while giving them its own twist and mostly avoiding Stations of the Canon, the canon characters are mostly not OOC without a very good reason and there is minimal bashing (even if it SEEMS like there is at first), and it avoids the common traps these fics tend to fall into or when it does have some of the cliches turn up it handles them in a well constructed way.
