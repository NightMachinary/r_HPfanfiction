Hey all. Have a question. Any tips on writing a abusive relative what to avoid? An oc of mine as a mum and dad who are equally abusive. But mum cares a little for him. Any tips?


** It depends on many factors. Not just the type of abuse you want to tell about: physical, psychological or sexual. I would avoid the parent who is abusive because "buahahaha I am evil incarnate". Sometimes a parent is abusive because they believe they're doing the right thing to educate and / or make their children stronger, better or more educated. Sometimes the worst acts are committed with love, a twisted sense of course.

** I would highly recommend reading this article ([[https://www.quora.com/q/nsfzupaphixdypzw/Child-Abuse-in-Harry-Potter]]).

It is a very detailed analysation of child abuse in the Harry Potter books, written by someone who expierienced abuse as a child himself. It also gives a few comments on fanficions and how abuse is commonly depicted in them.

** If you have to ask this question, my only advice is avoid writing such person. It will come out as an artificial and fake, because it will be.

*** Before writing a certain character, all writers have to study, read something, sometimes talk to people to be able to write it at its best.

it's precisely by not asking certain questions that you risk writing a character that turns out to be false or artificial.
