** I think there is close to no other fic that deserves the following emoji response more:

** IIRC the sequel has Harry etc. going back in time and fucking his parents generation and the incest only gets worse. So no it's very rapey and disturbing all round.

**** Yeah no I think there's a pretty clear difference though. This story is 100% meant to be erotic. That's different than just having an abused character.

******* It wasn't an analogy, but its similar, and not similar, both being forms of abuse, both being "triggering", but a different kind of abuse. I can't stand either.

** So, I tried to read it again.

Still unreadable.

I suppose you could do some convoluted analysis on how Harry's rapes are indicative of his broken psyche but at the end of the day, this story is just a rape fantasy

** Iirc, that one was first posted to stories.xnxx.com, now known as sexstories.com, so I can imagine the fanfic qualities are it's name at absolute best.

** I honestly never thought of it that way. I felt like it was more of a way to have a plethora of characters fuck without character development or whatever. If the spelled characters were spelled to look like they didn't want to do it then I understand the rape fantasy position but for the most part they acted as if they wanted it. I mean officially it's rape but I don't think it was written by someone who enjoys rape. Or maybe it was.

*** If they have no autonomy over their own choices, it's rape, even if they're fictional characters.

Of course, in fandom we give ourselves room to indulge sexual fantasies and explore kinks, so the terms non-con and dub-con help distinguish between different kinds of fictional coercion and fantasy material. Most of the time, even non-con means "unrealistic treatment of a rape scenario."

Some people object to the terms, but I think they're useful as a way of reminding readers "depiction doesn't equal endorsement." Fiction is not reality. Fantasy (not genre fantasy, obviously, but id-wallowing) is not reality. Some writers are a little unclear on the concept, but those are individual cases.

Not that you could pay me to read this fic. But then, it's not my kink. And even if I did accept a bribe to read it, I would reserve the right to rant about it and do the equivalent of throwing it at the wall with extreme prejudice.

***** Sorry, I was just spinning off from your comment because I think fandom's use of concepts like dubcon and noncon to play with rape fantasy is an interesting way of marking how a reader might approach a fic. It's all technically rape, and it can be uncomfortable for a lot of people. But at least there's some attempt on fandom's part to find ways to talk about sexual fantasy, including the disturbing kind.
