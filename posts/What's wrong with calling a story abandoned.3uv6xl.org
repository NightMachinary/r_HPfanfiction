I've run into this twice in the last couple months. A reader mentions a story is abandoned and the author flips out.

In the first scenario, a reviewer left a nice review about how much they liked the story in 2014. It's one of their favorites, great writing, keep rereading it, blah, blah, blah, and mentioned they were sorry to see it abandoned. Nothing offensive or demanding. The author hadn't updated it or their profile since 2010. In January 2015, the author updated their profile stating the story isn't abandoned, how dare they say that, and updates are definitely imminent. About a month ago when I found it, it still wasn't updated.

The other instance was pretty much the same, except the author threw a fit on their profile and ended up declaring they had been planning to update, but wouldn't since the reviewer had been so rude as to call it abandoned.

I guess I just don't understand it. In both instances the reviewers left great reviews. They weren't demanding updates (passively or actively) but just expressing the fact that they enjoyed it and wished there was more. At the time of the reviews, neither profile had been updated in 3-5 years and said nothing about hiatuses or plans to continue. What's going on? Is it offensive to call a story abandoned?


** I think the problem has to do with the suggestion that the author has failed. Calling a story abandoned is like saying 'hey you, author; you're a bad parent'. This in particular twinges an author if the story has been in constant drafting but the next chapter or chapters haven't proved themselves publishable. From the author's side it's "I'm working on and thinking about this every goddamned day! How dare you suggest that a lack of finished product equals a lack of work."

Perhaps we should start a movement to call these stories 'gone stale' instead of 'abandoned'.

*** As an author, do you think they're implying you've failed, or might you be projecting that? I hope I worded that well.

From my point of view, +the Jedi are evil+ if the story, profile, and their lists of favorite stories and authors hasn't been updated in 4 years or more, then I'd call it abandoned. I don't attach any negativity or judgement to the word, it just means that I don't expect to see it revisited. I think (hope?) most people realize that fanfiction is a hobby and there are a million things that might happen or take precedent over it.

**** It doesn't matter if you're 'not attaching negativity or judgement' to the word. It's text. There's no 'tone' given. And 'abandoned' is one of the most negative words, connotation wise, in the English language.

And as Wordhammer stated up above, it's always odd to have someone come out and say it. It does imply failure when hearing it.

For example, I haven't updated one of my stories in 2.5 years. In that time I've spent, on average 15 hours a week working on it in various forms. Abandoned to the reader and abandoned to the writer are two totally different things.

Granted, I don't care if someone calls it abandoned. They can do whatever they want. I will say, 90% of the time it feels like the reviewer is trying to guilt you into updating. As another user says further down, like a child looking for a new toy. When I was way younger I may have been mean about it. Now I roll my eyes and ignore it.

While most people may realize Fanfiction is a hobby, they have no idea what it actually entails. An amazing amount of people seem to think that a chapter takes as long to write as to read. A chapter that takes me twenty minutes to read, would probably take me 30-40 hours to plan/write/edit.

Maybe I'm slow. But I can say that, honestly, one of the most demoralizing things to me is spending 60-80 hours putting together a particularly difficult chapter, and then within five minutes of it being posted getting reviews of 'more!' I know that they didn't read the twelve-thousand word chapter I just posted in five minutes. That's my pet-peeve. I expect the authors you encountered are just touchy about the word.

***** If it's been 2.5 years with no word from the author I would assume it's abandoned. If there's a note explaining that the author is working on it but X, Y and Z happened then that's understandable.

***** You call yourself slow? Try writing a decade long fic! I still haven't finished it. But I'm finally close. Six or so more chapters to completion.

The fic may be ten years old, but over the years It has morphed a couple of times. I forgot about it for awhile, but then the urge to write continued. Sometimes an idea for a chapter hit, and my day is consumed with an itch to write. Sometimes, I find it a chore to think about it. To write a chapter can take days or months.

** ... Cognitive dissonance?

I would think since fanfiction is pretty much a 'whenever I have the time for it' activity that a story completion time of 5+ years is okay. They just probably feel protective of their stories.

Since you have a sample size of 2 authors I'm not sure this is quite a trend.

*** You've never come across it? Those two aren't the only times I've seen it.

It's strange to me how it seems to be taken as an insult. The vast majority of fanfiction is unfinished, especially those that haven't been worked on in years. It's definitely not an unreasonable assumption for them to make.

*** I've run into this as well but in a different fandom. I left a review for a story that said how I really enjoyed the story and that it was too bad it was abandoned (or something like that). The most recent chapter of that story was published in 2010 and I left my review in 2013. The author sent me a somewhat snide note saying basically how dare I think it was abandoned because it wasn't, and then gave me a few reasons for the lack of updates (new computer, moving, etc.). I just checked the story today - it's the end of 2015 and the last published entry was still 2010.

Real life:

** You don't really know what that author has been receiving. Reviews are one thing, but a lot of people pm. It could just be that that one review was the one that set him/her off. I wrote a fic (it wasn't very good, and it was short to boot) and I received a lot of nagging via pms and reviews. I can fully imagine a better/longer fic that readers can become very invested in, when "abandoned"... getting a lot of abuse. It's also a numbers thing. My shitty 18k fic has 41k views -- that's actually a lot. If 1% of them feel like expressing their discontent, that's still 410 pms/reviews, etc (ridiculous number, but just making a point. I probably got about 2 or 3 negative pms)

** They either had a bad day, it was cumulative, or they were just shitty people, take your pick.

Personally I get annoyed when I get 'too bad it's abandoned' reviews and most of the time just roll my eyes and continue on as usual.

The people who review or pm asking a question like 'hey is x fic abandoned/do you plan to update it' usually gets an honest response from me.

As for it being offensive, eh. I'd call it annoying at most. When you get those reviews/messages whining or complaining that it's been abandoned, or hasn't been update recent enough... It's like a child complaining that they want a new toy.

It's like... yeah it's all good and well to say personally decide that a fic has been abandoned and stop caring about it, or whatever. But fanfic writers don't get paid to write. It's a labor of love that quickly turns sour if they're needled about it.

** It's basically self-entitlement of the authors. Admittedly, some of it is deserved, since hey, they did write their stories; but some people simply take it too far and think that them having written something sometime back then allows them to say that nobody can have an opinion.

And the rules are simple: if there are no updates for over a year, and there's neither a note from the author about anything that could be causing the delay nor is the story finished, and there is nothing in the author's history that would make it possible that the author simply updates that rarely (I know a few authors that basically updates after a year), then it's your prerogative as a reader to say that in your opinion the story is abandoned. And in those cases, the only offensive things can be your attitude when you say it, or the author's attitude when they reply; the declaration of opinion is not because why would it be, you are simply stating what you see as the most likely possibility based on their usual update habits and your observations.

So in short, it's just this-or-that particular author being a self-entitled jerk. Happens to people.

** Abandoned implies that the author has, you know, abandoned it. If they are still working on it, however slowly, then it is not abandoned. The problem so far as I see is that people overuse the word 'abandoned', even using it for stories that have updated within the last three months.

** Some writers have the opinion that an abandoned fic could be adopted by another writer (normally with the original writers OK, but this is not guaranteed, especially if the writer has been totally absent so long). Therefore, if a fic is labelled as abandoned, some writers may feel that their IP could threatened. I can already hear people saying this isn't true, but an example off the top of my head is linkffn(the marriage stone) by Josephine Darcy, who disappeared in 2008 and there are now at least 3 fics written by other authors which offer endings (I think only one of which was ever in contact with Josephine at any point.)

** It's an emotional response. They see someone slagging them for not being productive, they recall when it seemed like they couldn't stop words from pouring down on the page and for a moment they reconnect with that feeling, so they think to themselves 'I'll totally update this, I'll show this fucker!'

But then that feeling fades as their day-to-day responsibilities creep back in, and before they know it, their story is right back where it's been the last couple of years, so far on the back-burner and so low down on the priorities list that something else /always/ takes precedence.

I don't remember who said it, but it went something like "If you want to be a writer, write. You have to take time out of your day to sit down and write something. It doesn't have to be related to anything else, you don't ever have to touch it again, but everyday, sit down for a predetermined amount of time and just write something. Anything."
