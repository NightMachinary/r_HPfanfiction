In OotP, Fred and George are testing consumable prank items on First Years. While they may be good at what they do, they aren't qualified professionals.

So, one fine day, a first year student has a bad reaction to a Puking Pastille because he had taken a potion prior to the testing (Hospital Wing, Potions class) which the twins did not account for in their product. The complications result in the student's death.

The twins are expelled and sentenced to Azkaban.

I wonder how canon would change. McGonagall and/or the Gryffindor prefects would face consequences and so would Dumbledore, especially with the Fudge administration in power. Mundungus would also be in trouble since he supplied them with illegal raw materials.

What backlash would Harry face when it comes out that he had initially funded the twins?


** Nosebleed nugat but the first year had taken an anticoagulant beforehand. Bleeds to death via rapid nasal hemoraging.
