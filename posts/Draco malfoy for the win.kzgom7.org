So I didn't really know what to flair this as. But basically the idea I had is Draco, after seeing his father grovel and beg lord voldemort becomes disillusioned with the war. He vows to never be like that. He begins to study magic more, learning from the death eaters and reflecting on what he's learned. He uses his father's money to hire someone to look into the past of lord voldemort, remembering Dumbledore called him Tom as a clue. He bids his time and waits for the right opportunity to overthrow him. Now I don't care if he fights for the good side in this, or if he wants to be the new leader and overthrow the magical world and make it his vision of the perfect society.

I don't know if I flaired this right, if there are already stories like this or if someone would be willing to write one. Or we can discuss possibilities on where this could go. Just had this thought and wanted to share it with the community


** Sounds a little like regulus. I think the image of Draco seeing lucius literally grovel at Voldemort's feet would be compelling. And I can totally see Draco playing the long game to beat him. The thing is if he uses his father's money, wouldn't Lucius find out? Anyway it's a solid idea I think.

*** Doubt Lucius would notice. Remember they're filthy stinking rich, I doubt he'll ever notice missing money, as long as it isn't too significant. And if he does notice it should be easy enough to lie about it. He can say he hired a mercenary to chase down potter.

** When did Draco hear Dumbledore call Voldemort Tom? (he certainly was not present in the Battle of Department of Mysteries)

*** I kinda meant in what would be this story. Didn't mean to imply canon
