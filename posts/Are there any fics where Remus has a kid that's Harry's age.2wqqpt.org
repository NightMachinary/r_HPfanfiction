Are there any fics where Remus has a kid that is in Harry's year at Hogwarts?


** Non biological father: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie]] WIP or abandonned, but a good read none the less.

*** Abandoned, almost certainly. Cywscross is constitutionally incapable of finishing a multi-chaptered story.

**** True. I say it might not be abadonned only because his profile claims that any story not expicitly marked abadonned shouldnt be considered so. I have my doubts, but would rather hope for the story to be finished.

** That might be a new one, I've certainly never read anything that had one.

*** I agree. The only ones I've seen where Remus has a biological child, it's usually him having Teddy with Tonks. The only times I've seen him raising a kid Harry's age have been when he's not the sperm donor.
