I would also except novelizations of Lockhart's fictional books where he's still a dirty rotten coward, but the books read like an epic adventure.


** Also, I recommend, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like A Red Headed Stepchild]].

It goes through canon year-by-year as usual, but in 2nd year, Gilderoy Lockhart, thanks to tampering by Quirrelmort, is convinced that he's a) evil and b) a dark creature hunter. He's not very good at the first, but surprisingly good at the second...I think, anyway, I don't remember and I don't have time to reread now.

*** This is clearly the best fanfiction, nay, literature, ever written and anyone who does not love and adore it is a heathen.

PS: I wrote it :P

Edit: Also, Lockhart totally solo's Supreme Danger Noodle and then goes off to fight chupacabras and also a vampire. Maybe I should just write a chapter devoted to that so I can get my fix.

** There's a good one where he gets obliviated, bones up (because he believes his own press?), and is a pretty good teacher.

**** Had I remembered the name, I'd have said it. I added that in hopes of prompting someone else that may know.

Oh. Also, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When_In_Doubt_Obliviate]] is pretty good.

****** Pretty good, but not the Allen Quartermain-esque story I was hoping for.

Sorry, but that typo has /always/ ticked me off.
