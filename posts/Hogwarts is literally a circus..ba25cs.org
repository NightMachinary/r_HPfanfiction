Dumbledore is the ringmaster. The Weasleys are a carnie family. The Muggleborns ran away to join the circus. The Malfoy's are the circus's wealthy benefactors


** It's a bit of a stretch, but I like the concept. Such as the idea of Dumbledore going to a Carnival. H The thought of him rocking back and forth on a Merry-go-round is definitely something to treasure.

** Close Your Dreams, Love by nightofowls has a Hogwarts as a circus theme, but there is only one chapter so far. linkffn(13198744). It's a cross-over with Night Circus.
