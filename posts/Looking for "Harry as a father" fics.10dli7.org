I recently read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3123443/1/The-Little-Child-to-Lead-Him][The Little Child to Lead Him]] and I loved it. I was wondering if anyone has found anything else along the same lines that I might enjoy.

Edit: I love the idea of a young Harry having to be all paternal while in school and/or dealing with old Voldyshorts.


** Oooh! Well, this isn't so much a young Harry as a rather more mature, older Harry, but it's definitely "Harry as a father."

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6329597/1/Snapes-Memories][Severus' Memories]]

Summary: Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679130/1/Severus-Dreams][Severus' Dreams]]

Summary: During that dark year when Voldemort held sway over Wizarding Britain, Poppy Pomfrey gives Headmaster Snape a Christmas gift. Sequel to "Snape's Memories".

There's an additional prequel that touches on Harry's childhood with Dudley that you can find on the author page.

** Not quite what you're looking for, but the only fic s I ever read with Harry as a father were by Shezza88. Not exactly a great role model to his progeny, but still badass.
