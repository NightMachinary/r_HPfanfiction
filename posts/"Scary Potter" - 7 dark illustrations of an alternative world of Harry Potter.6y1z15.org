*** Not really, once people see Harry's head they would take it as just a cover without any meaning to it. After all, she won't kill the main character right? RIGHT?

***** Always intended it to be male Voldemort. But I coulda put some cast shadow on his pecks so they didn't catch SO much light and look like breasts, haha. Apparently that's what everyone else saw immediately. My bad :P Also forgot to put Riddle's initials on the diary in COS. There's a couple more mishaps here and there but what can ya do, haha.

****** It really confused me. Especially since your shading is pretty spot on in all those pictures, I kinda assumed it was intentional. Add to that the long, fragile fingers and the skull anatomy and I was sure I'm seeing a female Voldemort in front of me.

Also, I think the initials of Riddle's diary were only on the first page of the book, not outside of it.
