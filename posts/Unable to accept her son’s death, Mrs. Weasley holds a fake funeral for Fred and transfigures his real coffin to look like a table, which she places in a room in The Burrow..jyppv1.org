#+end_quote

I do think that would be an interesting idea. The concept itself is quite unique and creative. (It sort of makes me think of A Rose for Miss Emily by Faulkner.) I think a traumatized mother doing something objectively off-putting because she's not able to let her son go is an area rich for exploration. However, it's weird that she would forget about it? Alzheimers introduces an interesting framing device to delve into this idea, perhaps her memories are coming and going
