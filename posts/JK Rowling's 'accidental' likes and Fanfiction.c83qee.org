** While I like the HP series to this day, I'm pretty that most of us that like the series have found several parts of the story that are not that lustrous on a second glance. I prefer to think of canon as mainly the framework that so many authors have used to build awesome works, for that, I'm thankful to JKR.\\
As for her personal views, I have mixed feelings, her advocacy for child welfare has brought some good into a human rights issue that, at times, requires a close look into, mainly by those of us that work in the field. That said, it is my opinion that public figures should be very careful over how they lean onto topics that have weight in how any group es perceived. Furthermore, anyone with any kind of influence should either remain neutral (with all that entails) or openly discuss their views (with whatever merit they may or not hold).

**** It's not about liking what a famous person likes. It isn't even about fame. It's about influence and reach. What a ”regular” person says, likes believes, or share usually will weight little outside the immediate context (virtual or otherwise) -that doesn't remove responsibility. However, a person with influence (and the source of the influence may be fame) has to think carefully because what they say, endorse or denounce will most likely be listened to and that may have consequences -intended or not-

** Harry Potter made fall in love with reading, and to this day it has a special place in my heart, and I spend a lot of time reading FanFictions, but yeah, I find it really hard now to appreciate Canon.

I don't really care about JKR opinions tbh outside of the HP-verse and even then I find it difficult to give a shit.

I think everything started going downhill after POA, and the more they add to the HP-verse the worst it gets.

For that reason I never found the strength to read Cursed Child, and while I watched both Fantastic Beasts movies, I find those to be atrocities who are not even following Canon in some parts (am I the only one who was disturbed by Dumbledore teaching DADA instead of transfiguration?).

So in general, I tend to consider everything added after DH to be utter crap and non Canon, even if it comes from JKR personally.

I don't understand this type of grudges, because in the very same movie, DMLE director Travers barred Dumbledore from teaching DADA. Why can a Wizard only teach one class? Why can't there be another great transfiguration professor teaching when Dumbledore applied for the job?

I can also give Aurelius Dumbledore a pass, because it could be a lie by Grindelwald. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's lie, because there's a very short scene about two Grindelwald men doing something to the Lestrange family tree in the movie. I missed that scene the first time, but caught it on my rewatch.

No, the real problem is a Professor McGonagall in 1927. It adds nothing to the story and totally violates canon.

It's what you'd call bad fanservice, they thought they would make people happy by giving a known character an appearance but ended up annoying the more engaged fans. It's annoying because it's a marketing ploy (which fanservice always is but if it's well done you'll notice it less).

** For me it mainly depends about "What revelation".

Some are nice little bit of Trivia that are interesting in thelselves but did'nt make it into the books, for example that the grand parents of Harry were called Fleamont and Euphemia.

Some are . . . Informations I did'nt need to know but thank for the precision I guess. Like, it was really heavily implied that Dumbledore was gay, but thank to precise they were both in a relationship and it was not just unrequired love (though their must be better way to say it that "physical and intense relation ".

And they are the ones that annoy me and make me think people should close her Twitter. Poop vanisher wizards in lead. I also remember the whole "Black Hermione " thing. I dont mind a black actress play her in CC (well no more that I mind this thing even exist ). But I feel like after 7 books, and 8 movies (where they chose Emma fucking Watson ), it's a little late to say "maybe the character was Black all along ".

***** As I said before, "Gay" Dumbledore is one of the few things that doesn't bother me. She may not have explicitly said it, but, for me at least, there was enough hints to at least not make this revelation unbelieveable.

The only thing that really annoyed with "Gay Dumbledore" was when she organised some kind of fake wedding between Dumbledore and Gandalf in front of some anti gay group HQ, and it was for the following reasons :

- Someone once said, there was no bad publicity. By organising this very public events, she gave this group a lot of publicity and a tribune where they could explain their view. For someone who wanted to ridicule them, she just made them well known (though I forgot who it was).
- Even if Dumbledore is gay, he loved Grindelwald. I find it extremely OOC that he would love pretty much any other character than him. And I never though I would ever think about a writer that he make hiw own character OOC.
- Without talking about the fact that Gandalf in the creation of Tolkien and it's pretty disrespectfull to do it without his accord (ok he is dead but still). It's Gandalf, A FREAKING GOD. He is not gay because even the concept of sex is foreign for him. He LOOKS LIKE an old man because him and the other mage though this appearance would be the best for their mission to guide the mortals, it doesn't mean he IS a man. What next, marrying Snape with the Balrog, same difference after all.

*** Good news, JKR did not say Dumbledore and Grindelwald had a "physical and intense" relationship. [[http://tryingtobealwaystrying.tumblr.com/post/182858309202/jk-rowling-on-grindeldore-weve-seen-snippets-of][This]] is what she actually said (skip to ~0.23 in the video):

#+begin_quote
  Their relationship was incredibly intense. It was passionate, and it was a love relationship. But as happens in any relationship, gay or straight or whatever label we want to put on it, one never knows really what the other person is feeling. You can't know, you can believe you know.

  So I'm less interested in the sexual side -- though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship -- than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other, which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationships.
#+end_quote

Nor did she say that Hermione was black all along. After Noma Dumezweni was announced to play Hermione, [[https://bounding-heart.tumblr.com/post/183889771538/jkr-did-not-say-that-hermione-was-black-a-black][JKR tweeted her approval]], saying there's no reason Hermione couldn't be black.

As for wizards vanishing their waste, it was originally a parenthetical detail in the Pottermore article about the [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/chamber-of-secrets][Chamber of Secrets]], and only became a big deal after the Pottermore twitter posted it sans context.

** So, for the things she's added to the story (reveals and the like), I don't really care. People got all up in arms about Dumbledore and Grindewald having an intense physical relationship, but that wasn't very shocking if you knew that she revealed his sexuality back in like 2007. Nothing has been that shocking, or honestly, deserving of hate.

As for her possible transphobia, I am very disappointed in her. At the very least, she is guilty of being very insensitive. Am I still a fan of her? Yes, of course. She made an amazing book series that has been the cornerstone of my life since I was a child. I would still love an opportunity to meet her. However, I think I would artfully engage her in a discussion about mental health and representation, coming from my perspective as a mental health provider. I used to think that I would dissolve into tears at the very sight of her, but I'm working hard to be a better advocate.

It's challenged me to be more inclusive in my fanfiction writing at least. I've met lots of fellow fans who are desperate for authentic representation.

In science you will find it used as something biological, with people for example, talking about the gender of mice, or genes being expressed in both genders.

Some examples paper titles: /Tissue distribution, gender-divergent expression, ontogeny, and chemical induction of multidrug resistance transporter genes (Mdr1a, Mdr1b, Mdr2) in mice/

/High-resolution DNA methylome analysis of primordial germ cells identifies gender-specific reprogramming in mice/

/Gene expression profiling of long-lived dwarf mice: longevity-associated genes and relationships with diet, gender and aging/

/Steatosis in mice is associated with gender, folate intake, and expression of genes of one-carbon metabolism/

This is also how these things are used when talking about humans, for example, here's another paper title:

/Gender-specific gene expression in post-mortem human brain: localization to sex chromosomes/

/Estrogen receptor in the human eye: influence of gender and age on gene expression/

/Effects of gender on nigral gene expression and parkinson disease/

****** However, scientific usage does not mirror common usage.

Theory, for instance is a word that has drastically different meanings in the strict scientific sense and common parlance. I would in fact say that the use of the words 'gender' and 'sex' in scientific papers has very little to do with common parlance.

Further, you say 'sociology jargon' as if that was a bad thing... social construction of ideas and knowledge are accepted theories in science. With that in mind, dismissing the 'social jargon' found within well regarded sociology seems a tad blind, when you've cited so many biological papers. Indeed, one might even suspect cherry picking.

If one looks at the whole of scientific literature, looking at biological sex (which you have shown is also referred to as gender within the biological scientific community) and looking at gender-identity are both fields of research, and they each have specific issues that they are more equipped to research and evaluate.

In addition, to say that TERFs are not necessarily transphobic is... ignorant? Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists - people who state that trans women are not women (for whatever reason) and claim to be feminists... despite shaming the egalitarian values that the feminist movement was built upon. Now, a debate as to whether the specific people that are being referred to are in fact TERFs is something I could not comment on. I have no desire to plumb the depths of twitter to look at JK's followed pages, to see how many are TERFs. The fact that she has apologized for such a thing at least once, however, suggests that they are, in fact, TERFs. While a person has a right to view their own gender identity as being defined by their own biology, that is not not a reason to exclude and commit hate upon a group that defines gender in a way that is is more inclusive. This is especially true with the existence of transmedicalism (which I think you might find interesting), and historical basis for non-standard and transitional genders (which I suspect you may not).

Further, to put gender in the hands of the biological ignores the sheer complexity of human development. Think about how little we understand about the brain, how many different bits and pieces of feelings, emotions, memory, reasoning, processing, language, music, etc. Is it any surprise that, just like every single other bit of the body, there is lots of variation within? Is it surprising that people experience their gender identity in manners that are considered nonstandard? And, given that complexity, is it not reasonable to use the science that observes human behaviour and patterns (psychology and sociology), rather than the science that fully admits that it still has a very poor grasp of how identity of many kinds is formed in the brain (biology)? Of course gender (as in gender identity) is affected by your biology. Your brain is affected by your biology, because it IS your biology. And just like any other sufficiently large system, it will display variances to the extent that they are observable as separate identity phenomena.

Now, to look at common parlance, there are several usages that need to be observed.

Sex (as in: to copulate)\\
Sex (as in: biological sex)\\
Gender (as in: biological gender)\\
Gender (as in: gender identity)

​

Perhaps it is different for you, but in my area is is very common to see the first, second and fourth usages, but basically never the third. This may be an artefact of my location and social demographic (I'm in a community that doesn't bat an eyelid at having multiple trans people, because frankly, who gives a shit), but I suspect that the usage of gender to mean gender identity is more standard than you give it credit for.

I don't mean to come across as harsh or rude, but I don't think that claiming that it wasn't transphobia is accurate, for the reasons above.

I hope that whatever your response, you have a lovely day.

******* The scientific usage is more in similar to the common usage than the sociology usage is. Furthermore, the use of the sociology jargon has been purposefully pushed politically as an attempt to change the common usage, and that is something which should certainly be opposed.

Sociology isn't a normal scientific field at the moment and it has become intertwined with very contentious things that do not have scientific support. For example, it's become common to use certain definitions that actually have content, so that they aren't really definitions, but hidden assumptions-- assumptions which can't actually be supported scientifically.

You are, in veiled terms, claiming that defining gender in terms of biology is transphobic. That is insane.

  The +scientific+ biological usage is more similar to the common usage than the sociological usage is
#+end_quote

This I have to definitely disagree with. The instances I have observed throughout my life have definitely suggested that the common usage refers to a sociological observance of humanity.

For instance, people talk about 'gender roles'. This is particularly noted within the feminist community (a community you appear to associate with, if radically?). It does not refer to biological roles. Instead it refers to sociologically and psychologically constructed behaviours such as 'women work in the kitchen' or 'women are bad at maths' or 'women should just stay at home all day and look after kids'. None of these things are biological. A biological man can make meals, do better at classically 'girly' activities and stay at home looking after the kids. The perception that these roles are gendered is entirely sociologically constructed; that is to say, that society has created stereotypes that people feel pressured to fill. Obviously that is not all inclusive of all gender roles, and plenty of people of all genders defy the stereotypes that are associated with them. However, to say that one's gender is completely unaffected by the sociological pressures of today is to completely miss large swathes of feminist discourse. Of course, a goal of feminism is to make it so that no one feels pressured into doing a 'gender role'd activity that they don't wish to partake in; that people are free to live their lives however they want it. But it also is to allow anyone who wants to adhere to a set of gender roles that they identify with to be able to do so without prejudice... a consequence of the former goal.

#+begin_quote
  purposefully pushed politically as an attempt to change the common usage, and that is something which should certainly be opposed
#+end_quote

You know what else has been purposefully pushed politically as an attempt to change the common usage? 'Raped' has become 'Rekt' under pressure from morally upstanding feminists looking to remove a common usage that allowed for normalization of rape. It seems to me that deliberately trying to change the language to allow /more/ people to feel included and safe is only a positive thing. Why someone would oppose it is curious - wanting to prevent change just to allow for more prejudice seems... very backward thinking. Similarly, your use of 'scientific' earlier, changing the meaning of the word to specifically exclude (this apparently nonscience) sociology. You changed the meaning of the word (because sociology IS SCIENCE) to purposefully push a meaning politically. Which, you just said, is something which should certainly be opposed.

I don't like accusing people of hypocrisy, but...

#+begin_quote
  Sociology isn't a normal scientific field at the moment
#+end_quote

I'm afraid you'll have to explain that. I appear to be able to find plenty of /peer reviewed/ articles in /Nature/ about sociology. You know, the most well established scientific journal in the world (there are a couple of others that may be more well regarded in specific places, but none of them exclude sociology if they're general science). Your use of 'normal' (again, purposefully pushed political etc. etc.) seems to be attempting to devalue the field of sociology as a whole; this seems ironic when talking about societal perceptions of ideas... which is distinctly sociology.

#+begin_quote
  intertwined with very contentious things that do not have scientific support
#+end_quote

Like anti-vax biology scandals, drug development and testing scandals, chemical disposal scandals? No wait, those are your 'normal' scientific fields. This is a double standard which helps nothing and is another blatant attempt to devalue an important scientific field.

#+begin_quote
  For example, it's become common to use certain definitions that actually have content, so that they aren't really definitions, but hidden assumptions-- assumptions which can't actually be supported scientifically
#+end_quote

Now this I don't know how to refute... mostly because I can't for the life of me parse it. Using definitions with 'content'? So... normal definitions? Hidden assumptions? I'm afraid I would need an actual example to comment on this further... it appears you have made a statement about sociological definitions that has... content, and has hidden assumptions.

#+begin_quote
  You are, in veiled terms, claiming that defining gender in terms of biology is transphobic. That is insane.
#+end_quote

You are, in veiled terms, claiming that using a biological definition of gender to exclude women who were born with different biology (you know, like every variance ever) is in no way transphobic. That is insance.

It is not that defining gender in terms of biology is transphobic - I don't agree with your common parlance claim, but I can only base that off personal experience. Instead, what I am claiming is that the /deliberate/ and /malicious/ exclusion of trans people, and using biology as a thinly veiled excuse is transphobic. It is not unlike phrenology fad that was used to justify white supremacist racism of the 1800s.

Now, I am certain that there are some who would debate in good faith about the biological differences between trans people, and those who had their correct gender assigned at birth. A trans person has interesting neurology, for instance, and this is something that is currently being studied. However, that is not what the majority of 'biologically female is the only female' commentators are espousing; instead they appear to latch on to any evidence they can find to further hurl abuse. Your posts being case in point.

********** Ah, I apologize. Some context.

Within the gaming community up until about 6 years ago, the phrase 'raped' was common place to describe the destruction of the opponent. So a team securely winning a game against opponents that they feel they beat by a wide margin might say 'We utterly raped them' or the like. There was a fair amount of controversy about this, particularly among people campaigning for women to be included in competitive gaming, or people who realized that this was normalizing the use of the word. The description 'rape culture' was thrown around a lot (more than it otherwise is) with regards to this practice.

However, roughly 6 years ago (I cannot give an exact date) there came a subtle movement pushing for the word 'rekt' pronounced identically to 'wrecked' in place of the formerly used 'raped'. This movement was picked up by a lot of gamers who felt that using 'raped' was distasteful, and then by the majority of the community. Now it is common slang, and has almost entirely superseded 'raped' as a phrase in the gaming lexicon, to most people's relief.

Also keep herself high profile by pandering to whatever form of virtue signaling is mainstream nowadays. Only that's a bad move, because there's no obvious line to walk there anymore, you're gonna have lots of people shit at you regardless of what you say, either because you've gone too far, or not far enough.

Don't care any more than I cared about Tolkien's Christian views. She is not changing the series. She can't. She literally can't. The books you can buy today have 99.99% exactly the same content they did when we first read them.

Tolkien can scream all he likes about if he likes allegories or not but I'm still gonna see allegories where I saw them before.

"Oh, but people think her word is the word of God..."

They don't. Look around you for one minute. Look through this post. You know who has the most upvotes? People who say they don't care/hate what she says. This is the reality. Start living in it. The people that cared about her have been ridiculed out of the public eye. If you want some well thought opinions go to a more private forum where you can get to know people and they can get to know you.

The wider public has only one acceptable answer now. "J.K. Rowling is stupid and makes a new character gay once a week and thinks people shit themselves in no particular special place as if toilets weren't invented before wheels and oh did you know she is also transphobic like 69% percent of the earth...."

Also, if you minutely care then perhaps [[/u/siderumincaelo][u/siderumincaelo]] 's post will interest you.

  Good news, JKR did not say Dumbledore and Grindelwald had a "physical and intense" relationship. [[http://tryingtobealwaystrying.tumblr.com/post/182858309202/jk-rowling-on-grindeldore-weve-seen-snippets-of][This]] is what she actually said (skip to ~0.23 in the video):

  #+begin_quote
    Their relationship was incredibly intense. It was passionate, and it was a love relationship. But as happens in any relationship, gay or straight or whatever label we want to put on it, one never knows really what the other person is feeling. You can't know, you can believe you know.

    So I'm less interested in the sexual side -- though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship -- than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other, which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationships.

  Nor did she say that Hermione was black all along. After Noma Dumezweni was announced to play Hermione, [[https://bounding-heart.tumblr.com/post/183889771538/jkr-did-not-say-that-hermione-was-black-a-black][JKR tweeted her approval]], saying there's no reason Hermione couldn't be black.

  As for wizards vanishing their waste, it was originally a parenthetical detail in the Pottermore article about the [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/chamber-of-secrets][Chamber of Secrets]], and only became a big deal after the Pottermore twitter posted it sans context.

** I'm one of those people who loved the books on first reading and only the first reading. As a popcorn story it was very enjoyable. It was enjoyable enough for me to get all the books and read through them. My issues with canon started after I started to think about the world she created and all the issues that kind of world would create.

As for the extras she tweets out and such. I tend to ignore them since they aren't actually portrayed in the books. Dumbledore being gay? Don't care because it wasn't actually written in the books. As far as I care, the books only really showed that Grindenwald and Dumbledore were close friends until their falling out.

Wizards vanishing their own poop? Amusing, but not portrayed in the books so I don't care.

Edit: As for fanfiction. I enjoy fanfiction but its really hard to find a decent story under the deluge of terrible crap. A lot of stories I just tend to stop reading due to people not understanding that you need separate paragraphs every time the speaker changes.

I think this article sums it up nicely, she has always been this way.

Tl;dr She's rich enough to never need more money, and she could have used her clout to get rid of Johnny Depp, or to ask for a visibly gay Dumbledore in the new movies, but she chose money.

Fanfiction is better off ignoring her, and the further it moves away from canon framing(house elves like being bound to serve for no pay) the better it can become.

And instead of taking the time to show that they had a relationship, that there was an emotional reason for why he had stayed away, why he didn't talk about Grindelwald, Rowling and the producers chose the vague route, sidestepping that opportunity completely by making references to brotherhood and explaining everything through a blood pact. It was an amazing chance to really show the LGBTQ representation that Rowling said she supported and it feels like a let down. I know it may seem like a stupid thing but when it comes to representation it really isn't - if someone takes the time to make a character come out as gay and says they support LGBTQ issues for years, it really sucks when the representation is still shunted off to the side.

Her view points, whatever they may be, is not what I care about. Its her openness to change what is said and done ( on social media, interviews, or whatever) for, lack of a better word, the "better" and then accidentally like somethings that, for lack of a better word, is promoting the "worser". The books themselves are not under discussion. They are still great if not the greatest books I have ever read.

For me, after the books were done, after the films were done, she said something like "Hogwarts will always welcome you home". That inspired me and I am sure, many others, to further delve into the potterverse (as i like to call it). JK made a place for all to be accepted and many people find this acceptance via ff. And I hate to disagree with you, but her opinions definitely mixed with her art. House elves, purebloods vs the light, wizarding government. That all came from her opinions. I could go on but I hope you take some thought into this.

Please also be respectful. This is for opinions and thoughts. They can be right, the can be wrong. This is not a place for you to tell others what to think, what to believe or what to do, regardless of how strongly you feel the need to defend something.

You can always say "I disagree" and the explain your views.

**** Yeah, my language may need some refining, I'll give you that but isn't this obsession about whatever JK said or did getting tiring? She's not that different from countless artists out there who lose their compass when they find fame? Perhaps I should just ignore the posts but I can't help but be disheartened by how much people seem to care about what celebrities think. You are right, that we each have our own ideals and rights and wrongs. That's my point. JK could believe in whatever, and in her drunkenness (of fame) could say whatever. Why care?

***** For me, I don't think its caring about her views on x y or z. Its more of my own personal fault of building a great author up in my own head. (origin story!: I started reading heavily when I was in the hospital battling the big C) I would kind of escape to her world. A teenager fighting a huge evil that takes so many lives?, needless to say I was hooked.

She became a highly important person in my life, and maybe that was my mistake. I loved the books and when she changed them I accepted it because of her. I found out she wrote Dumbledore as gay and I though that was witty, because she wrote subtle hints. Hermione could be black...okay the illustrations showed her as white, she wrote Dean and Angelina as black, but not Hermione, and they cast Emma as Hermione...but whatever I'll accept it.

Then she revealed more and I accepted that because her views seemed to be heading to equality... now she is reported at liking stuff about inequality. Something doesn't add up and i feel almost tricked. Like I have a fallen idol. If she didn't change the story that would have been fine. If her opinions were just her own, that would be fine too.

But to have this all together...i feel like some of the magic got taken away and i used that "magic" to write. I wish what she said after the book got written down or displayed to her many fans. I hope this all gets resolved and my faith in someone I held in high regard comes back, but until then... I would see if anyone else had these same thoughts...or if anyone else was effected differently or not at all.

And you may be right. Maybe it is my own fault for caring. But I just wanted to see if I was alone in this thought and wanted to see what other people in the hpff community thought. Because now I feel like the magic will be coming from ff writers. I hope this makes sense because I have a lot of feelings on this issue haha

****** I always loved the saying, 'never meet your heroes.' I hope you find your love of fanfic and writing again because I think every writer and reader of this community is a special brand of awesome and it would be a shame to lose a member. (And I hope you've gotten better or get better if not yet.)

** I don't really care about any of it. If she apparently has some - let's be charitable here - unfashionable views - that doesn't affect what she wrote in the stories.

There's plenty of writers and other artists out there who hold views that I don't like, but I still like their work. Stormzy, for example, is a religious lefty but also a good musician.

As fanfic writers we're free to treat as much or as little of her output as canonical as we like. My own preference is to take the first five books as canon, treat the sixth and seventh as having some authority (apocrypha, as compared to gospel), and the rest as being indistinguishable from fanfic.

And I'll diverge even from that which I take as canon where necessary to solve internal inconsistencies or (non-magical) divergences from reality, and if I need to do so because my story requires it.
