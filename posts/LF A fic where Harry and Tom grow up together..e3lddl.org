...Alternatively, I also would like ANY fic that has especially adorable friendships at the beginning.

Any fics that loosely meet this requirement are welcomed too.\\
Let the cuteness begin ;3


** Tom grows up with a twin sister in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13381792/1/The-Riddle-Twins][The Riddle Twins]]. It's a new fic published earlier this year and is currently midway through year one. It has a unique dynamic between Tom and his OC sister which I've enjoyed reading so far. I'm always a bit wary of OC-focused stories, but in my opinion this one is well written and avoids all of the typical problems of Marry Sues and self-inserts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] is probably the most influential fic in the 'Harry grows up with Tom at Wool's Orphanage' trope. It's an excellent story but unfortunately died before reaching 4th year. I recommend giving it a read if you haven't already.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14476725/][Bound by Souls]] is an AU melding of the /Harry Potter/ and /His Dark Materials/ universes. The horcrux in Harry's head is embodied as a dæmon, thus Harry grows up at the Dursleys' with "Tom" as his childhood friend. The fic has many great heart-warming moments in the beginning.

  When Harry goes to Hogwarts, he finally understands that having a dæmon is normal. Only, the wizarding world never anticipated that Harry's dæmon would be an 11 year old Tom Riddle. AU Harry Potter inspired by His Dark Materials.

  "Tom, after his father..." Merope Gaunt woefully rasped, aware of the fact she was dying, "and Mary - Mary Riddle, after her grandmother." Eleven years later, Mary, who was adopted at the age of three by a wealthy, adoring family, is to reconcile with her twin brother at Hogwarts.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.

  Harry ends up back in time on the steps of Wool's Orphanage. Raised in institutional squalor with Tom Riddle, he has a very different attitude toward magic, Hogwarts, and friendships. dark!harry, brotp!tomarry. On Hiatus. Thinking of abandoning. Just isn't fun to write.

** I love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13279185][Snake Eyes]] linkao3(13279185). Tom busts Harry from the Dursleys the summer after their second year. Timeline mashup, Harry and Tom are the same age, though they didn't grow up together and met at Hogwarts. Despite being tagged as Tomarry, it's barely pre-slash if you squint.

  Murder first, apologies later is a perfectly legitimate plan in Tom's mind. Harry disagrees.
