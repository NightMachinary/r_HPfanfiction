** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]], linkffn(11102515): Crossover with BtVS. Hermione and her great uncle Quentin Travers, a Watcher, got hold of Harry during that summer. Things went differently afterwards. Dumbledore is quite awesome in this story.
