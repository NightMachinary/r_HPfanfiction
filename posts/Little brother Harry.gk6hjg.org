I really want a fic where Harry has an older sibling ( preferably a big brother) at least three years older than harry and them being super protective of Harry and getting kinda mad when there is yet another attempt to kill their little brother. I would prefer it if they grew up separately so the bigger siblings can be mad that Harry had to stay at the Dursleys.


** linkffn(No Fortress is So Strong) I read this a while back, so I can't attest that the dynamic you're looking for is /there/ but Harry was raised in Foster Care and his older brother by the Dursleys. It's a pretty cool fic iirc

  In 1981, the two Potter sons had their fates switched, and Nicolas Potter became a famous face. But there are those who know the truth, that the real Chosen One was the younger child. The Slytherin. Now, two brothers share a destiny. Complete.

** It's a bit different than what you are asking, but I absolutely love it. If you like Fem!Harry, that is. Heather is a 2 years older sister to the Boy-who-lived, in the same year as the twins. It's also a Severus/Fem!Harry and a Hadrian/Cedric, in case that makes you squick, but it's really well done!
