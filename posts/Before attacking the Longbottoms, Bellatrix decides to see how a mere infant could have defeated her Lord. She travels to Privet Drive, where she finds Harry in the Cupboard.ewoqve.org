Inspired by yesterday's "Good but insane Bellatrix" post.

What if she tracked down Harry (eg through Ministry contracts or by remembering something Snape once said about Lily's sister) and found him in that cupboard? I remember that at least some thought that Harry had to be a powerful wizard, so she could get through the wards because she meant Harry no harm but was merely curious. Then she finds him dumped into a cupboard by those filthy Muggles...


** I saw a fic like that once... it was followed up by Bellatrix kidnapping Harry to raise him, then an immediate timeskip to several years later for some /very/ weird smut.

1/10, would not recommend.

** Oh man this reminds me of some story where Bellatrix pretended to be Lily and raise Harry and his sister? If I remember she treated the girl badly and tried to make Harry dark some how...I can't remember much from it.

But I like this. I would love for Bellatrix who is crazy in the way that she's smart and dangerous, cautious and stalks her enemies to understand the best way to kill them. Pretty much Bellatrix before Azkaban. So she gets some leads about where the boy who killed the Dark Lord is. She wants to know how and why this brat can do it.

At the same time she questions the Dark Lord. How was he able to be beaten by a child? Disgusting.

She finds Harry in the cupboard and understands that the wards protect him and his family. But she sees the muggles treating a wizard like dirt and it puts her teeth on edge in a way that only her sisters could do when they get on her nerves.

So she plots. She steals another child and with a few spells you could hardly tell the difference between them. And in the middle of the night she switches them out.

Let the muggles abuse one of their own. She was going to take Harry with her.

I imagine that Bellatrix would train Harry in Dark Arts and in hand to hand combat. He would be smart and smart mouthed too. And he would be raised as Draco's friend/cousin.

******* Nah, Bella might be the bigger biggot, but she hates muggles and muggleborns solely, halfbloods (read Harry) and Purebloods are alright in her books, so as she wouldn't be so deposited against Harry and all he is, she would accept him, as an innocent baby, easier than muggles who hate Muggleborns, Halfbloods, Pureboods, or anything to do with magic.

******** She was way more violent though. And it feels weird to call Vernon a Neonazi while Bella is a textbook member of the magical Waffen SS.

********* Bella hated, but didn't try to enslave and impart her own will on people she hated, she just wanted to kill those she hated. Vernon, instead, tried to appear as a decent human being, while hiding his true nature and would mask his questionable decisions behind self-importance speeches and self-righteus anger at those that are different.

*********** Yes. She's a terrible person(see how I already agree she's 'my' MILF), but would you rather deal with unfiltered Neo-Nazi swines that hate EVERYTHING different than them, or with a MILF that's crazy, but if you show your power she would obey you?

**** Rules matter in fanfics if you want consistency. If you change something, ensure consistency in that change. But the prophecy is utterly irrelevant in this prompt.

******* Exactly, but since Dumbles and Voldie are both searching for him, the prophecy has no value other than his parent's death.
