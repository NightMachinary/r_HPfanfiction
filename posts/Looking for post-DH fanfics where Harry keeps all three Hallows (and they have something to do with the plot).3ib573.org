** Coming back late meets this criteria I think, in which harry is slightly delayed in returning to life after getting killed on DH, and after slaying voldemort from afar decides it's his responsibility to be the last master of the hallows by dying undefeated and thus breaking their power. He fakes his death and goes into hiding. Story picks up 15 years later, so it's something of a next-gen fic too.
