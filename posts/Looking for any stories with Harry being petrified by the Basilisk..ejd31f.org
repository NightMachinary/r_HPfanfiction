The only one ive been able to find is from the fantastic Bolts from the Blue! by sprinter1988 In chapter 8 so if anyone has any suggestions I would be very grateful.


** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=126789][Second volume]] of “Meaning of One” by Sovran has this (except, it is cheating to suggest, because ... NO SPOILERS!).
