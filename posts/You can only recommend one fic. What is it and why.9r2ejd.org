As the title says, if you could only recommend one fic, what would it be? Why?


** Right at the moment its probably linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20). In general i dont really read stories about Harry's Hogwarts years anymore and this fic isnt even finished. Milo and Fiona are my favourite OCs ever, Milo being there actually changes a lot so its not a canon rehash. It has a few surprising plot twists, some really emotional moments and funny parts too. In addition the clash between the two different magic systems is fascinating too. Now if only there will be an satisfying ending...

*** I tried getting into it but I just can't get over milo not being able to do proper magic. As I'm not in dnd I can't enjoy the rather lackluster magic system. Normally I don't have a problem with combining systems like saying Naruto chakra is just magic wandless and with different foci and another path through the "magic tech tree". And I can enjoy a litrpg. But that unorganic one charge per day system... I just can't get over it.

linkffn(10677106)

Reasons to read:

- It's funny(humorous without the 'lol so random and quirky' factor)

- It's long enough at 100k words, and covers all seven years

P.S. : Any update on the FFnet situation?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/][The Changeling]]. It's a Ginny-centric fic in which she is sorted into Slytherin. This fic is in my opinion the one that by far has the most complete narrative, and is the one I have become the most invested in. The growth of the characters feels very realistic and earned. It does follow canon events mostly, but it focuses on different perspectives and characters in a way that makes it feel natural and keeps it interesting.

I can't really unlearn the depiction of Ginny in this fic and so far find myself disappointed each time I read other depictions of her.

It's a crossover---I'm obsessed with crossovers, they're like an AU that's pre-built---but the characters stay really wonderfully in-character despite changes to events, and often are even better characterized because of those new events. Plus the story itself is side-splittingly funny because of the matter-of-fact, deadpan way the absurdities of life at Hogwarts are presented.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929][The Debt of Time]] My all time favorite fanfic. It is long, but worth every second. I've read and reread it so many times I sometimes have to remind myself it's not canon. I just think everyone should read it.

*** Isnt that the one where the author spends four chapters bashing you over the head with the fact that sirius and remus know whats going on and hermione will end up with sirius? Does it really get better, because I had to click off after that if that is level of subtlety I can expect.

** I wholeheartedly recommend A Second Chance at Life. Post 5th year AU. Harry realizes that he really doesn't have a shot against a wizard with 50 years of experience. So he goes and gets some. No bashing but does make Harry realize that the world is bigger and, sometimes, you can't take your friends with you. Also, the author's take on blood magic is fantastic. I reread it every few years. linkffn(2488754)

** Out of the Night by Raining Ink

Because:

- OotN gives more character to Knockturn Alley in one story than all the rest of fanfiction put together.

- It's an independent, dark Harry that's entirely in character and realistic.

- Harry's character arc is extremely satisfying, as is his oddball accumulation of magical knowledge over the course of the summer, the complete antithesis of the "summer training regime" trope.

His love of magic and discovering this new world make it a really enjoyable read, also is something that I miss in canon. Imagine you discover you are a witch/ wizard and you get to learn and use magic: Would you ever stop? Wouldn't you be excited/ fascinated about everything? Harry rarely uses magic in the books and never casual, the only thing he seems interested in his Quidditch and DADA.

** I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell for this, but in the absence of any qualifiers I would have to say Harry Potter and the Methods Of Rationality. It's funny, it's at least as well written as most novels on the market, it doesn't do much bashing (it slaps Ron around a bit, but never for very long), it doesn't put Draco or anyone else in leather pants, and it does a pretty solid job of avoiding sues. It isn't everyone's cup of tea (at its core, it's a critique of the HP universe), and it has a substantial hatedom (which is why I'm probably going to lose karma on this), but it's the HP fic that's stuck with me the most.

  Maybe Tom had to admit in easing the verification by adding some prove to his counter next to the newspaper -- but then, he was a simple innkeeper; who would suspect an innkeeper like him when it came to influencing the public by making them verify the things written down in their paper...?

******* I just looked it up, and yes "benignantly" is a word. Thank you! I learned something new today.

However, I also learned that it's an archaic word that generally isn't used now. So in my defence, while technically correct, it's still not very good style when the more common usage "benignly" is available.

  Harry Potter, Master of Death, has been reborn fifty-one times with his soulmate Tom Riddle. They've lived across different time periods, countries, and genders, and now they've decided to return to their first life. This whole rebirth affair can be awfully boring, but this time Harry's ready to make the most of it. Certain that Tom could hear his quickened heartbeat, Harry inadvertently let out a little gasp as Tom pressed his long fingers against the small of Harry's back. Without further ado, Tom bit down on Harry's soft, plush skin, running his tongue over Harry's delightfully luscious mouth. Harry was unable to suppress the low moan that escaped his throat, and he could practically sense Tom's smug smile at the sound. In retaliation, Harry snaked his hands up Tom's shirt, feeling the toned torso. Tom growled appreciatively, deepening the kiss with a ferocious passion. Harry almost whined when Tom pulled away after a long while of more kissing.

  "I think it's time that we made this even more entertaining." Tom murmured by Harry's ear.

  "Oh? And how do you suggest we do that?" Harry breathed.

  Tom smirked. "You sure you want to know?"

** Quiet by Goldy.

It's a pre HBP/DH fic, but it is absolutely the best Harry/Luna fic I have ever read, and is single handedly responsible for solidifying my love of this pairing. I love how it characterizes both Harry and Luna, and it's both warm and touching, but also very bittersweet. It shows them as a married couple after the war, and has a very poetic and sad feel to it. YYou see Harry through Luna's eyes, and it really is beautiful. I find it to be a plausible after the war scenario even though it was written in 2005.

It's a one shot, but one I keep going back to over and over.

  What begins as Severus' anger at Sirius Black's attempts to seduce Hermione leads to a life he never thought he deserved to live.

It also established my otp of Harry/Fleur (I really have no fucking clue how that happened) it helped me see the potential of fanfictions to explore greater ideas than what was just laid out in cannon. Not only that, but the writing style just really fits my tastes, as does the content.

if i can rec a series i would recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590][Leo Inter Serpentes]] by Aeternum on ao3. it's basically the books rewritten with harry in slytherin. it's severitus, and it's drarry endgame, so if you don't like either of those don't read it. it does contain slash sex between harry and draco in the later books (book four and beyond, i believe), i personally skip the sex scenes and read the plot, since the story isn't hugely focused on drarry's relationship there aren't a ton of them and they're relatively short.

if it has to be a standalone i'd rec [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/311126/chapters/498237][Second Life]] by Lariope on ao3. it's a snamione secret (sorta forced) marriage fic that's canon compliant up to the final battle. hermione is of age the entire fic, as it begins after she turns 17 in her sixth year.

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

** I only know of one serious drawback to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past), namely: the author has serious health problems that have kept it on hiatus for years (though with continued assurances that it's not abandoned).

It really sets a high bar for how a Peggy Sue fic /should/ be done. Harry has adult skills and some amount of foreknowledge, but he also has PTSD from having watched literally all his friends, family, and acquaintances killed off. In several cases, literally dying in his arms. And the more he uses his foreknowledge, the more the new timeline diverges and things become less predictable. And someone in the shadows appears to be working to restore the original timeline's events. So it scratches the itch that makes people write fix fic, without (IMO) creating a Gary Stu.

I think my favorite part is the many slices of life in the Burrow. This is a Weasley-heavy fic - but for those who dislike Ron, I'll add that Harry deliberately sets out to strengthen the friendships that created the canon pairings, and prepare his friends for a war. So, we end up with quite a different Ron.

** I would recommend the Black Queen series by Silently Watches. It's long, dark, well-written and has good concept of black/white magic that involves gods (or more like higher powers). The main charcter is OC - twin sister of BWL, left by Lilly and James at Dursleys (any further info would be a spoiler, so just read the first chapter to see if this one for you). P. S. Author's comments are almost as interesting as the story, so I totally recommend reading them too.

**** I liked the series for the first three or four stories of the series but than it got the same old story line. Harry constantly having to prove himself, Connor and Draco being just plain stupid. I mean Connor's known Harry for his whole life and he gets sorted into Slytherin meets Ron for the first time and is now Ron is right you are evil Harry (so much for family being important). And Draco refusing to let Harry have time any time with his family was just idiotic, and the Werewolves in this series drove me nuts. Harry is in the middle of school, going through hell, but you need to help us right now or we will kill/turn Draco and Severus? But the constant Harry having to prove himself over and over and over was a bit over the top. Still have one and half stories left to go, but I just can't.
