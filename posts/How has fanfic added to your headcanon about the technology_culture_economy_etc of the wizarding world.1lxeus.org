I read a fic recently that gave Aurors a device like a compact mirror to communicate with each other, and I really liked the concept. Another fic suggested that there's apparition stations scattered around the country for wizards to use.


** Just remembered; the 'Notice-Me-Not' charm. It's fanon.

*** Sort of. The origins of this spell are likely some terrifying mpreg fic lost to the mists of time, according to DLP boffins. But most modern fanon is likely drawing on what Hermione uses when setting up camp in /Hermione Granger and the Horcrux Camping Trip/... I mean, Book #7.

Those spells appeared to do some odd stuff in the movie version, which was different from the book in a lot of ways (most of them good). So it wasn't created whole-cloth from nothing, at least in the most modern use, but it is very much a fanon thing now.

** I, like many others, have operated under the assumption that the Memory Charm 'Obliviate' operated in a way similar to the neuralyzer from Men in Black- once zapped, the victim was open to suggestion as to what should replace the missing memories. Then JKR/Steve Kloves confused the issue in Deathly Hallows, when Hermione wipes her parents' memories of her and sends them off to Australia under different identities, then turns around (after she, Harry and Ron defeat some Death Eaters that pursued them from the wedding) to say she's never done a Memory Charm before.

Sometimes fanon just works better.

*** JKR has said in interviews that Hermione didn't wipe her parents memories. She just did a charm that makes them believe they're different people. The memories are still there and can be restored, but her parents just can't access them. It's different from obliviate.

***** I'd imagine the intent and concentration of the caster would make the difference. You can change a memory, or remove it completely. It is a "memory charm" not a "mind wipe charm".

Done badly, you could end up pulling a Lockhart. Done in haste you leave gaps in the memory which would be like a blackout...or missing time. Done well, the subject would never know anything was amiss as they have a fuzzy memory of something happening that was probably not really worth paying attention to at the time.

Kind of the same way that notice-me-not charms or muggle-repelling charms would not actually "hide" an item, only make your eyes slide away from it, or immediately think you have something else you were supposed to be doing.

*** I've always believed that repeat uses of the Obliviate Charm would result in cases like Lockhart. I've wondered how it affected the camp manager from the quidditch cup to be obliviated so much, especially after being attacked.

*** Obliviate is an odd one. If it actually existed as something that could be used on magicals without detection, as many fanfics do, then every magical government in the world would by logical necessity be the worst totalitarian state ever invented, with the Obliviation squad its secret police. Anyone in opposition gets handled quicker and easier than anything in /1984/ and then everyone gets back to their lives.

I've read some fanfics that explore that concept, but I'm not interested in writing stories like that. So my idea is, it is actually ridiculously easy to use on Muggles (and maybe squibs) and very, very hard to use on magicals or magical creatures. There is also a separate, unnamed charm Hermione and others use that is /also/ apparently not commonplace for use on magicals.

Some examples from canon: Tom Riddle hits a house elf with that cover up murder and his theft of the cup he turns into a Horcrux and no one even thinks to try and check for such a thing when investigating. He does another memory charm on his uncle, and everyone is likewise fooled, as if such magic simply doesn't exist or isn't ever used (or their law enforcement is just that bad and/or corrupt).

But Barty Crouch Sr. blows one, wiping Bertha Jorkins' memory far too much. You'd think someone with his experience would do better. However, we also have Hermione doing the modifying memory charm on her parents without any problem, as well as multiple ministry officials having no known problems also using it on lots and lots of Muggles, thousands even.

In fact, it seems that other than Lockhart (and it isn't clear he was always successful), only skilled people even /try/ using it on magical people, namely Hermione, Dumbledore, and Shacklebolt. There are lots of situations where a simple Obliviate would have solved a /lot/ of problems, especially for people who have no problem with assault and murder, so the best canon-wrangling I've got is that doing so on a witch or wizard is simply outside almost everyone's skills. That would explain people not instantly thinking someone like Lockhart is doing something wrong (and law enforcement incompetence on memory spell use in general) and also Voldemort not thinking his agents who are acting strange in DH after running into the Trio have been memory charmed by 17-year-olds (because he doesn't take into account the Hermione factor).
