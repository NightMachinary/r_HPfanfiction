Just in case someone wasn't aware... you can use this page to drop fanfic links and get an ebook. I assumed everyone was using it, but I didn't see any specific posts about it. And it is really the best thing since sliced bread for someone who reads on a tablet.

[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/]]

The other big fanfic sites have download links. This thing is a lifesaver for me.


** You can also use the fanficfare function on Calibre, if you're into the book management lyfe. :)

** Many of us use [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] either as a command line application or the plugin for Calibre.

** SAMMY I use FANFICTION DOWNLOADER program!!! :) It's super easy and tiny, you just copy and paste a link and click download and it goes into any folder you want to as a EPUB or a MOBI or a PDF even. :) :)
