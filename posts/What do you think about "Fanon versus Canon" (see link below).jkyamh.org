I just came across [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/fanonvscanon.htm][this article]], and I'm wondering if there's anyone else on this sub who has read it.

Personally, my opinion is mixed. On the one hand, it is very extensive and it does clear up some misconceptions; on the other, the author makes a lot of assumptions that would probably count as fanon themselves (even when supposedly listing canon facts) and is clearly biased in favour of some characters (well, mostly Snape).

  *The Death Eaters equate to Nazis or the KKK.*

  It may well be that Rowling had the Nazis vaguely in mind when she wrote about the race laws which Umbridge introduces, but the Nazis would kill anyone who was even a quarter Jew or gypsy, whereas the Death Eaters, and even Umbridge, will spare anyone who is even a quarter wizwitch.

  There are superficial similarities between the Death Eaters and White Supremacists, but the dynamics are different. White Supremacists, at least where they occur in predominately white countries, are members of a majority who have been in power for centuries and don't like the idea that they may now have to share their toys with others. Pureblood supremacists are a minority within an already tiny minority, possessed of certain advantages but hiding in fear from the very Muggles whom they affect to despise but who outnumber wizwitches six thousand to one, and who in the past have done their best to hunt wizards into extinction.

  If the Death Eaters equate to any American racist group, it's not the Ku Klux Klan but the Nation of Islam; a militant wing of an oppressed minority, who have become as bigoted as their erstwhile oppressors.

**** It's a numbers game and I'd say they are not a majority but a minority who has been in power. Officially you can only be a pureblood if all your grandparents have been purebloods. Inofficially of course you can be a pureblood if you can hide your non-pureblood relations well enough for other purebloods not to doubt your claimed status. So any /known/ halfblood or muggleborn in your ancestry automatically disqualifies you. Which puts a bit of a limit on the ability of purbloods to procreate while having their children retain that status.

And a heriditary minority in power pretty much describes historical European nobility. Which did not gladly accept the rise of the commoners and their own decline.

*** This is such a shitty take it's difficult to even process. I'll zero in on one thing though:

#+begin_quote
  their best to hunt wizards into extinction.
#+end_quote

Muggles are viewed with contempt, not fear, by pure bloods. The witch hunts are mentioned in canon as being laughable. It's suggested in the Wendelin the Weird anecdote that muggles failed to kill a single witch or wizard in their witch hunts.

Hatred of muggles predate the witch hunts of the late middle and early modern period by centuries. Slytherin lived hundreds of years before then and literally created a magical monster to murder muggleborn children.

Whoever wrote that is basing a chunk of their opinions at least partially off fanon. This sort of take is super common in "Deatheaters are the good guys" fics.

Rowling has literally said that the pureblood classifications were based on Nazi terms.

**** Adding to this, the author says the two groups are incomparable because Nazi's were more strict about blood purity. Voldemort was working with a much smaller population. He couldn't really afford to be picky- if a half blood had talent, they could be recruited. Even if a muggle born had talent (like Lily) she could be recruited. He made room for exceptions because the pureblood population was actually quite small. It just wouldn't be pragmatic to eliminate all non-purebloods.

But in Germany the population was huge. Nazi's didn't have to concern themselves with thinks like sustainability.

*** So the author of that piece has never come across the idea that an author possibly could poach some defining features of real-life groups or people without emulating those same groups or people in every detail, can conceive that an author may create an amalgamation of traits from a number of varied real-life sources, is unable to wrap his head around using examples from outside the US and is incapable of comprehending a /minority/ who has been in power for centuries and is now declining in importance.\\
Like, for instance, /heriditary nobility/. In England.

** That's beautifully written and well-researched, but yeah, the pro-Snape bias periodically shoves the alleged canon into fanon.

I think this is most clear in the "Snape gave as good as he got" section. It starts by listing all of the canonical incidents debunking Snape's statement that the Marauders always physically attacked him four on one... then concludes, with zero foundation, that the Marauders usually physically attacked him four on one. Despite the fact that canonically there's no evidence that Lupin (who didn't approve) and Pettigrew (who was a wimp hiding behind James/Sirius) ever did a damn thing but look the other way and/or cheer. And looking the other way and/or cheering are plenty bad... but they're not the same as being part of the physical attack.

*** It begs a few serious questions with canon. Even Snape himself doesn't seem to hold Lupin as responsible as Black and Potter. He managed to put up with working with him and brewing for him for a full school year with his only real aggression being trying to out Lupin's lycanthropy. Replace Remus with Sirius, and Snape would have tried to kill him within a few weeks (and likely succeeded).

His only real emotion towards Pettigrew is contempt.

**** Outing Lupin's lycanthopy is not exactly a small thing though. That costs him a job, a home, access to medication (the Wolfsbane) he badly needs and a stable future all at once.

It's less blatant than trying to strangle him, but it's still pretty devastating.

**** I don't even think he's mad at Sirius for /trying to kill him./ I think he's mad at Sirius because he himself stupidly followed his instructions.

Snape knew what he was looking for. He found what he wanted. And had to get his bacon saved by James Potter.

Anyone who says otherwise belittles Snape by not only making him, someone known for being intelligent, and someone known for their knowledge in the dark arts (even back then) an idiot for not noticing. They've been bickering for their whole hogwarts career? And he still hasn't figured it out at that point? No. He wanted to get Lupin expelled. Or killed.

***** Snape clearly didn't know what to expect, which Lupin and Sirius themselves admit by saying Sirius "tricked" Snape into going. If anything, Sirius probably lied and proposed a duel of some sort.

Anyone who says otherwise is victim blaming someone who, according to them, was suicidal, since that was the only logical outcome of going against a transformed werewolf.

If Snape wanted to get Lupin expelled, all he had to do was shout the information from the rooftops, or just pass it on to Lucius/Voldemort, who would have had a field day using the press to turn the entire Wizarding World against Dumbledore, the guy who allowed a Dangerous Werewolf sleep next to their children.

Also, the "knowledge of the dark arts" bs is what...the dudes who nearly got him killed peddle, and we see exactly what it consisted of prior to the murder attempt - anti-eavesdropping spells, toenail-growing hexes. You know, the sort of spells that seem handy when you're being followed around and repeatedly targeted by some bullies, hmmm.

Yeah, that argument gave me pause too when I followed the link in the main post. He had no expectation that the comment would upset her? After more than a decade of teaching tweenage/teenage girls, it never occurred to him that mocking their appearance from a position of absolute authority might be a problem?

** She has her biases, but especially her Location series (Hogwarts, Grimauld etc.) is top tier. Amazing reasearch, first-hand knowledge, and everything impeccably sourced so you can always follow along her conclusions as far as you want or entirely draw your own. The HP wiki could learn from that.

I never read all of her Fanon debunks, because I have firm grasp on that myself, but upon first glance, it looks qualitatively similar.

** I think I read that some months ago... I think it's fascinating. Clearly they're a Snape enthusiast, of course, but I think most of the Snape stuff is really more brushing the distinction between fanon and fan theory/inference. The former being an idea that is accepted as fact, whereas the latter is an extension of textual information. Of course, we might call this a distinction without a difference but I do think there's value in distinguishing headcanons, fanon and theories.

** I don't feel she's particularly biased towards Snape, British mannerisms among other things are much different than the USA's, etc.

Claire Jordan (the author of this article) is an incredible intelligent individual who has lived in the UK all her life iirc, and knows the culture extremely well. And she's very good at examining and looking at different perspectives.

That's just my two cents, either way it's a well thought out and well written article whether you agree with her or not.

*** She insists Snape isn't biased towards his House, and simply favors Draco because he has "genuine potions ability" and that Neville is "genuinely a bad and dangerous Potions student" thus deserving of the attitude he's given... despite Snape treating them both the same throughout the books as he does on their very first day of class.

She rather openly implies we should blame Potter's attitude toward Snape on him being "working class and friends with an actual girl".

The author has some good insight, but badly needs to check her own biases, especially when she says Snape was based on someone she knows.

Which Draco does, and there's not much favouring going on? Snape doesn't break any school rules to favour Draco, unlike McGonagall with Harry, for example, and he doesn't do anything about Ron trying to attack Draco, Hagrid threatening Draco with torture, McGonagall not doing anything when Draco /is/ tortured by BCJ, etc.

Which he is. Even McGonagall openly treats him as hopeless and an embarrassment to her.

When Draco displays genuine potions ability, and Neville nearly injures the entire classroom.

Considering he starts calling Snape "Snivellus" (i.e. weak) for choosing to follow Lily out of the compartment and the confrontation, and he also mocks Lily for being nonconfrontational, sounds believable enough, especially when taking into account James's general Toxic Masculinity 101 behaviour.

I don't think he targeted Snape /because/ he was working class, but rather took advantage of the direct effect of him being poor and a half-blood, and thus unpopular with the other Slytherins. James knew Snape would be an easy target, so he focused on him (and later on, according to JKR, he focused on Snape specifically because he was jealous of his friendship with Lily).

****** I think it's the opposite, and the issue is that Snape has high expectations of everyone, chronically incompetent people like Neville included. He says as much in his speech regarding the OWLs, suggesting that he rarely, if ever, has a student fail their Potions OWL, and he seems genuinely frustrated that Neville, after an entire summer of supposedly studying the potion, still makes a disaster of it.

Flitwick constantly assigns Neville extra homework because he's so bad, and McGonagall treats him as hopeless, and neither of those methods produce any better results. Neville's probably good at Herbology because it involves almost no magic at all. I suspect part of it is because of his malfunctioning wand.

In HBP, Neville takes DADA with Snape, performs decently (thanks to his training with Harry + new wand), and...there's zero mention of Snape saying anything mean to Neville.

The same way there's never any mention of Snape unfairly praising Crabbe or mocking Dean.

******** Why would he be much happier teaching DADA? His supposed desire for the positions was a ruse agreed upon with Dumbledore, and the reason Snape went asking for the position in the first place was because Voldemort ordered him to do it, knowing it would be open because of his curse, and wanting a spy near Dumbledore.

In any case, "happy" was likely a feeling Snape wasn't experiencing as he was preparing Harry and his friends to face Voldemort in the near future, while knowing he'd have to kill Dumbledore even sooner, so it really feels like grasping at straws to fine some convoluted and flimsy explanation for Snape being harsh on Neville, when the obvious explanation is staring everyone in the face - Snape is generally demanding, shit students will fail to meet those demands and get criticised for it.
