Saw a post about Mundungus being like that, and decided I'd like to read fics with a Harry like that.


** Interestingly, that fic that was recommended in the Mundungus thread (linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5)) also features a LadiesMan!Harry.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
