I'm a hardcore Tomione fan. (Tom Riddle/Hermione) I don't remember why or how this happened but don't bash it until you try it! The weirdest pairing I probably came across was a Harry/Hedwig fic. I couldn't take it seriously.

EDIT: Thanks for all the pairings guys. I'm looking forward to broadening my horizons with some of these!

** You kinda have to define "unusual" because one persons unusual is another's usual. For example, I love Harry time travel pairings (so black sisters, lily, whomever). Some might think thats unusual since its outside his traditional time period.

I am also a sucker for Harry/Katie romance FF because it feels like there are so few of them (at least good ones).

But if we want to really talk "unusual"... How about a Harry/Ariana Dumbledore (time travel would likely be involved), or a Harry/Bella Swan (Vampires fit into the HP universe).

Susan Bones from Hufflepuff may just survive some of the craziness thanks to her aunt giving her self-defence lessons (and probably a license to kill too since, you know, DMLE head and all that). Su Li could probably hold her own better than Cho ever could. Lillith Moon or Tracy Davis could too. The Patils may, /may/ survive some of the shit thrown Harry's way.

But hey, I'm an H/Hr fan. And Hermione survived shit that'd qualify her for an apprenticeship under Harry Dresden on merit alone. But she's not an unusual pairing whereas Fay Dunbar rarely ever gets a mention outside of one or two fics such as linkffn(8514243) and not really in a romantic context either at that (warning: the above fic is dead enough that reviving it would probably no longer qualify as necromancy).

... I need to write something with that girl... I mean, she keeps a beater's bat near her bed in the books per the wiki. She wants to be the magical equivalent of a Dark Wizard hunter (basically an Inquisitor with magic and magic gear really. Even the red cloaks they wear read like those from that Monty Python skit) and she's sporty enough to apply for the quidditch team as a batsman. I am sure that falling on the half-blood side of the pure-or-half argument would allow for an adult version of her to make a good urban fantasy character if she's an auror that specialises in screening muggle mystery cases for magic.

Otherwise, yeah, she could totally kick some ass in an HP book where she plays the Damsel to Harry's Knight... except she's a better knight than Harry is.

** Umbridge/Dementor is one obvious choice

Lily/Giant Squid was even mentioned by Lily herself as a possibility

Snape/Fleur worked well in one postwar fic

Hermione/Albus Severus appears possible to me, and someone has already written Hermione/Scorpius

Harry/Rose actually has a few readable fics devoted to it

--------------

Well, I like Harry with Fleur (makes more sense than Fleur and Bill IMHO, because they are a lot closer in age, compared to her Bill is an "old man") or Tonks (without having Tonks be kind of "damaged goods" because guys want her to fucking change all the time!) or with one of the professors (and well done Harry and OFC...especially since OFC necessitates canon changes (can't stand canon rehashes with only a different pairing...damned if I want to read canon I'll get myself the HP-Books again (never owned a copy - a former girlfriend of mine loaned them to me!))...sadly there are so few really good ones :(

Then there's pairings that are truly unusual, like Harry/Katie (or other - female! - members of the Quidditch Team) or Harry/Penny Clearwater

***** Really? I've read tons of slash on FFN.

Also, FFNs highest rating is M so any explicit mention of dicks going into vaginas (or indeed any orifice at all) means that the fic is violating the sites rules.

Also the site with the biggest aversion to slash as far as I can tell DLP. It's also not a very friendly site for Harmonians.

**** Well, I wasn't going to include Snape, but since you insist....

Edit: You can also vote on the poll on my fanfiction profile. I promise that I'm taking this all very Siriusly.

** Personally, unusual/not popular pairings I've ended up liking are:

- Seamus/Blaise (male)
- Charlie/Luna
- Percy/Oliver
- Ron/Draco <-sort of popular, but Draco is usually paired with Hermione or Harry
- Tom Riddle/Time Traveled Ginny
- Theseus Scamander/Percival Graves
- Krum/Hermione <- kind of an honorable mention I guess since the pairing is technically canon
