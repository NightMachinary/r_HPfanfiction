** It's written quite well, although I never really got into it past the first 20 chapters or so. All the terminology being thrown around without any plot substance made it come off as a bit pretentious to me. It's a great work, just not a great work of fiction.

** On chapter twenty. It's absolutely brilliant and I've almost choked laughing a half-dozen times yet.
