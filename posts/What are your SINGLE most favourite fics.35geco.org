There have been some threads essentially asking for fic-dumps, but I think narrowing it down to one fic or series of fics that you like the most of any would be better.

Personally, I'd go for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]] as it's probably the best in the AQ series to date, and the series on the whole is the best-written I've /ever/ read. What about you all?


** It's a tough question and a little cruel but I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] is my favourite fic. There's something about Harry in that story. While he's wacky and funny there's an underlying sadness throughout the whole story that raises it above other stories. Even though Harry is surrounded by the cast of Firefly you can see the crippling loneliness of being the last of his kind. Human pride and folly is a big theme and runs as an undercurrent throughout the entire story.

I doubt others necessarily read it the same way but for me it's a beautiful lament that still manages to be both funny and exciting while still remaining poignant.

You know when you finish a great movie or book and you just stare at the screen or page for a few minutes digesting the whole story? I think Browncoat, Green Eyes is the only piece of fan fiction that has ever drawn that reaction from me.

There's a lot of other good stuff, but for me I don't think it can be bested.

*** Browncoat is definitely my favorite Firefly fanfiction, but it falls apart at the end too much to be my favorite HP fanfic. Once you find out what happened to the wizards a huge part of the tension you talk about is gone. Still really good, though.

**** I agree, I think it would have possibly been a better story without the 'happy' ending. Still, when I look back on it now the ending seems fairly irrelevant to me. It could have been perfect, but even with the ending it got it's probably still my favourite fic. If nothing else it's the first fic that springs to mind when I try and think of a story that actually drew a real emotional response from me.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by The Santi. I just about freaked out when it updated a few months ago after a 4 year hiatus. I can't wait to see where it goes, though that being said, it is still in progress, so hopefully it doesn't start sucking. But for now, it's my favorite.

** My favourite fic is Ectomancer by RustyRed. It's an action-adventure with great worldbuilding and characterisation of Harry. He feels very much like his canon self, but the most awesome version of his canon self, the one who can think on his feet and, when under pressure, be quite inventive. The one who was able to learn the Patronus Charm at age 13.

Hmmm. I was never all that fond of this one. I could never buy the premise, that Ginny's death could somehow give Harry powers of /wandless magic/ and make him (and Ron, for that matter) an overnight prodigy. I have the same any of the million 'Harry suddenly decides to study hard for <insert reason here>' stories out there -- I just cannot buy the premise, and if I cannot buy the premise, I cannot really enjoy the story either.\\
But credit where it's due -- the dynamic between Harry, Ron and Hermione is pretty well done. The problem, of course, is accepting this version of Harry and Ron are the same characters as the Harry and Ron from canon, but is you force yourself to accept that, then everyone in the trio seems to have a purpose, and the banter feels natural, so that's good.\\
I'm still waiting for a trio fic where everyone in the trio is actually in-character, or at least start off in-character. This is the next best thing, I suppose, but it still seems unsatisfactory.

***** Its close enough. Both Harry and Ron started getting all Outstandings by third year. By fourth year Harry looks on bored while the seventh years all fail in whatever practice challenges they were supposed to be doing, while making complicated transfigurations he showed no signs of doing in canon. Perhaps not prodigious, but still, it doesn't /feel/ like something canon Harry would have done under these circumstances, so it loses points for that.

*** Man, this looks good, but it just goes too far. I had a lot of hope for it in the beggining, Harry is a little shit that makes me want to throttle him because he can't recognize that just because you don't care for someone that doesn't mean they aren't useful. The fact that Harry bothered me so much was a sign of good writing. However the author ruined it by having Snape poison him and lock him in a broom closet for no reason. What the hell is that? The author deliberately has Lupin say there is no reason not to trust him, then has Snape almost immediately reinforce that he is absolutely not trustworthy.

Also, I know that he is a spy, but it would be awfully suspicious to not be fired for that.

It perfectly manages to balance that line between giving you what you want and being realistic about various character's flaws. It's one of the few fics I've read that makes use of subtext and themes.

Runner-up would have to go to [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][/Delicate/ by Padfoot4ever]]. It takes a few chapters to find it's feet, but when it does...well, say goodbye to your free time. Delicate is wickedly funny, wonderfully characterized, and has a plot that grips you from the start. I'm convinced it is the only fic in the entire fandom that manages to portray teenage pregnancy in a realistic way. For once the characters actually feel like teenagers. It also does a fantastic job of making all those random next-gen family members (James, Al, Lily, Hugo, etc) three dimensional and interesting. But don't take my word for it -- /Delicate/ won a Dobby for Most Addicting Fic and a Golden Snitch for Best Next Gen.

Both are of epic length, pretty much canon pairings & a sort of cliché "Harry & Ron are aurors fighting evil" plotline, but well-written, introduces some really interesting OCs, just a pleasure to read.

** My SINGLE most favorite fic? This is a damn hard question, you know. Welp, time to brainstorm.

DrizzleWizzle's Slytherin rewrite is great, HPMoR is fantastic (I don't care what you think, cruel subreddit!), Natural 20.. is perfect.. Santi's Boy Who Lived, Shezza's Denarian, Taure's Light by Silver Memories, A Black Comedy is pure gold, Für Das Größere Wohl is the definite AU (screw you Alexandra Quick! If there isn't nazis, your fic ISNT BEST :@ ), melindaleo's Seventh Horcrux is special for being the faux Deathly Hallows..

*NO* more ranting. The definite best. The single favorite fanfiction I have in this entire fandom. Why have you asked me such a /difficult/ question!?

Well, the single best fanfiction in this fandom..

+Harry Potter and the Natural 20. /No really, it has the best characters and does fanfiction just perfect./+

+The Santi's Boy Who Lived. /No question about it, really. The Durmstrang AU, the girlfriend character, the handling of Krum, the way brother-boy-who-lived is done, subtle Quirrel, descent into dark magic../+

One more try. Come on. You can do it. It's not that hard. It's just a silly question. Try again!

*Für Das Größere Wohl*

I'm sorry, but this is just my absolute favorite fic in this fandom. A Hitlerjugend at Durmstrang? Come on, there's not a single better plot-hook in this entire bloody fandom. And the fic is well written, also. I've made my choice. That's it, no more edits..^{nomore^{damnyouOP^{unfairtoohardquestion}}}

**** I like both. Although the second has lost its way, I'm really enjoying reading about the misadventures of Fiona the Muggle. It'd be better as a standalone story where it didn't intrude, but I'm fine with it. It's great!

****** To some extent, yes. The second part cuts Harry and Co from the story even more and focused more on the DnD part. I can see why people wouldn't like it

** Eden by obsessmuch [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3494886/1/Eden]]

The story intro says it all, check out the link.

Maybe not my favourite but probably the most memorable.

All I can say is that I felt like I had stockholm sydrome with this story and I freaking loved it, it's long and painful but so so worth it.

Although, warning, it's not for the faint hearted.

**** Well I don't want to give away too much about the plot but essentially you're waiting for this brutality and conflict to end, for Lucius to show the faintest sign of anything remotely remorseful, and it takes so long, so much so that you feel tired and captured by the story just like Hermione is by Voldermort and his cohorts.

Now I love Lucius (I'd say the story would be even harder to read if you didn't), but even I had trouble liking him in this one.

It's worth the agonising hours I spent reading it, and a very accurate representation of how I think a lot of the pureblood supremacists felt.

It's like you want to hate the story, to hate Lucius, but you can't.

Sorry, it's sort of hard to explain, but I can guarantee it will make you feel something strong if you commit to reading it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times by Jewels5]].

It's probably the most interlaced Harry Potter fanfiction, and most undeniably from the Marauder's Era.

** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]/ is probably my favorite (though /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][Partially Kissed Hero]]/ is a very close second). I've cooled down on it a little after seeing its flaws pointed out, and it certainly doesn't measure up to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][my favorite story in the /Naruto/ fandom]] (which is also /my favorite book of all time/), but I haven't found anything better than it in the /Harry Potter/ fandom, at least.

** I've recently reread [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6624252/1/Nocturnal][Nocturnal]] and think it may usurp Vox Corporis as my favourite.

The depictions of Ron's dream sequences and detailed descriptions of his behaviour at the breakfast table always get a laugh out of me no matter how many times I read this story. It's hilarious and well written.

** hpmor for me, but to a degree that doesn't fit under the fanfiction label. among those that certainly do, it's crazy to me that no one in this thread has mentioned the life and times. i get the sense that most of the full-length marauder era stories are not this subreddit's cup of tea.
