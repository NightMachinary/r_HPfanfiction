When I started reading Harry Potter fanfic I did start with Harry x Hermione but stopped and started looking for other pairings but now I want to read some well-written and thought out Harry x Hermione fanfic.


** Stages of Hope - linkffn(6892925).

It's such an absurdly wonderful story anyway. Hermione and Harry are platonic through much of the story, but maaaaan it's an intense relationship and beautifully written. I don't tend to ship them, but was shipping them so hard by the end of this!

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** I'm guessing one-shots are not what you wanted, but frankly linkffn(Definitions of Romance) is the quintessential HHr story, it's how the ship should be written.

That aside, linkffn(Hermione Granger is Stupid) is pretty good and it's complete.

*** Could you elaborate on Definitions of Romance? I've seen a fair number of people agree with you that it's the quintessential H/Hr story, but I don't see the appeal. It isn't even really a story, more a snapshot of a relationship.

**** Sure! I think it captures how they'd be in a relationship realistically. It's very in-character. Like take this passage:

#+begin_quote
  They rarely touched in public.

  "Are you just ridiculously shy, or do you really not want to hold her hand now and then?" Ginny asked at Ron's birthday party.

  Harry shrugged. "What's the point? I know she's not going anywhere and she knows I'm not either. We don't need to be joined at the hip to prove we're engaged."

  "It's not about marking each other! It's about wanting to be near her because you love her, you idiot."

  "We're in the same room. And we live together," Harry said, baffled.

  Ginny threw up her hands and stalked off to commiserate with Hermione about the general stupidity of men. This apparently didn't go as well as she'd expected, judging by Hermione's own baffled expression and the sidelong glance she cast at Harry.
#+end_quote

Harry and Hermione are intense personalities, but they also aren't very romantic in the usual sense. Harry would never be like Ron was with Lavender, nor would Hermione. Harry doesn't strike me as one who would ever "get" women (see OoTP). It would feel very OOC. Similarly, both aren't the type to be very public about their feelings (Harry especially). DoR captures this and feels right because of it. Lovey-dovey, hanging-off-each-other Harry or Hermione, irrespective of who they're paired with, is too out-there for me, I don't buy it when I see them act that way in stories as if it's their usual behavior.
