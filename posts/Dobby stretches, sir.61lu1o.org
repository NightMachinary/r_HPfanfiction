Looking for a short fic. It was at first Lily/Hagrid, but it then changed to Dobby/Hagrid. Dobby said "Dobby stretches, sir!". I think Harry took a piss on Walburga's portrait as well.

***** If I remember correctly he used his finger...not his actual dick.

I'd rather not ponder on such thoughts. I'll need to buy the most expensive mind bleach that the local Wal-Mart sells.

** Google says the fic is linkffn(1634396)

Tip: If you put something in quotes, you can search for an exact string on google, [[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Dobby+stretches%2C+sir!%22][example]].

Also, I read the first 3 paragraphs and now am over on [[/r/eyebleach]]. See you :)
