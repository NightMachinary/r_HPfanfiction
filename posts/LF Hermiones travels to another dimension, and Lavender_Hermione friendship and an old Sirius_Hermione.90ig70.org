I'm getting back into HP fanfiction, so there's a few type of HP fic that I've been yearning to read.

I'm looking for any fic where Hermione travels to another dimension, I don't care whether there is romance or not as long as I don't see Ron/Hermione, or Viktor/Hermione. No Snape bashing, I love that man. Please no constant damsel in distress Hermione. Sometimes people need saving, yes I get that there will be times where she'll needs help, but Hermione has always been resourceful, cunning, not to mention intelligent to the point of being a genius. Anything else is fair game. Please let them be long and finished.

Also are there any fics that have Lavender/Hermione as friend during Hogwarts. I don't mean that they grudgingly get along, no I mean that they meet when young and despite how different they are they become best friends. No Ron/Hermione Pairing please and thank you.

It's been a while but I'm still looking for a Sirius/Hermione fic. It happens to be after the war(I believe), Hermione is an adult, it is not time travel. Where Sirius and Hermione are constantly arguing but one of those argument leads to Sirius and Hermione ending up locking themselves together in a room and not coming out for days. It was on the shorter side and On FF.net

Thanks so much for your help.

Lavender is a great girl in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] and good friend with Hermione. She also died a hero's death. Hermione had this conversation with Ron after the Final Battle:

  She nervously suggested, “Maybe we could name our first girl after Lavvie.”

  She expected Ron to go ballistic over the idea that they would get married and have children. Instead he complained, “Lavender? That's as bad naming a boy Viktor. No, it's definitely worse. Not as bad as Euterpe or Siouxsie or Elvis, but still...”

  Hermione leaned into him. “Lavender's middle name is -- was -- Rose. And Viktor's middle name is Hugo.”
