I'm looking for stories where Harry specializes in fire magic, like in linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) where he becomes known as the Fiendfyre Lord, or linkffn(Made of Common Clay) where he burns the prejudice out of people's minds with the Deathly Hallows.

Whether he's good or evil, I want to see him scorching his enemies with powerful fire. If he associates with creatures connected to fire, such as phoenixes, ashwinders, dragons, etc, even better. Adult Harry is heavily preferred, since he couldn't just go around incinerating other students. (Though I'd like to see a fic where the cliche SecondChances!Dumbledore just keeps cheerfully covering up Harry's murders/experiments with the excuse that given enough time he'll understand his mistakes and embrace the power of love. I've never seen that before, only the lectures on why Harry should give others second chances. Rambling food for thought...)

Anyway, if anyone knows some good Pyromancer Harry (possibly even with the term being used correctly so that he uses fire magic for divination.) stories, I'd really like to read them. Romance (even slash) acceptable (but not required) so long as it's non-explicit. Thanks!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

  What if the founders built in a safe guard to protect incoming students from abuse at home, in the form of the hat? How would the hat react to Harry's so called childhood? Rated for language and expected violence. As complete as it is ever going to get. Revised as another story.

  Harry Potter's temper has always been rather dangerous, but it's not until things start bursting into flames that people realise exactly how fiery it is. And now that the fire's been lit, Harry isn't all that willing to let it be smothered again, in fact he's all for letting it burn. And should the Ministry or Voldemort stand in his way? Well... fire solves everything.

**** linkffn(2823892) is just a bunch of oneshots, but is also pretty good.

Oh yeah, definitely a lot of cliches, but I think what really set it apart is that Harry decides to work with Dumbledore. I still dislike the Amelia Bones saves the day cliche though.
