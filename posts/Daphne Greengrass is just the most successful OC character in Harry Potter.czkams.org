Seriously, /everything/ about the character is invented by fans, as the only bits that come from canon are she's a pure-blood and a Slytherin.

We don't know she's actually blonde but she's always portrayed as blonde with blue eyes, we don't know anything about her personality but she's always an "Ice Queen", we don't know who she was friends with yet she's portrayed typically as sympathetic to half-bloods because of a fan-created friendship with Tracey Davis.

Everything about the character is essentially your typical pure-blood OC (aristocratic, knowledgeable about customs, falls for the outsider Harry) yet she escapes the criticism of the label OC because people assume the character is based on something because the name is a Rowling creation.

******* Who wouldn't want to know that the "Manipulative Dumbledore who believes in the Greater Good" stereotype is officially canon? Dumbles hired Lockhart, knowing that Lockhart was a terrible person and a bad teacher. He condemned a whole year of students to an inadequate education, in order to reveal Lockhart as a fraud and teach the kids a life lesson of "What not to be".

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep. He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud. Professor McGonagall, who had never liked Lockhart, asked Dumbledore what he thought students would learn from such a vain, celebrity-hungry man. Dumbledore replied that *‘there is plenty to be learned even from a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be'.*

Dumbledore being mad that Lockhart would do that and hiring him to expose him as a big fat liar isn't quite something I'd compare to the Manipulative!

******** Something else to consider: The position is cursed. Whoever Dumbledore hires is going to fail by the end of the year regardless of their skill. Why not make it someone Dumbledore despises? Oh, some kids' education will be stifled, sure, but...

Magical Britain hasn't had a decent Defense education in 20 years. It isn't just that particular year that is fucked, it's been fucked for two decades! They might have had decent professors like Lupin sprinkled in here or there, but none of them have lasted, so those lessons get forgotten rather than reinforced and expanded upon (this is likely one reason why having a single professor per subject is considered a good thing, while you have exceptions like Snape being an asshole for your whole 7-year education).

Dumbledore gets the double satisfaction of ousting a fraud by hiring Lockhart and inadvertently teaching the students that they should not automatically trust their authority figures, no matter how pretty or charismatic they may seem. Voldemort, after all, was a very charismatic manipulator, though not nearly vain in the same sense as Lockhart.

** Possibly. I would caveat that with the fact that though she appears more (barely) in canon, Susan Bones is nearly as successful in that regard. She is the generic Good-Ministry-Pairing for many stories. Think about how fanon it has become regarding her...assets shall we say.

So, we have major pairings for three of the four main houses most common in fanfiction:

- Gryffindor - Hermione/Ginny (waxes and wanes due to oversaturation)
- Slytherin - Daphne (and admittedly a LOT of SI girls)
- Hufflepuff - Susan

The odd man out is actually Ravenclaw, which by my estimation has the least OC characters created in the whole fandom (pairing or otherwise). Why is that? I can only speculate.

My guess is probably due to both the train-wreck relationship with Cho not exactly painting her (and possibly Michael Corner) in a good light. Another factor that, now I think of it, may be that Ravenclaw characters get the least 'page-time' out of all the houses in the books (actually checked this too).

Not to mention Ravenclaw actually seems to have the least broad characterization (everything related to being smart/knowledgeable). Compare that with Gryffindor - honorable, boisterous, brave, reckless, humorous, straight-forward - where you see both the good and bad of the house so clearly in the books.

*** It's probably the lack of an archetypal character.

Hufflepuff you've got Susan, Tonks, Hannah, and Cedric who all have various shades of friendship and loyalty above all.

Gryffindor I don't need to list because there's enough to show their traits which you list.

Slytherin have a few characters to show their factional, cunning, political, and loyal (in their own way) tendencies.

Ravenclaw, all you really have is Luna (who says she gets bullied by her classmates) who doesn't really fit into their archetype.

Most OCs are typically a character the author likes but with certain traits added or removed (most Gryffindor OCs seem to be a combination of Ginny's sportyness and Hermione's brains but without the former's impetuous personality or the latter's awful social manner)

** It really isn't that surprising, there are two major areas that Daphne fills that more well known characters do not.

​

The first is Romeo & Juliette. For good or bad, people love a good star-crossed lovers tale.

​

The second is a redemption arc. People like seeing the Dragon brought to the side of the light. Redemption through Love is also a very popular trope.

​

Now those make sense, but why not the more established characters? Well, it is because *Canon Draco is completely irredeemable*. He is comic book levels of evil. He displays pretty much no desirable qualities throughout the entire series. His 'official' redemption arc is essentially he is too cowardly to pull the trigger. He still believes the rhetoric and advocates genocide and ethnic cleansing. But he doesn't want to pull the trigger himself. This pretty much poisons any decent use of him for these categories, as well as most of the characters around him.

​

I mean, to do a decent redemption arc you gotta show questioning of beliefs and or the system they are in. Draco's character is literally hero worship of his father. If you want to redeem him, you gotta either start very young (and diverge from canon personality hard), or give it enough story development to be believable. The two stories that had the most believable Draco redemptions I can think of (Escape & Pertrification Proliferation) basically have him at the point where you can start imaging a redemption arc at the end of the fic, because you gotta put him through a lot to get there.

​

Side Slytherin characters that have screen time are almost as bad. You got Draco's muscle followers, you have the Inquisition Squad, you have the Slytherin organizing of public shaming in the 4th book. They are shown literally doing nothing redeemable in the book. (I mean, would it really be that hard to say one or two of Harry's years joined Dumbledore's Army? or at least considered it?). You have a bit more play here (I've seen a few good Greg redemption, seeing how he is being used). but the traits they have don't really make them good for pairings and/or being a central redemption figure.

​

Thus if you want to do one of these areas, it makes perfect sense authors would go to characters-in-name-only. I mean, the first thing you have to do is Slytherin less of a 'evil vs good' equation and more of a 'its complicated'. A lot of fics do that (and end up with the Light vs Dark vs Grey). It is just... a popular archtype that seems like it should fit the universe JK set up but it.. just does not.
