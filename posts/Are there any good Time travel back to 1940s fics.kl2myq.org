There are a lot of fics about time travel back to maradeur era, but i haven't seen any about going back to 1940s. Tom riddle is in Hogwarts, Grindevald is free, Dumbledore fails with both, I see dozens of ways to twist the plot. Any recommendations, please?


** In the Bleak Midwinter is excellent - still WIP though. Hermione goes back to retrieve an infant Tom Riddle when his mother dies in childbirth and takes him to his father. The amazing twist is that the muggle Riddle family ends up being as intelligent, devious, and as Slytherin as Tom himself.

*** Just realized it might be more like the 1930s than the 40s. But worth a read.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278]])

It's a Harry goes back in time and raises Tom fic, and definitely one of the better ones. Incomplete and ongoing, but the updates aren't regular. It's also one of the few that addresses the Grindelwald/Elder Wand situation in-depth, with a separate interpretation from the Fantastic Beasts movies. Overall, really well-written, really interesting plot, while also discussing the muggle side of WW2 in the background. It's tagged Tomarry, but it's gen so far.

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10402749/1/War-Paint][War Paint]] is one of my all time favorites but it's not a time travel story. I would highly recommend reading it though.

There's only one chapter out so far, and you don't actually see him go back in time yet, but there are a few extra chapters out on his discord, and so far its shaping up to be an interesting story.
