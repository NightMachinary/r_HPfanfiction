:END:
Hey everyone. I'm sitting at home bored out of my mind and trying to remember some stories I read years ago. That research is going pretty well for me on my own, but on this one I only recall a small fragment of the plot and I haven't had any luck:

I /think/ it was a Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass story but it could as well have been another pairing. In the story Harry's love interest receives a letter from her future self which obviously urges her to change things in a major way, but it was secretly written by future!Harry who used it for his own ends.

Before anyone asks, it's not TomHRichardson's current work but I was reminded of it when I read his story recently. What I'm looking for is at least several years old and I wouldn't be surprised if it were posted more than a decade ago.
