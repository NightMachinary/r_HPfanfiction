** Well, "Elsewhere but not Elsewhen" might qualify. Although since it involves Dimension Travel, there are two Voldemort's, and one definitely isn't pursuing a largely non-violent victory.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

** Benefits of Old Laws is the title of the story, but I can't recall the author or any other details well enough to find it again. In which Tom Riddle uses a legal dodge, an "I-was-possessed" equivalent to an insanity plea, to avoid responsibility for what he did as "Voldemort" and starts organising as a serious political movement. And also making sure Harry is properly cared for, for the first time, because reasons (which I recall being plausible in-story, albeit I can't recall much). I don't think it's complete.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** "Benefits of Old Laws" is probably the largest and most well known example.

Others I've enjoyed:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/30/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][A Well Groomed Mind]] - Harry has a mental break and realizes that Everything Was a Lie™ in 4th year. He eventually meets and is adopted by Voldemort. The story has an interesting take on Voldemort's faction as more rational and humane than Dumbledore's, with some great world building. Unfortunately it also has some poorly executed Dumbledore, Ron, and James bashing.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/17/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots][Lord Voldemort and the Intricate Plots]] - Voldemort is more cautious when dealing with the prophecy. Rather than kill baby Harry, he kidnaps him and begins looking for ways to overturn the prophecy without falling into the self-fullfilling trap. Meanwhile, he keeps up the political game while putting all his more overt plots on hold.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/28/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - Voldemort successfully steals both Harry and the Philosopher's Stone at the end of 1st year. He coerces Harry into becoming his apprentice and gradually takes on a mentor/father figure role. Meanwhile, he pursues his goals in a more rational way than the first war. Contains a Dumbledore with questionable intentions, but no overt bashing.

*** Currently reading Benefits of Old Laws, but the Dumbledore portrayed is getting bashed consistently. Guess it's a hazard of this kind of fic to give the other side legitimacy over Dumbledore. Thanks for the recs!

**** Dumbledore in that fic is different from what we see in the books, but he has good intentions even if misguided. To me it's a believable -and often chilling- take on what Dumbledore could have developed into if the curse in his hand affected him more.

For me, bashing is when a character has been written so badly that they are no longer well-rounded and have been reduced to their negative flaws. So a fic can have a malevolent or manipulative Dumbledore without me considering it bashing, as long as the character is well written.

** Limpieza de Sangre linkffn(11752324)

​

Harry becomes Voldemort's protege, and pseudo-ward, in an unconventional fashion. The story begins in the final moments of Goblet of Fire and continues through the Half-blood prince, so there are a few action oriented confrontations towards the latter section of the story. But the majority of the violence in the end is not precipitated by Voldemort and Riddle's involvement in said events is based around keeping Harry from harm.
