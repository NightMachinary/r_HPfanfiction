I really enjoyed the manipulative teen Tom Riddle (especially as he wasn't your run of the mill Tom Riddle) and how Harry ended up developing Stolckholm Syndrome, it was really well written and the progression was nice, though I doubt it's going to update anymore.

Specifically I like the idea of diary Tom Riddle (as a teen) returning, and not in the 'he's in Harry's head way' (I've read several of those already). So basically, a manipulative Tom Riddle and Harry Potter story. Actual manipulation, not just tossing around dangerous spells to force him into submission. I'd prefer no slash, since it's more interesting when Harry is younger but if the fic is well written and their ages are close I might try it out


** linkao3(15873207) "Ink" is a relatively short but good one. Diary Riddle kills Ginny, kidnaps Harry, and blackmails Dumbledore into letting him teach DADA. There's no romance at all, just Harry Stockholm'd by Tom after several years of being kidnapped. A dark fic, be warned.

linkffn(9702269) "Do Androids Dream" is also good. Diary Riddle meets pre-Hogwarts Harry and finds a way to become a real boy. Well-meaning manipulation, much lighter in tone than the previous fic. No romance, it's a Gen/friendship fic.

I'd rec more, but most of the well-written Harry-Tom fics I know are slash or have slashy undertones.

*** Thanks for the suggestions! I've heard good things about 'Do Androids Dream' but haven't gotten around to reading it yet. And I LOVE dark stories, so I'll check Ink as well!

Also I don't /mind/ TR/HP slash recommendations, I'm just a whole lot more picky; as long as Harry is at least 15 y/o and Tom isn't significantly older (so in his teens still, basically, even if it's just his physical appearance) I'm willing to try it out, so I'll take the recommendations if they're meeting that criteria. Undertones are fine as well. Just a lot of TR/HP I've read makes one of them out of character, or has Tom as a nuthead who tosses curses and crucios like no tomorrow (and has no real control). So the pairing is a bit tainted for me from those fics since I personally feel that teenage Tom Riddle was more...smart and politically/emotionally manipulative, rather than by pure fear.

**** I'm picky about Tom Riddle's character and writing in general, and I'm not into the slash/shipping stuff, but I'll read them anyway if the story is well-written and if they capture Riddle's character, flaws, and complexities. One of those things is differentiating teen Riddle from post-resurrection Voldemort. Young Riddle is willing to be manipulative and subtle, and worked as a shop clerk to keep the charade. Voldemort is an established Dark Lord with a reputation, several generations of followers, and a power base. He is free to act like a barefoot nutter and everyone is too afraid of him to tell him not to. On the inside, they're both ambitious, amoral, and unstable, but Riddle has more inhibitions and restraint keeping from going full NYAAAAAH~~~!

Some very good Diary Tom-Harry fics with slashy undertones, but no actual slash as the stories start with Harry as a kid:

linkao3(2296544) "Lithium" is probably my favorite Diary Tom and Harry fic. One of those fics which I feel captures Tom's character as manipulative, and gives him a believable growth arc when he finds out what his main soul is doing. I re-read the Tom POV chapters because his character voice and the writing is so good.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle is not the diary, but during his more lonesome periods the line between his consciousness and the yellowed pages of the timeless journal thins until the leather cover is his body and the black ink is his tongue. In spite of his own mind's hallucinations, where every rustle of the paper feels like the fluttering of his robes, Tom Riddle is but a memory with its own will, chained. A snippet from an old newspaper futilely rewriting its own articles, never to be read.
#+end_quote

Chapter 7 is a good sample of the writing style. The present tense is a bit weird, but Merlin's staff, that imagery.

--------------

linkao3(10890636) "Man in the Diary". Another well-written Diary Tom who kills Ginny and comes back to life. Harry transfers to Beauxbatons after the Board of Governors shuts Hogwarts down, while Tom stays in England and tries to fill the power vacuum left after Dumbledore is publicly disgraced. Explores the plot divergence in a realistic way.

***** I've gotta agree with your comments on Tom Riddle vs. Voldemort; by the time we meet him he is, honestly, complete and utterly insane. The charming and manipulative (and still unhinged, but not nearly so much as his future self) Tom Riddle is gone, replaced by the crazed and insane Voldemort. Whether that's a result of splitting his soul so many times (my personal headcanon), the Power going to his head, or something else, Voldemort is definitely no longer Tom Riddle. I feel like a lot of fics just...don't grasp that when they write Tom Riddle.

Thanks for the recs again, they both look very promising.

#+end_quote

In my experience with HP fanfic, a lot of fics don't grasp Tom Riddle's character in general.

Sometimes he's written as a flawless, hypercompetent Mini-Voldemort like in HPMOR. In shipping fics, he's a generic sexy bad guy who kills muggleborns but the wish fulfillment protagonist still loves him because he's got a hot face. Or tries to "turn him good" by the power of love, without understanding that this would never work on a realistic, in-character Tom Riddle.

The best Riddle fics give him believable strengths and flaws, highlight his delusional, hypocritical thinking, and his lack of self-awareness, and make him intelligent but not infallible. I feel that many fics go too far in either direction in making him too strong, or make him too weak, as an object of pity to be redeemed/reformed, instead of finding a good balance. Or they don't even try.

#+begin_quote
  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within. This simple act results in a ripple effect that tears the story as we know it apart, causing a descent into the madness that is the human psyche. Polish translation

  Harry pulls the diary from Ginny's cauldron after having seen Malfoy slip it inside. What begins as a friendship with a kind man trapped inside a book turns into a story of obsession as Tom Riddle seeks to protect his horcrux and Lord Voldemort returns to find his throne threatened by none other than himself.

Also I make my own offering: linkao3(13059681) which is in progress but actively updating. I haven't read it yet, but I'm very excited for when I do. (Also OP: it's got slash, sorry)

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.
