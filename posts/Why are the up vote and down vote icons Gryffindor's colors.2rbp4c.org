Just asking you know, it just seems a bit biased.

** Up vote should be the deathly Hallows, with the down vote being the dark mark

The shapes are pretty similar as well

** At least it's not upvote in Gryffindor colors, downvote in Slytherin colors!

** Not going to lie, the current subreddit style is just a cobbled together mess that I whipped up in like, a day.

I honestly don't even remember where I even got the crest. Oh well.

** Why not a symbol relating to "my immortal" for down (or up) vote?

*** A phoenix for upvote, the dark mark for downvote.

**** I was actually using an orangered Hogwarts seal for upvote and perrywinkle dark mark for downvote in a half-finished CSS overhaul.. it's kinda hard to make out the dark mark that small, though.

***** Given that you've been around a while, I'm sure you know most/all of this already, but just in case: Check out the text that appears when you up/downvote on [[/r/mindcrack]]. You could do something like that with "Expecto Patronum" for upvotes and "Avada Kedavra" for downvotes. Add that to something like [[/r/dogecoin]]'s upvote and you could have an actual patronus/spell fly around the page.
