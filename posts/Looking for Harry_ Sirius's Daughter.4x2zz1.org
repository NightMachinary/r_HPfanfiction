It could be with Sirius's daughter, or Bellatrix's daughter.

I expect it to be well written, engaging, and with minimal grammatical mistakes.


** Not yet but seriously hinted at. It's more Harry/Harem though. Sirius' daughter's clearly in the harem, however.

It's funny, you really can rec this fic almost everywhere. There's just an insane amount of tropes in the description alone :) It's the only one I can think of.

** Super lengthy story. Updates sporadically. Read almost a year ago. So I forget what the story is about & if there's cliches or not. Probably follows much or less canon plot in first two years.
