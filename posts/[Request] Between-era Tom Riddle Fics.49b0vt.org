By "between-era" I mean fics set /after/ Riddle's time in Hogwarts but /before/ he established himself as the leader of the Death Eaters. The Crown of Metis, linkffn(6939995), is a good example of that time period.

This is an extremely narrow subset without a doubt, so if any other stories of this period exist, I'm not picky about word counts.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC
