I posted earlier : [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ckvjn0/ron_and_hermione/]] and I asked why Ron and Hermione don't break apart, when Harry breaks off their friendship.. Someone commented saying that Ron and Hermione also move away from each other and don't become a couple.. Are there fics like these?


** I mean at least 3/4 of the fics fall into this category. Hard to find a fic where Ron and Hermione are actually together.

I haven't read this fic in years, and it has been on indefinite hiatus since 2008, but I remember really liking it. Then again, I read this was when I first started reading fanfiction so it might be shit.

Either way, this fic has Harry and Ron leave England after the big battle. They decide not to bring Hermione along with them. Fair bit of warning, the story ends right before a big, dramatic confrontation so be prepared to get blue-balled.

*** Indefinite Hiatus means abandoned, especially if it's been 11 years, and the author has been inactive since 2011.
