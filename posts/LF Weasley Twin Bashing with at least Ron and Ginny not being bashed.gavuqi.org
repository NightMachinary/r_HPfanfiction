** I have literally never seen a fic where the Twins get bashed, but not the other prominent Weasleys.

There's a few Slytherin!Harry fics where the Twins are pretty much to Harry as the Marauders are to Snape, but in all of those fics Ron and Ginny hate Harry just as much.

** In [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning of One by Sovran]] has Hinny, so Ginny is most prominently NOT bashed, Ron is a good Hufflepuf-like firmly supporting them all the time, but the rest of the family ... oh well.

[[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129977][In the Heat of the Night by Brennus]] has Ginny fighting her whole family, it is BTW really sweet story.
