I was reading “Harry Potter and The Dark Lord's Equal by ACI100” and really liked the idea of Dean as a good friend of Harry's, so are there any other good stories with Dean as a friend?


** "The Perils of Innocence" fits that.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** He's a prominent character in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) after being the first to see Harry at King's Cross. Most of the canon challenges are brushed aside in this fic; it's about Harry's schooling, with Tom Riddle being a minor pest.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
