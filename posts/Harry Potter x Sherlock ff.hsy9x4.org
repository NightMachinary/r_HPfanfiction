Moriarty as Harry in Slytherin: Think about the heart attack everyone would get. From Harry in Slytherin alone and THEN actually meeting Moriarty. On the other side: Voldemort would be dead before he really came back to life. And just fucking imagine: Jim Moriarty praised as the saviour of the wizarding world and totally fed up about how every single move of his is watched, supervised and judged. He can't get a single moment for him alone and is therefore incapable of plotting the doom of this goldfish world.

Sherlock as Ron in Ravenclaw: because there are far too few stories with a Ravenclaw Ron and the Weasley could show Sherlock how to act like a human even more. And anyway, they would be in for a shock since no Weasley was in a different house than Gryffindor for generations.

Mycroft as Dudley with magic in Slytherin: He can help Jim to survive the Dursleys. Maybe takes him to the police when they are still young or run away with him should the Dursley begin to abuse him too because of his magic or he takes Jim to an orphanage before they know he is a Muggleborn and has to suffer alone. And imagine the outrage of a Muggleborn in Slytherin.

John as Draco in Gryffindor: The whole school and Lucius would probably get a heart attack and disown him in private. John could be a bridge to the other children in Slytherin with Jim and Mycroft and save them if they don't want to become a death eater. And he could later be a spy if Lucius doesn't disown him. Like Snape.

That year would be a single heart attack for the entire school.
