:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a story that is a different kind of time travel story. Harry is sent in the past a few hundred years, 300+. He ends up in France and learns in Beauxbatons. That will be dealt with very briefly in only 1 or 2 chapters. He builds a house (wards and all) earns money and has an account with gringotts France. The king sends people out to recruit fora war. But Harry doesn't feel like it, his goal all the time is to find a way back into the future. So he experiments, but then he gives it up and puts himself in a stasis. He then wakes up in the present, using Snap's life dept to lure Dumbledore into a trap. The story has its funny moments and Flamel later helps him.


** I don't remember the exact fic, but I know it's a Star Wars crossover. He goes through the veil, and keeps cloning himself, because he ends up way in the past.
