I'm writing a scene where Harry asks Olivander for a particular type of wand. See below.

​

“May I suggest an option, Mr. Ollivander?” Harry inquired politely. Several cases were not on the table with little match with Harry.

“Sure, Sure!” Ollivander said with excitement. It seems Ollivander liked tricky customers. Harry imagined it gave him a sense of novelty when everything was somewhat predictable.

“Do you have a wand with Elder wood?”

Ollivander jerked and swiveled his head around to look intensely at Harry.

“The connection between a wand and a wizard is singular, Mr. Potter. I always aim a bottom up approach where the wood and wand core give me an indication of a wizard natural inclination. Nonetheless, presenting a wand with Elder wood would be the very last option as you know, there is a famous saying, ``Wand of Elder, never prosper.”

“You're missing the last part.” Harry replied, searching his memory.

“Wand of Elder, never prosper. Core of Thestral, always desert. *Thestral Elder when together* ..."

​

I don't know how to effectively end that rhyme. Been thinking about it for a day. Can you help me finish this?


** *Thestral Elder when together* fuck you it's my damn money

Rhymes as much as Thestral and Desert do.

Wand of Elder, never prosper. Core of Thestral, *nothing special.* Thestral Elder *in a pair, to enemies will bring dispair* .

*** I like this, but can I suggest a slight change to improve the rhythm? “To your foes will bring despair” matches the syllable count better

** Thestral Elder when together...

For fucks sake. Olivander, for the first time since his family started making wands in 200bc, ran screaming.

Away from all the screaming and muder in Diagon Alley.

That image, that image, of Harry Potter, wielding that wand, that deadly half-finished wand, knee deep in the dead, laughing, while he forced Lucius Malfoy to eat his son...

Ollivander threw up. Again.

What was it his father had said?

*Thestral Elder when together...*

*Run for your everliving life you motherfucking fool!*

Of all the peices of wandlore to forget...

** Honestly, I don't think you have a very good rhyme/ saying to start with. It doesn't roll off the tongue and it just doesn't sound quite right. Even just “Wand of Elder, Never Prosper” isn't catchy.

*** Old poems often don't rhyme. It's more about the rythm of the lyricisms, not the words themselves. For instance,

"At the blue moon howling

To darkness did he fall

In silence and in death

May night forever hail"

only has a single rhyme, and it's not even a good one. It's still poetry, just not modern poetry. Conversely,

"At the blue moon howling

To darkness did he fall

Seeing but not believing

The shadow's endless call"

Rhymes much more truly in the ABAB sceme. Older poetry was a style of writing epics, unlike modern poetry, which encapsulates shorter stories and/or small passages that need to rhyme.

**** You've highlighted an important point. The poem does not need to rhyme like that. But it would be great if the last word could.

** Wand of Elder, never prosper.

Core of Thestral, always improper.

But thestral elder when together?

Most powerful wizards cannot tether.

--------------

I think you need to change the word in the second part to rhyme with the first to make it sound better. Not bc it needs to rhyme, but with such a short poem, it flows better with a rhyme.
