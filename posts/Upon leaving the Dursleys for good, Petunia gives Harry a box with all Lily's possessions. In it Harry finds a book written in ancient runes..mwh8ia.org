Excited that this might hold the secret to immense power that may help him defeat Voldemort, Harry asks Hermione to translate it for him.

Turns out they are just shitty stories she wrote she was thirteen in which she ships Snape with either James or Sirius or both of them.


** Fantastic!

What do you think snapes reaction would be like if Harry handed them to Snape and just walked off saying. “My mother wrote about you a lot.”

** "Again.. Legilimens!”

Images flicked before him like a film, springing from image to image. Snape had recently become aware of the existence of his mother's diary and had been actively targeting the memory. His progress in occlumency had skyrocketed since Snape started focusing his attention on the diary, much to the professors annoyance. But it took only so long before Snape managed to reach the content of the diary Harry had buried in the back of his head.

He was fourteen, reading his mother's diary, the words mpreg, stag!James and Snape flashed before his eyes.

** Despite having conquered the country, the great Lord Voldemort had been on edge recently and all his followers knew that a single sound or movement could set him off, yet none knew why. Only Nagini, ever loyal, held the secret of the Dark Lords innability to sleep. He would speak to her after waking from the nightmares, at first only vague shadows and strange sounds, but now the horrors were unending and the dead had returned to taunt him, giving him visions of undiluted insanity. Even Severus, whom had been struck down after the dreamless sleep potion failed, had come to taunt him. And all the while that redhead would sit beside him, slowly speaking of what was happening before them, as though it were a story.

It would never be discovered as to why Lord Voldemort at the peak of his power slaughtered his followers, collected his means of immortality and brought them before the child of the red demon begging for death, but it was granted to him.

Tom Marvolo Riddle finally found peace in a white room, until a womans voice came from behind him.
