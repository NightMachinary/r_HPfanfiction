***** Luna offers to assist in collecting mongooses...mongeese... (I checked, it is mongooses).

Ginnymort "accepts" and bides time to look for opportunity to betray Luna to Blinky the Basilisk.

Also, Blinky is the most hilarious name for a Basilisk ever.

******* Unfortunately, now Luna is convinced to try and make friends with the Basilisk.

It refuses to leave the Chamber unless Luna is neutralized.

Ginnymort has two new goals: Contain Luna somewhere so the Basilisk can attack mudbloods; Find something to get rid of the migraine Luna gave her.
