*** I mean, if you go with the "Ron has ADHD, and that's why he's good at chess and has flashes of brilliance, but otherwise comes off like a berk", interpretation of the character, so did Ron Weasley.

**** This would make for a good Ron bashing fic feature. It turns out that both he and Draco are high functioning autistic and have to go to remedial everything.

** A long time ago I read a long fic on schnoogle about a student with disability (I think it was spina bifida or cerebral palsy or something along those lines), she had an enchanted knife and Snape took it away from her, saying it was an unfair advantage. I never finished reading it (found the pace boring), but the writing was good. I wonder whether it is saved anywhere else.

** Young Remus was a special needs kid whose accommodations included the whomping willow, the shrieking shack, and, I assume, extended deadlines on assignments due around the full moon. He was a special case, though, as kids with his disability weren't usually allowed at Hogwarts. Their acceptance and accommodations at Hogwarts apparently depend on the whim of the headmaster.

** Yes please remind!me! :) This would be so nice and wholesome yes it would!!! I always imagine Hogwarts being super disability accommodating, cause with magic you can do so much good stuff. :) Like instead of wheelchairs you can have hover chairs so stairs don't matter and they can glide over rough terrain. And for like my autism I would LOVE to wear like total magic noise cancelling enchanted earmuffs when I walk the halls with all the echoes and ghosts and clanging armor and other students talking. :) And like a deaf person could get a magic stone that makes floating words in the air when people talk and stuff, magic auto translate! Like chat bubbles but real life. :)

And also blind students could have either schoolbooks auto converted into braille, or they could just have like a text to speech thing where they put a finger on the page and it reads it! Or since they have smart talking sapient paintings and mirrors already, it should be easy to get a reader assistant entity! And the assistant entity could also help them to navigate Hogwarts by telling them where to go and stuff if they want to on their own. :)

These are just some ideas for my super nice Hogwarts. :) They would let me go if it was real!!! And if I ever have a meltdown I can go to the Room of Requirement and it can be full of animated stuffed animals and nice pillows and blue colors and also lots of books I love to read and de-stress.

******* the wizarding world is backwards. but for all we know alot of stuff muggles suffer from does not effect wizards

broken legs, we just regrow bones phyiscal disablites we have potions for that

hell we know kids use accidental magic, so maybe severe disabilities never happen because accidental magic fixes them.

wizards are basically superhumans anyway
