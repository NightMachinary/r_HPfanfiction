** [[http://www.helenish.net/closeenough.shtml][Close Enough]]

"NC-17. Summary: “The war had given them all new and unexpected skills: Neville had learned how to break a man's arm in three places, and Draco had learned kindness, and Ron, himself, had learned not to take unconsidered action. Almost.”

Awkward relationship, frustrated!sex, unrequited (not really) crushes, and very hot sex. Very good writing.

[[http://community.livejournal.com/harry_and_ron/818059.html]["The Thrill of the Chase and Other Illuminating Concepts,"]] and its sequels. It's my favourite. It's brilliant, it's funny, it has explicit stick figure drawings.

"It's a comedy so the style reflects the genre: light, a bit silly (in places a bit over the top but still not annoying). Harry realised he's in love with his best friend. Now his task is to seduce him, only, as Hermione said, he has an emotional range of a teaspoon, so Harry must be really blunt. But Harry isn't the best specialist in the matters of heart, so he makes PLANS and draws their stages in stick-figure porn. He also has brain-Hermione and brain-Ginny who give him advice and urge him on and whom he argues with. Amusing and entertaining!"

Aaaand the majority on this list: [[http://painless-j.net/blog/2007/10/01/hp-recs-harryron]] (these two are included there)

**** You're welcome! I'm frankly astounded by the lack of popularity this pairing has - is the bromance just TOO strong to leave room for some slash? It's very good when written well though.
