Quite bored of the typcial main characters, especially hermione (she is so fleshed out by rowling almost all hermiones read the same due to it, which imo makes her the most boring character alongside ron in fanfiction - even if she was my favorite in the real books).

So are there any good secondary character/secondary character or oc?

Must not contain slash (cant stand to read it, sue me, be it male or femslash) and be 150k words+.

So please do present me with your favorites :).

Thanks in advance.

** These are the only decent three I can think of, though one is a little shy of 150k. Linkffn(1724293) and linkffn(3688609) and linkffn(2712711)

  Remus manages to rob Tonks of her Christmas spirit, but helping her to get it back proves the catalyst for something a tad more lasting than a kiss under the mistletoe. RemusTonks romance through OOTP and HBP. Started before DH.

** My personal non-popular favourite, linkffn(Witchcraft by a Picture). Tom Riddle/OC/Alphard Black triangle that's a super interesting development of Tom Riddle in his youth. Definitely not your usual characters, got romance, and it's pretty long.

  If you think that Hogwarts was squeaky clean in the 1940's, think again. Sex, drugs, violence, love, jealousy, and a bit of murder... Welcome to Hogwarts! Tom Riddle/OC, Alphard Black/OC, OC/OC. Rated M

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate]] by padfoot4ever. Has a sequel(also complete), is Rose/Scorpius, and is my favorite next-gen fic. Definitely recommend it. It skims just under your limit at 145k words, but the sequel is also 142k.

** I feel like Alexandra Quick is the obvious answer to this if you haven't read it already. Takes place in US well after the British war with Voldemort is over. Tone wise, think fifth book and up.

Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is pretty good, and the golden trio are very much secondary characters, but the tone is pretty silly throughout.
