**** My fic starts with Harry at 31. Trying to line up the MCU timeline with Harry Potter was a mission considering there's a lot of conflicting information on when certain events happen.

Stargon1's fic seems to start with Harry at around 24/25.

  Harry Potter has had many titles in his life: Boy-Who-Lived, Auror, Master of the Mystic Arts. But after an assignment in the United States he gains one more, possibly the most important one yet. Avenger. MCU and other Marvel elements. Pairing undecided. No Slash.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.
