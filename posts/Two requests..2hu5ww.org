I'm looking for any fics with Harry on the dark side of the war. Voldemorts heir, death eater Harry, or just an advocate. He opposes the ideals of the light and is relatively skilled or powerful. (I've read Prince of the Dark Kingdom, which is a very popular rec on this subreddit) The other one is any Harry in Azkaban fics. I've taken a liking to those. Preferably no slash if possible.
