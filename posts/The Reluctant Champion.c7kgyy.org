Just finished reading The Reluctant Champion linkffn(The Reluctant Champion) by theunrealinsomniac and I was wondering what others thought of it. Also, do you know if the sequel is still being updated?


** I quite enjoy the story, especially because it's a Haphne story without the usual ice queen trope. The characters and their interactions were pretty much all unique and interesting which is rare for fanfiction.

My two biggest complaints are that Harry and Daphne finally get together off-screen which felt really disjointed. Also, maybe its the curse of knowledge, but Harry and James spending the entire year being suspicious of Moody but not doing anything about it idiot-ball style was irritating.

I also got pretty tired of the Neville and Harry are gay jokes. I get that it's probably pretty common for kids of that age but it didn't sit right with me.

No idea if the sequel is still being updated, but I hope so.

** I am split about this fic. From one side, I do enjoy some of the ideas like Harry having a parent alive, or a non Ice Queen Daphne. From the other, I find this Harry totally unlikable. From what I remember of the fic, he cant say 2 sentences without cursing, and his interactions with other character are ... strange (like how he go get a head from a french girl while the main ship is ready to sail, or his Incredible reaction when he sees his father with a woman )

** I've always quite liked this story. The characters are really well done. Harry in particular seems realistic for someone who's grown up in the wizarding world, fully cognisant of his role in defeating Voldemort.

I agree this makes him less likeable than in canon but I don't think it makes him totally unlikable. He's a teenage boy with an oversized ego and everything he does has to be seen in that context.

Some things, like the big fight between James, Sirius and Remus felt forced but in general it's a good story and I enjoyed it.

The sequel is being updated very, very occasionally. It's been on my alerts list since it started and I'd say about a chapter per year is par for the course.
