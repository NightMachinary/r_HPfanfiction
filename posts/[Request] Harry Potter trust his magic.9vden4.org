Harry trust in his magic as it has always been there in his time of need, he becomes more careless, more daring as his magic always catches him. Fanfics plz


** I actually remember one kind of like this. Harry's magic is wild, nearly out of control / sentient, but it also looked after him mostly. He does a lot of occlumency to try and get ahold of it, ends up creating a mental construct to guard his mind inspired by Riddle's diary. Petegrew nearly starves him to death at one point I think, but I really can't remember much else.

Now that I'm saying this though I don't think it was complete at the time and I really want to go back and read more. I wish I could find what it was called.

**** I'm hoping someone will recognize it by my description so I can read it again. Most likely on ffn since I rarely go anywhere else, but I just can't remember its name to save my life.

***** You are thinking of the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/murkybluematter][Pureblood Pretense series]]. Most of the events you describe happen (or are revealed) in the third book: The Ambiguous Artifice.

****** Really? That's so odd. I remember the Pureblood Pretense, but nothing about wild magic and mental constructs. Just potioneering and social maneuvering. Clearly I haven't read it in quite some time because it's separated in to two completely different fics in my head.

I skipped to a random chapter in the third book though and you are without a doubt correct. Well, I know what I'm reading this weekend.
