Obviously it's not a requirement, but if anyone on here is interested in reading a Lucius/Narcissa oneshot, it's right [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13747275/1/To-Speak-Of-My-Devotion][here]].

All fanfiction authors are my heroes, honestly. Except that lady that rewrote the HP series to be ultra religious.


** Good job! Great writing! How about you expand this into a full fledged work? You clearly have the skills for that! The quality is much better than most shit writers I read these days! If you could write the description so well and keep it up, it is fully possible to get to the top 100 fics!

*** Oh my God, you really think so?? That's the greatest news I've heard all day! I am a couple chapters deep into a new fanfiction for Draco and Luna, and I think I just might continue with both of these couples. There's so much wiggle room with Lucius and Narcissa, and I fully believe that their relationship is like Gomez and Morticia, if a little closer towards the Dark Arts.

** That was fantastic! Ive never read a Lucius & Narcissa centered story, and you did quite amazing for it to be my first one. The two of them give off very strong Gomez & Morticia vibes in this one shot and I really, really love that dynamic. Please consider continuing with your writing, and maybe making a full fledged story around them!

*** I adore you. Thank you so much! I've got a Druna longfic in progress and am hoping to publish that by the end of the month. I'm going to see about doing another Lucissa down the line but all the feedback is making me feel so empowered!

** Just letting you know, the nape of the neck is at the back, so unless Narcissa has a neck that's 3 feet long, you may want to change it to his throat

** This. Was. Awesome.

Like, I've never published one, although I am thinking about it, but I've binge read sooo many fanfics, and this shows so much experience with...everything!

Lucissa is an underused ship, and it's lovely to see them getting some appreciation by a talented author! MORE

*** Comments like yours are like heroine to me. I love and adore you and since you're like the fourth person to ask me for more Lucissa, I guess I HAVE to now. Challenge accepted!
