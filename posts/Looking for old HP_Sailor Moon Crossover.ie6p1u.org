:END:
Howdy!

I hope someone might be able to help me as I have been searching for days now. Any help would be appreciated! Sadly I cannot remember the fic name or author name, but I will include key points I recall.

- Harry is raised by Usagi/Serenity.
- Harry still went to Hogwarts.
- Usagi/Serenity either wasn't reincarnated with the other scouts or awoke far earlier.
- Had rebuilt Silver Millennium early on Earth.
- Serenity eventually brought other scouts into the fold.
- I recall at one point there was an attack on Earth and Harry went full blown unleash the power of the moon in the Great Hall of Hogwarts.

Thanks for any help you can provide.
