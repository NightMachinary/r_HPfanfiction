Such as, on Animagus transformations?

What of the plausibility of becoming one young, like the Marauders did?

What about a young witch or wizard, who unwittingly uses spontaneous accidental magic when there is a severe enough threat to their life, that they delve into the dangerous territory of transforming without the months/years of preparation in order to be able to return to their human and not be lost to the magic and animal?

Do you think it possible, or impossible?

I see so many fanfics featuring animagus transformations, but not nearly enough that actually have thought put into them; most have the consequences be damned, making the characters(mostly Harry) into their own overpowered Mary Sue who instantly masters it and is much like a new Merlin. SMH.

I'd love to hear about any you know of where it's the opposite, where he or anyone else, actually takes it Siriusly. (Much like the Marauders did for Remus)

Please, be as detailed as you'd like in your thoughts and opinions. I'd love to see all your views on the Animagus subject. It's actually the one bit of magic that's always fascinated me since we were introduced to it in the HP world. :)


** I have some thoughts. I'm not sure these are the ones you are looking for but I'm willing to give it a go. Personally, I have read way too many fics that have Harry, Hermione, someone...becoming an Animagus quite easily, quickly and without struggle. I don't feel like that is accurate or believable. Animagus training is supposed to be regulated by the Ministry so that in case of an accident there is someone who knows what your Animagus is and can act accordingly if you got 'stuck' or became partially transformed, it could handled by professionals. Why would those rules be in place if it was easy? In the case of the Marauders, they started their training quite young and only had one another to help fix them if they became stuck. (Can't you see James with antlers stuck on his head that he couldn't remove or Peter with a tail that he had to keep hidden in his pants? Lol) In all fairness, they were supposed to be exceptionally bright but children, students, make mistakes. Hermione, for example, was bright for her age but she made mistakes. She struggled sometimes with the application process more than she did with theory. I cannot see her not struggling with it. What would have been wonderful, was if Sirus would have taught our Golden Trio how to become Animgi while he was still alive. Would have helped immensely while they were on the run. But alas, earwax.

** I like to think that Magic is inherently flexible, allowing the user multiple ways to achieve the same result.

As such there must also be multiple ways of achieving the animagus transformation. The canon method is likely the method that had the highest chance of success with the fewest possible negative side effects and if done really well, with the chance of some advantages too (say gaining improved senses from your form). That this method is so stringent in its requirements (from what I remember anyway) is likely something the ministry likes too.

Other methods could have limitations or effects that more sanctioned options don't have. For example, maybe one could take a potion to force the transformation. With the disadvantages being higher risk, or locking out the chance of being a multiple animagus or perhaps even being able to choose a form.

Accidental animagery is also something that should be possible, but it also comes with the inherent issue of being accidental. Someone who accidentally transforms likely doesn't know how to transform back. So they might be stuck like that until they find someone to turn them back. Not to mention that an accidental transformation will likely cause varied and unpredictable side effects both positive and negative.

*** THANK YOU, to that last part. I've been having a discussion with a friend about the accidental Animagus transformations. I myself thought it would be possible, because, I mean, look at Harry at 10 years old and apparating. He thought otherwise. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I've been thinking of using the accidental method in a future fic of mine with the negative and positive effects from it, such as a bleed over effect and lasting changes. But definitely wanted to get opinions on it. Thank you. üò¨

** I hate when the reasoning for Harry's animagus form boils down to it looking cool. (Down with panthers!) To me, it seems kind of obvious that he'd turn into a grim like Sirius, because he's very similar to Sirius. He wouldn't have the Prongs animagus form, because Prongs is a protector to him, and that's why he appears as a patronus. Instead he'd be a big fluffy dog.
