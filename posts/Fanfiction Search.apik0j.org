Hello,

​

I am searching for a dramione fanfic, it is post war, a lot of PTSD ideas. Hermione has a bookshop and she lives on the second floor of that building. Draco wants to apologize to her and sits in the bar in front of the shop for a long time, until she goes and talks to him. I can't seem to find it anywhere.

​

Thanks in advance!


** That's The Die by Colubrina. It was taken down, and I don't believe the author shares it.
