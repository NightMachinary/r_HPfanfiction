** I just read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440][Unfogging the Future]] and it's amazing.

#+begin_quote
  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."
#+end_quote

It gave me a lot of inspiration for a Lavender POV of my own (something I never thought I'd write!) and, ugh this fic is just so incredibly well written in a minimalist sort of way that made me desperate for more!

This excerpt from the beginning shows such a a fantastic grasp of Lavender's character:

#+begin_quote
  Lavender stands in the middle of the street, modern school robes charred and ripped and stained with blood and dirt. Her right pocket holds her wand, two galleons, seven sickles and a knut. Her left, a half-used bar of pink lipstick and a hair tie.

  It doesn't take a genius to guess that she's in trouble.

  She walks ahead, because no one ever fixed anything by standing dumbfounded while looking at their pockets.
#+end_quote

and her shell shocked assessment of her 1940s situation is on point:

#+begin_quote
  Tight-waist robes and victory rolls -- not the worst decade to live in.
#+end_quote

Lavender is /cool/ in this messed up, brittle way that I adore. Every relationship is so complex and unhealthy it can't help but feel horrifically /real/. Lavender's philosophy seems very "one step forward because there's just a gaping pit behind me." There's a sense of urgency that follows her in this story that you never understand fully until the end.

**** There is an e rated scene further into the fic, and some violence (deaths) but I think it's quite well written.

The central mystery Lavender encounters surrounds a murder (as well as surviving in the 40s).

The E scene is quite well done- If it makes sense Lavender is incredibly “in character” about it and the author managed their varying levels of power in the relationship in a well thought out, dynamic way.

The story works quite well because Lavender begins (along with the reader) feeling like we know enough to have the advantage, before it's slowly laid out how this is not the case. So, I was always trying to keep up with everything that was happening, and that gave real stakes.

Read: the sex scene was hot and there wasn't anything super weird

** Bad Education by magicspacehole

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27049720/chapters/66040888]]

/What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)/

It has my favorite depiction of Tom Riddle I've seen so far.

Despite him being very competent the situation he is in causes him to struggle and seeing him trying to find a way to figure things out is fun and compelling in the second half. And seeing him struggle to handle children is hilarious in the first half.

I like how the story humanizes him and makes him relatable and at times sympathetic without making him innocent. The rest of the supporting cast is also well done and it was alot of fun seeing Tom bounce of them and work with them. Despite his intelligence he couldn't do everything on his own and they were very relevant to the plot in the second half which I also really appreciated.

There is no romance with Tom ( at least not so far it is not complete) which i actually kind of appreciated. I don't hate the idea of Tom Riddle + romance but i don't see him very invested in romance and I usually don't across many Tom Riddle centric things where he wasn't romantically motivated in anyway. So it was a nice change.

** Honey and Magic (by White Squirrel and other co-writers): [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25601596/chapters/62138278]]

A very cute what if Matilda went to Hogwarts fic. Matilda was very in character, she is the perfect Hufflepuff with just a touch of mischief. Highly recommend if you enjoyed the movie or the book Matilda as a child (or as an adult for that matter).

Hermione Grangers Crammer for Delinquents on the Run by waspabi: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]]

This fic had the most realistic British teenagers I've ever read in a Harry Potter fic. An interesting take on what if Harry never got his Hogwarts letter.

Swung by Serafim by flamethrower: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9821300/chapters/22052543]]

A Severus Snape POV canon divergence, where Harry and Ron are obliviated by Lockhart at the end of year two. A long fic, but worth it for all of the changes that come after the war.

** I've been rereading linkffn(Stepping Back). It wasn't as good as I remembered it being, but the last time I read it was years ago.

I liked how the Blacks weren't completely redeemed, and even Arcturus (who is an important character) still believes in blood purity, but works against Voldemort because Harry tells him how much damage he did to purebloods to fulfill his own goals. I liked that Dumbledore wasn't portrayed as Manipulative, like I expected. He was more of a good person with control issues.

That being said, I lost interest very quickly. A lot it just dragged on. Harry seems overpowered, even for being trained by Unspeakables, and Harry/Bellatrix isn't my favourite pairing. I don't like the way Voldemort is portrayed. He seems like a halfway competent villain at the start whose followers mess stuff up for him, then just becomes... useless? There's a better word for that, but nothing comes to mind.

I haven't finished it yet, so something might change, but I'm in the last chapter before the epilogue so that doesn't seem likely.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** I've been rereading the "Tea Time" series by Elizablue on Ao3. I've finished the first fic "Put Your Guns Away, It's Tea Time", so I'm currently on the second much longer fic linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474/chapters/18003613]]).

It picks up right where the first one left off, and I love the characterization of all of the characters post-Cursed Child. They aren't suddenly perfect, but it gives the Potters and Weasleys much more characterization, with the added bonus of them trying to do better by Albus and Scorpius.

I'm not big on canon Hinny (or any Harry ship really), but I love how it's done here, feeling very realistic and in-character. They have a balanced dynamic that I absolutely adore, and the rest of the Weasleys are done in very much the same way, slightly infuriating flaws and all.

I forgot how much I enjoyed hearing about Ginny punching Rita Skeeter in the face, and any OC's (such as Nora) and characters without much canon personality (like Audrey) are given enough to be enjoyable without being spotlight stealers in the slightest. Scorpius and Albus's relationship (it's a Scorbus fic) is slightly awkward but happy, and it's given just the right amount of focus to be very enjoyable but not overbearing. James, Lily and Rose are amazing, and I appreciate that the fic tackles early marriage/pregnancy (James and Nora are both 17) by showing how it should be handled: carefully, but not with a large amount of stigma, as well as other difficult topics.

Ginny and Draco's newly-formed friendship is amazing despite the little focus it gets, and god do you want to punch Rita Skeeter in the face by the end of the second chapter (though thankfully, Ginny does it for us). I love how the author points out the flaws in the Wizarding World as well (the house cup system and outdated laws for example), and how certain people exploit those while trying to change them.

I could gush on and on about this fic and series, but in the end, I highly recommend it for Cursed Child fans and haters alike.

  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging-- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there-- especially when you've got three mischievous children and a handful of students who can't seem to do more than ogle at you.

*** This series is golden!! My favorite ever, possibly, especially the second installation. A lot of the concepts used aren't things I liked before I read it (including Cursed Child itself), but I found myself adoring everything in It's Teatime to the extent that I'm a fan even outside the series. I really disliked CC when it came out and was only able to appreciate its redeeming qualities after It's Teatime got me invested in the characters. It also really sold me on Ginny. I liked her in the books but didn't feel like I knew her that intimately.

A lot of the characterizations of James and Lily (and other members of the family who have almost no canon personalities) now feel so canon to me that I have to remind myself not to rip off ellizablue when I write them. I was genuinely wary of writing Lily for a bit because, like, Lily should be hanging out with dragons and dating Caden, because that's what Lily does. It's very cool that she pulled something off where the initial draw for most fans was the Scorpius/Albus relationship, yet most people are more intrigued by the relationships with original characters by the end.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25288345][We'll Sing Like Birds in the Cage]], Gen. It's a domestic kind of story about the Snape family where Minerva shows up and saves Eileen and Severus during one of Tobias's rages.

What I like about it is the way it sort of is just about life on Spinner's End and being a poor family in the sixties. While a lot of the problems are small in the story, ironing, holes in Severus's shoes, it all ties back to the big problem of Tobias and the domineering hold he has on his family. The end I think I was good. Eileen and Severus are not necessarily rescued in it, but it still leaves things on a hopeful note that things are improved.

** I've been reading Of A Linear Circle. On part IV now. It's really /dragging the fuck on/. Does the author really need to pack so much into every single day these characters experience????? It's so obnoxious. I don't like the main romantic pairing, nor how the second romantic pairing appeared out of fucking nowhere. Part III, set back in time, was nice and I wish I'd read it as a stand alone fic and just skipped the other parts. I'm considering quitting now that they're doing the “titled nobility supported by the Queen” /bullshit/.

** *The Sultan and Scheherazade are one* The final chapter of this Gellert centric fic posted. The ending matched the fic to a T.

/What I liked/: Both Albus and Gellert are written sympathetically. Gellert taking Voldemort under his wing. Ariana and Flamel playing vital roles in the tragic love story of Albus and Gellert. Literature references used to great effect. Spanish Flu being used as a plot device. Beautiful fic. 10/10.

** I've been on a weird streak of exploring questionable fics that I haven't seen recc'd here. It's not to say they've never been recommended here before, I just kind of googled fic topics, said a prayer, and jumped in. It was... mostly awful.

I'm not exactly saying I recommend these fics, but they /are/ what I've been reading. 😅

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unforgivable Tournament by questionablequotation)

This one wasn't too bad. I found it quite entertaining! It's just a "what if", I'd call it a borderline crackfic except that it isn't all whacky and zany like you'd usually expect from a crackfic. It's almost anticlimactic, but in an entertaining and somewhat satisfying way because it's disappointing to all of the other characters in the fic and I'm petty like that.

The next one I came across was linkffn(Conspiracy by Maethoriel Raina)

Again, I'm not sure I'd recommend it, but it was entertaining regardless of the fact that I didn't love it. I was in the mood for a good bashing fic and I didn't care who got bashed. Maybe I was feeling cranky, I don't really recall, but it was entertaining to see what a smart and vindictive Harry would do. Hated the ending. I had my suspicions of who the mystery person was that Harry was holding on to, and I was absolutely disappointed to learn that I was correct. I don't know why. I just didn't like that little tidbit.

There was also linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5) which actually may have been something I saw recommended on here a few days ago, I can't remember, but I did actually enjoy this one. It's got a nice length to it, it's just full of intrigue and darkness, and the entire system of brainwashing was nicely done. Much dystopia, very wow.

** Just read Oblivion by Slide linkffn(10947156).

It's the completion of a trilogy featuring Albus (Potter), Scorpius and Rose which itself loosely follows on from a collection of books about a group of Slytherin friends who are at school at the same time as Harry et al.

During the course of the series while they battle bad guys, they are increasingly drawn to question their own decisions and ethics. Occasionally this all gets a bit too inward looking as seemingly every character wrestles their own demons alternating with more concrete threats, but the dialog is snappy, the OCs are solid and if you are a fan of a long read this is a great series to lose yourself in.

Start with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2233473/1/Latet-Anguis-In-Herba][L]]atet Anguis In Herba linkffn(2233473) which is the first of the earlier generation books and emerge a few weeks later at Oblivion.

Just writing this down I found that there is a sequel and I missed one of the first series. Back down the rabbit hole for a week.

** LOTS OF RECS BELOW!!!

1) WIP I've been following that have recently been updated:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29356095][29356095]]) Either must die at the hand of the other by Metalomagnetic.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011][24476011]]) Ouroboros by Metalomagnetic.

​

2) Voldemort wins AUs / Tom as MoM:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24262186][24262186]]) Love in the Dark by ShoulderTallAbyss:

similar vibes to No Glory but quite different, Voldemort legilimizes Harry in the Forbidden Forest and learns he is horcrux, possessiveness becomes Voldy's middle name. Harry does manage to escape once, so good for him. I thought the interactions between the DEs and Harry were quite entertaining.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30540372][30540372]]) Reporting for Duty by LissiaMoonstone

Features: Harry as a Minister Tom Riddle's office assistant and cute banter, eventual slash, fairly new fic but seems promising.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21820978][21820978]]) Wild Soul by eatsdeath. Last updated December 2020, but I think it's still worth a quick read.

features: Voldemort wins and is minister, dark side wins through legal means, Harry (illegitimate) is abandoned by his mother in an orphanage until a burst of accidental magic puts him on the radar. In the most recent chapter, he was blood adopted by Snape and Regulus. Eventual Harry/Tom.

3) Okay, so I found this author purplewitch156 on ao3 and promptly devoured all of her fics, but the main ones I'll recommend are:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26422963][26422963]]) Entwined: Voldemort wins (kind of...it's quite short lived) but starts having dreams of Harry in this strange space dimension (Harry had vanished mysteriously in an attack and has been missing for weeks). Harry doesn't know who the "phantom" that's visiting him is, but eventually Harry is rescued and the resistance continues.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22051093][22051093]]) Memento Mori: features a few of Harry and Tom's multiple lives, quite fluffy

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14368581][14368581]]) Of Your Making (and its sequel): this one's been shared a few times on this sub, but the first story features this Carcerem artifact in which both Harry and Voldemort are trapped and have to forgive each other before time runs out. Interesting world building inside the artifact. I thought they resolved their differences a little too soon, but it progressed realistically enough (I think I just wanted to hold on to the angst a little more lol). Features a fun crime solving partnership between the two after entering the real world again.

The sequel is just as good but features a trip to an alternate universe, so now we've got dopplegangers running around. This world is quite darker than in the original.

​

4) Miscellaneous:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30537870][30537870]]) Beauty and the Beast by Metalomagnetic

MUST READ. This fic kind of acts like a prequel to Ouroboros but is also standalone. Focuses on Bellatrix's relationship with Voldemort up to the end of the final battle. I would normally never go out of my way to read a Bellatrix/Voldemort fic, but this one is sooo good. It's completely canon compliant, but somehow their actions seems so justified and make sense from their POV. Also, Bellatrix's relationship with Sirius is very fascinating and heartbreaking.

I saw this one recommended elsewhere, so I went ahead and read it:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29034237][29034237]]) Neither can live while the other is high by ScaredyCrow

Harry and his friends get high on a special type of weed found in the Forbidden Forest (guess who originally planted it there) and Voldemort's connection with Harry suffers.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21221933][21221933]]) Once a Paw at a Time by You_Light_the_Sky

Harry accidentally time travels to Wool's Orphanage but is trapped in the body of a black cat. He proceeds to make Tom's life miserable (not really).

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7789879][7789879]]) Odd Magic by You_Light_the_Sky

Fairly Odd Parents crossover, features Harry as Tom's fairy godparent, quite short and I wish there was more but it is what it is.

Edit: yes these were all read over the past week or so

  Lord Voldemort was winning the war, and Harry knew it, at no point more clearly than when he is heading to the Dark Forest to confront his fate. The adrenaline-fueled destruction of the Horcruxes had so far driven him, Ron and Hermione to be able to run, to flee and do what had to be done---no matter the consequences, no matter the danger---to end Voldemort. Harry's life is about to change, if not in the way he expects because, for every question posed for the fate of the Wizarding World, there will be fleeting answers to trace, and no one is more curious than the tyrant himself.

** This is my first time posting in this thread! Here goes. Hopefully, my links work properly.

*Butterbeer Mustaches* - /Just Finished/ - Set post Hogwarts. Hermione owns Flourish and Blotts, and a repentant Draco works at the ministry trying to improve his family's reputation. They bond over their mutual love of books. It's a really well done romance. Both Hermione and Draco feel mostly in character. (completed)

(Sorry no quote because [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], ugh)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12580409/1/Butterbeer-Mustaches]])

*What You Call Sin* - /Reading Now/ - Set in eight year Hogwarts. All of the students are resorted to promote unity, and Hermione and Draco are now together in Ravenclaw. Very slowburn as they build a friendship over an advanced potions assignment. Really enjoying. Both Hermione and Draco feel in character. (in progress, updates seem to be coming out quickly)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29322264/chapters/72013461]])

#+begin_quote
  His hand clenched and relaxed, then he faced her. “I apologize for how I treated you.”

  He went quiet, but remained as tense as she was. Hermione stared, and a flush of anger ran through her. Did he think just because Harry spoke for him, all was forgiven? That one apology undid years of abuse?

  “What do you expect me to say to that?”

  “Nothing,” Draco said. “But it still needed to be said.”
#+end_quote

*Her Beauty and the Moonlight* - /Just Finished/ - Set post Hogwarts. Ron has been dosing Hermione with love potions for years, and they are living together. She goes on the war path and decides to punish him by fake dating Draco Malfoy. Well written, mostly enjoyable fic. The Weasley (Molly and Ginny too) hatred took me out of the story a bit. Also a little old school take at the end on infertility and continuing bloodlines that icked me out. But overall still a good read if you're a Draco/Hermione fan. (completed)

#+begin_quote
  “Draco, I want you to date me.”

  He laughed at first, shoulders shaking. “Really now. My horoscope did say an unexpected surprise was in store for me today. Seriously now Granger, why are you here? A donation to your cause for creature rights? Some kind of quid pro quo arrangement for political support?”
#+end_quote

*Occurrens Mentium* - /Reading Now, May Drop/ - Set post-war but still students. Draco and Hermione are stuck in the past, 1944. They decide to attend Hogwarts to get access to the materials they need to try and cobble a way home. Hermione disguises herself as a Durmstang transfer and Draco in animagus form as her familiar. Voldemort is a teenager, and they are now sharing a common room. Premise was really good, and there's a lot of creative ideas. But the execution is shaky. For instance, we don't get to see how they ended up in the past or how the two characters build a bond. We open on them going to Hogwarts, already sorta friends and wildly out of character.
