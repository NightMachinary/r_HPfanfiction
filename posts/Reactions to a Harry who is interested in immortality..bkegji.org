I have this idea going on - due to a past experience of loss of a close childhood friend, Harry starts to see death as something that is terrible and should be stopped. Learning about his parents' deaths only intensifies that sentiment, and coming to know that magic exists makes him think that maybe death can be stopped. Just to be clear - Harry would be primarily interested in stopping others, and not himself, from dying.

Assuming that Dumbledore knows (not necessary, but consider the case) about Harry's fixation, how do you think he would react? I can't see him putting his faith on Harry when it comes to the stone in first book.

And how do you think that Voldemort would react to Harry?


** That depends on how optimistic you want to be about Professor Dumbledore. If we are dealing with competent early-books Dumbledore, he would give another wise speech of the type he gave before the Mirror in /PoS/, and no doubt more quickly.

If we are focusing more on later-introduced elements of the mythos, the characterization of Dumbledore suits itself fantastically to this matter, because his thing in Rowling's view is that he is haunted by his missing Grindelwald's turn to darkness and keeps trying (and failing) to rectify that mistake; first Tom Riddle, then Severus Snape. If Harry showed signs of yearning for immortality, then between that sad tendency of his to see Grindelwalds everywhere and the whole Prophecy thing, he would waste no time in mentally branding Harry the next Tom Riddle. He would be /extremely/ wary of young Mr Potter (yet simultaneously kind of guilty about it because part of him knows he's probably just being paranoid). What this means in terms of plot is up to you.

As for what Lord Voldemort would do... he would have an easier time of manipulating Harry in the Mirror Confrontation (or some equivalent to it, as I hardly suppose events would unfold the same way in that timeline). He did make the attempt back in canon of tempting Harry with power over life and death, as you'll recall: he offers to use his sorcery to bring back Harry's parents. In your proposed story, he would instead make Harry the same offer he made to many of his Death Eater: a half-veiled hint that if Harry serves him loyally, Voldemort just might impart upon him the secret of immortality. And seeing as he's talking to someone who just came back from the dead (albeit halfway), Harry would have better reason to believe him than he does in canon to believe Voldemort could bring his parents back. (He's actually /wrong/ to disbelieve him in canon, in hindsight: Voldemort /did/ own the Resurrection Stone by this point... one of the more amusing details you pick up on rereading.)

I'm not altogether certain what you mean about Dumbledore "putting his faith in Harry when it comes to the Stone" in the first book. It is, I think, quite an unreasonable interpretation to assume Dumbledore engineered the Mirror showdown as it happened. He did have a chessmasterly (and supremely dumbledorish) plan, yes, but clues point towards said plan relying on Harry /not/ being selfless enough to try and protect the Stone. So if Harry really did wish for immortality that much, this would change very little in Dumbledore's plans --- the Stone would be just as safe from a Harry who woudl wish to use the Stone as from a Harry who would wish for something else altogether; the Stone was only in danger if it somehow occurred to Harry to wish for the Stone while not wanting to use it. (Which he did, the poor, courageous git.)

Other things to consider: how does Harry react to learning the existence of ghosts and souls is a certain thing in the Wizarding World? And regardless of Dumbledore's plans, what if, upon learning of its existence, Harry becomes obsessed with stealing the Philosopher's Stone himself?

*** Thank you for the answer.

You're completely right about the mirror showdown. It's been some time since I've read the first book and now I feel silly for confusing that lol.

I mostly agree with your take on Dumbledore. I just wonder if seeing that Harry - in the beginning at least - yearns for immortality as a means to not lose people (still selfish, but not as selfish as Riddle's motivation) would not make him be a bit more cautious in branding Harry as the next Tom Riddle.

(Now I really want to read a story in which he actually succeeds in turning Harry away from a dark path, but I don't remember finding one of those.)

As I am imagining Harry now, he would try to find out everything about ghosts, and whether he could '"summon" one of his friend and parents. That would be just one more thing for him to look on, though - he would be pretty interested in anything that is related to avoiding death.

There are so many ways to go with this idea. Harry could become obsessed with stealing the stone, or he could find something else that (in his view, at least) has more potential. The stone can't bring people back - and maybe he would find a lead to something that could. I can see him at the beginning Harry caring more about bringing people back rather than keeping people he cares about from dying (since at that point he wouldn't really care about anyone). His attitude towards the stone would also depend on how he views his own mortality, given that he survived what no one else did. And learning about ghosts and souls would lead him to a potential interest in the afterlife - and perhaps towards the idea of communicating with the dead rather than bringing them back/keeping people from dying. Maybe that could even be less "dark" than other forms of immortality (such as Horcruxes or drinking unicorn blood).

Lastly, as for Voldemort, I was thinking more of how (if) he would try to manipulate Harry without giving up his fa√ßade as Quirrell, or if he would see encouraging Harry on that path would not lead to the boy becoming a threat (what if he learned about Horcruxes, for example? I don't think Voldemort would want that). Of course, everything changes if he thinks that Harry can get to the stone.

**** u/Achille-Talon:
#+begin_quote
  Flamel invented the philosopher's stone, granting him and Perenelle immortality, & is one of Dumbledore's close intimates. Why not teach Harry alchemy if he has the motivation?
#+end_quote

That's a thought, but classically, Alchemy can only be achieved by those whose souls are at peace; only a man wise enough /not/ to crave the Philosopher's Stone is capable of creating one. (That's why it's called /Philosopher/'s Stone, natch.) Of course, this may not be the case in the /HP/ universe, /but/...

#+begin_quote
  Harry would be saving others, not himself. I think Albus would take to it really well, to be honest. It could make for a really good mentor!Dumbledore fic.
#+end_quote

Apologies for the misunderstanding --- but even there, I think he would be kinda creeped out, actually. There is in fact a famous fic with precisely this set-up of Harry being super into stopping everyone from dying and this kind of creeping Dumbledore out because he believes int he "next great adventure" and all that jazz, namely /HPMoR/.

#+begin_quote
  Doesn't he do the opposite of this in regards to Draco in HBP?
#+end_quote

Yes, but that's a few years later, /after/ he has witnessed a brilliant counterexample to the "bitter, talented orphan turns Dark Wizard" in the form of Harry turning out alright. If Harry /hadn't/ turned out alright, he may have been much less forgiving of Malfoy. (Also, being in full possession of his parents, and loved by them, Draco is not as perfect an execution of the Tom Riddle pattern as Harry, by far.)

****** u/Achille-Talon:
#+begin_quote
  they're both dark lords, yes,
#+end_quote

Well, technically, Grindelwald /wasn't/ a Dark Lord. Voldemort made up that title for himself. (Or pilfered it from Tolkien; there is something deeply amusing to me in the suggestion that Tom came by a copy of /The Lord of the Rings/ at the Orphanage and somehow concluded Sauron was a perfect role model. Though it's a bit of a silly theory.)

#+begin_quote
  he /hates/ tom, while with gellert he blames himself for intensifying him & working together with him:
#+end_quote

/Does/ he hate Riddle? I'm not sure. Certainly he cares about Grindelwald more, but I rather get the impression that he thinks of Riddle as another failure on his part; this time not as a blinded friend, but as an inattentive schoolteacher.

#+begin_quote
  exactly, and albus speaks about harry's soul as being uncommonly pure
#+end_quote

But that's canon Harry. Though his soul might well be pure too for all we know, we cannot lift info about Canon Harry's psychology and try and apply it to our proposed AU Harry, who has different goals and values.

As for why said AU-Harry's mind might be significantly less "pure" by alchemical standards... well, the books' logic of "the well-ordered mind accepts death" seems to suggest that there is something not quite right with our AU-Harry if he's so set against death.

#+begin_quote
  severus has also started atoning at this point - why wouldn't he serve the same example to albus that you say harry does in canon?
#+end_quote

Oh, he might. I did not necessarily say that his seeing worrisome parallels with the Grindelwald-Riddle-Snape pattern would lead to him being /antagonistic/ with Harry. But surely you agree that Dumbledore would not treat someone he saw as "another Voldemort/Snape type who may yet be prevented from walking down the path of darkness, if I tread carefully" the same way he treated the canon Harry?

**** Canon doesn't say. Dumbledore suspects he didn't know, but that could just because to a Hallows-enthusiast like him it's /unthinkable/ that Voldemort could know what it was yet treat it so callously. What /would/ you expect Voldemort to do with the Resurrection Stone /but/ taint it with his own influence and then bury it somewhere? "Only I can live forever" and all that --- he doesn't /want/ to bring back anyone else than /himself/ from the dead.

** linkffn(8551180) very much grappled with this, where Harry is paranoid about aging and death and searches for ways to stave off both.

linkffn(9057950) actually features Harry secretly pursuing necromancy while at Hogwarts due to the death of his younger sister.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Do you mean besides HPMOR?

It's a pretty big plot point in that fic, but Dumbledore is kind of framed as a straw theist there. He's mainly shocked that a Good Person would think that way, but he does rationally consider Harry's arguments and tries to guide him in the "right" way without resorting to evil schemes.

(Also, it's a very controversial fic on this sub in general.)
