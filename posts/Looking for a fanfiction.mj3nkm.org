:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Is there a fanfiction where Harry's whole soul ends up in Voldemort's body? Not like a horcrux but something along the lines of a body swap. But only Harry ends up like that because Voldemort is dead at that point.

And if you are wondering how I came up on such a strange idea, it's because I dreamt about it today xD and I thought it was epic how Harry opened his eyes in Voldemort's body.


** Reminds me of a story where Harry Potter's soul gets sent back to his younger body. He convinces the death eaters that he is Voldemort possessing harry, and he makes his eyes red. Can't remember the name of that story though.

** I came across a fic where they both swapped bodies (but the story itself wasn't to my liking, so I stopped reading pretty quickly).

That's an interesting idea though. What happens to Harry's body in this? I'm thinking maybe there is a body swap and Harry kills Voldemort while their bodies are swapped for the greater good and Harry tries to find a way to get into his old body, keeping it frozen. Ooh and maybe Voldemort pretends to be Harry and Harry trying to kill Voldemort just looks like Voldemort's typical insanity to others.

I'm going to save this idea and may or may not revisit it for a one shot haha
