** I remember a story that Harry hypnotized him and Hermione to exercise while sleeping, and on the second day they couldn't leave the bed because of sore muscles.

This was a good anecdote that skipping the hard part of something always have a downside.

** You and me both :D

Seriously, I'd love for the imperius being a thing if professionals could use it that way (harsh fines if they do anything their clients do not want them to!)...

I'd ask for:

- more drive in general

- more focus (I have ADHD and this might help with that)

- drive to do fitness stuff and learn programming (I am interested, but not enough to do so after a day at work)

etc. etc.
