Do you guys remember David Hasselhoff evil twin? Nah! You're all probably too young for that.

â€‹

Anyways, this is what this I about. Unbeknownst to the magical world, the Dumbledore family was bigger than they imagined. Not only did Albus had a little known brother working as a bartender. Not only did Albus had an even less known little sister who was accidentally killed in a struggle with an old fling. Not only did Albus had a secret brother named Aurelius with a terrible sense of what constitutes a good hairstyle and a passion for angst. NO!!! He had an even secreter lost strangled brother. A twin brother. A man named Malbus Dumbledore.

While Albus dedicated his life to education and correcting his terrible life choices, Malbus went into exile to work in as a pirate in Asia. Drinking rum and killing baby whales. He was the kind of person who would leave the toilet seat up and leave you on "seen" on Facebook intentionally, then laugh about it.

One fateful day, Voldemort fell after an ancient protective spell bounced from a baby to him, leaving him bodyless. That same evening, Albus was ambushed by Malbus, who stole his identity.

Professor McGonagall was the first to find Malbus as he put on his brother's robes, "Albus, Albus, it's terrible, you must have surely heard..." she started, then stopped looking at him, "what's with the black moustache?"

"Oh, it's a new style of mine, nothing to worry about. Arrr!" Malbus answered winking at the professor.

Minerva, who had grown used to the man's eccentricities, decided to dismiss it. "Nevermind, you must surely heard of the Potters. Oh Albus! What are we to do with their baby?"

Malbus looked at the distance thinking it through, as he twisted the black moustache on top of his white beard. "Does the baby have any relatives?"

"Some muggle relatives, I've heard. But they are beyond dreadful."

"Perfect, we'll drop him there. Do you have quill and parchment? I need to write a letter so they understand the gist of it."

And that was how Malbus reign started, with Minerva looking at him writing, in disbelief. Once the man was over, the fireplace erupted. It was Hagrid.

"Professor Dumbledore, I found have Harry, as you told me." the giant said, not even noticing Malbus' moustache.

"Ahoy there! Well, take him to his muggle relatives. We'll meet you there, after I have served myself on of these new sweets I invented. Lemon Rums!" the man turned to McGonagall, "Want some?"

It was like this that years went by, and Harry and the rest of the wizarding world moved on, taking Malbus as the real Albus. That was, until one day, when Voldemort returned, when the power of the ritual used to give him a body broke the seals that held the real Albus in place. Now Malbus, Albus, Voldemort and the Ministry have to come crashing down in the mother of all series of misunderstandings.

** That sure is some good crack. It's kind of sad that it makes more sense than pretty much all of the serious Evil!Dumbledore stories.

*** It's even better if Malbus practices evil monologues in front of the portraits and uses the phrase "For the Greater Evil!"
