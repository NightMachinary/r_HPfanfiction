Any fics where Harry is a demon or vampire. I mean like he's a manipulative bloodthirsty monster. Like he can act all nice one moment and rip your throat out the next. Crossovers welcomed as well as FemHarry. No Twilight, No slash and no Mpreg.


** Linkffn(Sanguine by Lady Hallen)

An /adorable/ bloodthirsty monster that exchanges study guides for blood.

And eats people.

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.
