Years ago I read a story where Harry was obsessed with the Sherlock Holmes books from before he went to Hogwarts, and modeled his entire life on him. He moved into 221b Diagon Alley, Neville was his Watson, etc.

Would love to read any more like that, with Ron in a prominent role too if there's any (Ron deserves better).


** This is one of the more well-known fics, but if you haven't heard of it, I think you would be interested in linkffn(The Aurors) and you would really like its sequel, linkffn(Hollow Ash).

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  When a mysterious woman comes to the Auror office claiming to be the victim of a terrible crime, Theia and Harry want to do everything they can to help her. The problem is, she has no memory of what has happened. As they piece together the sinister events, their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface, causing them to question who they really are. Sequel to The Aurors.

*** Highly recommend this one. If I remember correctly this is more of a noir crime story so not entirely in the Sherlock Holmes style, nevertheless a great story that revolves around an investigation. Also a standout iteration of Daphne Greengrass (who, for a character that has so much flexibility and potential, all too often ends up the same in every story).

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

** Not Harry as an auror, but to me the closest fic with Sherlock Holmes style is "The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne-Perks" linkffn(6243892)

All the fics listed here are good, though I don't like The Aurors very much, but I wouldn't call them Holmes style.

*** Well if people read the title, they should realise that I'm not looking for Harry as an Auror, instead looking for him as a private investigator. That being said I just finished reading "The Aurors" last night and it was probably one of the best fanfics I've ever read

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]] does have a Drarry endgame but it is the best detective story I've read - I'd highly recommend it.
