Basically, the point is today I thought about calling the children harmione myself. I'm not ashamed to admit that when I read the series for the first time, I was hoping that Harry and Hermione would be together at the end. So that's what I was thinking during math and made up.

Harry and Hermione would have two daughters and one son. The girls would be Diana and Rose and their son Cepheus. In my head, Diana would be the oldest, at Hogwarts, she would have gotten into the Ravenclaw. Her best items would be potions and Transumatation. She would have her father's curly dark hair, her mother's eyes, and a few single freckles on her face.

Rose would be her mother in everything. A proud Gryffindor, fiercely defending her friends, intelligent and quite awkward in interpersonal relations.

Cepheus, on the other hand, would be that quiet boy. He would go to Slytherin, he would have great magical potential. He would like anything, but Spells, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Ancient Runes would love him the most. His features would be his father's, but the hair and eyes his mother's.

I think everyone would have a very good relationship with each other.

How would you see their family?


** I think three children might be too much for career-oriented Hermione. Harry would like more kids, but she's only willing to compromise on one. They have a daughter they call Lily, and while she's bright like her mother, she inherited her father's love for fun.

Harry is the stage dad. He's the one the kid remembers sitting with her for meals or playing in the park. Harry loves to cook, and it's a love that he passes down to Lily. He's the one who was present for each and every tea party, the one who kissed scraped knees. He heaps all the love he had never gotten to his beloved daughter.

Hermione tries her best to be there, but she's a rising star politician. Her work takes up all of her time, and it often follows her home. She tries to be there for dinner at the very least, and she's assigned herself the bedtime stories. She tries her hardest to be there for the big things like Christmas or birthday parties. But her job is huge and there's a lot of weight on her shoulders, so she's often called away anyway.

Harry, obviously, is the favorite. He's the one there after all, and he feels guilty about it sometimes - feels as if he's hogging the kid - but Hermione's quick to assure him that it isn't his fault. She's the one who's up in the office at first light and often comes home past midnight. She did seriously contemplate quitting politics to be the mother her daughter deserves, but she knows herself well enough that she would never manage it.

When it's time for the child to board the Hogwarts Express, Lily jumps into Harry's arms, and they cry loudly into each other while Hermione watches a meter or so away. When it's her turn to say goodbye, Lily suddenly turns shy, and Hermione knows right then and there that everything's broken.

And for once in her life, she has no clue how to fix them.

** Not an Harmonian myself, but if I had to imagine...

First, Hermione is very career-oriented and wouldn't easily stop her career to become a family woman, so imo they'd have either a kid (a girl, Rose) or twins (Lily and Richard). Hermione would climb the ladder and become Minister of Magic, while Harry would be the one to stay at home, and then later either become a professor or work at George's shop.

Rose would be an only child, be born soon enough after the war and therefore live her entire childhood through the aftermath of it. She's a private, witty, sharp-tongued girl, very talented academically, but develops a dislike of the magical world because of her being exposed to people that got deeply traumatised by it. So, after her first Hogwarts year (when she is sorted in Ravenclaw) she starts learning the muggle curriculum, takes her A Levels in Maths, Physics and Chemistry and goes on to study college Materials Science (of course her Hogwarts grades aren't very good, but she doesn't care). She finds a job in a small firma that develops medical materials. She still has a good relationship with her family and their friends (and basically lives "between worlds") but prefers her Muggle life and mostly lives in that world.

If it were Lily and Richard, for them I imagine a different life. They are born later, about 10-13 years after the war, and lived in a world that has already mostly healed. Richard is a Squib (but had he been sorted he'd been a Gryffindor-Slytherin hate tall, for he is as audacious as he is ambitious and cunning), but with a deep intuition for physical sciences, and has a warm and friendly personality, while Lily is not that good a witch (think a bit better than Neville in the first years) and has a shy and meditative personality. Richard has no animosity not real envy towards the magical world, but strives to be a part of it and to reform it. So he goes to college, studies Engineering and then comes back to the magical world and works with his mother to integrate technology and muggle innovations in it, both to integrate squibs and magical creatures and to bring that world out of the stagnancy it had fell in because of the wars. Lily, who gets sorted in Hufflepuff, chooses to live a quieter life and instead works for a while at the Leaky Cauldron, before then opening her own magical shop. She loathes the spotlight that being the child of 2 war heroes brings, especially since she is very different to both of them, and developed a particular relationship with her "Uncle Ron".

P.S. first, sorry for language and format, but English is not my mother tongue and I'm writing from my phone, second I intended Richard to be named partially after Fred (the names share part of their rispettive etymologies)

** A single daughter of a divorce on account of Hermione pursuing a career in politics and Harry actively looking for obscurity and keeping himself busy as private investigator/ handy man. Spends her time flipping between the two but enjoys spending time with her father more on account of Harry have no expectations or advice for her. Hermione is still a good person but one caught in a never ending crusade that having already ended things with Harry, has a sunk cost fallacy that if she doesn't keep pushing for reforms everything including her sacrife of her personal relationships will have been for nothing.

Harry probably spends a lot of nights drinking with the old crowd, may or may not be a functional alcoholic. Daughter might marry Scorpius or if Neville has a kid. Takes a job in a traditional magical field like alchemy because she has neither of her parents worst hangups and on account of not really having any muggles either parents really still speaks too is essentially exclusively magically raised.

Lily is a decent name as any. Or named after Andromeda on account of Sirius and if Teddy's still a thing Harry's closeness there.

** As a dysfunctional one. Harry would be consistently annoyed by Hermione's nagging and bored out of his mind that he has to stick to a family life where his partner is career obsessed. He would probably go off on adventures together with Ron and with Hermione when they'd get a bit of her time. In terms of kids, I dunno. Maybe one at most who would be constantly pressured to do well in school by his mom but looking up to their father.
