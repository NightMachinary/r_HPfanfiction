Does anyone have any good fic refs for stories in which muggles, for whatever reason, are allowed to attend Hogwarts alongside magical students? Maybe modified class schedules, like Potions, Herbology, Divination, Astronomy, etc? Whether it be to replenish the Magical community's numbers, encourage inclusivity, foster relations with muggles, or just fortify an army against Voldemort...


** Not exactly this, but I like linkao3(10294436). Petunia gets to Hogwarts, although under rather problematic circumstances.

**** You know, you can just add the story ID to the end of =https://archiveofourown.org/works/= to get the URL of the story, right? So, it is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10294436]] .

Whoops, which means I gave you incorrect story ID. Whoops! I am sorry.

** Wouldn't it be a bit problematic for Muggles to study at Hogwarts, when the only they can see is a ruin with sign declaring it danger to enter?

*** I would assume it would preclude taking down the wards that hide it from Muggle view and repel them.
