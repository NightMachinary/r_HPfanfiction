Like, I always appreciated his snark when he wasn't pissed off (then it just got sad), so the idea would be he's just really sarcastic and has a caustic sense of humor, and is only bitter because whenever he makes a joke people complain to their Head of House. He constantly makes esoteric jokes and puns during Death Eater meetings that everyone is too busy being scared to get, but Voldemort is vaguely amused at. He tries to do everything deadpan but he did spend a large portion of his life dealing with murderers and psychos so it comes out really dangerous and scary and he doesn't notice? Like, he legitimately doesn't understand why Longbottom is crying he was making a pun about frog legs dammit why are these children so sensitive. POV from either Snape or someone who gets the jokes. Maybe Voldemort watching a class through Harry's scar?


** You know, I can actually buy that from some of his remarks in canon.

  'I have no idea,' said Snape coldly. 'Potter, when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe, loosen your hold a little. If Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job.'

It's funny in a terrible, cruel way. I think Harry also commented that the Prince had a dark sense of humour. It would be really hilarious to read a fic where Snape is confused why people look horrified rather than amused at his jokes. Following this thread closely.

**** Also, the toenail-growing hex! Most of the spells in his book were similarly Fred and George-ish but it was the later entries that were dangerous and dark like Sectumsempra.

***** In the Snape Chronicles, Severus works closely with Fred and George for a while on antics like you describe. I thought it was very well written and super hilarious that they had this dynamic.

****** Ffn is down for me right now but if this is by rannaro: this is an amazing fic and canon compliant. He made another version where Snape doesn't die and then creates a new story out of it.

I recommend this to everyone. It is one of the best written fanfics and shows a whole new Snape while still being the Snape we know from canon. There isn't anything out of character and yet it makes you feel for him.

*** Snape really was funny if you look at it from a perspective that is not an 11 year old school child. I mean, he was a horrible sunovabitch, but also, funny.

** He's a very sarcastic and cynical guy in canon, I found some of his comments in the books to be rather funny, it's a dry or perhaps dark kind of humor that I can appreciate.

*** Yeah, it's quite humorous for an adult who likes jokes with dark undertones. Totally inapropriate for pre-teen though, and barely so for most teenagers (canon Harry being among those who could apreciate them giving his snark.... too bad he doesn't like Snape)

** When I write Snape, I tend to have him making a LOT of puns and wordplay jokes in his head, as well as just generally being sarcastically funny. The guy just? Has SUCH a dark sense of humour, but in a different context, people would really appreciate it more, I think.

**** Hey, I'm on [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/DictionaryWrites][Ao3 here]], and on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1650948/DictionaryWrites][FFnet]]. I've only written a few things from Snape's POV, though. The most is in The Serpent's Gaze: The Lernaean Hydra, but that's the fifth book in a series.

*** I think this is another one of the reasons why I (and many other people) love Snape, not only for his literary complexity, but those with a dry/dark sense of humor find him hilarious. I'm in exactly the same boat as you, but few people have both a dry/deadpan and dark sense of humor.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
