It has to start right before they go to Hogwarts for their first year. I'd like it to be pretty long. Can be canon or slightly AU, as long as James and Lily still end up together. Any suggestions greatly appreciated.

Nothing is too long.

Very parallel to canon timeline and events.

*** I'm going to give it a go. Little disappointed in the first paragraph that it starts /after/ they've been to Hogwarts the first time though. Was kind of hoping to go through Lily and James meeting each other for the first time and all that.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

  This is the story of four boys. This is the story of how these four boys came to know each other, of how they became friends. This is the story of their unbreakable bond that could survive any test. This is a story that will ultimately end in tragedy.

*** Yeah, I saw that one and started reading it. I can't remember why but I lost interest in it early on. I looked through quite a few so its hard to keep track of which ones were which.
