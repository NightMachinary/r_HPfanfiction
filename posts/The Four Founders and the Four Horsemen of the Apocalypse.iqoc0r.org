I've been thinking a little bit about it but since JK liked to make a lot parallels between the story and the Bible, it could be that the Four Founders might have been the first to conquer the four hoursemen:

Slytherin thought that magicfolk were oppressed by Muggles so he became the Master of Conquest, also known as Pestilence, associated with the anti-Muggles and Muggleborn sentiments following after. Some theological philosophies also consider Pestilence as the prophet of Christ and the Antichrist. Merlin, who is seen in the HP world as a godly figure (his name is used in magical sayings equivalent to those where Muggles would use god or Jesus, and in folklore he is referred to as the Prince of Charms - which are the opposite of curses), and Voldemort, who seduced people with promise of power thus leading them to perdition, were both Slytherins

Hufflepuff offered motherly love to everyone equally and expected everyone to love each other. She particularly tended to the renegades, the weak and the wounded. But she also realized that her students will never succeed unless they are united, loyal to each other and live in peace. Thus she became the Mistress of War.

Ravenclaw wanted to satiate the hunger for knowledge of the people so she became the Mistress of Famine. Famine typically refers to physical hunger but in theological philosophy it's also associated with lack of resources and the oppressive empire which keeps the common folk ignorant of the corruption by entertaining them with bread and circus.

Finally Gryffindor was brave and was willing to risk his life to save others. Thus he became Master of Death. Harry Potter, a Gryffindor, later conquered Death as well and another Gryffindor, Dumbledore, is often associated with Death in the fan theories which suggest that Voldemort, Snape and Harry were the reincarnations of the Peverell brothers, who also conquered Death. Death is also said to ride together with Hades, who is the master of the Cerberus and the Keeper of the Keys to the Underworld. Hagrid was also a Gryffindor, Keeper of the Keys at Hogwarts and master of Fluffy.

Do you have any thoughts on the matter or do you know of any fics that deal with this?

Thank you!

Edit for an additional thought: Harry Potter is the second coming of Merlin just like Christ's second coming is supposed to come defeat the Antichrist. Harry comes back from the dead before defeating Voldemort. Ironically, irl, Jesus is probably one of the best known names and before Harry Potter, Merlin was the most well-known fictional wizard, but in recent years I think Harry took over the title.

** I think of it like this:

Gryffindor is War: The house traits are what makes a useful soldier. (Of course the best ones would also be smart, resourseful, cunning, and kind in the form of showing mercy and not destroying everyone they see even if the people are women and children.) One house color is red, like blood. I see Gryffindor as full of energy and being noticed. Whether it's that they are social, loud, and funny, a prankster, a hero, or something else, I like to think they stand out and aren't the type to fade into the background.

Hufflepuff is Famine: The reason I chose this, is because they are the least threatening house. I tend to associate being passive, too tolerant, and too nice with them. I thought about how each house would be in a disaster, and I figured they'd be the most likely to go hungry because they'd refuse to demand it from anyone, steal it, use trickery or deceit to get it, make people pity them and give them food. I feel like they're the most likely house to share and to give away, which would end badly for them if food was scarce. I also see being passive as someone not getting all that they could from life, as missing out on so much, some people repressing desires or denying themselves of things for their own reasons. It all fits Famine for me.

Ravenclaw is Pestilence: Knowledge can be the best thing in the world, or the worst. It all depends on how and why it's used. Experimenting on people and animals, learning about how to brainwash people as well as make them docile and obedient, making drugs, making food that smells and tastes delicious but is awful for health, making cigarettes and encouraging society to smoke for years and years before admitting it's unhealthy, creating weapons, power plants, nuclear weapons, war propaganda to make people think a certain group is bad and needs to be dealt with through fighting to the death, and the ability to create viruses in labs. These are some examples of knowledge causing irreparable damage, being used for evil, of it being a plague in a way.

Slytherin is Death: Both are misunderstood, and feared by some. Death is dreaded by some and welcome by others, painful for some but peaceful for others. Like death, Slytherin traits are neutral. Whether they are good, helpful, and bring joy to people, or evil, selfish, and hurtful, all depends on who has them and how they use them. Plenty of people hate death and wish it didn't have to happen. It's an essential part of life and everything would be chaos without it. There is prejudice against Slytherin in the series, among a portion of Harry Potter fans, and in life. People talk about cunning, fraternity, and self preservation like they are horrible, some speak as though ambition and selfish were synonyms, and people talk about how wanting power is bad. Self preservation is natural in animals and people, it's part of survival. It relates to death in how it's viewed from a negative lense. What some people don't understand, is that the traits of all four houses are important and necessary for humanity. With Slytherin specifically, imagine where the world would be without ambition. At best, we would still be cave people. I believe we would have died out right after we began.

*** I was actually debating of whether to associate Slytherin with death... but I decided to go with the prophet of Christ and the Antichrist thing because it actually fits so well. Also other than Voldemort who is really afraid of it, death doesn't play such a significant role for the typical Slytherin as it does for some Gryffindors.

** About the Bible and the series, here are my thoughts about Slytherin's mascot:

It was chosen because snakes are thought by some to be evil, just as the house is viewed that way. In reality, both are simply misunderstood, and are judged harshly out of hatred and ignorance.

It was chosen to remind people of how the snake got Eve to eat the apple, meaning it's meant to be the bad house.

The Leviathan is an enormous serpent like monster that lives underwater and can destroy the world. What if JKR chose the snake and the element of water for this reason? There's also Slytherin's connection to wanting power. Could this be another reference to the monster? And there's the Basilisk Harry killed, which happened to be a serpent like creature.

I also want to mention Parseltongue. What it is and what it sounds like. First, some refer to the Devil as a serpent. Second, the eerie whispering and strange language that only some can comprehend and speak. Now that I'm an adult, it makes me think of people speaking in tongues, or what it may sound like if the Devil or demons communicated with people. And we could say that the reason only some get it and speak it is because only some are contacted by demons. I hope that JKR wasn't making all of these connections, but it's fun to think about.

And I have to throw in that I do believe in God, but I don't like how snakes are portrayed. They are not evil, they just eat and breed like every other creature. They got their reputation because of people's primal fear of them. People dislike them, think they're creepy, scary, so it's easy to see how they get labelled evil. It reminds me of how pale women with black hair, and old women were called witches more than blondes who weren't pale, because men weren't attracted to them. The simple minded thought process of "This animal freaks me out, it's evil." "I don't want to impregnate her, clearly she's a witch." or "Her hair is black. Darkest color means evil. Her skin is pale, she's sickly, she's not healthy and furtile. Probably got sick from witchcraft."

I love snakes and every other animal!

To be fair about people associating things they don't like with evil: I like to do that with spiders because they're what comes to mind when I think "What if I had to choose something to be bad?". In terms of what we know exists for a fact, there is no better symbol for the ultimate bad than a hideous eight legged, five eyed insect with an unsettling mouth and body, who makes web, and who catches prey and eats them as they struggle. Spiders are my least favorite thing out there and I wish they didn't exist. (I have severe Arachnophobia if you couldn't already guess.) If they got bigger or people shrunk, they would be catching us in webs too. ðŸ˜¨ My fear of them is primal and extreme, it's the same as others with snakes. Just adding this: One of my favorite things is Inuyasha. Without a bunch of spoilers, I'll just say that spiders and evil are connected.

*** I think you're on to something... snakes are evil in multiple mythologies. It's not only the snake that tempted Eve, but Typhon is half human and half snake, the dragons who abduct the fair princess in medieval legends are derived from snakes. However the water element is usually seen as the good one (except for the legend of the deluge). Aphrodite came out of the water an she is the Goddess of beauty and love.

** Ravenclaw is Famine, absolutely. An unceasing hunger for knowledge.

Slytherin is Pestilence because ambition, unchecked, is a disease. It sickens people who pursue it if they're not careful. Look at Slytherin's most famous Heir and the damage he did to himself, the contagion he spread to his followers, and the damage they did to Magical Britain.

Gryffindor is War. Gryffindor /loves/ courageous last stands, heroic charges, bold strikes.

Hufflepuff is Death. Death is the ultimate equalizer. Everyone dies; rich or poor, good or evil, everyone will have their turn. And Death never stops working. You can't bargain or plead or fight or run or hide or hope you're overlooked - Death will do their job.

*** For Slytherin I was thinking more that he is the Master of Pestilence because Muggles are seen by the Slytherins as a pest that needs to either be subdued or exterminated. But I like your association better.

Also good point about Hufflepuff. Truth is I was kind of forcing war on her because she is probably the most peaceful one of the four.
