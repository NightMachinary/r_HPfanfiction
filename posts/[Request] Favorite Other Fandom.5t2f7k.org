Hey Everyone,

Like many of the good people on this subreddit, I have read a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction. Now many fics that would have impressed or entertained me a year ago seem hopelessly boring. As a result I've branched out a bit and read Worm by Wildblow, and have gotten into that fanfiction community as well. Like all fanfiction, it has its overdone tropes, and its struggles in shrugging off the stations of canon. For now though, its given me a bit of variety that I needed.

So what's your other favorite fanfiction community/ fandom? What fic got you into it/ what is the best fic you've encountered in that fandom?

TLDR: What fanfics do you read when you get bored of HP? I read Worm.


** Buffy the Vampire Slayer, over on [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/]["Twisting the Hellmouth"]].

** Avengers/Thor fanfiction because Loki. I haven't read much, as I prefer romance, but I liked him paired with Darcy. I don't really like splitting up really couples (so Jane/Thor stays), so Darcy's great there. One of my favorites is a short action/smut fic : [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3928408/chapters/8798995]] It's hot and fun. I also like the pics that delve deeper into Loki's troubles, like the whole frost giant/asgardian thing, but I don't have a rec in mind. If you're interested I can try to find others I liked, but those two character just work so well together, I also love reading normal world AU (that same author has a story like that). It's just fun, I'm not here for the super detailed Marvel world, just the characters, their personalities and what happens to them.

I've liked Tairis Deamhan's Razor's Edge stories ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2399641/Tairis-Deamhan]]) and Full-Paragon's AU where the Quarians made first contact (linkffn(9156000)).

** You are so very right with going for worm...there is some absolutely fantastic fics avaliable in the fandom and I have read most of them;)

That said a few worm fics i would recomend:

Copacetic (post golden morning...still updating)

Taylor Varga(crack taken seriously? Its lovely and a happy read)

I don't remember the name but there is a fantastic worm/okami crossover that is pretty long.

Other than worm i have read a ton of naruto fic, i never watched it but the sheer volume of fics avaliable means there is some really good quality stuff if you know what to look for.

Also there is a story on fictionpress called mother of learning that I would suggest reading.

  Plenty of people had looked down on Eggsy throughout his life. He had gotten fairly used to it. Didn't mean it was fair, but he knew how these things worked. What really sucked was that the new Arthur was worse than the old one. “Eggsy grimaced. He didn't know how to explain to Harry -- who seemed like he hadn't been discriminated against a day in his life -- that the new Arthur kept giving him what amounted to suicide missions, and that he was currently bleeding out in a warehouse because of the deliberately bad intel she had given him.” Also featuring: Dean is harder to get rid of than Eggsy thought, his mum is going off the deep end, there are way too many nefarious plots in play, and Eggsy is really beginning to wish that Harry would stop holding his hand and kiss him instead.

** I'll read almost anything, so I've got quite a few, but I'll stick to one to keep it short. I got really into Thor/Avengers mainly because of Loki and the crazily creative nonsense I find in the fandom. It's been a while since I read them, but I remember finding some really good OC fics, and maybe it's because I read everything at two in the morning, but I also remember quite a few fics that kind of blew me out of the water.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8388624/1/Schaduw-Wereld][Schaduw Wereld]], is a shorter one where Thor, the Warriors Three, and Sif learn how Loki travels through the shadow world, which has Lovecraft elements, after they need to escape Jotunheimer.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/869337/chapters/1669000][Ice Maiden]] is a fic I didn't expect to like, since I usually stay away from anything with a alpha/omega feel to it, but ended up loving because of the worldbuilding and crazy detail. It's pretty dark though.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1578908/chapters/3352673][Return to Sender]] is a collection of hand-made pen pal letter between two boys (Tony in NYC and Loki in London), and it subtly tells the story of their lives through their letters to each other. It's ongoing, but really good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/550896/chapters/981409][Bend Around the Wind]] is a /really/ long fic where, after the events of the Avengers, Loki and Tony are kidnapped and have to work together to return to Earth. Their time spent traveling through space is a very detailed and interesting story with great OCs and character development.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/778651/chapters/1465611][Distortions in Time]] is another /really/ long fic where Loki grew up on Jotunheim and runs away to have a crazy space adventure that eventually ties in with the Avengers.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1403944/chapters/2944474][One Hundred Steps Back]] is an awfully dark and depressing story by the person who wrote Ice Maiden, but the amount of detail and world building is astounding. Like the two above, it is very long and very detailed. It's Thor/Loki, which I would usually stay away from, but they hardly interact in this story anyway so it didn't bother me. Seriously though, it's dark. Also, it starts off with short chapters that get longer as the story goes on. I almost gave up on it because the beginning had a very happy tone that didn't fit the description and small things like the author italicizing things the way you do on reddit (using this ->* ) but that all went away once the story began.

** I read pretty widely, and I am picky about what I'd recommend. Do you just want a list, or do you want recommendations? The ones where I can think of something good enough to recommend to you off-hand are:

- *How to Train Your Dragon*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6038952/1/To-Soar-into-the-Sunset-A-Night-Fury-s-Odd-Memoir][To Soar Into The Sunset]] - Toothless's memoirs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435562/1/I-Hear-Him-Scream][I Hear Him Scream]]'s technical writing isn't quite up to snuff, but the story is good. Hiccup is turned into a Night Fury.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1586927][In Which No One Trains a Dragon]] - The plot of the film starts after Stoick's death. A crossover with the Marvel universe.

linkffn(6038952; 6435562)

linkao3(1586927)

- *Pokemon*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The-Sun-Soul][The Sun Soul]] is a darker take on the Pokemon universe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions][The Game of Champions]] is an extremely well-written take on Red.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390479/1/No-Antidote][No Antidote]] is about a trainer who is poisoned, and his Bulbasaur. Be warned that it is extremely depressing.

The Sun Soul got me into it. Acrophobia is the best I've read in this category.

linkffn(The Sun Soul by 50caliberchaos)

linkffn(The Game of Champions by L. Lamora)

linkffn(4390479)

- *Doctor Who*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/471497/chapters/815855][Time v3.0]], by Teyke, is about the Time War, and it is one of the best pieces of fan writing I have ever read.

[[https://www.whofic.com/viewstory.php?sid=43209][Practical Mythology]], by Lyricwritesprose, is about Jack Harkness finding out that the Doctor really is a Time Lord. It's extremely well-written, and feels believable. NO BOT LINK, as it is hosted on Whofic.com.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3486089/1/The-Man-With-No-Name][The Man With No Name]] is a Doctor Who/Firefly crossover, with both the Doctor and the crew of Serenity in-character, and good writing. I definitely enjoyed it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8858961/1/Timelords-and-Terror][Timelords and Terror]] is a Doctor Who/My Little Pony crossover, written as a Doctor Who episode first, and a crossover second.

A long-ago read got me interested. Time v3.0 is the best work I've read based on Doctor Who, and is possibly the best piece of fanfiction I've ever read, period.

  Nothing came of that night five years ago, to Hiccup's bitter disappointment. Nothing changed. At least until now, and with his father's untimely death, his crush's ascension to the chiefdom, his worst nightmare up close and personal, a prophecy gone wrong, and the gods' meddling, nothing seems any better. In fact, things have turned much worse. In other words: when HTTYD and adulthood hit Berk's teens at the same time.
