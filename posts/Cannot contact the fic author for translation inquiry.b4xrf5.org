** Just do it. Fanfic is already a derivative work made for fun that doesn't explicitly get Rowling's permission for each work.

So go ahead and translate the work, and don't be a dick about it - clearly flag it as a translation at the start of each chapter, and link to the original English-language version. Add a disclaimer along the lines of "if you like this work, please go to the original work at this link and give the author kudos/reviews."

If the author somehow later shows up and asks you to take down your translation, then they're being the dick, not you (after all, they took JK's work without explicit permission from her to make their own derivative work, so refusing to let others do the same is hypocritical dickery).

Obviously that doesn't apply to straight-up plagiarism, but for things like AU-of-an-AU or "alternative endings" or other types of fanfic-of-fanfic, then you absolutely do not need legal permission, and so long as you're polite about referencing and linking to the original fanfic, I'd say you're also in the clear etiquette-wise.

EDIT: Bunch of other folks in the thread offering opposing opinions. That's how it goes - reasonable people can disagree. I still maintain that by at least trying to contact the author and clarifying that you'll take it down if you've given offense, you're in the clear.

*** It's not a derivative work if they aren't changing it significantly. There is a difference between fanfiction and stealing work. Even if they just credit the author, it would still be an unauthorized work. You can't just slap Spanish subtitles on Infinity War and expect that it would be just fine to give it out for free.

*** This is so completely wrong it's not even funny. I'm guessing that you've never had someone take your work and repost it without permission. It's just about the most disrespectful thing someone can do to another member of the fandom.

**** I would think personal attacks and plagiarism would be much more disrespectful.

And, as it happens, I did have someone ask to re-post one of my works to a website I don't use (not HP fandom). My response was literally, "...nice of you to ask, but pretty sure you don't need my permission. Just list [my alias on the original website] as the author and link back to the original post, and that's all good, man."

Now if the author resurfaces and says she's not cool with it and wants the foreign-language version taken down, it would only be polite to comply.

***** You see, in your example, the person asked before doing anything - that was appropriate. That way you, as the author, could decide whether or not you would like to have your work posted somewhere else.

Taking away that choice, taking away the author's control over their work, is the problem.

Personal attacks (I'm talking internet flames here, not something actually dangerous) don't feel anywhere near as violating or disrespectful, in my opinion.

You're right about plagiarism though.

** I really don't think you should translate the work (or, at any rate, post your translation) without permission. It's just a shoddy thing to do when you don't know how the fic writer would feel about it.

*** I agree with this. I would be offended if someone translated my work and posted it separately from me. Wait for the author to respond and let them post it themselves. It's not yours to do that with without discussion. I know you have good intentions but when you write something it becomes very personal to you and there is a lot of emotion you feel towards your fic. I had a reader post my fic on a site - she gave me credit etc. and posted it there because I didn't use that site and wanted others to see it- but it truest upset me. Because it was my story and my story should be where I felt comfortable having it. I felt robbed of that choice and I despised that she took my work and did what she wanted.

** I know how you feel, but don't do anything without the author's permission. I'm very familiar with the story in question - it's one of my all-time favorites, and I'm also sad that Oddment Tweak hasn't ever produced more or even responded to anything else, but that's how it goes.

But taking someone else's work and posting it without their permission, even when you're translating it, is not cool. I recently discovered someone else reposting one of my stories without my permission and I was surprised and how angry it made me. They did a bit of editing on their own, nothing major - mostly changing chapter headings, etc, and still gave me credit, but the discovery felt like a violation, like a betrayal of trust.

Don't do that to someone else. Especially don't do that to someone whose work you've enjoyed. It's incredibly disrespectful.
