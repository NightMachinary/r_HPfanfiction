I was just watching the Blacklist (For those of you who haven't seen it, it is basically about an anti hero, FBI's top 10 most wanted, who turns himself into the FBI to help bring in other huge bad criminals (who all have different operations and skill sets) and requests the help of a certain new agent to do so. Often he helps bring down said criminals for his own agenda) I was thinking of having Sirius Black be the anti hero and Harry Potter being the new agent (auror). There are also many other roles that HP characters could fill (Permanent FBI roles would be our favorite HP characters, DEs could be the criminals). My question is: would there be any interest to an AU story like this? Thanks and I know it is really a shot in the dark request.


** Well, that was basically what Harry was doing after the War.

It was perfectly reasonable for an Ex Death Eater/Snatcher to turn on his former comrades. Karkaroff did it after the First War. Snatchers, being opportunistic thugs to begin with, might exploit Ministry's temporary lack of manpower to curry favor with the new regime. After all, that Potter kid offed the immortal Dark Lord and that Weasley matriarch killed the dreaded Lestrange Bitch in single combat. Such powers were not to be trifled with. Better join them now when they still needed people. Cook up some sorry tales about being press-ganged (partly true) and deliver some marked ones to the Ministry would set you up nicely.

The Dark Lord's inner circle was among the richest of magical Britain, pissed off winners would undoubtedly make them PAY. Poor Death Eater A didn't have much gold, hadn't really committed any major crime apart from a few vandalism and a couple imperiuses for fun, he also happened to know a fleeing inner circle member's hideout, so A stood a good chance in avoiding prison if he turned early. He might even profit handsomely if he offed that inner circle member.

Harry was truly incensed about the torture Hogwarts children had suffered, and especially furious about what Neville and Ginny went through. They, along with hundreds of similarly angry parents and fellow students, demanded a thorough purge of the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and thorough punishments for ALL Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers. Kingsley was very happy to oblige, so the Revolution began in earnest.

** This request creeps me out a little because it's like you read my mind -- or at least my fic. I've actually had the beginning of this very story sitting in my "probably should finish this sometime in the next hundred years" files for a while now.

But this is exactly zero help to you because it's unfinished and unpublished.

** I'd think Severus Snape during the first war would be the best expy of Red Reddington. Death Eater turns his coat and helps the Aurors hunt down more of them while trying to keep it on the down low so Voldemort doesn't find out. Maybe Voldemort was planning to hunt down the traitor before he got blown up by an infant.

** There is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1869273][a Drarry fic named The Darklist]] on the blacklist that's really well done. There are a bunch of interesting mysteries in this fic and a twist I didn't expect at the end. The whole thing feels AU enough that the slash shouldn't feel OOC. Worth the read I think even if you're not a slash fan. Linkao3(1869273)

  When Draco Malfoy, wanted criminal, strolled into the Ministry to give himself up, he seemed destined for Azkaban until he offered to hand over information to avert an upcoming crime. Of course, he refused to divulge that knowledge to anyone but Harry Potter.
