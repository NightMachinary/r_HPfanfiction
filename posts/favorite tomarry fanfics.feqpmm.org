** A WIP. Super interesting so far. Tom Riddle (The horcrux) is Harry's daemon. Crossover fic with dark materials but only in the terms that every wizard and with has a daemon. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14476725]])

Don't remember much about this but I've got it bookmarked so... linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

Not really tomarry but a fav of mine nevertheless. Quirrelmort reads an essay of Harry. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19946671]])

Voldemort is very ooc in this but it's pretty funny. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/433140]])

A brilliant fic. I highly recommend it. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9372596]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9375371]])

Another take on tomarry. Spooky AU linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13789866]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14244327]])

Tis a good fic Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14368581]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14178429]])

This one is soo good. If you are into a darker Harry this is the fic you are looking for. I wish there was a sequel. The ending is open. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6006037]])

This fic as well as the sequel Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14173404]])

Bit cliché but not bad. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5745595]])

  Harry Potter is finally 17. Free to leave the Dursleys behind and start a new life as an independent wizard (if staying at Ron´s until he gets that apartment in London can be called independence, anyway), he does what any young man in possession of a good fortune would: he third-wheels and goes to a museum. It´s not really a bad plan. The Malfoys had announced they had made a big donation to the newly opened "Myths and Prophecies: Lord Voldemort´s secret collection": The Boy With The Green Eyes collection. All of it.

  “I will fix this, fix you. Fix your mind, make you happy, kiss you all day long, whatever you wish. I will do it, me.

As always, Harry is right at the middle of it all, yet in a situation he couldn't have ever fathomed and alongside the very person whom he was supposed to hate. It changes them both.

  REPOST: SLASH LV/HP: AU: Lucius has twin boys. Voldemort is asking for his servants' firstborn child. Thinking it's an honor; Lucius gives Voldemort the healthy child, Draco, who happens to be the younger twin. Harry grows up the black sheep of the Malfoy family and befriends Mudbloods and the boy-who-lived, Neville. Eventually, he ends up being disowned from the Malfoy family. Things spiral out of control when Voldemort finds out Harry is the firstborn. He'll stop at nothing to get Harry on his side. After all, the ritual Voldemort wants to use will not work without Harry. For the Dark Lord wants to eat off the children's magic once they are of age.

  Harry is drinking his life away as usual. Suddenly, he's back in the past, 1943 to be exact. Harry's given a whole new chance at life as Harrison Evans and this time he's not planning on saving anyone.Unfortunately, the Potter luck strikes again and Harry's sucked back into the conflict and face to face with one Tom Riddle. Somehow the more he tries to stay away the more entangled he gets.

  Harry has almost accepted that he won't be going back to his own time, and he's working in a small apothecary in Diagon Alley to make ends meet. Then someone tries to blow up his employer's shop, and that brings him face-to-face with Tom Riddle, who he successfully avoided during his time at Hogwarts.

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).

  Boy Who Lived, Saviour of the Wizarding World, Defeater of Grindelwald, never received his Hogwarts Letter. Five years later, a 16-year-old Harry Potter is found on the streets of London and immediately sent to Hogwarts, where he catches the eye of one Professor Tom Riddle. When Harry is sorted into Slytherin, well... that just makes things a whole lot easier for him, doesn't it?

  COMPLETE. When Harry and Hermione inadvertently tumble half a century into the past, they find themselves in the same year as the notorious Head Boy, Tom Riddle. Both Harry and Hermione's courage will be tested when they are confronted by chances of romance from the most unexpected of places, and unlikely enemies hiding in the tallgrass.Lost in the past, they may well forget the way home.Not DH compliant.

** There was the Dark Lady by ynmidk, though it got deleted last year. The author rejoined Ffnet and Ao3 under a different name last week and I hope that this fic is posted again. It is one of those rare Tomarry fics where Voldemort is still evil. It's a fem harry x Tom fix where fem Harry Potter is just plain evil.
