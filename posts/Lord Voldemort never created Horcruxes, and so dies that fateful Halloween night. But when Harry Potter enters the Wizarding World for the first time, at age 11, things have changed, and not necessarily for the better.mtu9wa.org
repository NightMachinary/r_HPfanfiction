Maybe Death Eaters take over. Lucius, Bellatrix, etc

Maybe Fenrir Greyback and other creatures have rebelled against the Ministry

Maybe the Ministry is even more corrupt.

etc, etc.

Just anything you could potentially think of.


** Pettigrew watches the roof getting blown off the Potter house and sees Voldemort dying. He takes Voldemort's corpse and wand. The next day Barth Crouch Jr. takes Polyjuice and uses his action skills to make a big appearance as Voldemort to make people think he's still alive. The Death Eaters continue their taking over the country under the Leadship of Pettigrew, Crouch and Malfoy, who are the only ones who know Voldemort is dead.

One day Malfoy poisons Pettigrew and on the next raid he kills Crouch with a curse in the back. To the public it looks like he broke free of his imperius and defeated Voldemort. The remaining Death Eaters flee, some are arrested, and Malfoy's friends turn out to have been imperiused. The next election, Malfoy the Dark Lord Slayer becomes Minister.

The problem with this premise is that there were actually people under the Imperius (that's the reason Malfoys excuse worked) who woke up when Voldemort lost his power. So they would also wake up if he would die... how would Barty, Peter and Lucius explain that?

** Turns out this whole time Voldemort was only trying to raise the Ministry's awareness on Muggleborns' rights by committing acts of terrorism against them. Now with Voldemort's threat gone, the Ministry had fallen into its old status quo. With a rather mild center-right narrative, Dolores Umbridge soon rose to power and only when she became Minister for Magic did she show her true nature as one of the most radical anti-Muggleborns, anti-halfbreeds leaders that Magical Britain ever had.

** What would be funnier, Voldemort makes horcruxes but when he returns, he is declared undesirable number one by Malfoy/Umbridge led ministry(now a facist regime that is expanding towards continental europe) so he has to team up with Harry to bring ministry down.
