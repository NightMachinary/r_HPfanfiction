(For those not in the know, Lunar Harmony is Harry/Hermione/Luna).

I've enjoyed quite a few ships exploring the dynamic within this trio, especially

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4321881/1/Deaths-Pride][Death's Pride]]
- and, in a life where I had more tolerance for fluff, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4757373/1/Heart-s-Home][Heart's Home]].

It seems I've hit some sort of black hole, where there is no more HP/HG/LL that doesn't devolve into Lord Harold Black-Potter-territory.

Any secret tips or recommendations? I'm generally open to all ratings and lengths, and have checked ff.net, schnoogle, and scryer so far.


** In additon to those mentioned already:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10359113/1/][Tempest of the Fae]] is pretty amusing, another story from the same challenge as Faery Heroes.

If you like Robst, there's always [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5210983/1/Fate-s-Gambit][Fate's Gambit]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5345583/1/FG2-The-Trio-Hit-Hogwarts][FG2 -- The Trio Hit Hogwarts]].

For humor, it's tough to beat [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!]].

There are others I'm forgetting right now, many of which are unfinished. If I happen to remember I will edit this.

Edit:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053661/1/][Harry Potter: The Forgotten Brother]] is a sort of crazy WBWL story. It has issues, but definitely worth a read.

Hm, what's the opposite of an acquired taste? I recently found his stuff to be very hit-and-miss.

I've read LL&L, but my recollection of it is "basically HPHG with some stuff about the Giant Squid, oh and Luna hangs around a bit as well". Not really very memorable.

Thank you for your other suggestions :). I'll have a look when I'm not at work <.<.

**** All of Robst's work has the same format. Harry is incredibly powerful. He's married/bonded/the like befOre he steps off the train with Hermione and then he shits on Dumbledore and Ron

***** I'm usually even fine with some bashing - in most cases, it just dissolves into exaggerating a character's weakness, which I might not have realized to begin with.

I've seen writers bash Harry (in fics where the narrative is not centered around him), and it is very refreshing.

Plus a lot of torture and rape as jokes. I don't know how people can laugh at that.

** There was another Lunar Harmony story I remember reading at some point last year. I can't remember the name of it. What I remember is that [[/Harry%20is%20rescued%20from%20the%20Dursley%20residence%20around%20age%207%20or%208%20by%20a%20Potter%20family%20house%20elf%20and%20taken%20to%20a%20Potter%20residence%20where%20he%20is%20instructed%20by%20the%20magical%20portraits%20of%20his%20paternal%20grandparents.%20%20He%20meets%20Hermione%20&%20Luna%20through%20a%20means%20I%20don't%20remember.%20%20They%20&%20their%20families,%20along%20with%20a%20released/escaped%20Sirius,%20move%20in%20and%20make%20one%20big%20weirdly%20happy%20family.][spoilers]]

Edit - how do I mark spoilers with the black text instead of the fake URL that's way too long to read easily?

*** Oh man, that sounds really familiar, but I'm struggling to find the title of the fic as well. Probably it's one of those which are just labelled as "Harry P." without any actual pairings because it involves more than 2 people >.<

** Hardly any, which is sad, because it is my favorite pairing.

I told myself that I would not write any more epic length FanFiction, but in this case, I think I will. There will be no Lord Potter, His wealth (inheritance) will be very moderate (maybe the equivalent of a couple of hundred thousand US dollars, not outside the realm of what happens every day in inheritance cases), and he will not immediately become HARRY the GODLIKE.

There will be no Soul Bond of any kind. Period. I don't mind the concept as fluff, but this will be a more realistic look at things.

Will Harry be Powerful? Yes, this is Canon (diving off all the dementors with a single patronus).

If anyone can think of any other tropes that I should avoid, please let me know. If anyone is interested, let me know and I will post the link to the first chapter when I have it written. If you think I shouldn't waste my time, you can let me know that too. Doesn't mean I will listen.

Why am I rambling? I'm stuck at work with nothing else to do :(

*** I'm sure it goes without saying, but the Ginny and Ron bashing, (plus optional: love potion) trope is to be avoided at all costs.

I don't really know of any really good, convincing and well-paced Lunar Harmony fics out there, so it should be interesting to finally see one that +doesn't suck+ isn't fluffy, outrageous, and/or totally out of character. I look forward to what you come out with!

*** Here's the summary :

#+begin_quote
  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; *manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny*
#+end_quote

No. Just no.

(Although it is hardly worse than Death's Pride, I suppose. The first chapter of that fic is the most retarded start to a fic I've ever read.)
