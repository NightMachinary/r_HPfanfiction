So I don't read female Harry at all normally and I was wondering if there is anything along the lines of /temporary/ fem!Harry (say, due to a potions accident) or crossdressing!Harry (like a reverse Mulan). Because always female Harry doesn't do it for me though I had a few reqs for that before so I intend to give them a shot.


** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/546831/kyaru-chan][Harveste Addams]] series has a crossdressing Harry. it's Harry raised by the Addams family after he murderizes the Dursleys.

** Just thinking about it, Mulan's situation was that she couldn't participate as she wanted to unless she posed as a man. Similar hijinks were in play for Alanna the Lioness- for which I can recommend linkffn(the Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter). In order for Harry to need to appear as a witch, the whole society would be upended. It would be an interesting AU- only women have magic and they are fully expecting to be visiting a new witch at her home only to find that the Hogwarts letter has been sent to a boy with magic... but it would be a different story and world, entirely different than the Potter one. Harry couldn't be famous because hiding him as a witch wouldn't make sense.

Now, if Albus decided to hide Harry by changing him into a girl, that might work, but the few stories I've seen where that had happened it was always a ridiculously evil Dumbledore who would both with that level of shenanigans, no doubt also including a 'block on his/her magic' and other sorts of storybook injustices. Still wouldn't fulfill the idea of a /willingly/ transvestite male witch.

I've seen a few potions-accident Harriettes, but they are predominantly excuses to hook up newly-permanently-fem!Harry with Draco, Snape, Lucius, Voldemort or all of the above. Possible exceptions would be linkffn(Effects and Side Effects by Pheonix Dawn) and linkffn(Season of Change by BranchWraith).

  When Harry Potter dies trying to save her life, Daphne Greengrass takes his place to prevent the wizarding world from collapsing into a panic at the return of Voldemort and the loss of the boy-who-lived. Can she keep her secret and pretend to be the hero the world needs long enough to find a way to bring the real thing back to life? Or will she eventually stop needing to pretend?
