So, I have been reading HP fanfiction since GoF was released 18 years ago. In all that time I had never found a story featuring Harry as a new Dark Lord that I enjoyed. They were all just, I don't know, unlogical? There always were a ton of obvious plot holes that made me abandon the stories rather quickly.

Then I found "The Sum of Their Parts" by holdmybeer linkffn(11858167) yesterday. I could not stop reading. It's characterizations were sublime.

Now I am wondering if I have missed any other fics like this. Where Harry turns dark with a believable plot and where Ron and Hermione don't run straight for the hills at the first signs of dark magic/intentions.

Thanks in advance!


** You might wanna try linkffn(Made of Common Clay). Here we have a bitter Harry who doesn't want to reform traditional wizarding Britain, he wants to destroy it. Hermione and Ron are very supportive of him.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

**** I would suggest that (spoiler) it's a curse that leads you to reveal truths that you keep hidden. Thus it revealed how Simon really thought, but would tend to keep hidden, or couch in nicer terms. For example, one of the first things we learn about Simon and Ginny's relationship, is that he's very focused on having a well-dressed girlfriend, and he cares about clothes. One of the things that he must've been biting his tongue on hard would be her clothes - she's a sports player, a Weasley, and her mum hand knits. So with a compulsion to tell the truth about what's on his mind, as soon as he comes home and sees Ginny wearing something he doesn't like, that's what comes out. (/spoiler)

****** I really don't like the Umbridge 'got raped by Centaurs', I'm fully aware of the myths-Greek myths were far and away my favourite-but JK Rowling's Centaurs were never meant to be like that and it basically means Umbridge is right. Much more likely Umbrdge was simply traumatised by being in their mere presence. In any case Hermione certainly had no idea it would happen.

Snape was likely not even singed considering the flames could be held in your hands. Seemed much more likely it was a visual effect to grab his attention.

Still, Hermione is someone that you wouldn't want to ever betray. She can be vindictive.

...Umm...neither technology nor settlements are indicative of the 'ordiliness of society'. I come from Australia, our Aboriginal people were wanderers, but they most certainly had an orderly society (a society with rules/leaders/etc.).

Centaurs, are quite happy as they are and there's nothing in the books that indicates that's there's anything inferior about their society. They even understand prophecies better than humanity.

I really don't think JK Rowling was trying to say that Umbridge was right in her hate for Centaurs.

Firenze is clearly a good person, the Centaurs ultimatetly did the right thing as well fighting against Voldemort (they may even have been right to not interefere initially-Harry was meant to die in the forest).

Harry wasn't necessarily happy being a scary badass, but he certainly was scary, and, it was him hunting down and killing Death Eaters, as opposed to, say, getting captured within days of Hermione being gone, because he doesn't know the magic needed to conceal the encampment. Or, for that matter, as opposed to dying to the first Death Eater he goes after, because, while a talented athlete with excellent reflexes, he is still half-trained and barely experienced in adult wizard combat. The author just glosses over how Harry suddenly acquired those skills.

Meanwhile, Hermione and Ron just happen to do all the wrong things the moment Harry isn't around. Indeed, they are mentioned later in the fic:

#+begin_quote
  "And now, all those you once cared for are dead. The impoverished blood traitors, the filthy mudblood -- you remember her screams, don't you, Harry? The way she begged for you to forgive her for abandoning you? The way she insisted, as she lay there broken and dying, that you would save her? It was most amusing, I must say." His serpentine voice caressed the taunts obscenely.
#+end_quote

By the way, what's with that bit with Hermione insisting the Harry would save her? Couldn't the author at least leave her some dignity? It's like he has this preoccupation with inflating Harry's ability and importance at the expense of other characters.

** The Charming Universe by Lomonaaren on AO3 is great. Harry becomes a Dark Lord to save Hogwarts from the Ministry. At first it's in name only, but he sees himself slightly corrupted as time goes on. Ron and Hermione aren't 100% supportive in this series, but they don't abandon Harry either. I really enjoy this author, and feel this fits.

*** Thanks, I read many of his other stories but never took a look at this series. He is one of the very few slash authors I enjoy actually, his characterizations just make sense.

***** Thanks! Reading HP fanfiction has actually a lot to do with that. That was one of the things I started to do to improve my English while I was still in school. Besides watching all movies and series in their original language. Got to the point now that I even dream in English instead of German most of the time.

******* Well, to be fair, it is a lot easier to learn English than it is to learn German or most other languages. Not only is English easier, it is used so widely that people from for example Germany are confronted with it constantly, side effect of the internet age I guess.
