Looking for any ^{^{completed}} fics that gave you that weird feeling that something was just not "right", but nothing that Is overtly horror-like (like The Lament Configuration) or "oooh Voldemort Is growing inside Little Harryyyyy" stuff.

Mostly looking for any "everyday stuff", but unsettling.

Thanks!

Edit: after reading the first chapter, I was mistaken. I've already read it t some point. Oh well.

  Harry Potter is finally 17. Free to leave the Dursleys behind and start a new life as an independent wizard (if staying at Ron´s until he gets that apartment in London can be called independence, anyway), he does what any young man in possession of a good fortune would: he third-wheels and goes to a museum. It´s not really a bad plan. The Malfoys had announced they had made a big donation to the newly opened "Myths and Prophecies: Lord Voldemort´s secret collection": The Boy With The Green Eyes collection. All of it.

  RRS: the Recourse Reserved Specialists, a lesser-known division of the Serious Organized Crime Agency, where cases are sent to die. Only this time, it's personal. When Harry Potter, an unassuming barista from Surrey, calls in with information about Tom Riddle, and Draco Malfoy is sent to interview him, neither of them realizes how the investigation will disrupt what they thought they knew about their lives.[ This story is not in any way representative of how law enforcement really operates. Relatedly: influenced by Hannibal (the TV show) & Hannibal Lecter book series (...in separate ways, and without cannibalism). ]Updates: On hold until 2019, pending life smoothing out a bit.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]

** You might like this? Crookshanks comes back from the dead (kind of) to help Hermione and Snape catch a necromancer?

linkao3(21654745)

That plot kind of wraps up halfway through but the whole story is fun.

Contains the line (spoken by Death): "Farewell, Hermione Granger. I will make certain to bring all of your past and future cats when we meet again."

It really isn't creepy or horrific, despite how it sounds! I found it fun.

Edit: Please don't downvote me if you don't like it! I tried!

#+begin_quote
  After the war, Hermione returns to Hogwarts and finds herself in the possession of an undead cat on a mission. Thank goodness, because there's a mysterious necromancer raising inferi from the corpses of the battle of Hogwarts, and as usual, Hermione and Harry find a way to dive head-first into danger. Not content to just risk their lives, the two of them must also face down new revelations about themselves will drive them away from old friends and closer to controversial figures - including one specific, beloved asshole in his flappy-flappy swooshy-swooshy robes. Severus is learning the meaning of the phrase 'no rest for the wicked.' Despite his best attempts, he's survived the war. Minerva keeps him employed (and blackmails him whenever he tries to quit), and he's got an Order of Merlin (which he keeps trying to throw in the lake), but he finds himself lacking in purpose. The worst part? There's this insufferable know-it-all chit trying to be helpful and friendly. Oh, and the necromancer. That guy's pretty bad, too. SS/HG. Drarry occurs as well. My first fic ever, pls no bully; I was just writing a little fluff but I got distracted by a plot-like object and I'm sorry.
