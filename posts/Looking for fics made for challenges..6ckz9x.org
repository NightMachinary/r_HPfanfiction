  And good God, under starry skies we are lost... And into the breach we got tossed... And the water's coming in fast! Did I build this ship to wreck? (-Florence and the Machine) Padma/Astoria, for the Doomed Ship Challenge on Mugglenet FanFic. Warnings: Heavy alcohol abuse, mild sexual situations.

  Rose says that I am an oblivious moron, but would an oblivious moron have such a deep and sensitive diary? I don't think so. No one knows how I suffer in this ridiculous family. Written for SIYE's The Burrow Secret Challenge 2016, and inspired by Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole.

** Lots of mine started that way. This one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic]] was written for a challenge on hpff (though I deleted it from there a while back). This one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11300719/1/Two-Down-Solanum-Atropurpureum]] was written for a Teachers' Lounge challenge on ffn and this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10881800/1/The-Life-cycle-of-Eels]] was for a HPFC challenge on ffn.

Edit: I just remembered one I wrote for a smut challenge on ao3 too. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4073086]] ( think I must have been a challenge whore at one time)

** A challenge site I follow has a collection on Ao3, so you can filter by fandom/character, etc. Since it is a multi-fandom challenge site. But I find the writing quality on that site to be fairly high.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/RoughTradeNaNo13]] (it says 13, but all following years continued to use the same collection)

Admittedly, the terms of the challenge aren't always included. And since that site is multi-fandom, challenges are kind of vague: "second chances" was one (most of them ended up being time travel); or, characters in a different universe. The most specific one was Sentinel fusions, that actually got its own collection:

** I have a few posted on FFN that were written for challenges. I'm not saying they're good, but they're there.

linkffn(8201678; 7613015; 7382146; 7061637)

Also, weirdly, one of the habitual plagiarizers has uploaded one of of my contest stories in the past, despite me never posting it myself since it was really bad (and that's saying something given the quality of some of my stories that I do have posted.)

  The unthinkable has happened. I was so close to winning, so many people laid down their lives for me, but I've failed. Voldemort escaped. I thought I had found them all, but I was wrong. There's another Horcrux out there, and I don't know where or what it is.

  Winner of the October DLP Azkaban!Harry story contest. Harry Potter, imprisoned by a fluke stroke of luck, wakes up to a new world filled with spaceships, an all-powerful Military Government, and the ragtag crew of Serenity. Where does Magic fit in?

  One last desperate gambit lands Harry in the past, to change the whole course of history - for the better. There's no turning back on the path Harry has taken, no second chances. Dark!Harry, vampire!Harry, time travel. 4th place in May DLP challenge.
