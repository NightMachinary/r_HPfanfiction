** Snape had neither Bellatrix's insanity nor Malfoy's tactical/strategic failings, and Voldemort isn't likely to be too terribly distressed by Snape being a Half-Blood. What held Snape back from being universally considered Voldemort's right hand was the fact that being a spy always comes with quotation marks in the loyalty column, but even then Snape was a man even other Death Eaters feared to squabble with. Snape was also considered one of the top professionals in Britain for both Potions and the Dark Arts.

As a Half Blood whose entire life was run on Spite he would also be much more likely to stay loyal to Voldemort when Voldemort inevitably turned on the Pureblood oligarchs, so I think its likely that he'd go down in history as a man whose infamy was only ever eclipsed by Voldemort, being only a few short steps away from being considered a Dark Lord in his own right.

** The Snape in Puzzle is Voldemort's poisoner, killing his enemies with poisons too subtle to detect. Seems like a suitable job for his skill set.

*** I agree.

Puzzle was such an unnerving story. One of the rare stories where Lily's character is well written.

** The piece of sh#t kind?

Seriously, Severus Snape probably would have been one of the worst. He may not have been evil, per se, but he was a disgusting, hateful, bitter, loathsome, sad excuse of a... person who took his frustrations out on children.

He probably caused quite many gifted potioneers to drop the subject, because they didn't feel like putting up with a semi-sadistic teacher who honestly deserved less respect than the dirt under their shoe.

****** His treatment of kids, disgusting and despicable as it is, has no bearing on his role within the Death Eater's ranks.

I'm ignoring the OP's question and piling dirt on Snape, because I loathe him, felt like stomping on him, and I was bored.

** One of the most terrifying. Bare in mind that Snape was such a useful spy because he was one of the core marked Death Eaters who Voldemort summoned to his resurrection. This was despite him being just a few years out of school and an unimportant, muggle raised half-blood by the end of the first war, so he must have risen through the ranks fast with a spectacular show of skill and enthusiasm.

Then even though Snape had been vouched for by Dumbledore as a spy and spent a decade and a half working for him, Voldemort accepted him back into his full confidence immediately as a double agent, and later makes him Headmaster of Hogwarts, one of the most prestigious posts in the country even if he wasn't replacing Dumbledore. This is even before you consider the skills that Snape is shown to have in canon, both in potions and curses. He is the only person who Dumbledore bothers consulting about dark magic (keeping him alive from the curse on the ring and helping Katie Bell in book 6).

** A sneaky one. Even before Voldemort threatens Lily, he still spies for Voldemort. So I'd think he'd be associated with jobs that needed a more subtle approach such as infiltrations and poisoning.

**** Well that's how he ended up at Hogwarts. Snape says to Bellatrix in HBP Ch 2 that he stayed at Hogwarts because that's where Voldemort ordered him to remain. So this would imply that Voldemort gave the order before he disappeared, therefore indicating that he got the job to spy on Dumbledore.

** To me he seems ambitious so he would have had no trouble climbing the death eater ranks - I see him as obsessively loyal (like he was obsessed over Lily Evans) and incredibly ruthless - think of the spells he invented while he was in school. Also constantly having to prove himself as a halfblood would probably increase his viciousness
