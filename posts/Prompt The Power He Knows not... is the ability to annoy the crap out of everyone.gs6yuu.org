I can see this being a real funny fic.

Dumbledore: Harry, please give me the sword back.

Harry: No.

Dumbledore, slightly irritated: Harry, I was only being polite...

Harry: What do you even want with a sword, old man? I mean, at your age, you really shouldn't be going to fight dragons or whatever.

Calm, unflappable Dumbledore: *DAMN IT POTTER!!!*


** This is an interesting idea. Trolling Harry. If this isn't a trope it should be.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

** There was one I read where in the Goblet of Fire, in the dragon tournament thing, where he sits down at the back at a transfigured desk I think. Then eventually a whole army of owls drop off thousands of howlers which all in perfect unison start shouting at the dragon at decibels so high that it hurt the dragon. When the dragon started attacking the howlers it didn't notice Harry grab the egg. It was great. I'm sorry that I can't remember that one though...

As the flair suggests, I've read too much fanfiction.
