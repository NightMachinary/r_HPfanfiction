This is all I can remember:

• Harry uses gringotts to hire a mute house elf and learns sign language to communicate with her

• he hires goblins to go through his accounts, I'm sure the goblins have arm bands that change colour when he hires them, and he hires one on probation?

• I think he moves into the attic of privet drive

• he learns to paint

• I remember he's in a room with his goblins when another one opens the door and tries to take over and harry pretends that he's poor so the goblin loses interest


** Not the one you are looking for, but Harry also hires a mute house-elf in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). This one is often recommended here and my favorite postwar fic.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  He was a genius. He could paint, play music, talk to snakes, control fire. He was more powerful and intelligent then any knew. He had strong 'friends'. The problem was, he had few emotions. Dark Harry. I Do Not Own Harry Potter. -Slash-
