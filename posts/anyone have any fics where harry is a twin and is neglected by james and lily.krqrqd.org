**** It is a series- all 7 years. It is incredibly long though. I remember it took me months to finish the first 5 books in the series (reading daily). Then, I just didn't finish the last two due to IRL reasons. I really enjoyed the series though and I am very glad she finished it.

It is very dark and does have a lot of character bashing which is something I dont enjoy much these days. But at the time I read it, I really liked the series. Do give it a try.

I would say that the first 3 parts are definitely the best. The way she describes the magic is very different. Her OCs are also /real/. I definitely recommend trying the first part.

It's not textbook abuse, but like the author said, one child being more valuable or whatever isn't right either.
