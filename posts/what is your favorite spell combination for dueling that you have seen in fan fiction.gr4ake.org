** I can't remember the name for the life of me. Avis Spam > Cannonblast spell (to deafen) > Serpentsortia.

NOBODY checks their footing. Especially when you are recreating a Hitchcock movie. Cannonblast spell deafens parseltongue.

Hell, you could probably just bombarda maxima the ground at their feet while they are busy getting mauled by birds.

Avis is my favorite spell AND contender for most OP. Distraction, attack spell, shotgun conjuration to catch unforgivables, shotgun conjuration to catch other spells, trap detector, etc.

It's practically the combat version of Prestidigitation

** Good opening for an attack: Do a ton of duplication charms on some plastic explosives, put them in a bigger on the inside bag and add a simple time trigger, either mechanical or magical. Super powerful explosion and it doesn't take any effort of the user since all the magic involved was done in advance. If someone tries to cancel the magic the expanded space collapsing will trigger the explosion. Can also be delivered to your enemy via owl. Best done if unexpected.
