I've read quite a few fics where Harry ends up in his younger body, where he ends up simply in the past in the same body, where he finds out he's a girl under a glamour, where he ends up in the past before he's born and gets to see his parents...

I've also read a few like the topic says where Harry ends up in the wrong body. Lockhart (Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly), Bellatrix (Harry Potter and the Grim Mishap), Hermione (A Switched Chance), and an OC in a darker alternate world where he ends up in a suddenly grown version of his dead female sibling (Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) ... and I was wondering if there were others of this particular genre.

The who isn't exactly important. Could be someone he knows from canon or it could be an OC. Boy or girl, same year as 'present' him, younger year, higher year, graduated, etc... again the who isn't that important. As long as it's not Voldemort... kind of defeat the purpose of fixing things imo if you end up as the villain and can just stop things with a snap of your fingers.

The how isn't important. Could be a mishap or Death/Harry's Reaper/whomever decides that Harry gets another chance to fix things but not as Harry Potter. Harry Potter still exists in that world but it would not be him.

He'd still be able to defeat Voldemort himself or he could just make it easier for 'Harry' to do it.

Tl;dr - Just a fic where Harry is sent back in time somehow but doesn't end up in the proper body for one reason or another even if 'Harry Potter' still technically exists.

Sorry I tend to make my requests rather long and descriptive, don't I?

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]
