  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!

*** Couldn't handle the ron bashing in that one. Didn't even get to Luna, it was too cartoonish.

** In the Venom Peddler, by Lightningfurystrike, on FanFiction, is a long read, but it's got a couple of times in it when Harry proves to the Ravenclaws that screwing with Luna would be bad for them...

It's a non traditional HP story, with him imprinting on 6 basilisks, and no real slash going on...

  HPTN slash. AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically. Amoral Harry, seven parts. COMPLETE.
