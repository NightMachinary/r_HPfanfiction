Marauder era or whatever era, as long as they're good. I've just read All the Young Dudes and I feel like I'll never read something as good as that but I still want to believe.

Of course Wolfstar is very much appreciated.

Fics I'm reading or have read already:

Unbroken promises

Shoebox project

Stealing Harry


** I've seen several recs for /Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban/ recently. I read the first few chapters and it was a bit too sad for the mood I've been in lately, though I've marked it to read later. Genfic, so far as I can tell. linkao3(6510730).

*** I'll second this one. Dark and the characterization of the Marauders is generally spot on, so although the dialogue can be a little clunky at points, one of my favorites.

#+begin_quote
  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight. (Light Remus/Sirius.)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/54783][Survivor's Guilt]] is a Wolfstar series. The second fic is called Moony's Tale, and while it can be read on its own I think reading them in order really adds depth to the series as a whole.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1873704/1/Kisses][Kisses]] is a Wolfstar oneshot. I really enjoy reading Remus and Siruis' conversation in this one - it's a favorite fic and I reread it often.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12299451/chapters/27959679][Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow]] focuses on Remus having a conversation with Hermione. Very well written, and one of the better characterizations of Remus that I've seen. This fic is part of a series of standalones, and I would recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125][Calibration]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12042771][Let it Choke]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11172114][How to Be Happy]] as well.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3615783][Remus's Special Friends]] is set during the time he was a Professor at Hogwarts and shows his relationships with some of his students.

** linkffn(Oblivious by Jess Pallas)

This was written before the series finished, so it's old and not *completely* canon compliant...but for a fic written before we knew Fenrir Greyback existed, it sure nails a lot of what he did to Remus. Just find and replace a name or two.

I'm doing a bit of a reread of this and the sequel /Imperius/.

There were little, half-moon scars around his knuckles, too inconsequential to see unless light hit them at an angle and made them silvery with scar tissue. He wondered if other werewolves had these scars too, whether they were a telltale sign too mundane to have made it into the textbooks.Remus had hoped, too.
