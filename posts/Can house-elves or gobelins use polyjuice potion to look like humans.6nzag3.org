** I would say no. Potions are delicate and temperamental in canon. To me that suggests they are very specialised and would therefore be restricted to human to human transformation. Hermione and the cat suggests this might be true. It might be possible that modifications could be made to the potion to allow cross species transformations and compared to some of the things I've seen in fics this wouldn't be too immersion breaking for me.

** No.\\
Polyjuice is sympathetic magic, it's the subtility that Snape venerates, not a blunt instrument. It's effect is hard to obtain (a month to brew it), need preparation (the part of the one you want to turn into), is very limited (1h, only humans), is only cosmetic (you aren't magically able to act like the one you copy); but, in a prepared hand, it can be extremely powerfull (see: Uther's progeny; bank robery; flying cakes).\\
Now, it could probably allow a house elf to impersonate another house elf, a goblin another goblin.... would Flitwick or Hagrid be able to use it with human hairs? What happen if you try it with a werewolf hair under a full moon? These are probably the questions that keep Snape greasy!

*** I actually think the "human's only" limit for Polyjuice is why Dumbledore trusts Hagrid as Harry's guide. He /can't/ be mimicked with Polyjuice, and there are likely not many half-giants around if like can imitate like.

**** That is excellent and I've never thought about that while reading the books. Really does give extra credence to Dumbledore seemingly insane but actually smart and resourceful.
