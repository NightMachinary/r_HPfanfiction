I've been looking for fics that explore the friendship between female characters.


** I'd be interested in any recs on this theme too.

You might like [Iacta Alea Est]([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11491209]]) by Eli Morgan on ao3. It's over 200,000 words long and the writing is good.

Luna, Hermione, Ginny, and Lavender are inadvertently dragged back in time to avert some of the disasters of the original time-line. They disagree on how to approach the situation and have to compromise and negotiate. It turns into a bit of a training montage and there's a great scene when they decide to get into shape and take up running (or, for some of them, jogging.)

Eventually I lost patience with the pace of the plot, but I enjoyed the set-up in the early chapters.

*** I tried. Word of warning, it bogs down fast, and gets rediculous quickly. I wasn't able to get far, but the overall good quality of writing kept me around for far longer than the rest of the story warrented.

Some highlights:

-14yr old Ginny was so in love with Sirius that she felt guilty about having sex with Harry in Grimauld Place after the war was over

-17yr old Ginny modeled for playwizard and was embarrassed into silence about people seeing the picture when Luna showed it off

-Somehow Hermione had time to have sex with Remus while he was married to Tonks (presumably often based on context)

-Lavender is suddenly a 'Weak' werewolf who's lifeforce is tied to Young Remus?

*** Thanks! I'm going to read it now.

It's interesting because time travel stories usually don't involve all these characters together. I like that Lavender is a part of the plot too.

** While it isn't the main theme, I like the camaraderie between the characters in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/][Where in the world is Harry Potter?]] series.

** *Ginny and Luna*

[[https://pubfiles.elusiveguy.com/J4AEk8cTPwNAzaw][Faith and Understanding]] is one of the best one-shot fics I know. Ginny and Luna's friendship, and Ginny's musings therein.
