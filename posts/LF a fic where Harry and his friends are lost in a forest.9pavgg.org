I think it was on ffn, on the train ride to Hogwarts there was some sort of attack and Harry and a bunch of other people were trapped in a magic dampening forest. They built a little colony of sorts that didn't use magic. I remember a scene where two people shrank their school trunks and Hermione compared how they felt afterwards. I think Snape stumbled across their colony at some point?
