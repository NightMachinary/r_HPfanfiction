As it says on the tin.

For me it's: misspelingss, Dumbles/Siri/Moldyshorts/Voldie etc., bad grammar and addressing the reader directly ("This is my first fic","Read and review", "Poll up" etc.)

Personally I would change the first sentence from " Harry Potter has had many titles in his life: Boy-Who-Lived, Auror, Master of the Mystic Arts. " to " Harry Potter has many titles: Boy-Who-Lived, Auror, Master of the Mystic Arts. "

It seems smoother to me (especially since those titles seem to still apply to him).

** What if this summary was nothing but questions? What if I kept asking the same question but just altered the wording slightly?

The lovely Revising or warning that the fic is abandoned so they can write a new version... that hasn't been updated in 6 years.

HP stories with non magic AUs. If Harry and co don't have their magic then it's not Harry Potter fanfiction. I could understand a fic where they went to another land and had to learn the local magic or "find" their magic again, but no magic whatsoever? Hard no.

This is specific to AO3 fics but stories that seem to have more tags than words in the story. Where they list every single pairing or character, no matter how small a part they play in the story. Where they put silly tags like "This is my fic and I'm gonna write it my way" or other non story descriptive things. You get the idea.

*** I understand where you're coming from, but disagree about magicless AUs. There's more to Harry Potter than the magic.

I think the important aspects of any work are the characters, their relationships with each other, and the worldbuilding. Fanfiction can fiddle with each and can change one completely, but not much more than that.

So non-magic AUs can have the same/similar personalities and relationships between characters, and the fanfiction becomes about exploring them in a different setting. It's not everyone's thing, but it's still a legitimate fanfic.

If you take the superheroes out of comic books then it just becomes the normal day-to-day lives of people. If you took the zombies away from The walking Dead then it just becomes your average post-apocalyptic show. Etc.

If you take the magic out of Harry Potter then it just becomes a boring story about kids going away to school. There's no house elves or ghosts or talking portraits or magic shopping areas.

Speaking of summaries, tell me what you think of this one:

Fic Title: Cleaved

Fic Summary: v. split or sever (something), especially along a natural line or grain. +The Muggle and Wizarding Worlds have been cleaved for centuries. Some Muggle-raised embrace the Wizarding World like a well-worn glove, never looking back. Others hold a tenacious tie to the Muggle World. Holly Lillian Potter is one of them.+ EDIT (9/2/19 @7:34PMEST): AU. Holly Potter was to be raised in the Muggle World for her safety, return to the Wizarding World at eleven, and leave her deplorable family behind to learn magic. A Squib-born friend, an under-the-radar education, and a suspicious business running, though, the Wizarding World will get far more than it bargained for with the Girl-Who-Lived.

*** ehhh... For me it looks like a High School-level student trying to be clever... and failing miserably. Too much words and illogical statements. "Muggle-raised embrace the Wizarding World like a well-worn glove" ? That analogy makes no sense, besides it sounds strange, even dirty.

EDIT(3/9/19 12:48 GMT): Better for me, but still... why "under-the-radar" and not just plain "secret"? And it should be "get from" not "get with". Also the last sentence is not a proper sentence. Where's the verb?

"With a squib-born friend, a secret education, and a suspicious business running, the Wizarding World will get far more than it bargained for from the Girl-Who-Lived." ---> this at least makes grammatical sense and sounds better to my ears, although the "far", "for" and "from" are a bit too much fs.

My professor always said to read everything out loud and see how it sounds. Try it, it should help. It does for me.

- When the summary is filled with bad grammar and misspelled words.

- Not a summary but if a fanfic has too many chapters with very low word count(say 70 chapters and 25k words), i will skip it.

Non-Summaries (that contain all sorts of bullshit, but nothing about the fanfic in question!) are bad, too

Otherwise I am pretty open (as I said: I discard stuff I don't want to read like Harry/Draco ASAP, no questions asked, no looking inside etc. - I wouldn't read that if all other reading materials in the world suddenly burst into flames! In fact if that were the case? I'd try to make a fortune re-creating some of the greats like Lord of the Rings :D )

** Summaries that have Don't like, Don't read. I mean, it goes without saying right?

Summaries that have cliche tropes.

Summaries that have false pairings. There were many a times it started off as Ron/Hermione and Draco/Hermione or Snape/Hermione. I don't care about those pairings, but don't try to trick your reader.

Obviously obvious gramatical errors. I don't mind some unintentional misspelling but I'll be vary.

I tend to avoid non-canon pairings but also Harry/Ginny. So those.

Character bashing (any).

Summaries that shows that OCs are a main character in the story.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.
