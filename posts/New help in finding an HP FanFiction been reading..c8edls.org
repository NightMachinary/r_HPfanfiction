:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So after months of trying to find the fanfiction I had started to read, but lost the link due to computer crashing, I am seeking help, that someone may know of the story I am looking for.

​

It is an story of where Voldemort captures Harry at his home, through the use of Parseltongue, and him not unable to resist.

​

I found it on [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]]

​

thank you for any help.


** I've read a couple of different fics in which Voldemort capture's Harry at the Dursleys' house. Can you provide any other details about that scene or other parts of the fic?
