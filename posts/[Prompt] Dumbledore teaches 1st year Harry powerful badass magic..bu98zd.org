Things like the firewhip, fiendfyre, badass armor transfigurations. This should be humorous, with a slightly irresponsible Dumbledore teaching an awestruck child.

** “Now Harry remember the spell is aresto momentum.”

“I've got it sir but are you sure we should be practicing that here? Wouldn't it make sense to start somewhere not at the top of the astronomy tower?”

“Nonsense my boy, this is how my mentor taught me. “

Dumbledore then gives Harry a hard shove sending him tumbling over the wall.

“I see you've lost ahold of your wand. No need to make it harder on yourself my dear boy.”

** But.. but.. Harry is still a first year, so he's shit at the spells. Albus is frustrated, but compensates by trying to teach him even more outstanding magic.

Harry is still having shitloads of problems, because he never learnt the basics, since his super!training started day two of his Hogwarts life. Therefore Albus tries motivating him by teaching him about the worst of Toms actions, his goals, his part in Harry's orphaning, and terrifies Harry into weeks of nightmares. Albus sees none of this.

Pomfrey, being old, and an old school pureblood witch, from who was raised in the 40s, sees nothing wrong with this.

*** C'mon don't be a buzzkill. This is a joke prompt.

Dumbledore: "Wanna learn how to shoot lightning like in Star Wars?"

Harry: "Yes! But when did you see the movies?"

Dumbledore: "When I foisted off my paperwork on Minerva. She technically ran the government that day. Good times."
