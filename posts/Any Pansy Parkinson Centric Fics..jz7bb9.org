Can anybody recommend me a Pansy Parkinson fix. Or shows Pansy in a realistic light. not just a vapid bitch who simmers after Malfoy? Cause I only have one that is incomplete, it's called Atheris by xenomorpheus.


** If you're into HP fanfiction then you've probably already heard of it, but there's one called Draconian. I wouldn't say it's a Pansy fic, so maybe not quite what you're after. But she does have quite a prevalent role in it.

** She's prominent in both these:

The Auction is written by someone who had written 2 other fics that are (the right thing to do, all the wrong things) Draco/Hermione post-war and the Auction is that relationship in an AU where Voldemort won. Does this make sense? I've read the auction it's great and has one chapter left to be updated, it's updated consistently. I assume Pansy is also prominent in The Right Thing To Do and All The Wrong Things but I haven't read them.

Breath Mints/ Battle Scars had bern highly rec to me but I haven't read it yet it's Draco/Hermione year 8 when they all return to complete school but I have heard she's prominent there and has her own romantic storyline as well.

  For a moment, she's almost giddy. Because Draco Malfoy's been ruined by this war and he's as out of place as she is and --- yes, he has scars too. He's got an even bigger one. She wonders whether one day they'll compare sizes.

#+begin_quote
  In the wake of the Dark Lord's triumph over Harry Potter, the defeated must learn their new place. Hermione Granger, former Golden Girl, has been captured and reduced to human chattel. Sold to the highest bidder as the top prize at an auction of Order members and sympathizers, she is thrust into the rabid, waiting hands of the Death Eaters. But despite the horrors of Voldemort's new world, help---and hope---seem to arise from the most unlikely of places.PART 3 of the RIGHTS AND WRONGS series.

  She meets a pack of Australian muggles at a pub in Barcelona; they tell her that they're staying in a youth hostel with bunk beds and communal bathrooms and rat traps in the hallways---and she sneers in response, half-cocked and semi-automatic, but then a bottle of Absinthe is produced from an Army-issue canvas knapsack and she's being handed a fire-filled glass and told to ‘say hi to the green fairy' and the lights spin and the room tilts and she smokes her first cigarette and kisses her first stranger and smears her pearl-pink lipstick on a cocktail napkin to wipe the sweat off her face and she hears herself laugh and laugh and laugh and there's music pulsing in bass-heavy shockwaves up the notches of her spine and there's salt on the insides of her thighs and the hollows of her hips and she isn't Pansy Parkinson anymore, no, she isn't a girl who hides or runs or escapes, no, she's someone else she's someone new she's someone who's breathing and fighting and alive---

  Because there's a word for what she's doing.

  “Why are you here?” Parvati asked Pansy once. People asked her a lot, when they found her in Flourish and Blotts, or at work on the Prophet. Their eyes raked her, looking for green, for silver, for venom. Sometimes she'd smile back and let them see the danger. "Because I'm not fifteen anymore," said Pansy. "God, do you know what precious Potter Sr. got up to at school, the bully? But boys get to grow up to be men, you see, and us girls just grow up to be bitches."

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
