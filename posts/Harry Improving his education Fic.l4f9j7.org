:END:
Looking for a specific fic where a harry time traveled to possess his younger body and started doing better in some classes and taking new ones. Two things I remember about this fic were harry taking a transfiguration class with the twins and taking a lower year ancient runes class with Susan Bones,Luna Lovegood and Astoria Greengrass because Susan switched classes like Harry and Astoria was bumped up a year in ancient runes.
