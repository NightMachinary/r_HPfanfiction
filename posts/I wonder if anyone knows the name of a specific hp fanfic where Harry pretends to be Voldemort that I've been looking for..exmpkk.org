:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A while back, I read a Fanfic on Fanfiction.net that had Harry pretending to be Voldemort during his absence. So, I think he was a kid and death eater's where watching him, Lucius specifically and mistook him for a reincarnation of Voldemort so he ran with that. I think he may have travelled back to his child form.

Either that or he was a Vampire/MoD version who found himself as a child and seeked out Lucius to try and establish himself as the Dark Lord and take over the Death Eaters.

I think he also used the Malfoy Manor as a meeting point and none of the Death Eaters except the inner circle actually knew who he was, and he finds a way to convince Remus and the werewolves to join him as well as break out Belltrix and Sirius out of Azkaban while still pretending. Also, it's probably a relatively longer Fanfic.

I'm not sure on exact details, I've read a lot since then so I may be mixing a few different ones together. Sorry if this is confusing or not specific enough. Thank you to anyone who's kind enough to try and help, I really appreciate it!

Edit: Thank you so much for the Help! But [[/u/SilverCookieDust][u/SilverCookieDust]] seems to have found what I was searching for so I am extremely grateful for that! For anyone who's curious it was Curse Of Fate by Mistress Nika.

** Sounds familiar. Might be Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. He pretends there. There's a couple more like that, but I can't remember them at the moment. I'll poke around.

*** Thanks a lot! Unfortunately I don't think I've ever heard of them before so I don't think it's one of those. This is still helpful though, I'll check just to be sure, so Thank you!
