... though hides behind glamours and she's known as a squib potions maker, and from what I can remember Hermione was adopted by the Malfoys. Tom Riddle also teaches defense and uses Voldemort as an alter ego. He also sort of won the war because Dumbledore and The Order of the Phoenix were also forced into hiding. Harry's famous in Beauxbaton and even though he didn't really submit his name just an empty piece of paper (parchment?) he still ended up as Beauxbaton's Champion. Oh, and Draco's the Hogwarts Champion. And Lily wanted Harry to be the French minister of magic, I think.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! I forgot where I read this if it was on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] or Ao3, also forgot to follow or subscribe it then forgotten about it at some point. I was wondering if that fic updated recently and I really can't remember the title nor the author.

I hope someone knows this fic! Thank you for your time!

*** I found it! It was Consuming Shadows by Child_OTKW. Thanks though, Deprived looks interesting. I'm out of fics to read so I'll try Deprived. :D
