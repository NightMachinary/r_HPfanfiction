Hello everyone!

I've noticed a sudden surge of requests and recommendations using the WBWL trope recently. After looking around and reading a few threads, as well as a few stories recommended by others, I wondered if anyone had ever put thought into WBWL not as a /story,/ but as a potential story to /write./

I don't see too many posts where people are offering advice or experience, although quite a few requests for thoughts or opinions on original ideas. With the structure of reddit and how this subreddit tends to redirect and compose lists for reading, I assume that the majority of users are passionate readers. Out there, hidden in the crowd of usernames and comments, are unassuming writers or authors who create the works that keep us happy and fed. Since the surge of WBWL requests have appeared, I thought that maybe it would be nice to create a post based for writers instead.

Within Harry Potter, I've written a fair number of different stories, ranging from short, to long, to /very/ long. Generally, my works tend to swerve into darker territory, appealing to audiences who enjoy a more heartbreaking dynamic.

I'm sure that many have noticed the trend with darker stories, that alluring trap many people fall into. When writing a dark story, it's easy to be sucked into the black hole that is Dark Magic, Killing characters, Revenge, Overpowered Magic, and that sweet sweet vengeance. Along that path, it's easy to write yourself into a metaphorical hole, and struggle to climb back out. It's easy to lose inspiration once you've accomplished those amazing scenes where everyone cries or beg for mercy- because you've done what you wanted and now there's nothing left fueling you.

This is, in my personal belief, one of the greatest factors that leads to darker stories remaining incomplete. We've all felt this, experienced this. You stumble into an amazing story....and it's been abandoned for years just after the good part.

As someone who has completed a long running fic (not to mention a dark-WBWL story- what a trial that was) *I am happy to give any sort of advice, help, or answer any questions that you have with brainstorming, creation, or conclusion of a story.* I also may be able to provide some insight if you have any questions in particular for the WBWL trope, although please recognize that my perspective and theories as to why numerous authors follow the same cliches is not definite. There are immeasurable other factors and variables that we are not at privy to know, but I /may/ be able to provide my own view as an author.

/Please note, that it's completely alright to dislike my story. I recognize that what I create will never satisfy or appeal to everyone. Honestly, I am happy that individuals do not like my work- this separation of taste and preferences allows us to expand as a fandom, and supply our own unique selection of stylistic choices and works. I recognize that you may entirely dislike or disagree with my perspective- but that does not make you any less valid in your own opinions. Please be respectful to others, do not invalidate stories which someone finds joy in whereas you do not./


** This post is thoughtful of you!

I haven't read your stories, but from what I've seen on this sub, the most frequent praise for Antithesis is for how it managed to draw out intense feelings from the readers. I'd like to hear whatever thoughts or advice you want to share on hitting emotional notes, and in general instilling the feelings you want the reader to feel.

*** Oh this is a loaded question, I'll try my best!

I personally have learned the impact and sway that Fanfiction has on people worldwide. It is...impossible to describe. There is a heartbreaking level of pain and wonder and loss that so many nameless faceless people experience daily. I felt that...as an author, I had almost a moral obligation to myself and to others, that if I were to put a character through and sort of pain or suffering I then had to grip them tight and haul them right back out. When you read a story, you find pieces of yourself echoed in the characters. Things that are shared- the same favourite colour, the same name, the same birthday. When a character is written with trauma or abuse or mental illness, there are always going to be individuals that then read your work and assume the role of your characters. If you hurt your character, you will hurt someone. Authors of all sort have this magical truly amazing gift, because we have an /opportunity/, to say the things someone can't. To offer help or optimism or positivity in a form that someone can't reach. When you take a character and put them through hell, you have the /opportunity to drag someone else back out with you./

I don't know if I've ever touched someone's heart, or helped soothe their pain or grief or sorrows. I don't know, but I feel blessed and so grateful that this is one thing I can do. If I can make one person sleep easier with less chaos in their mind, then I feel that it is worth it.

*** I knew i'd get this question! You're going to love my answer, it's so silly. I came up with the idea for Shadowed Malice (the poorly written “prequel” to Antithesis) when I was 11, and unfortunately I learned that if I had been born a male, my parents would have assigned my name as Skylar. This, combined with the natural edgy-ness only a child can possess, was the reason I landed on such a horrible name. Also, 11 year old me had the creative naming skills on par with a codfish. Antithesis is my attempt to rewrite Shadowed Malice in a cohesive logical story, yet I kept the horrible name as both irony, and homage to one of the first fan fictions I ever wrote and what guided me down this path. It served as a constant reminder to myself over how far I had come, and also, simply put, it made me smile to have such an obvious reminder of how much I've grown. Thank you, bad baby names.

** How do you deal with the issue of coming up with an original premise for a WBWL fic that's hundreds of thousands of words long? Especially with all negative connotation with WBWL and all the tropes.

Also, I read your story and while I did finish it and enjoyed objectively --- I felt a lot of it was overly angsty and it turned me off a bit as a reader. I came in reading it during the beginning thinking I'd be reading a dark dystopian fic where eventually Voldemort won and Harry would eventually come into his own as a sort of heartless general but it suddenly took a right turn towards the whole Barty Crouch Jr. scene where I, as previously stated, felt it became too angsty in a lot of parts.

*** My original idea for writing is to investigate famous cliches and try to alter them in such a way, that they are somehow different. I've learned in recent months that this is a personal stylistic choice known as deconstructionism literature, but eh I hadn't known that at the time. There's a reason why WBWL stories are famous, and a reason why people don't like them. Just as a portion of the population will always enjoy the stories, guilty pleasure or not, people will always dislike them as well. To get past the negative connotations is to think about why you're writing. If the opinions of others or your readers alters your style or ideas to that degree, then your own plotting or brainstorming ability is constantly at jeopardy and is unstable to follow precisely. You can't ignore the cliches and tropes, but you can pick and choose the ones you want, and explore why you like them or why you don't.

All ideas for WBWL are inherently original simply because everyone writes differently. If you want to be original, find one thing or maybe two things that really stick out to you, and shift it ever so slightly. Give your character a nervous tic that comes into play later. Give your character an uncommon friend, subvert expectations by not writing relationships at all, or better yet come up with something new. Writers and authors are amazing people, but the moment they write to appease someone else and not for themselves, that's when stories become abandoned. Don't lose your spark- wrote the story that /you want to read/, and someone else will love it just as much.

Thank you so much for reading through my work! I always want to stress how proud I am of everyone that takes the effort and marches through those chapters. Readers that only make a handful of chapters are still so admirable and I wish more recognition was given for those who take on the challenge of such a large story. Antithesis has flaws, yet I am so so proud of it because I have learned /so much/ from writing it. Now I only want to help anyone else who needs it in any way I can!

** One of my fav things about your fic was the ending. Don't get me wrong, it was also terrible and tragic and left me an emotional wreck with so many Feels, but all of those things together is what really left a mark on me.

My question is, how much planning went into the ending? Like, sometimes I'll get a great idea for a fic (sometimes a wbwl trope) but I don't know how to develop the idea into a proper story with an ending, so I just end up writing a scene or two and leave it in the archives. Also, did you plan for your fic to be that long, or was it just something that happened as you plotted?

*** This is a really good question!

When writing a very long story, regardless of how much time and effort you put into an outline or timeline, you will almost always deviate from it in some way or form. I know a few authors that stick nearly perfectly to their original plotline with only a few significant changes. Personally, I almost write canon-divergences of my timelines when drafting new chapters. It gets to specific points where I decide not to finish one way, or lose inspiration and try something else. I also impulsively add a lot of content before posting which tends to shift the outline. Some people then adjust their outline (the author of /Sum of Their Parts/ and I have discussed this in depth) so they have an accurate blueprint forward, whereas others tend to...improvise with a firm direction in mind.

A lot of times for longer stories, I personally have only a rough idea for how a story will end. This rough idea is still drafted enough that I can work with it, but not so concrete that it restricts my ending. Longer stories generally demand some form of conclusion or a concrete ending, so I plan from there. Concrete endings in Harry Potter almost /always/ involve confronting Voldemort, or finishing the war. I figure how I want that to go, which side, or if I'm too indecisive (which I was for Antithesis) I start writing and adjust as I go with the knowledge in mind.

When writing the story, I had a well structured document for deadlines- by a specific chapter I had to have finished a certain school year/book. Other times, I would write one or two sentences for what I wanted to accomplish in that chapter and then write until I had managed it. This was really important for me towards the end, for reasons I'll explain.

This is where the ridiculous exhaustion of Antithesis really kicks into gear.

Antithesis is 80 Chapters (81 counting the Epilogue). This number was chosen, for /no reason/ other than one day, when I was around Chapter 64 or so (in that range), a reader asked me when the story was going to end. I, like an absolute /fool,/ responded "why not on October 31st? That's symbolic!" The stupidity, is that this was in the summer months (I can't recall the exact date but I'll estimate around middle of June) so I had the sudden realization that I now had to write 16 Chapters in roughly 4 months. That doesn't seem too bad, except for I had /not planned for the story to finish in 16 chapters./

I generally write each chapter in a single sitting, split screen with my information document on one side and the story on the other. It takes anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to write a single chapter, however depending on how much research I need to do for sensitive subjects it can take much longer. Antithesis was...a wild ride.

[Spoilers]

This is even more amusing with context, because Chapter 64 is the part of Part 4 or the "Lone Wolf" arc. I also jumped around and determined that the final chapter titles should be labeled after the stages of grief. Chapters 76 - 80 are named Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance in that order. I wanted to be more symbolic (in hindsight I really screwed myself over), and have each of the final chapters actually focus on that specific stage of grief as well. This took away 5 chapters from my 16 chapters left, where I could unscramble the knot that is the plot line, and finish the story. From Chapter 64, I had 11 Chapters to finish and work out every loose end and plot event as well as finish the character arcs, and finish the story in 4 months. I believe that my chapter update speed towards the end was every 2 weeks, then in September and October I was updating a complete chapter every 5-7 days. Almost all of the ending was NOT originally what I had in mind, in fact the entire Great Hall Scene was entirely unscripted, and I figured out how to finally finish that plot arc roughly 2 days before I posted it. I was running and sprinting through chaos like the creators of South Park trying to churn out a new episode every week. The only scene I had vividly imagined and kept in the last arc, was Skylar and Adrian standing side by side in the last few chapters.

Ironically, I planned for Antithesis to be /longer./ It was the fact it gained so much popularity unexpectedly that drove me to finish the story and write better. That's why there is a /huge/ difference in quality of writing from the first half of the story compared to the second half. I tend to get inspiration while walking my dog, so I was taking two walks a day and the poor girl was exhausted every night. I carried sticky notes and scribbled anything that came to me- specific lines that sounded beautiful, a dynamic or phrase, and even dictated out loud while driving in to university to make sure I could look through all of my subconscious ideas later. The route from start to end for Antithesis was a poor Mapquest line frantically trying to find our way to the destination. We were in Rollercoaster Tycoon letting the computer finish our rollercoaster for us /while we were riding it./

If you have a specific scene in mind, a common technique I use is working backwards. Is the scene inside a forest? Perfect! That means, that just before it, your characters had to get /to/ the forest. That meant that they had to realize they wanted to /go/ to the forest. For that, you had to somehow bring up the conversation point prior to that to get the realization. This little backwards walking has already fleshed out how I structured chapters. I'd start it with something basic, casual events or actions, maybe a conversation which then triggers some good old internal monologue, then a nice pondering and the idea of the forest comes up. Throw in some doubt, then reaffirm that going to the forest would be good. Detail getting ready to go, how they would manage it without being caught. Describe sneaking out, describe finally getting there....and /now/ you write your original scene.

Please let me know if you're confused at all! I have my personal document that I used to write Antithesis, and simply for the safety of not spreading spoilers I'm not posting examples from it. If you're still curious or would like to know more, I'd happily talk one-on-one with you about the precise steps I took, especially since I still have all of the documents.

*** This answer changes depending on a few things- namely the genre, story, and length of the chapter itself.

For Antithesis, I spent on average 2-3 hours to write a solid 4K in a single sitting. For other stories where I'm aiming for 7K per chapter or more, it can range anywhere from 4 hours to 6 hours of work. Normally when chapters are of that length, I tend to split them up into multiple work periods, either divided throughout the day (interspersing writing with schoolwork and studying) or two consecutive days.

When writing angst, tragedy, or possibly sensitive topics, I tend to add on an additional...I'd say half hour per chapter of work. Either because I'm pausing to phrase things a particular way, or to consult my information document to make sure that my information is accurate.

When writing humour, or more of the 'slap happy' style stories, I tend to finish these in 3 hours maximum, however I /may/ touch back on them and elaborate. This generally is for oneshots, however if I'm working on a chapter story I'll spend around 4 hours per chapter just to assure that the balance is right.

Outside of writing the chapter, I spend probably...2 to 3 days ahead of time thinking about how I want the chapter to run. Similar to trying to recall the exact plot of a movie, I frequently flip or move scenes around mentally well before I sit down to write. Even if i'm not writing, thinking about the next chapter or even talking about it to a friend or an interested pet is a sure fire way to improve your writing speed and ability, since you know it inside and out already. If you have a timeline, it's super helpful to keep it open next to your story so you can write concurrently to reading what you already had planned. For Antithesis, my timeline was 22 pages.

For larger stories, I also compile an information document which I constantly refer throughout my entire writing process. This is where I keep information like...the proper spelling for spells, or the exact series of events in the canon books. I'll shove in information on seasonal weather temperature averages, the average amount of snow in Scotland per year, a map of London so I can accurately describe realistic walking times, or the proper treatment/first hand accounts of various mental disorders. I take this information gathering very seriously, and on average tend to gather two pages per chapter of relevant information.

I'm checking back in my document right now just to confirm, and my information document for Antithesis is just under 142 pages.

** WBWL fics are bad because they're built around a fanon trope. We don't know much about Lily and James except they loved each other and they loved Harry unconditionally. We certainly don't know how it would have turned out if they survived and Harry and his "brother" lived to tell the tale, even more if one of them happened to be "the chosen one", which is retarded because in the end it was Lily the one who destroyed Voldemort, not a baby. You have to turn off your brain in order to enjoy WBWL stories because it's simply stupid to think such scenario would happen, but I don't think that's bad, it's popular and some people enjoy this niche, it's just simply impossible for me to enjoy and actually "believe" this can happen.

Now, about your story. I read it and I couldn't get past the part where Bella becomes Harry's mum. Why? Because I didn't feel I was reading about Harry's story anymore. He has another name, he didn't look like him, he didn't speak, act or behaved like him. If I were to open the story at some random chapter without reading the previous I wouldn't know Adrian was actually him, and that's a no-no for me. The only way I believe Harry would be part of Voldemort's group was if he was literally brainwashed and his memory were erased, simply as that. Your story is not badly written, not at all, but it certainly revolves around tropes, overuse of angst where there shouldn't be none, OOC character and lack of real focus beside making Harry angry and edgy for being ignored by his parents. I read HP fanfic to try to imagine what Harry would do during certain scenarios, not go over a complete rewrite where he's not himself in any way, shape or form.

**** But it's true, though? OOC stories are badly written stories in my opinion. Harry can be shaped in many ways and it's totally okay as long as it makes sense, it's a gradual chance and it moves the plot forwards, instead of it happening because the plot demands it.

I don't really like canon, I feel like many characters were misused, others were not used enough and many were left open with tons of little things to add. I don't ask for a 1/1 copy of canon in fanfics, but I do like stories where there's a /believable/ plot and characterization where characters can truly develop and chance in different ways while still feeling like I'm reading a HP story. When I read this story, and many others WBWL stories, I can't get behind Lily and James neglecting Harry, James can definitely have the BWL is favourite, but I can't simply read a story where they suddenly fawn over all Harry's twin and make Harry live with the Dursleys(Jesus, how original) while they are the perfect exemplar family. Why not give him to another member in the Order? A friend of the Potters? Oh yes, because Harry needs to be absolutely miserable in order the become the ultimate victim. Same thing with Harry, by the time he went under all the ritual or whatever it was I don't remember by Bella, he simply was not Harry Potter anymore for me. It was like reading a OC character wearing Harry's skin(and not even that because I remember he looked different) and acting absolutely nothing like Harry.

This is my opinion, and I'm not trying to insult anyone, but I feel like saying this because I honestly don't think this fic is good.

****** (Standard disclaimer: this is mostly my perspective and I want to stress the fact that I recognize and value your unique ideas and opinions. I'm not trying to change your mind, I only want to provide my own insights.)

I think, that the definition of OOC (Out of Character) is heavily reliant on the foundation of what that character is. For most fanfiction, when written in a severe AU such as modern AU, or Coffee Shop AU, the character is removed and placed in such a setting where the original personality is altered. This means, that in most forms of standardized AU, all characters are in some way, OOC. The difference is the author's ability to show clear concise reasoning as to how that character got there. How did these different variables lead to this? How has the shift from canon to something else changed the fundamentals of what you're writing?

With my story, I shifted the foundations to attempt to show a clear realistic interpretation of depression, mental illness, and other traumatic content. I recognize and I acknowledge that the Harry Potter in my story /is out of character./ I recognize that other characters, such as what we know about Lily and James, are also /out of character./ My intentions behind writing the story weren't to perfectly capture the canon personalities, but my goal was to write a realistic tragedy that individuals with trauma could relate to. Did I succeed? Maybe. Is the story still painful and awkward to read at the start due to the cringe? Oh completely. I only started to address the story seriously towards the later chapters once I realized how quickly it had gained attention. The story isn't fantastic, and I know if I put all my effort into it, it could be much better- but I am still proud of it regardless.

That's good! I'm sure that many people share the same thinking pattern. This sort of perspective and opinion is what leads and inspires so many people to write their own story, spinning their own plotline that becomes some of the greatest foundations for stories. If you don't see something, or have yet to find something you love wholeheartedly- then /make it./ If you want this, then someone else does as well.

I 100% respect that. I actually really enjoy talking to the people who don't like my story. They offer the best sort of critique and elaboration that then helps me find the proper channels to write something /better./ You helped me comprehend why you personally didn't like my story, which I am incredibly thankful for. I won't be rewriting Antithesis (god knows a rewrite of a rewrite would be /chaos/), but that doesn't mean that I won't be writing /more./ Having this help means that my future stories will be just a little bit better, and I will always improve the smallest bit more.

  In terms of the fic, I also was not a huge fan. I liked the premise a lot, but I agree with you there were a lot of holes. Especially after Harry got abducted from the orphanage.

I always joke and tease myself that my ideas and concepts are good, but the execution always falls short. A lot of gaps and problems that more attention, focus, patience, and a good editor (or someone to smack me with a newspaper for silly plot spirals) could have helped me wonders.

#+begin_quote
  I generally don't see a problem with an author starting the fic with a wildly OOC character, provided the story then unfolds naturally from there.
#+end_quote

I could entirely be wrong- but I think this is an individuals like or distaste for classical literature. Stories that start off following canon heavily and stay true to canon characters are a....traditional fanfiction (?) perspective, whereas stories which start with an OOC character or with OC's tend to favour or lean more towards traditional literature. It's the difference of starting a story and expecting it to stay true to Harry Potter, or starting a story with an open mind and anticipating an entirely new book that is /inspired/ by Harry Potter.

#+begin_quote
  I would hesitate to call these all bad fics, solely because they have characters that are very different from canon.
#+end_quote

I like to say, especially new writers who are insecure or unsure of their beginning steps in writing, that you can look at any work of literature or writing and learn something from it. Even stories that are 'bad' or 'weak' can still be used as a tool. Generally, you find /something/ that inspires you; a single line that sticks in your head, or a plot twist you never anticipated. You can learn something from /anyone,/ even if you dislike their work. I never brush aside new inexperienced writers, because they have ideas and thoughts that deserve to be heard and can help my work even if it seems like otherwise. I can agree that some stories are of less quality compared to others, but I wouldn't call them bad. I'd prefer calling them /weak,/ because bad has such a connotation that devalues stories and authors and really hurts people if phrased poorly.
