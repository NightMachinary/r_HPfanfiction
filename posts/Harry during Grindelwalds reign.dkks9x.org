Any fics where harry travels back in time when Grindelwald's in the rise and he joins with Dumbledore and fights him. Something like realignment only harry works with Dumbledore against Grindelwald. A harry who is as powerful as both Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Preferably no pairing or if it is a pairing ..ok with anything other than slash.


** Well there's on in the WbA section of dlp about Harry Potter who dimensionally travels and meets his fem!counterpart cuz they both got their asses beat my Voldemort and then end up in grindelwalds time. They are both pretty stupidly powerful. But we haven't seen any conflict with another powerhouse to really gauge them off though.

**** Here's the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/double-vision-m.38707/][link]] but you need to be an active participant on the forums to access wba which is I think like 5 good posts that aren't deleted.

It can take some time to get approved as a member before you're allowed to post. But not everyone can access wba because it's mostly unfinished work it's not generally how people fully want to portray their story and they post it for critiques.

****** Yeah only the first chapter is up right now and it's a bit rough around the edges but it's still very solid.
