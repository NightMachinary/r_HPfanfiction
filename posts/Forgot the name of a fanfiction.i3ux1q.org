:END:
These scenes are most likely from different fanfictions. This is what I remember:

There's a scene where a number(5?)of people in the Order of the Phoenix sit down. The chairs represent things and fawkes chooses who sits in them.

Sirius is kept by Voldemort for more than ten years and escapes, Mad-eye is killed really early and there's a false clue by the death eaters that he's alive.

Voldemort teams up with a dark witch, she asks for things like animals and potion ingredients and he makes Lucius pay for them. He also gets a wand (maybe with a thunderbird feather core).

James jumps off a broomstick and people think he was struck by a curse but he jumped off to avoid being hit.

Lily created a reflection of herself and someone kills the reflection, some people thought she died.

Harry, when getting his robes at Madam Malkins, acts like he is so honoured to meet Lucius Malfoy, who is very confused.
