This is probably a long shot since this is a really old fic (circa 2002/2003) but figured I would try since I'm dying to read it again and occasionally will still look for it.

It focused on Snape and an OFC named Shelby, who originally started out as a student but then they ended up meeting up again when she was an adult. There was a point in the story where she was wearing a pendant called the Phoenix Song (I think) and dark wizards were attacking her for it. Not a lot of info, but that's all I can remember. Was on Fanfiction.net.

I loved it so much, it was one of the most well written Snape's I had ever read. Thanks!
