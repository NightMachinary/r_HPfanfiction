As I remember Harry met Daphne Greengrass on the train during first year and they became friends. She introduces him to a few rituals that helped him better connect to his magic and such. I think there was also something about going into the forest to plant a wandwood tree.


** Well, I never thought this story would get posted here...

*** I skimmed through the first chapter. Does the writing quality improve? I do like the premise, but the execution is a bit rough.

***** Well, I for one love the premise, but the execution of it does leave a lot to be desired. Do you mind if I give this a thorough editing and send it back to you, to see if it can reawaken your muse? Failing that, do you mind adopting it out? Like I stated previously, it is a fantastic plot idea.

****** If I were to write something along this vein again (and I have tinkered with many ideas like this), it would most likely be something completely new, and likely starting later on. I just don't find first year stories all that interesting, hence why this one is short and not overly verbose.

I pretty much got the idea for this fic from the band "Blackmore's Night" and in particular, the song "Fire's at Midnight."

******* So do you mind if I took the general idea and tried to develop something of my own based on the theme? I would take great care not to plagiarize your work and give you proper credit for the inspiration.

******** You can write whatever you want. I only wrote this because I was annoyed that similar stories like "out of the night" and "on the wings of a phoenix" were never finished.
