Basically Voldemort has taken over the Ministry and Britain and Harry is the leader of the remaining Order of the Phoenix.

Looking for:

-More violent Order tactics

-More organised and structured Death Eaters/Ministry

-Dumbledore dead.

-Major Character death is acceptable.

-Preferably complete.

Thank You.


** linkffn(The Resistance of Azkaban)

Fits exactly what you're wanting, I believe. Basically, Harry leads a resistance against Voldemort-controlled Ministry in Azkaban. Well-written and enjoyable, at least the last time I read it ;)

  It's been twenty five years since the death of Albus Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic is now under the control of Lord Voldemort. Those who oppose him place themselves under the command of Harry Potter, former Auror and ruler of the island of Azkaban

** Not a fic as such, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f3lpo/post_your_favorite_alternate_media_fanfiction/ctlfo3o][I came up with an outline of one as inspired by some wanted poster fanart someone posted]]. One thing that, in retrospect, I am not seeing is Harry leaving Britain; it just wouldn't be Harry. I was following what the posters said.

That said, I don't see a non-HINO Harry leading a guerrilla movement as such; he is more likely to be the figurehead and a squad leader, with someone else actually running the organization and calling the shots. Even if it's going to be someone from that year (as opposed to a grownup like Moody or Shacklebolt or one of the older Weasleys), it'd probably be Hermione: more ruthless, more versatile magically, better at planning and organizing.
