I'm looking for fics where Tom is actually innocent of being Voldemort! Could be imperioused, replaced with someone else, or any other explanation given really. Even better if he reabsorbs his Horcruxes! Even MORE so if he actually LIKES being called Tom! What it's a nice name =) Any and all ships, but I have a preference for Tomarry.

Thank you!


** Don't feel like finding the link, but it's something like Neglect and Indifference. He's not innocent, but he gets off my claiming he was Imperiused, I think.

** I can't remember the name, but there is a fic where (Thanks to some old laws) Voldemort is able to return to normal society as "Lord Slytherin" and adopts Harry.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** Eh, not sure if it fits but it's more crack than an actual fic. There's heavy Dumbledore bashing though if I'm not mistaken but aside from that, I remembered that Tom is absolutely innocent in this context

  Left alone with Dudley's computer, Harry googles "Tom Marvolo Riddle" on a whim. Perhaps he shouldn't have done that... HP/TR romance.
