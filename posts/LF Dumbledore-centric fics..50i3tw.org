I actually honestly like Dumbledore, so I'm looking for fics where he would be the main character. I don't care about what age he would be or if it would be a reincarnation thing, although if possible, I don't want to read a romance-centric one. I'd appreciate it if his persona doesn't change, too. I once read a brilliant (but abandoned) fic about Harry getting all of Dumbledore's memories, and pretty much mannerisms and persona, and that's perfectly fine with me as well.

I know some are probably still in the Dumbledore hate bandwagon, but yeah, Dumbledore fan over here.


** I don't have any good recommendations, but as a Dumbledore fan, I'm glad to know there's others.

Set in the summer of Grindelwald's visit to Godric's Hollow. Ariana's characterisation here is especially fascinating.

The fanfiction version lags a bit; the story is complete at [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=328230][HPFF]].

  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

  Just what did happen at the top of the Astronomy Tower on that fateful night? What went wrong... and who fooled whom? This story tells the events at the end of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince from another point of view: Dumbledore's own.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-next-great-adventure-dresden-files-harry-potter.359091/][The Next Great Adventure]] is a pretty good Dresden Files/Harry Potter crossover, though it seems to have been abandoned.

Summary: Albus Dumbledore came to the end of his story in his world. Fortunately, or maybe less fortunate for him, fate decides he wasn't quite done and whisked him away to world filled with monsters, magic and other miracles. How does a tired old man deal with everything the Dresden Verse can throw at him?

*Beside Me... Always* is a great fic. It follows Dumbledore through the seven years of canon and a bit beyond.

  Harry proudly accepted the title of 'Dumbledore's man through and through' but how little does he, do we realize that Dumbledore was 'Harry's man through and through? Their years together, now through Albus's eyes, see the bond that these two share.

** He's a POV character in a number of my stories, though I tend to write him a bit more ruthless and active than in canon - the kind of person who'd rather kill a Death Eater than risk a child and plots against Voldemort on multiple fronts. Though while a central character, he's usually just one of several POV characters.
