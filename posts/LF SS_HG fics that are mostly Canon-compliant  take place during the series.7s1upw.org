I almost always stick to post-Hogwarts stories, but I'm looking for well-written ones that take place (or begin) in the 5-7th years and don't stray too far from the primary Canon. Also, please only rec fics where Hermione is of age due to the Time Turner, or if she's younger, the romance doesn't start until after she comes of age.

I read one Marriage Law Challenge fic that did this expertly...so much so that I couldn't remember which parts didn't actually happen in the books.

Thanks in advance!

*** Thank you so much for these recs! I'm going to save them immediately! And for the life of me I can't remember the title!! It's what inspired me to post this request. I'm on mobile and can't verify right now, but I think it MIGHT be called “Second Life” because Hermione was living a double life the entire 6th and 7th book as Snape's secret wife. Don't quote me on it :)

**** About the Phoenix Trilogy - the third part isn't marked complete, but it's only missing an epilogue (the author says so his/herself in an AN at the end. I read it a while ago and was super disappointed when I noticed the lack of "complete" mention in the tags, but I kept reading because it was really good. What a nice surprise to discover it was in fact finished ! So I mention it now when I see it recommended, wouldn't want potential readers to avoid it because of this :)

** linkffn(The Professor's Discretion by Twelve Years in Azkaban) This one is mostly canon. Almost all their interactions happen between canon in a very realistic way. The romance is implied at the end but nothing really happens between them though.

linkffn(Pet project) Super known fic, although its less canon since it was written before the Deathly Hallows. There is no romance until the very end, but it's really well written and is absolutely hilarious at times.
