My fianc√© [[/u/geekdom42][u/geekdom42]] has decided to write an Ilvermorny fic. We ate doing what research we can on it. Is there anyone interested in reading this type of fic? Anything you would like to see in this type of fic? We have an idea of who our main character is and a general plot.


** Don't make carbon copies of the Harry Potter characters, but in Ilvermorny, that would be strange.

Make sure your character has flaws, isn't perfect, isn't a Sue type of character.

What differences does Ilvermory has compared to Hogwarts, the differences in the teachers, the classes, how the students get along, et cetra.

Are the same pets allowed, or are there some different ones allowed? Note if you allow different pets to join a student, make it believable and not like a horse or something like that.

** Tell a story.

Here are a few snippets of advice from Emma Coates at Pixar:

- You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

- Trying for theme is important, but you won't see what the story is actually about til you're at the end of it. Now rewrite.

- Once upon a time there was /__. Every day, _. One day _. Because of that, _. Because of that, _. Until finally _/_.

- What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?

- Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.

- Finish your story, let go even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.

- When you're stuck, make a list of what WOULDN'T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.

- Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you'll never share it with anyone.

- Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it's poison to the audience.

- Why must you tell THIS story? What's the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That's the heart of it.

- If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.

- What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don't succeed? Stack the odds against.

- Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.

*** Thanks I've told him to look at it. I'm just the editor and partial plot developer.

** First off, make sure you've got a good story and characters. One of the advantages (and likely reasons) why Harry Potter is such a popular fanfic setting is because of how people already have connections with the characters. It makes it easy to connect with them in a FF - because we already have that connection.

In your case, you have the flexibility to approach it a lot of ways, being removed from the main field. I'd decide if you want to include any of the actual HP characters in the fic, and if you're going to be setting it during the same events (or any other relation to the main series). That's the type of thing you want to hammer out ahead of time.

For Ilvermorny itself, I'd like to see it be different than Hogwarts. There are a lot of ways you can take magic in America - and I wouldn't restrict myself at all to what you can find from research. Sure, there's some material out there, but functionally no one has a strong image of Ilvermorny in their head (or most don't, unlike Hogwarts). So if you want to not have an equivalent to Hogwarts' houses, don't. Same with magical America - some interesting things to examine might be the relationship with the pre-European wizarding world (eg, are there any remnants of the First People's magic users? Do they have their own isolated communities, or are they integrated? How about the Meso-American and Andean wizards - did they survive to the current day?). Views towards muggles, goblins/other magical creatures and the like are other things you could examine..

Past that, it'll depend mostly on your fic. There's little sense in saying too much without that being known - an epic conflict/war fic will have a very different set of expectations than a slice of life school life fic, which would be different than a comedy, etc etc.

** Frankly, I don't remember much from the Pottermore stuff, and so would first say don't feel totally bound to strict adherence. Use it as inspiration, not a straightjacket.

Hogwarts in large part recreates a fairly common British schooling experience (boarding, houses, terms and such), it could be cool, particularly for non-US, to play up some US school system stuff (fun stuff, not depressing and not stereotypes), ex. instead of boarding, everyday you have students flooing in, apparating in with frazzled warlock father off to his job, or arriving by transport like Knight Bus, Durmstrang Ship, or Beauxbatons carriage ie. a school bus but very much magical.

And/or like Hogwarts no Apparition, and so recreate the schoolbus experience by having to travel with jerks and nobodies each morning from property line as Hogwarts does with Thestral carriages a few times a year. The relief of a friend/free seat, loneliness of staring out the ?carriage? window. Little things. Maybe recreate drivers license outside apparition with wealthy kids being bought brooms or flying creatures, and others stuck with magical mountain goats.

The other thing is that Hogwarts shows a clear influence down through the ages from the Founders. For good or bad the Slytherin vs Gryffindor and Voldemort vs Dumbledore/Harry is at the forefront, and Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff comparatively forgotten. You have to focus on something, so what is the history, how is the surrounding culture (even temporary, like Umbridge) effecting things?

Basically mix familiar with strange, bring lots of whimsy but with an American flair. With none of the same characters you have an uphill battle, but making the reader feel both at home and having fun discovering the american wizarding world would help bridge that gap.

** World building. Is important, for one a whole lot of hyoe in Hogwarts is grounded in the tale of te founders. Ivermorny can get that as well. Important key fact in the lore of Ivermorny.

+a descendant of slytherin who fought pureblood idealism +native American magic is the basis but they introduced wand work as well + the no maj segregation law followed the No maj breach where Ivermorny was found and attacked
