** Lucius. Would have cemented the redemption of Draco and Narcissa if he died in an attempt to keep Draco safe.

instead they just randomly come out entirely unscathed and nobody seems to care about a family of threw death eaters just chilling in the Great Hall after so many people were killed

**** Draco would have been the best one I think.

The Malfoy's are still horrible people and having their own past horribleness result in the death of their son whom they then failed to protect is a bit of a full-circle narrative comeuppance. It would also, I believe, mark the end of a Pureblood family which could be seen as highlighting the pointlessness of the 'war' as it were.

****** Draco dying at some point doesn't change that theme at all unless he dies so early it changes Narcissa's actions and Harry knows it happens. She can still be trying to save her son but ultimately fail. It could even be seen as juxtaposing acting out of love compared to acting out of fear.

*** i like that they all lived. It's in character, since their family is known for their self-preservation instinct dominating, particularly in the later books. And all the bad guys dying wouldve just been annoying. I mean, bellatrix and voldemort already died. Killing off the only other noteworthy death eaters wouldve been annoying. Just in the same way that saving all the good guys would've been annoying in an unrealistic way.

** Her large, blue eyes stared vacantly into the ceiling. Their innocence preserved even in death.

Mentions of nargles and blibbering humdingers would never again pass her lips. Never again would she tell them of how she almost caught a Crumplehorned Snorkack.

There was no mark upon her body, but a single spell had managed to touch her. The king of the Unforgivables, the killing curse.

*AVADA KEDAVRA*

It somehow seemed appropriate. Seeing Luna looking anything but completely unconcerned would have been /wrong/.

Her body lay in the very halls she had wandered for years, looking for shoes that the nargles had stolen. Every hall in the vast castle was filled with flashes of light and shouts, the walls falling apart from the hexes and curses. But not this corridor, no spells were spoken here. Everything was perfectly still, the massive pieces of stone that had been torn from the ceiling lay broken upon the floor.

No sign of humans could be seen. Except for the lone body of Luna with her blonde hair spread around her head like a bright halo.

So passed Luna Lovegood from this world, the likes of which would never again be seen.

** Trelawney

Why? Every time she makes a big deal about a prediction (both prophecies, Harry seeing the Grim, the thirteenth person at the table, the lightning struck tower), it turns out to be horrible for Harry and/or others.

And personally, I would have Harry or Ron or Hermione do it (because its a question, not about what's realistic). They all have a reason. Harry, every time Trelwaney predicts something people get hurt. Hermione, she hates divination and thinks its bunk (despite everything). Ron, he went through three years of stupid bs along with Harry about recording dreams when divination appears to be useful to only certain individuals (Harry could say the same too).

And I just imagine one of them pointing their wand and saying to her:

"Look into my wand and tell me what you see" or "Don't forget your tea leaves" or something to that effect.

** having voldemort kill neville after neville victoriously slayed the snake woulve added some tragic depth to the story. Neville finally grows into his gryffindor skin during his seventh year leading the DA in harry's absense. This builds up to his moment of shine, where he kills the snake making voldemort mortal, only to die moments later. Was it worth it. Also, Neville had the potential to be the boy-who-lived, but he was never the one chosen to defy all odds (including death) when it comes to facing voldemort. Him slaying the snake without being injured by voldemort was a bit of potter-like luck that should only belong with the real chosen one. Or maybe thats what JK is trying to potray by this scene. That harry isn't that special, but succeeds because of bravery and a refusal to give up
