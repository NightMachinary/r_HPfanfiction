I've been reading fanfiction for roughly 3 years and have yet to find a fic where Harry exhibits even the briefest notion that he had a sheltered childhood without him being on the receiving end of impalpable abuse from his uncle, or where he has turned 'dark'. I want a fic in which Harry is similar to Canon but shows signs of social inability i.e. bad at holding conversation, nervous in crowds, different speech patterns, failure to read social cues etc. If you know of a fic like this i would be extremely happy to find out.

This is my first post upon finding this brilliant sub. I'm glad that people like fanfiction in lieu of cliched fics, not due to it.


** Off the top of my head I can think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry.]] It's been a while since I've read it, but I do remember finishing it. I read/reread a lot and I've seen a few fics like what you're asking for - I'll update with more as I think of them.

*** Seconded. It was a welcome change from the overly charismatic Harry this fandom often portrays him as. Includes some muggle weaponry and the sequel is iffy. I would definitely recommend this story though.

** Doesn't that pretty much describe canon Harry?

*** Not really. From the offset, he trusts Ron implicitly and without question even though he just met him. He has the confidence to stand up to Malfoy even though he's one of the first people he meets in an unfamiliar environment. He stands up to Snape, an authority figure, as he insults him, despite his relatives doing the same thing time and time again and he doesn't have a reaction in the beginning. Despite having no experience in the matter, he is able to make friends and trust very quickly. He also has this supposed in-built sense of good and bad that he somehow managed to gain.

The kind of Harry I described is more introverted, but not without backbone; unlike Canon where he doesn't like the spotlight but doesn't mind attention e.g. being able to be watched playing Quidditch in front of hundreds of people.

** Best match I can think of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]]. It's been a while since I read it, but from what I remember Harry is pretty isolated and socially inept, and a big part of the plot is him slowly coming to terms with things (with the help of a bunch of people).

It starts off very slowly and deliberately paced, and the end isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitely worth checking out based on your preferences.

*** I've read it and it came across a little disjointed. The whole premise seemed somewhat impossible; Wouldn't the blood protection fall if Petunia left as it needs a blood relative, that being the whole reason Harry was there? Then Dumbledore would know if the blood protection fell. Otherwise, thank you for your suggestion.

** The only fic I can think of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]], and even that isn't really what you're looking for, haha. What happens is basically that Harry is abused by his parents and turned into this intelligent little war guardian machine but in turn he doesn't really understand how to keep friends as anything but friends and not allies, or that people care about him, etc., etc. It's an EXTREMELY long fic and not exactly one that caters to general tastes, but I think it's good.

*** I've previously read it and loved it! Even though slash isn't particularly to my tastes. Thank you for suggesting it, it reminded me of it and I shall re-read it.

**** It's a good fic! Very emotional, at the very least. Good luck in your search. :)

** I haven't read all of it, and I read it a while ago, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For][What We're Fighting For]] has a Harry that was raised by Sirius (with teaching from others) in secret with everyone else believing he was killed in Godric's Hollow. He comes back during the DoM fight.

He enters Hogwarts in 6th and he's never associated with anyone his age and is somewhat robotic and socially stunted. iirc he's a bit Super!Harry and the story is hhr.
