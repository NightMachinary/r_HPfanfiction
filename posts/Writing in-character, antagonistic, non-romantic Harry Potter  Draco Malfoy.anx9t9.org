Had a nifty idea for a fic with Harry and Malfoy as the main characters. Background: they both hate each other and are very much enemies, but have to interact humanely toward each other for much of the plot.

Problem is, 1) I've read a lot of fic, just terrible amounts of it, my soul is stained despite my best efforts; and 2) a book reread just isn't in the cards for me right now. Because of that, it'll be pretty easy for me to forget canon vs. fanon.

So your help is needed, [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]. /A lot./

(Especially for Malfoy; he's one character that I actually don't seek out as a main in fics.)

Things that need the most help:

- What are their flaws, their good points, their defining characteristics, their motivations?
- What should be avoided?
- What should be explored?
- How would they act and react around each other?
- What other details (little or big) should be remembered?

And if you folks can think of anything else to add or point out, it'd be greatly appreciated!
