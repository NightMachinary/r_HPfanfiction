My story got its first proper flame recently! I was wondering when it would come. I guess I should be happy they refrained from attacking me personally. Which I'm fairly certain they would have, if it didn't mean they could be removed from FFN.

Anyway. It came from the very well adjusted and absolute delight of a person, going by the name Osborn123. I admit to having done a little research, and that person is clearly the one the rest of us should strive to be. And I, much like every other writer (surely they must have), whose story they have deigned to leave a /review/ for, wanted to thank them for delivering unto us such an amazing insight into the human psyche.

It may prove invaluable for for future scientists. Thank you, Osborn123, for such a selfless act. Your name shall be forever etched into the annals of humanity. Such passion! Such nobility! And bravery, especially the fact that they blocked the feature that allows people to send them messages. Hiding, and not being able to stand your ground, should people wish to engage you after you've dumped all over their work, is a very sexy look... Not that I had any intention of interacting with them. It's not worth the effort. Still, it's kind of gratifying to know they are a coward, much like most other wannabe bullies.

It just so happens I'm old enough to understand I cannot please everybody. I've gotten enough negative reviews to underscore that! I'm also too lazy to allow such tiny, insignificant people like Osborn123 to affect my writing. Especially when they take out the frustrations of their sad lives out on the work of people who actually went ahead and wrote something.

But not everyone can let such things slide. They take it personally, and stop writing. It's very sad. But what's even more sad and pathetic, is how that seems to be the intention of bottom feeders like Osborn123. As I said, I did a little research, and mine is not the only story where they have decided to so vividly express how... unimpressed they were with the writer's efforts.

To any writer, who happens to read this, I say following. Getting nice reviews is very fun, feels good, and for some, it helps them to keep going. However, if you rely on reviews for inspiration, you leave yourself open to people like Osborn123. Do not give them such power. Do not allow them to take away your enjoyment of writing. Ignore people who attack your work as if it has personally offended them. They are not of sound mind, and they deserve our pity. Write for yourselves, first and foremost.

And to those with a penchant for acting like idiots. Why are you angry with writers? Do you think we write stories in a certain way, just to push your buttons? Why attack other people's work with foul words and insults? You may not have attacked the author personally, but many will feel miserable, because you chose to lower yourselves to a very low standard of being. Unless, of course that's who you are, and if that's the case, I'm sorry for you. Seek help. Strive towards being better.

Your critique may be completely valid, but all foul language does, is make you sound like an idiot who should be summarily dismissed. I can understand people not liking a story, and that's perfectly fine, people have different tastes, and some stories are better than others. Hell, mine could easily be horrible. I'm not going to rate my own work.

I'll say this, however. If you dislike something, and feel the need to leave a review, by all means, do so. But try to be constructive, try and use language that's appropriate for civil society, if you wish to be taken seriously. And remember, there is a person behind the name under which they publish their stories.

Rant over.


** rant all you want ! I haven't had the pleasure of reading ur stories but I'm sure there amazing ! Keep your head up and continue to write ! have a good night

** Imma be honest with you, I have indeed let bad reviews effect my inspiration to write a story, which led to it being abondened. It's a struggle every fanfic writer has to bear and sometimes it just is too much and you start to lose the motivation to continue. It makes me glad this hasn't happened to you and I would actually really like to read your story, so could you please share the link?

Since you're a girl, a Harry/Multi fic may not be up your alley. (I'm profiling, yay!) I refused to write a smut fic, there is enough porn, that we don't need to make porn of HP.

Instead, I wanted to spend my time trying to give each of Harry's women a distinct personality and an active role in the story.

Perhaps I should tell you the biggest problem people have with my story; apparently my very kind and goodhearted Harry does not turn into a killer quick enough, and his struggle to do so in 'unnecessary drama'.

I looked to comics for inspiration, and I kind of modelled the kind of hero my Harry is, on Peter Parker and Clark Kent, so him going on a killing spree the day he begins his quest makes no sense.

Now, if you do decide to go for it, I'd love to hear what you think!

***** Nope, I've been around.. Just don't see the need create porn out of every little thing. But, as they say, if something exists on the internet, someone's made porn of it.

** I went and read the review that Osborn wrote and I'm not sure if it's just me but what he said didn't seem too bad. Sure he was rude and not very constructive but it's not anything I would have spent time thinking about and working myself up over yet it's obvious that It did affect you a good deal considering how much you wrote about him. Your message about how writers shouldn't quit because of mean comments was a good one but you gave Osborn way too much attention honestly he's probably already saw your rant and is just marinating in pleasure because he now knows he's hurt your feelings.

*** It always sucks getting a review like the one I got, and it will always sting, if you care about your work. I just won't let it affect how I go about writing my story. And yes, I did feed the troll, which one should never do. It's what keeps them alive.

The reason you don't see what Osborn wrote as that bad, is probably because he only attacked my work, and not me personally, which is all too common.

Now, this post of mine is honestly not so much about what he wrote about my work (even though it triggered it), as it's about flaming/rudeness in general. I've seen so many disgusting comments, and what I got is fairly tame, in comparison. I've always hated it. We should treat each other with respect.
