Any other recommendations would be greatly appreciated!


** But... What... Who... Huh?

When was /this/ ship invented? And more to the point, why? I can imagine voldermort/bella fics, even voldermort/harry. But voldermort//hermione/? When did this happen?

*** I encourage you to read some, and come back, and then we'll discuss it. See if it still seems bizarre. I'm so use to it now, I can't imagine them not being together...

He's so dark, and Hermione loves knowledge, but she has such a sense of right and wrong. Lord Voldemort teaches her to let down some of her inhibitions (eventually, and often under duress) and see that power and knowledge aren't evil. Lord Voldemort, when really studying Hermione, I couldn't imagine him not being intrigued---she's a brilliant witch, powerful and clever. Imagine, that had Hermione grown up with Tom Riddle from first year Hogwarts that his opinion on blood status could have been different, because they would have been constantly competing. There are actually a few fics, where Hermione goes back in time to Tom's last year and they become involved for similar reasons.

Just curious, have you ever read Snape and Hermione? I like them together too....

**** I always wanted to write a Harry and Lily ship. It would be one about how Harry is sent back in time and loses his memory. He competes with his dad for the love of Lily, eventually teaming up with an oddly muggle-loving Lucius and very sexual Amelia Bones. Somehow Ron is there and everyone pisses all over him again, like all other fics. I'll call it, "Gotta love dat Lily"! Oh and in the last chapter, Voldemort will be defeated.

Hey, I'm already writing a fic about Harry being burned alive, might as well write a Lily/Harry story.

***** I can't tell if this is your way of telling me voldemort/hermione is in no feesible way a realistic possibility as a couple (I use the word "realistic" tentatively, as we are discussing a fictional story within the context of fanfiction) or if you just wanted a place to talk about your Harry/lily story and this seemed like your safest bet.

****** Nope. I was reading this thread and BAM, the idea came to me. I like the idea of Voldemort slash stories but it always places the other character in a submissive position. In case of Hermione, I always hated how fanfics seem to make her submissive at times.

******* Hmm. I can't imagine Voldemort's partner NOT being submissive. How would you imagine Hermione? I prefer as in character as possible, even when making the leap to a pairing with Voldemort. I think with Ron she'll take dominant role, but that's just because Ron is a twat and his mother is dominant, so of course he'd want that in a wife.

Your story, is it a drama or comedy?

*** The idea of Luna and Voldemort together is fascinating. I'm going to start reading it tonight. Now. After this comment. Hmmm. I wonder what angle the author will come from with this...

Thanks! I'll definitely read Tied for Last too, once I've sated my curiosity. Oh, and if you haven't read my above mentioned favs (and don't mind a little sex and violence) you should try those out. I ship Hermione and Voldemort pretty hard.

***** I have yet to write, read, or find a believable, in character, Voldemort-centric "romance" story that does not involve some sort of forced sexual behavior, or cruelty. Tom Riddle stories, /maybe/. But Lord Voldemort? I can't imagine it.

** This story is mature so be warned! It's one of my favorites and it's still WIP. [[http://hp.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600093987]]

Shared Flame doesn't have a super submissive Hermione. She gives as good as she gets which is enjoyable to read!

I have to say that this pairing is strange, but when it's done well is really dark and frightening which has its own appeal.
