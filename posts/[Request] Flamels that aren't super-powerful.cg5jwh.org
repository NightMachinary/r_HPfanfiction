Knowledgeable, yes. Cunning, yes. But able to stand up in a duel with Dumbledore or Voldemort, no.


** I've always liked the idea that Perenelle is the super-badass while Nick is just a giant lab nerd.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
