So I'm in the mood for some good Harry Potter fanfiction. I rarely read HP fanfiction, but I want some well-written reads nonetheless and would much appreciate some help.

*Looking for these pairings:*

- Snape/Harry (most requested)
- Harry/Hermione
- Lupin/Tonks
- Snape/Hermione
- Sirius/Lupin
- Sirius/Tonks
- Lucius/Harry

*Requests (doesn't have to be all in the same story):*

- Non-magic AU (most requested...can be one-shots, full story; modern day, historic, war time, dystopian, emigration/immigration...etc.)

- Book setting

- Marriage-fic/forced marriage/marriage of convenience

- NO Harry/Ginny...bad enough that I had to put up with it in the books.

- NO time travel please!


** I also would like some Remus/Sirius please!

** I've only read a few Snape/Harry and the one I really liked was called [[http://juliakt38.blog126.fc2.com/blog-entry-1009.html][Homecoming of the Soul]] by Slumbering Potion. It has many references though, of past Harry/Ginny (she's dead) but it is a Snarry fic.

linkffn(Hermione's Plan by chem prof), linkffn(Vox Corporis by MissAnnThropic), and linkffn(The Power of the Press by Bobmin356) are my husband's recs for Harmony.

For Snape/Hermione a few that I liked were:

linkffn(Pet Project by Caeria)

linkffn(Being Hermione Granger by Amphotera)

linkao3(Second Life by Lariope)

  She had no idea how to build a life for herself without first discovering who she really was and what she desired. It was worth an attempt, in any case. DH epilogue disregarded.
