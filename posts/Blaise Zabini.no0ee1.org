Why is Blaise Zabini suddenly randomly being turned into a girl in fanfictions. I've read several fanfics that has Blaise be a girl (and just being Blaise no one else is gender bent) and I just got done with the first chapter of a fic and the AN asked

^{Should} Blaise Zabini be a boy or a girl?

Like are people confused on who Blaise Zabini is?


** Blaise Zabini appeared for the 1st time in the "Philosopher Stone" (where he was the last student to be Sorted), but only his name was mentioned there and his gender was not known until "Half Blood Prince" (since Blaise is technically a neutral name). During this period, Blaise was often used as the "Nice Slytherin's girl" that can show Harry that not all the Slytherin are bad (pretty much the same role that is now played by Daphne Greengrass).

Most of the fics with a female Blaise are ancient fics from that time. But even if the character lost a part of his popularity (being replaced by others), some people still want to write about him, and some also wants to write him as a girl (sometimes as an hommage to these old fics).

** In canon, he's a he. But we didn't know that at the time. Pretty sure his gender wasn't confirmed until book five?

Personally, I thought Blaise was a girl because of a character in another series from that time period. (Who was, incidentally, also a witch). Don't remember which book, but it was the night world by LJ Smith, of vampire diaries infamy. You know, the series that was supposed to have a finale during Y2K and we're. Still. Waiting. Gah!

** In the German version of the Philosopher stone Blaise was female.

"... w√§hrend 'Blaise Zabini' zu einer Slytherin gemacht wurde..."

The "einer" is used for females.

That is why I thought that Blaise was trans. Because in the sixth book, she was turned into a male.

*** Trans!Blaise is my headcanon, because (1) I have a soft spot for the girl!Blaise stories of my youth and (2) fuck TERFs.

** blaise's gender wasn't confirmed until later so it's usually the older ones that have him as a girl

** To be honest I was actively reading fanfic back when everyone thought Blaise was a female. In my heart and mind she always will be a female so if I write a fiction Blaise will likely be fem out of habit.

** All the fics I've seen with Blaise as a girl are really old ones. Don't think I've seen that in any newer ones.
