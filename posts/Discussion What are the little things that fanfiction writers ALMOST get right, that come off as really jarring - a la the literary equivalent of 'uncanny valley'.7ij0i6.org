For me it is the use of contractions. Sometimes, an amazing author will use a contraction which breaks the 'flow' of dialogue. Or, when an author who clearly isn't British tries to sound British, and it falls flat due to how OOC it makes the character(s) sound.

Basically, I'm talking about things which make you wince a little bit, but not things that make you quit the fic. It might not be "bad" per se, but rather it is something that can stick out like a sore thumb.

*** I agree that using contractions can help the flow of dialogue, but it depends on the character.

When I see someone write Dumbledore, Snape, or McGonagall with all contractions, it does break the flow for me because it seems out of character. They do speak with some contractions, but not all. Snape doesn't tell Harry, “don't lie to me,” but, “do not lie to me.”

Conversely, I've seen people write Harry without using any contractions and it feels equally as awkward as writing one of his teachers with all contractions.

****** Hehehe you may have a point.

And I'd agree that usually using a word so far from a character's voice is missing the mark by a mile, but I've genuinely read a couple of fics that had him down perfectly, in all his sneering, sarcastic, eloquent glory, except for that /one gorram word/.

And it may be annoying, but this morning I tried to read a very popular Snape fic, only to find that all of the characters sounded exactly the same, and everyone spoke in paragraphs of exposition that were literally pages long. I mean, compared to the staggering incompetence and utter ignorance of dialogue, voice, and /how real people actually speak/ in that fic, I can live with a lot. Even Snape saying 'okay' (though I draw the line at OK)

I guess what I'm saying is that it could always be worse.

**** I don't entirely agree with your example, actually. Snape would definitely use contractions, and the whole point of not using them in that moment is to emphasize how furious he is. He's laying stress on every word and leaning on his authority. But in ordinary conversation? Snape would use contractions. (And of course now I'll have to go browse the books and compare their dialogue.)

What grates like nails on chalkboard for me is having Snape, McGonagall, or Dumbledore use "should've" or contractions to that effect (or worse, "should of").

** Sometimes I'll see stories where authors seem to have done some research about the area, meaning it comes across as nearly right. However, I live in Surrey myself so I can't help but notice small little flaws like one story had Harry walking in Little Whinging and suddenly ending up in Windsor which is in the next county over and would require quite a trek even if he started at the very edge of Surrey. Nice effort though.

*** It's not completely implausible. Englefield Green is only 5 miles from Windsor (according to Google's shortest walking and driving distance) and I've definitely walked that distance at times when I'm wandering about because I don't want to go home. I can imagine Harry leaving Privet Drive in a strop and then just walking and walking because he doesn't want to go back. The timing would be the big thing; if he only just left Little Whining and shortly later turned up in Windsor, I can see that'd be jarring.

** When they try to scatter what they think is "British slang" in, because they've been looking at one of those idiotic lists of "British words", and then you have Molly Weasley using a posh Londoner's slang, or Draco Malfoy talking like an absolute Taff. Nothing gets on my nerves more, especially given that it's not that hard to just look at the CANON way they speak and mimic that. It's not always SUPER off, but you can be going through, and then there's a slang word that's just completely out of place.

Cultural ignorance kind of sticks out in the same way, I think, but more because some people pick it up piecemeal, and then it feels like there's a process that's incomplete, but the writer doesn't know.

Like, for example, a character asking if they'd like a cup of tea, but not asking if they want milk or sugar. It's not that it breaks the immersion, exactly, just that it kind of reminds you that the writer has never been asked if they want a cup of tea in their life.

Later on, they started reading fanfictions and encounter those kind of "British slang" as you put it, and it just stuck, lol.

For someone like me, who has been taught and used American English for almost twenty years, it takes conscious effort to look out for the words that have a British equivalent and write them that way, so I tend to avoid 'slang' altogether.

** Relationships where the characters are like 11 or 12 and are thinking about sex and/or looking at each other's bodies. I'm not sure if it's worse with or without a time travel element to the stories.

Like for example I'm currently reading a Harry-goes-back-in-time story and the author keeps coming back to Harry having /thoughts/ about Ginny and wanting to /progress their relationship/ (at this time, they haven't even kissed yet) but having to remind himself she's an 11 year old girl all the time. The way it's written keeps almost suggesting that we, the reader, should start to try and forget that she's 11 and fantasize about her too, and it's really coming close to breaking my immersion every time it comes up (which is too often).

I can only assume they're written by people who are themselves minors or who are forgetting what they were like at a younger age; fact is, an 18 year old or an adult in a child's body would in all likelihood back away from trying to rekindle a relationship with a prepubescent kid, soulmates or no soulmates, just because of the ick factor.

And anyway, aren't kids that age a little young to be thinking about dating anyway??? People seem to always forget kids are confused at first by hormones, not instantly turned into sex maniacs from 10 or 11.

**** Yeah, paedophile time travellers are a different issue to how kids naturally act at that age. Most adults apparently tell themselves lies and deliberately forget what it was like to be that age, because I distinctly remember:

1. Every boy in first year (aka Year 7) had a crush on the girl in the year with the (what at the time seemed to be) "biggest boobs". On reflection it was likely the girl with the most padded bra.

2. People wrote sex related graffiti into desks - the word "sex", the classical cock graffiti, etc.

3. Everyone gossiped about who was going out with who. Of course at that age no one actually spent significant time with their boyfriend/girlfriend. But having one in name alone was a status thing.

4. Those who did have boyfriends/girlfriends definitely kissed. Mostly at lunch break.

5. The girl who didn't know what a blow job was received endless teasing (read: bullying) about it.

Now, I learnt writing Alexandra Potter that there are limits to what amount of realism is desirable. Reading 11 year olds as they actually are is tiresome and jarring for an adult mind. But to criticise it for lack of realism is misguided.

***** Yes! I remember when I was in seventh grade (age 12) there was a girl in my classes that was curiously mature. I was a terribly awkward kid at that age and I remember an instance in the library where this girl came up to me and asked if I was a virgin. At the time, I was utterly embarrassed to admit that I was. When I got older and thought about it again, I was like "What the hell kind of question was that? I was 12. Of COURSE I was a virgin."

We were all dealing with rapidly changing bodies and I remember not even knowing where to put my hands in case I accidentally touched my boobs. Thoughts of sex were everywhere. I even got called sexy by a boy in kindergarten. Given, this was a kid that usually wore a Dallas Cheerleaders shirt, but still. Even in elementary school, like second and third grade it was there.

In fifth grade I had a very good friend that was a boy and we were together all the time. We were constantly asked if we were "going around" and kids seemed really confused that we weren't. Mostly because he was gay, but likely didn't quite know it at the time.

Even in preschool there was a boy that me and a few other girls used to compete over. I was a teacher aide for several years for mostly first and second graders and there were definitely little boyfriends and girlfriends in the class. I remember being out on the playground in one kindergarten and I heard one kid yell, "Get her Tyler!" and to my amazement, a little boy dove at a little girl and kissed her. So this girl was basically assaulted on the playground by another five-year-old.

So, to think that children don't have any sexual thoughts whatsoever is completely disingenuous.

***** It varies from person to person, from place to place, and so on. I do remember that there was a girl in my class that someone from the class tried to woo when we were nine, and while it may not necessarily mean an obsession with sex because, again, it varies, it does at the very least imply that something of a physical attraction was there (and I remember because I was jealous of her, which also implies a certain desire for physical attraction, be it given or be it received, on my part).

And at twelve there definitely were people who were forming couples. At thirteen (not sure if she was thirteen or still twelve, but I presume the former) there was a girl in my class who stopped coming to school because of advanced pregnancy, which happened willingly and in fact out of her own initiative (which I'd found bizarre because of how irresponsible she was, but the desire for maternity ... no, I can admit it was already there when I looked at her, muddled as it's been when I felt it).

You may not have felt anything at that age, and that may be true. Likewise, those around you may not have felt anything either and that too may have been true. Some people do, some people don't. And it's not necessarily an obsession, in some cases it's just feelings, but if people allow or even encourage them to act on those feelings, well ... some adults like to pretend that never happens because it makes them uncomfortable, but no, happen it sometimes does.

On the same line, calling the teachers "professors". It kind of feels like calling a group of elderly witches "madams", just because they might have the title "Madam _____".

And the creeping use of the definite article. "Harry went back to the Ravenclaw tower". IDK, it just grates a little, every time. He might go to the tower, or the dungeons, or Ravenclaw, or the common room. But something about "the Gryffindor tower" feels really off.

But fics talk about "the professors were all standing by the table" or "he asked the professor" and so on, rather than "the teachers". Would you say "the madams were all standing by the table"?

To put it another way, everyone in ordinary British schools calls the teachers "sir" and "miss", or more formally "Mr (whatever)" "Mrs,Ms,Miss (whatever)", or occasionally "Dr". Informally, you might say "Sir said..." or "Miss said...". But you would never say "I asked /the/ sir..." or "Who is the miss for that lesson?" or "the sirs were standing by the table". The use of "professor" and "professors" for the Hogwarts teacher in many fics crosses over into this sort of use, and it's just a minor grating thing for me.

So it probably seems a natural use of language for you, referring in that way to anyone with that title who teaches. In the UK, in our universities, our lecturers (who teach us) often do not have the title "professor" and are unlikely to /be/ professors, because our academic ranks work differently. "Professor" is a much higher, rarer rank over here. Many (all?) of my lecturers were doctors, and addressed as "Dr ____" (although we mostly just referred to them by their last names, when not addressing them directly), but I wouldn't have ever said "ask the doctor" when talking about them unless I was joking.

That is in fact exactly what you can do. Contraction is a piece of punctuation that indicates a letter is missing, nothing more. It has nothing to do with grammar - all the words are exactly the same. Grammatical analysis actually strips out punctuation entirely, which is how you end up with grammatically correct sentences like "Sailors sailors sailors fight fight fight" and "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo".

The fact that we have certain common contractions does not mean that the operation of contraction is limited to that list.

And it would be correct?

And grammatical analysis definitely doesn't strip punctuation entirely, I don't know where you got that idea. Those sentences you gave still require a period at the end to be correct. The reason there isn't more punctuation is because they don't need any more to be correct. No punctuation has been stripped from them- they don't require any, besides a period at the end. That's actually exactly what makes those sentences so interesting. You can't just strip out needed punctuation from a sentence and say it's correct.

Yes, that sentence is grammatically correct. It's not comprehensible and thus bad use of language, but there is nothing incorrect in there.

It's important to distinguish lexical semantics (i.e. the meaning of a phrase) and syntax, which is concerned with the logical structure of the language. Grammar in the linguistic sense is concerned with the latter, and punctuation is logic-neutral. Your contraction-heavy example sentence is semantically meaningless in that no one would be able to read it with meaning, but it is syntactically and thus grammatically correct.
