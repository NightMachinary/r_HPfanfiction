*Premises:* A wizard who has the power to move physical objects how and where they like by force of will; this power does not drain their magic, nor does it interact with their spell-casting in any way. Ease of manipulation is decided by distance of the object. So for instance, if they want to pour a cup of tea,they'll be way more careful doing it from the living room next door than when standing by the stove just a few feet away.

*Question:* In your opinion(s), can this wizard perform normal wand magic using their telekinetic power? Would this necessarily free up their hands in any significant way? How quickly does a character able to multitask to some extent using this trick enter the realm of OP?

Just wanted to point out that in the HP universe, casting spells doesn't drain the mana pool, because wizards don't have one.

Wand spells and wandless spells are functionally the same thing. The magic is inside the wizard, not the wand. Wands are just an optional tool for focusing magic.

#+begin_quote

  - "These wizarding world accessories aren't just ordinary wooden sticks -- they're much, much more. They channel and focus magic... Magic can be performed without a wand, but it's difficult. Basically, having a wand helps -- and they also end up being a really personal item to the carrier."

If the wizard can concentrate on two different spells at the same, then they can cast two spells at once. Concentrating on spells isn't easy, just look at how hard it is to Apparate, which they limit to teaching kids once they reach Year 6. Other spells that require heavy concentration are the Patronus Charm (happy memory) and the Boggart Banishing spell (funny thoughts).

  - "Step two," said Twycross, "focus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!"
#+end_quote

Can you read two different books at one time, one in your left hand, and one in your right hand? Would you be able to answer questions about the content at the end of the chapter? If so, then you can probably cast two spells at once.

There was a case of a speed-reader who could read two different pages of the same book at the same time, then parse them together into a whole understanding. Video of him reading shows his eyes looking in different directions to pull it off. I bet he could cast two spells at the same time

**** Honestly I don't think you even need to go to that extreme. The spells that require more concentration, sure, but does someone like Dumbledore or Voldemort require concentration to levitate or summon something? I think the simpler spells would be able to be dual-casted by a decent enough wizard, although since we never see that happen or be brought up it seems like the limit is one at a time, at least if you're only channeling it through the wand.

Don't they, though? If someone does non stop intensive spell casting, don't they tire out more quickly than if they had been just relaxing?

** Your premises is fundamentally flawed I think.

Firstly, there are a number of ways magic are approached in fantasy/supernatural fiction. One is what you seem to be thinking - magic is a quantifiable energy source (aka magic = energy). Numerous examples abound of this, such as the Nasuverse and F/SN. This is not magic in Harry Potter, whether in the books or films.

Magic in Harry Potter is a phenomenon that is conceptual, not scientific. It has no energy source, and never runs out. Its more akin to mythical phenomenon like dieties, black magic and fae that are more like independent forces of nature. In this sense, magic is more like what is seen in say ASOIAF and GoT - a force that is only tangentially understood, but follows a few patterns and behaviors under certain conditions. Wizards don't get tired from using magic (if anything, they get tired because they probably don't get much in the way of strenuous activity).

Now as to telekinesis. Telekinesis is something generally thought of in the previous 'scientific' approach to magic I described. What magicals do when they do not use wands is basically the same thing as with the wands: they use their magic to make their intent reality. The wand is just a more convenient tool (think like a maestro's baton for an opera) for enforcing their intent. People can do wandless magic if 1) their intent is great enough, or desperate such as in OOTP or 2) they have such a good understanding of magic or the spell in particular that they don't require the additional components (i.e. wand, words, motions, etc.).

As for what normal wizards can do? I think canon supports the observation that most wizards are generally far inferior than, say, Harry, Ron and Hermione. Remember, most MoM employees cannot even do a shield charm. Wandless magic is probably, if it occurs at all in most people, in category 1) as mentioned previously.

TLDR: Magic is not science or quantifiable, its more of mystical force with some observable trends. Wandless magic is extremely common, but is the same thing as wanded magic except more difficult.

*** To clarify:

Whether it drains the magic or not, and whether or not that statement makes sense isn't as important as my premises make it seem. Apologies for that. I was attempting to convey this point: in my hypothetical scenario, the telekinetic power is entirely separate from the wizard's magic. It is as a sort of third immaterial limb.

So another way to phrase the question is this: when using the magic wand, do you have to be physically touching it? If this hypothetical wizard were levitating their wand, and tried to cast a spell through it, would they:

- fail and end up casting weak wandless magic?

- or would the spell in question still be channelled into the wand?

No, Harry casts a Lumos spell through his wand without touching it in the beginning of book 5 I believe.

** Of note, this subreddit has a very strong (and fair) bias against the idea that spells 'drain' magic. I do tend to like that approach myself - not in anything as crude as numbers, but in the general idea that magic/magical will is like a muscle/part of the body, and can cause the user to grow tired if overexerted (either through the use of magic that uses too much, or being 'inefficient' with magic). There's an excellent answer [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2a0il4/in_defense_of_magical_cores/ciqle8c/][here]] from a few years ago that tends to be how I think about it.

In any case, I'm entirely of the opinion that in fanfiction you can make it whatever you choose, particularly with how vague canon is on the mechanics and limitations of magic. So in your case, what do you think? You can have 'magical ability' work as a kind of recharging pool or not, or call it 'magical will' or whatever. You could have it simply be based on the physical/mental conditions of the character.

Now, I can give you some aspects of what I'd imagine. For wand magic, I've always pictured the wand as a conduit - something that when held physically, or nearby, lets the user channel their magic through it and help control it. In that context, I would be inclined to say that no, the telekinetic power would not let them use their wand remotely - but that is entirely up to you. Maybe you can have it work like wandless/wordless magic - that is, needing a lot of concentration and exceedingly hard to learn.

In the same vein, does this telekinesis free up their hands? Perhaps not. I know I immediately thought of a force user, needing hand gestures to use said telekinesis in most situations. So in some contexts, it could require /more/ use of the hands, and unless they're exceedingly good at multitasking, using both it and a spell would seem very very difficult.

As for being OP, that entirely depends on the limitations of the telekinesis, and the challenges you put the character up against. If they're able to minutely move a dozen boulders while painting three paintings and casting the Patronus, all while sitting back in a chair and reading a book - that'll clearly be OP in most situations. Instead, if they're struggling to pour a cup of tea while casting Wingardium Leviosa on another object at the same time, that'll be very different.

** I agree with the others. Magic does not drain wizards and witches, that's not how magic works in HP (magical cores and stuff like that were invented in fanfiction, they don't appear in canon). And I don't see why you would differentiate between telekinesis and magic? A wandless, wordless Wingardium Leviosa is pretty much the same thing. It's super difficult to do, though, so I doubt many people could manage that + another spell at the same time.
