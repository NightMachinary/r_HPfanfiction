Does anyone know if there are any fanfics in which the 'power he knows not" are actually just guns and Harry shoots everyone?

** There was one i read ages ago where the prophecy was rewritten somewhat, where instead of either will die at the hand of the other, it was bu the word of the other, which lead to harry telling some army to kill voldy. One guy sniped him in the head pretty much ending the fight immediately XD
