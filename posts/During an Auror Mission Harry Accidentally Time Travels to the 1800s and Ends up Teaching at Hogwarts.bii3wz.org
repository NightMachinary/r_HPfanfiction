  "Albus, my boy! Would you care for a slice of treacle tart?" asked Professor Potter with a twinkling green eyes.

** Yeah, wow. When I read the title I was thinking "Why the 1800's? Nothing happens during that time". And I completely forgot that Dumbledore was alive then. I've seen fics where Harry mentor's himself, or teaches Voldemort as a kid, or teaches his parents; but never Dumbledore. That could be fun.

​

I just looked it up right now. Dumbledore was born in 1881, so he would have started in 91 or 92. I guess it still counts as the 1800's if it's in the last decade.

*** Actually I wanted Harry to be an old man when he mets Dumbledore. If he's on his 30s when he arrived at the early 1800s then he'll be on his 120s when Dumbledore arrived at Hogwarts.

Like make it a one shot where albus just finished having a chat with Harry and Harry says “I hope the elves have some more treacle tarts for dessert” as he leaves and albus thinks back to the first time he tried it thanks to ‘Professor Potter'

*** That's a really cool fic except that if indeed Harry time-travelled he really wouldn't be into Dumbledore. In fact this whole thing is disturbing. He was a student in his school with many years of difference and then his headmaster with also quite some years of difference and despite JKR's way of doing things recently, Harry really isn't gay. But except this tiny detail it was a great fic. It's surprising Harry didn't do more to help Ariana sooner.

Finally I would have loved to see a showdown Grindelwald vs. Dumbledore where Dumbledore loses but in the end Harry saves the day and vanquishes him (a bit like Harry was saved in the Ministry by Dumbledore).
