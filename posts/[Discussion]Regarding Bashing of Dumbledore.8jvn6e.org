I would say Steve is not the best example of this. He famously took a $1 a year salary and lived in a relatively modest house in Palo Alto (well, modest by PA standards). He did have the use of a private jet and loads and loads of stock, but I'd also seen the dude in some ratty-ass jeans and sneakers when he was still kicking around campus. I think I saw him in jeans that had a hole in back pocket once.

  So this really begs the question if this is just a plot device to smear his character if authors don't have enough plot points to potray him as a bad character
#+end_quote

It clearly is, so if we assume the theft of money is to upgrade his lifestyle to Malfoy levels, the author is basically destroying his character in an effort to find more ways to bash him. It's not that disimiliar to authors exaggerating Ron eating like a pig, backstabbing Harry on the drop of a dime, being a racist because Hermione doesn't love him romantically, etc...

Now if the money is to pay off members of the order, that makes no sense. Half of those bashing fics are like 'Harry you've been dosed with loyalty potions (which coincidentally don't make him not care even though they should),' if Dumbledore wanted supporters he has no incintive to buy loyalty, someone else could buy it with more in that case, instead he could just imperius or drug his ideal followers if he can't convince them.

I now kinda want to see an evil dumbledore done well, so like actually propping up dark lords to keep his rep up as the good guy, false political opposition that he created to make himself not look like a dictator, cleverly killing off people who are actually threats to him, he'd actually appear innocent in the story and not be so obviously evil a first year can tell, and he wouldn't be outed as the antagonist half a chapter in.

** There's ... /tons/ of stuff even a "good" Dumbledore could be doing with access to a fortune. There's so much we don't know about the canon world that it's not hard to invent situations that require Dumbledore to need lots of money. Countering bribes, keeping prisoners in Azkaban, maybe /funding/ Azkaban, maybe funding the /government/ (there might be no taxes and the government is funded by "interested" families), keeping Malfoy off the Wizengamot, maybe the Ministry won't pay for muggleborn education or Muggle Studies so Dumbledore has to fund scholarships and "department chairs", investing in businesses so the Malfoys/Notts/Whoever don't take over everything, paying Remus to not need a job, paying Mundungus to do stuff, stocking up on potions and other gear, setting up safehouses, financing a spy network (probably concentrated in Britain, but potentially spreading out through Europe and the entire world), Wolfsbane potions for werewolves who can't afford it, scholarships for squibs kicked out of their families, funding wars against dark magicals in other countries, ...

Magical Britain has an economy based on money. Therefore there are things of value that can be purchased or achieved with money. Even Harry's canon vault had "mounds of gold coins" (that's really a lot of money) and hey, James said "Sure! Take what you need!" (we can suppose).

There are really just three scenes where they truly get along, one is Ron waking up after being poisoned, one is after Dumbledore's death and the last is the asspull romance.

As seen in GoF, OotP and HBP, Ron is one for looks, not that there is anything wrong with that. Therefore pairing him with someone who looks good, is enough, at least for Hogwarts era stuff (and I don't find the postwar era interesting unless you completely ditch DH and build your own AU).

I disagree. Both acted almost exactly in the manner he predicted. He emotionally manipulated Snape time after time, and he was right on the nose with Malfoy. The only thing he didn't accurately predict was the Elder Wand's ownership transferring to Malfoy, and in the end, it was better that the wand didn't die a natural death.

It's fucking ridiculous and insane, and that is the ONE THING I will always change in my year 6 fanfics, that the staff and the law enforcement actually get in there and take Malfoy out.

Dumbledore claimed he cared about the school, but harry was right when he accused him of actually NOT giving a damn. "You're leaving it defenseless and Malfoy has been doing things all year under your nose." Harry was exactly right, and Dumbledore didn't care. He let it happen.

** In my opinion, cannon Dumbledore is well meaning, but also an out right criminal when he feels like laws and morals need to be ignored "for the greater good". For example I see him capable of out right killing Harry personally if that would have killed Voldemort or prevented the war from happening, and then later going and honestly grieving Harrys death.

With cannon Dumbledore being like that it is kind of easy for fan fiction writers to make Dumbledore greedy or even actually evil or insane.

** Dumbledore is a gray character as far as I'm concerned. But writing gray characters is hard, so people shove him into wearing a white or black hat.

*** The entirety of the last book is basically a story of how basically no one alive knew Dumbledore well and that while being clever he is as prone to making terrible mistakes as anyone else, especially when driven by emotion....

What did he do to arrange Harry to die? The prophecy already said that he would?

**** I think different people knew different facets of Dumbledore. Elphias Doge new Dumbledore the boy, and Dumbledore the teenager. Aberforth knew Dumbledore, the ambitious young man. Snape knew Dumbledore the great, and Dumbledore the schemer. And Harry, well Harry knew Dumbledore the idealist, and Dumbledore - the man who stood up for what's right.

***** I like this comment a lot, because it's true for people in real life as well. Dumbledore is a very complex character who means many different things to different people.

** u/Krististrasza:

  So this really begs the question if this is just a plot device to smear his character if authors don't have enough plot points to potray him as a bad character
#+end_quote

No. But let me elaborate:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes to this.

But

#+begin_quote
  if authors don't have enough plot points to potray him as a bad character
#+end_quote

No to this part.

It is not that they have not enough plot points, it is that it is incredibly easy to use this plot device. It's on the first page of Plotting For Lazy People 101: How to make someone look evil? Have them take ALL TEH MONIEZ!!!

Not need for character interactions or plans, just make them steal +forty cakes+the money.

What that does to their portrayal of Harry they usually don't realise and don't care.

** The only time I saw it done well wasn't even a bashing fic really. Basically in this fic the war kept going even after Voldemort was defeated, with Lucius Malfoy (I think?) becoming the new Dark Lord. Dumbledore ended up bankrupting himself funding the war and then he chose to use the Potter vaults to keep the war from failing due to funding.

** There are a handful of stock explanations that tend to be given in Bad!Dumbledore stories.

- Giving the Dursley's Harry's money to take care of him...which is sort of the point of a trust fund anyway.
- Gratuitously enriching Order members because the whole organization is corrupt.
- Paying off one or more of the Weasleys (and Hermione) to participate in his evil schemes.
- Providing scholarships to poor and muggle-born students who otherwise wouldn't be able to go to Hogwarts. (Of course, this assumes a lot of aristocratic magical Britain tropes for it to make sense.)
