  Severus Snape has returned to Magical Britain a changed man after a long absence. He resumes his old position at Hogwarts, only to discover that he is not the only one who has changed in the seven years since Voldemort's fall.All hail J. K. Rowling, creator of the Harry Potter Universe and owner of all contained therein. (This is a fan work; I own nothing. The only payment I receive is in the form wonderful reader comments!)
