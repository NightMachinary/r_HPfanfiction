** I've had a lot of trouble finding GOOD fics where Harry is some kind of half-blood creature or infected with lycanthropy/vampirism, and those that have at least okay writing are abandoned pretty much always. I'd love to see Harry is a _____ done well - unfortunately like you've said, the only completed ones I've found are crack.

** A oneshot about Harry being a vampire, a scene from his first year: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23391646][The BMI of a Young Wizard]]

I also read a really cute vamp Harry fic a while ago that I think was Severitus-like. I'm trying to find it around here somewhere.....

** I rather like Cold Blood linkffn(5786099)

Harry gets turned into a kinda dragonkin. Notably becomes good friends with Viktor Krum and plays significant role.
