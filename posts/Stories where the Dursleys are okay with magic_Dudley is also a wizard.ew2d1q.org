As above, I'm looking for stories where the Dursleys are not anti-magic and thus, perhaps, are nice to Harry. Ones where Dudley is also a wizard would also be appreciated. Completed stories only though, please. Just got done with what there was of Magical Relations without realising until I got there that it stopped, unfinished, after Ch 71... ðŸ˜ª

Thanks for your help!


** Not quite what your looking for, but there is a series around a Holly Wycliffe, Harry's niece and Dudley's daughter...can't remember the name but it actually wasn't too bad. Think the first two or three books in the series were complete.

Really neat worldbuilding around Hufflepuff and Holly's attributes as an Empath (she could feel other people's emotions)

** linkffn(7390454)\\
I know you asked for completed ones and this one is theoretically complete, but it has two sequels and the last one is sadly not completed yet and I dont know if it ever will. It is a great read though and about an older Dudley (during Harrys 7th year and up).

Also as already someone said linkffn(4923158). This one is actually complete and a good fanfic in my opinon :)

** inagine Petunia being okay with magic, but spiteful enough to bar Harry to go to Hogwarts when Dudley gets in.

Ooh, a Dudley is nice fic where Harry reads and learns from his old books, but doesnt have a wand and casts with his fingers like in the Magicians.
