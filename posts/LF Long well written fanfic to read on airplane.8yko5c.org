Hi! I'm going on a pretty long plane ride soon so I would appreciate some lengthy fix recs. I don't have many preferences, so long as it doesn't have a lot of bashing and it's well written. I love funny fics but I'm open to anything.


** - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] is a story that begins by including all of the worst tropes (wrong boy-who-lived, super-Slytherin Harry) and all of the plot holes from canon, and then methodically subverts each and every one of them and creates extremely compelling internal reasons that completely justify and expand on each one, expertly weaving a logically consistent and surprisingly engaging story around the well-worn collection of tropes, cliches, and plot-holes associated with Harry Potter. It's a long story that has some minor grammar issues, but once you get past the initial parts that set up the tropes, it's absolutely worth it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] is a highly AU story featuring a ruthless and brilliant (non-snakified, non-insane) Tom Riddle who rules Magical Britain and his complicated relationship with Harry Potter. Vastly different from canon and any other fanfic, it features awesome magic and fighting, great characterization, and incredible world building. It's sadly incomplete, but at over 1.25M words, there's more than enough story for it to be worth your while.

**** I honestly don't remember, but I found the story to be quite good from the beginning, even though the early parts were familiar territory. It wasn't a slog at all. The tropes and cliches are tired but the way the story handles them is not.

I've read a /lot/ of HP fanfic, and I think this story is probably one of the best ones out there, top 5 at least. I remember being amazed at how well it explained and subverted so many plot holes and tropes. I suggest giving it a shot, and if it doesn't grab you, just put it aside and read it later when you're more willing to invest a bit of time in it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** If you at all like Ginny as a character, or don't hate next Gen or epilogue- & Cursed Child-compliant work, here are a couple of my favourites:

“Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to understand why.” [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342]]

Also its sequels, which you can find titled “Armistice series” by the same author.

There's also this author, who has some really fun takes on the post-war Potter family dynamic. Canon pairings incl. Albus/Scorpius. It takes place the summer after Cursed Child and has two sequels. Really fun humour.

** The Rise of the Drackens by Starlight_Massacre [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8022667/1/The-Rise-of-the-Drackens]]

Summary: Harry comes into a very unexpected inheritance. He is a creature both rare and very dangerous, a creature that is black listed by the British Ministry. So now he must avoid detection at all costs, whilst choosing his life partners and dealing with impending pregnancy at just sixteen. With danger coming not just from the Ministry but even other creatures, what was he supposed to do?

It's Harry/Draco/Blaise/OC/OC. It's a lot of romance, lots of sex(y) stuff, quite a bit of drama, as well as some funny stuff and even a little angst/sad stuff here and there.

Its one of my all time favorite fics, and not just from HP, but all of my fandoms. It's very well written, more than 100 chapters so far and more than a million words and it's not completed yet. But, she updates it pretty regularly. It does have quite a few OCs, but she writes in a way that after awhile you forget that they're OCs and not from the books. You fall in love with her characters and they feel like friends of yours. I really can't recommend it enough, it's amazing.

The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929]]

Summary: When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

Hermione/Sirius, Hermione/Remus, Remus/Tonks

Another one of my all time favorite fics. It's VERY well written, very long at 154 chapters and more than 700 thousand words. It's completed. You will laugh, you will cry (believe me on that one), you'll fall in love with the characters. I also can't recommend this one highly enough either. It's amazing.

** I have a well-written Snape-centric trilogy (first two are complete, third is WIP but it's over 1 million words total). I know not everyone loves Snape, Parent! Snape, or Mentor!Snape but in case you aren't against it, I've often been told my Snape is very believable but sympathetic.

#+begin_quote
  A realistic Snape's daughter story. Severus Snape discovers he has a daughter, born of a brief affair with Bellatrix Lestrange. First, a journey to reach the frightened, emotionally damaged child, and then a full-blown mental war, as Bellatrix manages to possess the girl from her cell in Azkaban. Among other things, an in-depth exploration of Occlumency. AU, in-character Snape.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. Sequel to "Always in Your Shadow". Severus Snape's daughter Calista attends Hogwarts. As if Occlumency lessons, peer rivalry, and growing up Snape weren't challenging enough, she still has to contend with her dangerous, sadistic mother, Bellatrix Lestrange, trying to invade her mind. AU, in-character; CC where possible. In-depth exploration of the art of Occlumency.

  Third in series. Snape's daughter fic. After graduating from Hogwarts, Calista Snape's plans include a new career at St. Mungo's, working with the Committee for Experimental Charms, and building her relationship with her boyfriend, Gerald Boot --- but shadows and blood still follow her and her father, as the Second Wizarding War approaches. AU, but all in-character; well-written.

**** And it only emcompasses preHogwarts through summer before year 4. Black Bond II picks it up after that, but its probably abandoned at this rate. Or in just a massive hiatus. (its another 100k+ words in just 2 chapter)
