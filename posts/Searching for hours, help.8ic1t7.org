Awhile back I read a HP FanFiction.Net story and I forgot to favorite it so that I could read it again. I've been searching for the past few hours and I cannot find it.

The plot is that Harry left after the battle of Hogwarts X many years ago. He's dying and wants to see Hogwarts one last time, so he makes a visit and doesn't tell Dumbledore or anyone else that he's dying. I believe that Hermione is a teacher there now. Snaps gets tasked with finding a cure for Harry and lives with him for a time. No slash or ships though. I remember that Harry's house is sentient as well and one of the defenses Harry activates makes the house vanish and it makes him sad. Harry is also friends with a Vampire lord too who pretty much threatens Snape to find a cure. He also threatens to turn Harry.

Has anyone read this particular fanfic and if so do you know the name?


** I've read this, as well, but can't remember what its called. I'll try looking, maybe I'll have some luck.

** Uh, I don't think Hermione is a teacher in it if this is the fic you're looking for. All of the other descriptions match though.

*** That's it! I'm not sure why I thought she was a professor but I could've been confused with one of the “Harry gets sent to Azkaban” stories. Thank you! I gave up looking last night when I reached the 3 hour mark and accompanying headache.
