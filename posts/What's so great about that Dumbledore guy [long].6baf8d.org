For the sake of this discussion I want to purposely ignore all the Evil!Dumbledore stuff (like conspiracy to commit child abuse, neglect of duties, kidnapping, brainwashing, abuse of power, etc). That's a different argument and has been explored more than enough... We'll just go with the idea in canon that he is a great man and it's all super awesome-good because it was necessary.

The main point: Even if we assume that he has everyone's best interest at heart, it seems like he is *really* bad at it. He's senile/incompetent at the very least and I won't pull any punches, I'm biased and won't give him the benefit of the doubt (so better don't read if you love Dumbledore too much). Feel free to be his advocate if you disagree with my perspective on his history. Just imagine I'm the prosecutor, not a judge trying to be fair.

Also I'll assume that he is an extremely proficient wizard and all his accolades in that regard are well deserved (this is an important consideration, he is quite powerful and should be able to do something productive considering the wide variety of magic available to him without delving into evil, other than sitting on his ass).

Onto his "accomplishments" (sorry for the messy formatting and rambling tone, this evolved over the last few days):

- Dumbledore becomes enamoured with a nascent Dark Lord (Grindelwald), apparently seeing nothing but a lovable sweet guy with amazing philosophy, except when it resulted in the violent death of his sister Arianna (1899). His own brother Aberforth (deservedly) shuns him from that point onwards.

- Personally recruits another nascent Dark Lord (Tom Riddle) from an orphanage. Of course - according to his own words (!) - he was suspicious about the guy from the beginning, yet (surprisingly) is completely unable to prevent Riddle from delving deeply in the dark arts, opening the Chamber of Secrets petrifying multiple students and murdering muggle-born student Myrtle. Did Dumbledore warn his colleagues, like Slughorn, about his suspicions on Riddle? Maybe make some kind of case against the student? Present actionable evidence? I mean, this isn't just silly schoolyard bullying, he suspects the dude of being a stone-cold killer, right? I've seen teachers who do more against illegal snowball fights than Dumbledore seems to do about a deranged murderer.

- EDIT: Some people in this thread seem to think that Dumbledore had no reason to suspect Riddle. Here's the relevant quote from the books:

#+begin_quote
  Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time? said Dumbledore. No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. *I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him*, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others sake as much as his.

  His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such a young wizard and most interestingly and ominously of all he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. *The little stories* of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave *were most suggestive*. /I can make them hurt if I want to./
#+end_quote

So either Dumbledore is lying about being suspicious in regards to Riddle in order to make himself look smart and all-knowing in front of Harry or he's an absolute imbecile and literally the worst at keeping his eye on someone. "Oh, there's a creepy kid that I wanted to keep an eye on. Oh, students have been petrified. Oh, the Chamber of Secrets has been openend. Oh, someone murdered Myrtle. I have no idea what could possibly be going on. I'm sure these things aren't connected at all, I'll just continue being useless". Face it, the guy is a moron. 12-year-old Hermione would have solved that case a few days after the first petrification and exposed Riddle as the Heir of Slytherin: "Lets make a list, who do we suspect. 1. Hagrid 2. Riddle 3. ???". Case closed.

- Dumbledore was also unable to exonerate Hagrid, even though it seems trivial in hindsight (how did a spider petrify everyone? Maybe interview Myrtle's ghost about how she died? Get your hands on a time-turner or something? Spy on Riddle with your awesome magical abilities? I don't know...). Since he - supposedly - suspected Tom Riddle of being super evil it should have been a high priority to curtail him as early as possible... but nah. [I'm just going to say that I don't buy any of that, even for Dumbledore's levels of incompetence it seems a bit much to get so utterly blind-sighted by a child that he supposedly suspected all along... he probably suspected nothing] Lets just move on... though I'd like to say that even if Dumbledore suddenly became competent and tried everything humanly possible to exonerate Hagrid (cutting him some slack, Dumbledore is just a very powerful teacher at this point), shouldn't that have given him an insight on how ridiculously corrupt and broken their system is and try to do something about it later? Maybe be a bit more suspicious about Sirius supposedly betraying his almost-brother? Eh, too sensible.

- After - presumably - lots of moaning and griping about his terrible burdens, Dumbledore finally takes responsibility and defeats Grindelwald in a duel in 1945. Good job, Albus. Took him long enough (including a terrible second World War that took a death toll of 60 million people - which might not have happened if he confronted his crush earlier). But since Albus is such a honest and respectable guy we'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that at least he was very open about all information regarding Grindelwald and consulted with experts giving them a psychological profile and insider information in order to catch Grindelwald off-guard in the years before the confrontation. Sure, yeah, that happened. Which is why it's totally public knowledge that he was very close to Grindelwald and no-one is surprised by that information at all. It's not like Dumbledore would try to hide his shameful past and be embarrassed, even if inside knowledge could help save lives, right?

- Dumbledore turns down offers for Minister of Magic multiple times... it's not like magical Britain is in desperate need of competent governance or anything. According to him, it's because he can't be trusted with all that power or whatever. Or maybe, just maybe, he's the kind of guy who constantly does the wrong thing for the wrong reasons (double whammy!) and he unconsciously knows it. Or he's just a pansy...

- At some point Dumbledore gains the positions of Headmaster of Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the ICW. Including his First Order of Merlin his political capital and ... ahem... power (whoops) must be unfathomable. But he's not the Minister so, it's all /goooood/. I guess? Seems to me kinda like he's that guy who's responsible for everything, has his fingers in a lot of pies, but never puts his own signature on the final forms. How Dumbledore gets away with the disgusting state of Hogwarts until Book 5 (Binns, Snape, alcoholic teachers, breeding ground for bigotry, recruitment camp for Death Eaters, petrifications, etc), even though he's actually, formally, responsible for that, is anyone's guess.

- under his watchful eye Magical Britain tumbles into the first blood war. Luckily Dumbledore kept an eye on Voldemort all the time and was ready to apprehen... nevermind. Also he takes quick action to inform the public and the government about Tom Riddle aka Voldemort, right? Oh he didn't? Well at the very least he told them that Voldemort is actually a Half-Blood in order seed distrust and paranoia in his ranks and stop recruitment of pure-bloods? No? WHY?!

- Things get more and more out of control, Dumbledore starts a largely unsuccessful resistance group (some kind of burned chicken club), which results in a gruesome blood-bath for the good side. I must quote a paragraph from Wikia about the history of the Order of the Phoenix here. I can't top that, it's just too perfect:

#+begin_quote
  Although the Death Eaters had been attacking mostly Muggles and Muggle-borns to spread terror, they soon turned to attacking "blood traitors" such as Order members as well. Fabian and Gideon Prewett were murdered by a group of six Death Eaters led by Antonin Dolohov. Caradoc Dearborn disappeared, the Bones family was almost completely destroyed, Benjy Fenwick was brutally murdered, and Marlene McKinnon and her family were murdered by Death Eaters, including Travers. Even as the Order suffered great losses, they continued to fight, and four of their members --- James Potter, Lily Potter, Frank Longbottom, and Alice Longbottom --- defied Voldemort himself three times.[1]
#+end_quote

You really can't put "utter failure" into better words, if the best that can be said is that they "continued to fight". Why wasn't there some kind of mutiny? Anyway, Dumbledore later gets a stroke of luck served on a platter by fate and receives a prophecy, but he can't even get that right, holding job interviews at the Hog's Head for some reason and being overheard. I can just imagine him and his overblown ego waltzing through Hogsmeade while a civil-war is going on and him being a prime target himself. Sure, he couldn't have known that he'd receive a prophecy, but the shoe fits.

- Victory finally comes when Dumbledore fails to adequately protect three of his most valuable assets (the Potters). I think the irony that the good guys won by being utterly destroyed (and Dumbledore being defeated/outplayed in every respect) is not appreciated enough. Anyway, he's also unable to ensure the safety of his backup-family, the Longbottoms (don't tell me it's all because of Pettigrew, there's a pattern of incompetence here) . Through sheer dumb luck this doesn't end in a catastrophe, but with the death of Voldemort. For some reason Dumbledore comes out of this as the victor and is widely admired. If I were Dumbledore I'd have quit all my positions out of shame after the death of the Potters and moved in with the Longbottoms as their 24/7 bodyguard (at least until the current crisis is over and Death Eaters on the run are apprehended). Oh and maybe I'd invoke some kind of security measures/protocols to prevent betrayals if I ever revive my secret resistance group. But no, that would be sensible and competent. Way out of character for the whiskered old buffoon.

- At this point, next to The-Boy-Who-Lived, Dumbledore is the shining beacon of light in the Wizarding World. Everyone (except Death Eaters) totally love the guy. He holds multiple positions of vast political influence, he steers the hearts and minds of the next generation, he's totally their king in everything but name (just look at his awesome throne!). If he told the populace - for the greater good of course - they'd need to wear their robes inside out from tomorrow onwards there'd be a law to that effect within the hour, no matter if he's the Minister or not.

- This should be the watershed moment for Wizarding Britain. The good guys have won and hold all the influence, with a strong, charismatic and prominent wise old wizard as their figurehead. The pure-blood supremacy movement is exposed as the inhuman monsters that they truly are. Easy right? Here's what happens instead: Innocent guy is sent to prison without a trial (conviction of innocents should be an impossibility in the Magical world, Veritaserum and Unbreakable Vows exist), Death Eaters with ridiculous excuses run free (the so called "imperius defense" is a joke), rampant corruption, no ideological clean-up of the government, election of incompetent and ineffectual leaders, the continued subjugation of magical beings and werewolves, etc. By not slapping them all silly, giving them some kind of ultimatum or threatening to resign from his positions Dumbledore gives tacit approval to all of that. These are multiple government-ruining type scandals and don't tell me that the public wouldn't be outraged if Dumbledore apprehended Malfoy and filled him to the brim with Veritaserum (or just toss him into Nurmengard, I doubt Grindelwald got a trial, Dumbledore is not above vigilantism, his whole Order operated outside the law).

#+begin_quote
  “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”
#+end_quote

Oh, also Dumbledore gives a hateful person, who has no interest in teaching, a potions job at Hogwarts, ruining potions education for a generation to come... out of pity or something. I don't even know why. With his extreme prominence finding something at least a little bit more appropriate for Snape should have been simple. But this is the same guy who thought it would be a great idea to put a magical child in a household of anti-magic bigots, so what the fuck do I know.

- Instead of a rehabilitated and strong Magical Britain we now have an unstable mess, that is ripe for the taking. It seems like the rickety thing is barely holding together even without Voldemort in the mix. Is it the fault of Fudge? Or is Fudge a symptom of a society with an ineffectual role-model who can't take responsibility and is too lazy or too afraid to involve himself?

- The timeline of the books has been discussed more than enough around here, suffice it to say that Dumbledore's utter uselessness in the political arena continues to impress. This distinguished and most powerful wizard can't even manage to protect his own school, not to mention enacting even just one of his grand ideals: He fails to protect the Philosophers Stone (or fails to prevent his students risking their lives for a fake - if he weren't incompetent), fails to connect the dots about the Chamber of Secrets AGAIN (yet a 12 year old muggleborn figures it all out by reading *books* in the library), fails to protect his students from Dementors and an escaped convict (it really is ridiculous how bad Dumbledore is, if Sirius had actually been evil Harry would be dead multiple times over), fails to recognize that one of his best friends has been replaced by an imposter, fails to convince the public that shit is real yo (that's like Hillary losing against Trump levels of bad, I don't even know how you can manage that... "I invite everyone who doubts our story to watch this memory donated by Harry Potter in my Pensieve" ... make it a public event, there, done, this shouldn't even be a plot-point), fails to protect his students from a teacher that is /literally/ torturing them (Umbridge is a gift, how many opportunities to crush the Fudge administration does this man need?) and then as his crowning achievement stupidly gets himself killed by a Horcrux, because of his personal baggage from 1899. I guess all of this shouldn't be too surprising, considering that this man has a hard time fulfilling the bare necessities of running a school, like finding teachers to fill vacant positions.

Tell me again why this is supposed to be such a great guy and why anyone should listens to his advice? Considering his past success rate it's probably a better idea to do the opposite of what Dumbledore recommends in all situations.

Really, what does he actually DO?! Besides defeating Grindelwald there's nothing in his win column. Magical Britain is a shithole/banana-republic. It seems obvious to me that he should be a Fighter not a leader or administrator. Even his ridiculous plan for Harry could have easily ended in tragedy (would have been amusing if a resurrected, drooling, Harry tried to give gum wrappers to Voldemort instead of fighting him). But whatever, I'm sure it's some kind of Trump-esqe 4D chess that is being played and I'm just oblivious to his brilliance.

Some people say they mellowed out on Dumbledore over the years. For me the opposite is the case: He seems worse and worse the more distance I get from this "imposing old wise wizard mentor" figure the books tried to evoke.

I probably made a bunch of errors (most of this is from memory, if I looked up everything in wikis and the books I'd still be sitting here next month) and included some fanon-bullshit. Looking forward to the corrections (with references if possible). Please tell me of the successes of this great man.


** That's all true - from a certain point of view.

If you look at it differently, by the time of the series, you have an old, worn-out man who has given his all for the good of the wizarding world. He has fought in multiple wars, been forced to duel the Dark Lord he once loved, and basically been cut off from everyone. He has taken up positions of authority he did not want, that were almost forced upon him, and tried to do his best with them. He hasn't always made the right choices, or the best choices, and he knows that. He regrets it, and it haunts him.

What do you think he saw in the Mirror of Erised?

At the end of the day, though, what you are complaining about is inconsistent writing. Madam Rowling, a great author though she may be, did not do a good job of correlating Dumbledore's reputation and his works/history. His character is remarkably inconsistent, as you've pointed out, because it is a necessity for the story Rowling wanted to write to advance.

Well yeah I mean as a sort of tragic regretful character that's kind of sweet (in terms of a literary device), but I'm having trouble finding any of his choices that haven't been bad. In universe it seems weird that he is so revered for doing /one/ good thing among a pile of regrets.

*** Bingo.

Dumbledore can be a great wizard and a shit person at the same time.

Using the series as a lens, seen through Harry's eyes, Dumbledore is the mentor with feet of clay. He's powerful, but not infallible, and he's made his share of poor decisions.

Reading from outside that context, you have the explanation that Rowling did not plot out his characterization in a stellar fashion.

** You started your essay with a description of Dumbledore's life, I'm going to do the same, but from my point of view.

Dumbledore is the most gifted wizard of his generation and he meets someone that challenges him intellectually, who he can discuss deep magical theory with and doesn't have to hold back. They are enraptured in the mysteries of magic and start to view themselves as superior. As young men often do, they view themselves as the saviors of the world, for the greater good is paramount. He spends his formative years with this viewpoint, travelling and learning with his best friend and the man he loves, and he is blinded by him. It all comes crashing down with the death of Arianna. Dumbledore is torn between the man he loves and his sister. His brother and his lover duel, he tries to stop them. Arianna dies. Dumbledore breaks.

Grindelwald leaves and Dumbledore is left alone, with the scorn of his brother and a broken heart. He retreats into the only thing he understands, magic. He travels, becomes famous, and learns magic across the world. He returns in the 30s and decides to teach. He could have done anything he wanted at this point, traveled forever, researched with Flamel for his life, run for office, etc. Instead he takes a teaching position, not teach prodigies, but teaching 11 year olds who have never held a wand. I think this more than everything highlights the good of Dumbledore.

The war starts. Millions are dying and at the head of the magical side is his lover. I firmly believe Dumbledore still loved Grindelwald. He felt betrayed due to the tragedy of Arianna, resentful due to the falling out with Abeforth, and hurt due to the betrayal of trust from Gindelwald, but the heart is not the brain and even with all that he loved him still. Now he reads the papers each day and sees his lover performing atrocities justified with the slogan they created together, "The Greater Good" perverted to match these ideals. As more die each day and he sees young witches and wizards that he taught dying to the wand of his old lover, he steps up. He confronts Grindelwald even as his heart tears itself apart. He fights, he wins. Even then though, even after all the atrocities Grindelwald committed, he can't kill the man he loves. Instead he locks him in Nurmengard and returns to the UK a broken man, for who can face the man they love in war and return whole.

He becomes the light of the wizarding world. He has defeated the man that terrorized nations, and they love him for it. They don't know about the love between the two men, or how it tears at Dumbledore's heart when he thinks about what he's done to the man he loves. They give him the Order of Merlin, positions in the ICW, and herald him as the next Merlin, all for defeating the man he loves.

Time passes, Dumbledore is headmaster and wants to dedicate his time to teaching yet they make him supreme mugwump, and he is still alone. There is no-one his equal, no-one he can share his life with. He is alone at the top of the wizarding world, with the populace viewing him as being beyond a man. Then in the 60s, people start disappearing. The wizarding world has been living in peace after Grindelwald, but now fear starts to run rampant. Voldemort reveals himself in the 70s after running a fear campaign that has the nation scared out of their minds. The ministry is full of corruption and greed, and provide little deterrent to Voldemort's reign of terror. People look towards Dumbledore, surely the man that defeated Grindelwald could defeat this Dark Lord as well? He is the one hope for the populace to look for, the one thing stopping the country falling into darkness. Dumbledore steps up yet again. He forms the Order of the Phoenix and leads them against the Dark Lord. Not for glory, money, or pride, but because the wizarding world needs him, and there is no one else.

For ~15 years Dumbledore leads the resistance against Riddle. People die on both sides, Dumbledore sees the horrors of war yet again, yet this time every death is personal. He has taught every student for the last 30 years. He is one of the very few people that knows every person in the conflict, on both sides. As they die one by one, he feels them all. Unlike with Grindelwald, Riddle will not stand and fight him one on one. He runs, he hides, he strikes from the shadows. Whether Dumbledore would have won is almost irrelevant, I feel he would have been happier dying knowing he had tried, rather than living through his personal hell of his students dying in his stead.

In 1980, after 20 years of war, Dumbledore hears a prophecy. Hope sparks as he realizes there was a possibility of victory that didn't lie on his shoulders. Not for the selfish reasons you might assume, but for the relief that he is allowed to fail, that if he falls to Voldemort the war is not lost. For 20 years Dumbledore has been the only thing in the way of Riddle and total victory, now there is something else. He tries to convince the Potters to allow him to be their secret keeper but they trust their friends first. He looks at the bond James has with Sirius and thinks it may be a good idea after all, for who would betray their brother in all but blood like that.

He meets a young man, Severus Snape, on the hilltop. He saw the way Severus acted around Lily in the first years of Hogwarts, saw the way he fought against the stereotypes of their two houses to keep their friendship alive. Saw how after 5 long years of fighting against the hatred between Slytherin and Gryffindor, he finally succumbed to the pressure and lashed out against the world. Now he sees a man on his knees begging him to save the girl he has loved since they were 7. He binds him in oath and together they fight to bring down the monster destroying the nation.

October 31 1981. Voldemort falls. A mere baby is responsible and two more students have been struck down in this conflict. He looks upon the scar on Harry's head and thinks back to the 50s, how he was treated after defeating Grindelwald. He was put on a pedestal he didn't want, given positions of power he had no desire in taking, but had to, for who else was there? He looked at Harry and realised he did not want that for this baby, for Harry's name would ring out across the country. He would be the new light of hope for the nation, the boy-who-lived, and that is no way to grow up. There was also the danger the boy would face, Riddle did not fight alone and the cruelties that those loyal to him would inflict on the boy were unimaginable. No, he would protect Harry. Blood wards, strength unparalleled, supported with his mothers blood protection. Thus he left Harry with the Dursley's, ignoring McGonagall's warnings, for after 50 years of war and all the atrocities he had seen, family stuck together always. He may not be loved, but he would never be harmed.

He looks upon Sirius Black in disgust as Black laughs, with the voice of Pettigrew still ringing in his ears shouting that Black had betrayed the Potters. How could a man who shared such a bond with James betray him in such a way. He looks at the two and sees himself and Grindelwald, one betrayed by the other in the name of the 'greater good'. He sends him to Azkaban.

He sees Severus without purpose, just as he was after the defeat of Grindelwald, for with the knowledge that their love is dead, how are they meant to continue? He takes the potions prodigy under his wing and offers him the same chance given to him all those years ago, the chance to teach.

--------------

As canon starts, you have an old man who has been the hope and light of a nation for 50 years. They rely on him and trust him because he has lead them out of darkest times in recent history. He has made mistakes, he is not perfect, yet when all is said and done, they are all still there and the one responsible for that is Dumbledore.

Frankly I don't view canon as a good representation of how a well written Dumbledore would act. As has been mentioned here already, due to the nature of the books Dumbledore had to be written poorly. If he solved the problems for the protagonist then there's not much point in the story at all. This matched with the tone of the first few books, a happy children's adventure novel, resulted in the wacky security of the philosophers stone, and Harry dealing with the Basilisk in Book 2. If they'd turned up for breakfast one day and Dumbledore had said 'DLME sorted it yesterday', that's not much of a book is it? This problem is rampant throughout the entire series and really butchers Dumbledore as a character.

I hope this gives you some idea as to why I view Dumbledore as they hero he is. Frankly your answer read a lot like a Lord!Potter fanfiction and I think you need to realise he's not a god, in his own words "I am just a man."

*** Dumbledore's style of warfare/politics can be summarized with the term appeasement. The concept itself was proved ineffective many times, with Hitler and Chamberlain the most known example. Instead of holding some Nürnberg style trials and simply sentencing the Death Eaters to hanging for their High Treason, something most if not all members committed, he watches without action while the government, which he can easily influence while being the highest justice lets murderers get away for a small donation.

Dumbledore not purging the Death Eaters in 1981 is the sole reason Voldemort could successfully return in 95. He had the legal framework to do so. A few drops of Veritasserum would have them confessing their crimes. He is supposedly the greatest wizard alive. He wields magic only matched by Voldemort. He could have done the cleanup alone. But he choses to condemn a child to ten dark years and watch as Malfoy and his friends bribe their way to freedom.

You're acting like he was a god that could not be defied, the people he was fighting merely had to touch their mark and Voldemort would arrive leveraging the fight. How was he meant to "round them up"? How would he even know where to find them all in the first place? You also then want him to be a tyrant and break the laws he fought to protect, just because he thought he was right?

*** A ton of justification, but still no reason to worship Dumbledore (even discounting what he did to Harry and the evil conspiracy stuff, there's still enough there to crucify him! Especially his preaching of forgiveness for murderers and terrorists! He should have advocated giving each deatheater the dementor's kiss, but what happens? They get the fuck off and Dumbledore doesn't open his mouth to protest (or: If that doesn't help, then he should have either hired somebody to kill them or done it himself! He knows that Voldemort isn't dead and depriving him of his powerbase is a logical thing to do!))

As for Snape? Nobody, and I mean that, can justify keeping Severus Snape as a teacher - keeping him out of Azkaban? Sure! Giving him employment? Sure! But having him teach? NO WAY IN HELL! (even more so after Harry arrives - I am sure Dumbledore's passive legilimency picked up on how Snape treated him...hell, I am sure there were tons of complaints about the grease ball!)

ps: If his own justification is "I am just a man" - then: STEP THE FUCK DOWN, turn your power over to people who will actually use it and get back to traveling/research (or become a full-time headmaster that still teaches the 6th and 7th years for example!) but don't be a fucking obstacle in the way of fighting the DE's with your own hatred of dark magic (hypocrite, after all: Grindelwald and he himself probably used said magic, too!) and your forgiveness even for the worst crimes (justice has to happen - a society can never heal and take a step forward if the guilty get off and stop any progress with money and threats!)...

As for the order: If that's a fighting force then I'd rather take the local kindergarden as my fighting force (children will at least use lethal means if they don't see another choice!)

** There are a few answers to this, some meta, some in universe:

1. The story has children as the protagonists. If the story is to work, the children must have the opportunity to be spotlighted, which means the adults must not be able to succeed by themselves.

2. This is a fairy tale about the changing of ages. The king f the last age is waning in power, evil is raising ts head and the new hero I'd discovered. Dumbledore was the hero, but time has ravaged him and now he is a failing symbol, ready to be replaced

3. Dumbledore has so many jobs because everyone expects the best of him. He expects the best of himself and doesn't turn down these jobs, and as a side effect he overlooks things.

4. Dumbledore isn't good at his jobs, and he knows ot. He also knows he is the only thing standing between Lucius Malfoy and his crimes taking over because of the power of his name. He tries his best, males mistakes and uses the power of his reputation to make it look like he knows what he is doing because if people lose confidence on him that is the end of the world.

I'm not being ridiculous, but I understand why you would be suspicious... because I could just make shit up, because I'd want to win the argument. I've had this discussion before (unrelated to hp-fanfiction). My favourite example is that I wouldn't even be sure that removing Hitler from history would actually improve things... and that seems such an obvious simple answer, because he caused so many terrible things. Yet, I probably wouldn't risk to do it (if I didn't get to take a peek at the results)... there's the serious possibility that World War II would have happened 10 or 20 years later (the world wasn't very stable) and would have been an extinction level thermo-nuclear war. We'd be fucked. Star Trek Voyager was a really shitty show, but it had an interesting [[http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Year_of_Hell,_Part_II_(episode)][episode]] around that topic of messing with history and what-if scenarios.

Sure, but you're working under the assumption that he's already evil.

That's besides the point. I'm not arguing about Ron. He's the cause of her being there, it's completely irrelevant whether it was right or wrong. I'm trying to point out that "Well obviously if it weren't for Ron, Hermione would have died in the troll incident" is a very superficial and completely flawed argument, same as saying "Well obviously if it weren't for Dumbledore...". It's just that we have more information on the situation involving the trio to make guess on what could have happened than with Dumbledore.

If the Ron example disturbs you, I can find something with Dumbledore: "Oh isn't Dumbledore awesome, he rescued Harry from the traitor Sirius Black and made sure that Harry was save" ... Sure, but if it weren't for Dumbledore the Potters wouldn't have been targeted by Voldemort in the first place because he would have never heard the prophecy. These things aren't simple.

It's not about the one scene. He was in close contact with Riddle for seven years. If it is true that he was horrified by that evil cruel boy from the moment that he met him that might have contributed to alienating the kid and making him go dark. Maybe he was a natural psychopath or maybe he just needed someone to help him. Either way, even if Dumbledore couldn't have prevented him from becoming a crazy killer, he maybe could have stopped him more easily if he fostered some relationship with the boy: "Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer". Again, who knows right? I have a hard time imagining a Voldemort that is more cruel and more insane than in canon, so Dumbledore probably did the worst out of all possible outcomes.

Yes, which is why what-if scenarios and "Surely, things would have been worse if it weren't for Dumbledore" are stupid.

You'll have to make some kind of effort to convince me why things would have been worse without Dumbledore... and not just by taking an eraser, removing the word Dumbledore while everything else stays the same, because that ignores causality.

** Although your analysis of Dumbledore's life is /very/ considered, I would happily agree that you're arguing from a prosecution-slanted position. As many have already said about his relationship with Grindelwald, I think it unfair to judge him so harshly - look at the rise of titans like Stalin, Mao, Lenin, Hitler, Caesar, Napoleon or any number of charismatic, outwardly-idealistic leaders and how not just one person, but /entire populations/ became enamored with extremist ideologies and in some cases condoned and even cooperated in atrocities against their fellow man.

To Dumbledore, a young, powerful and - even as he admits it himself - resentful wizard, who is shackled with the responsibility of caring indefinitely for his sister, his plans to travel and enjoy magic put suddenly on hold, the arrival of a kindred spirit in Grindelwald to the quiet village of Godric's Hollow would become to him more than just a friendship (I'm not even sure if he's confirmed to have loved Grindelwald romantically, or if they were simply very close friends), it would be an /escape/.

It was only after Grindelwald initiated the duel with him and Aberforth (at least I think Grindelwald started it) that Dumbledore is 'snapped out of it', but it is too little, too late, and Ariana lies dead, what's left of his family broken beyond repair. It's at this point that he realises how far he'd changed, how close to truly evil he'd become when infatuated with the ideal of /The Greater Good/. His guilt at her death, and whether he himself had actually fired the curse that killed her, leaves him seeing firsthand the damage he can cause with his power if he is anything less than /good/, in the noblest, yet cruelest sense.

Cue years of study and teaching, his eventual defeat of Grindelwald, and the somewhat quiet retirement to teaching at Hogwarts and doing research, throwing himself into his academic lifestyle to avoid being tempted by power, which he believes he is unfit for.

Here is where you're too callous - suggesting he could be a "pansy". The thing you have to try to understand is that Dumbledore now understands just how flawed he himself is, and that he can't trust /himself/ with the power to make those kinds of decisions, even if he'd be the best man for the job, because he /is/ the person whose good intentions would pave the road to Hell. With him as Minister alone, even disregarding his other posts, he would have near-total power, and the worst part is that many would be loyal to him, and trust his judgement - on matters so pivotal to the direction of an /entire society/, Dumbledore doesn't trust his own judgement.

It's a difficult thing to reconcile, as most people will go their entire lives without realising their own potential for evil, and Dumbledore is in the unenviable position of knowing /exactly/ how easily he could fall, without even seeing the one moment or decision that would tip him over the edge.

Something that really sums up Dumbledore's nature to me is a quote (from the Half-Blood Prince movie):

#+begin_quote
  “Did you know, sir --- then?” “Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time? No. If I had, I..."
#+end_quote

The way that he trails off implies that with hindsight, he might've actually killed Riddle for the Greater Good of the wizarding world.

His commitment to being a better man than he was is - in my opinion - what makes him so forgiving of so many, and why he doesn't kill, nor ask the Order, /his friends/, to become killers for him. Could anyone make that kind of request of someone, even for what might be the right reasons? His unwillingness to do it himself, and spare his followers that responsibility is why he would also never ask them to do it in his stead.

As for his decisions about Harry, the issue is more complicated. Harry as a human being - his feelings, his childhood, etcetera - undoubtedly suffer from Dumbledore's decisions to place him with the Dursleys. However, as much as Dumbledore hates the decision he is making - he even admits condemning Harry to ten 'dark and difficult years', which the indy!Harry crowd love to use as ammo to show how little he cared for Harry's wellbeing - he is making the decision to shelter and protect Harry so that he can die at the proper moment. That is the true horror of having to do /what is right, not what is easy/.

Harry's survival from Voldemort's curse could easily be an unpredictable circumstance, maybe something Dumbledore was banking on happening so that he wouldn't have just sent a child to die for the Greater Good, but there's no way of saying he knew for sure. Even so, Harry's sacrifice /ensured/ Voldemort's defeat, and was, unequivocally, the /right/ decision.

I won't get into the politics and trials and whatever that you're bringing up to do with the book timelines, because, unfortunately, there's little that I can say that would be concrete enough to help. Perhaps Dumbledore could have done more, and he undoubtedly looks worse because of the overall tone and content of the early books (like the traps of the Stone being able to be defeated by three plucky eleven-year-olds, whereas in reality the Stone would /obviously/ not be protected in such a way for the main character to just get it and save the day).

I think a good quote from Dumbledore helps round off a lot of what you're missing from your very pointed analysis of his life and choices - and although it is almost certainly a platitude, it might not make it any less true.

I completely disagree with your philosophical position here. To me that is highly unethical and borderline evil (which is why I didn't want to get into it). Army commanders can send their recruits into death, they know what they signed up for. Dumbledore is not god. He has no right to make these kinds of decisions about Harry or anyone else that hasn't consented to it. It is deplorable and despicable. I purposely didn't want to get into it, because that stuff makes my blood boil and I'd hate Dumbledore for it even if all his accolades were deserved. Can we just drop it here?

It's not going to go anywhere without a major philosophical debate about Utilitarianism and why it doesn't work as an a-priori decision making process, because you will never know that the 'bad thing' that you need to do to achieve 'good thing that outweighs bad thing', will actually be successful in achieving 'good thing' (especially when we are talking about timespans of years. It's ludicrous to make predictions about the results... at least when I decide to hit an intruder with a baseball bat - 'bad thing' - I can make a reasonable predicition about the results: 'unconsciousness'). Sure, we have hindsight (as a post-hoc measuring tool Utilitarianism is fine to me) and the power of the author can make anything happen, but Dumbledore has no-idea whether putting Harry in that abusive household is necessary or even 'fit for purpose' towards his goals. He's just making an educated guess and there's like a billion scenarios where he gave an *innocent* child 'ten dark and difficult years' for no good reason at all. Which is why I'm a strong believer in virtue ethics (the classical greek one, not the christian crap). Someone who leaves an innocent child with abusive bigots is a shitty person. Ergo you shouldn't do that.

Sorry, now I got a little bit into it anyways. Cut!

Edit: Now that I think about it Dumbledore is a perfect example for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect][Dunning-Kruger Effect]]... like... textbook. He still believes that he was totally clever and hatched a brilliant plan in Half-Blood Prince (where the quote is from)... that's like... I have no words.

**** I apologise for being reductionist - it was rather cheap of me, sorry.

Even so, Dumbledore's reasons for not taking the reins over Britain are completely satisfactory to me and fit with what the readers learn about his character.

Although I completely understand where you're coming from, and it is absolutely your right to disagree with me on a philosophical level - you're right, we can't really elaborate on that without turning it into a mammoth debate on the merits and pitfalls of utilitarianism.

As for leaving Harry with the Dursleys, the issue with our position as readers is that Dumbledore's reasoning is poorly explained - he states that it's for Harry's protection, but we never actually /see/ any "protecting" take place at Number 4, and although I will lean on my own headcanon that Voldemort was physically unable to attack Harry whilst he was staying there due to the Blood Protection, and that he, either himself or via proxy, tried it at least once.

Of course, as there's no actual evidence of any such events taking place, we effectively have to take Dumbledore's word for it, and I completely understand that that isn't /really/ good enough. I like to assume that it was necessary for Harry's continued existence, as otherwise I'm left in the moral quandary of trying to explain an /extremely/ poor decision about Harry's life.

I suppose I can't easily argue against the last point - Dumbledore is, to a fault, /never/ completely honest with anyone, be that with things like information or plans, or simply baring his emotions or thoughts, or even being honest with himself. For instance, when Harry tells him that Scrimgeour called him "Dumbledore's man through-and-through", and he said that he was, Dumbledore's response is to tear up and say that he's touched, making Harry uncomfortable, rather than explain even a /little/ why he feels unworthy of Harry's loyalty. His guilt at his mistakes seems to manifest in an almost Atlas-worthy level of personal burden-bearing, rather than less-removed (like expressing a genuine apology and explanation to Harry) methods of absolution.

On another note, it's discussions like this about Dumbledore's complexity, and the valid range of angles those discussions can be conducted from that make him one of the most interesting (and one of my favourite) characters in the series!

My head-canon is that the Blood Wards work as some kind of soft Fidelius. Like it's really hard for anyone to figure out the Address of Harry Potter without being told directly by someone else. Like if you for some reason just can't remember a certain phone number properly.

Because something like that is totally necessary or the whole ordeal would be pointless. A Death Eater could just wait for Harry at his school and kill him no matter how strong the protections around his stupid house are.

I can sort of understand that. He's certainly interesting. For me the most interesting character is probably Snape (and I dislike him too). I sort of understand him. He makes sense to me. I totally get why he is the way he is... and his personal tragedy is much more appealing to me than Dumbledore's, maybe because the books don't try to paint him as this perfect being. He's not my favourite character - at least in regards to Fanfiction - because 99% of Snape fanfics are pure garbage and fantasy about some OC character who's really grumpy but lovable and sweet (or the opposite, ruthlessly evil).

**** It feels like everyone is incompetent in the wizarding world, though - heroes, villains, teachers, Aurors, you name it. You have to grant a bit of that or you'll go mad with all the lost opportunities there are in the series (that fanfic authors like to bring up constantly).

I like to think that exposure to magic makes people a little crazy. Dumbledore seems relatively sane and competent when you realize who you can compare him to. Fudge? The Aurors who let moody be kidnapped for a year? Voldemort?

Besides, it's easy for us to think that the world revolves around Harry, but Dumbledore has many problems to deal with - from budgets and meetings to potentially dealing with other dark lords that aren't mentioned in the books.

In the end, he seems like a fallible but good person whose biggest fault is always seeing the good in others.

Sorry to be so contrarian, but that is probably the *least* of the problems I have with the guy. I'm pretty forgiving and strongly believe in the merits of rehabilitation, second chances and allowing people to redeem themselves. Dumbledore just goes about it in an odd/wrong way. He doesn't understand "Trust, but verify". But that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Anyway, I despise fics where Harry berates Dumbledore for trying to help people, then proceeds to ruthlessly murder everyone who steps over the line and creates some fucked up punitive society like medieval times. But for some reason that doesn't result in the dystopian nightmare that it should be, but is a perfect little world (because hacking peoples limbs off stops all theft, right?). Yeah sorry Harry, human history and the french revolution in particular would like a word.

This man was an ok teacher, but a terrible military and political leader who deserved the same treatment as Neville Chamberlain in history. (Neville's failures weren't nearly as bad as his, but Dumbledore died in the line of duty, so I call it a wash)

On the other hand, Dumbledore was obviously a plot device in a children's fairy tale book. He had to suck in order for kids to play heroes. Plots were never the strength of the Series, especially in the last 3 Books.

Yeah I'm not going to disagree. But where does this leave us as critical thinking adults? He's not supposed to be incompetent so I'm just going to cherry pick the good bits or make flimsy excuses for everything that went wrong? I hate that...

It's like nails on a chalkboard to me that everyone is impressed by a guy who in an objective view doesn't seem to get anything right.

Of course that's a great starting point for the child-heroes to come in and go "Yeah no, let's actually do something for once", but it's really weird, especially in Fanfics with the benefit of hindsight that everyone still turns to this guy for advice.

The main conflict of this story is about a war against barbaric and genocidal terrorists, and yet the author didn't bother much with war strategies and tactics. The hero basically stumbled on to victory due to an insane amount of luck and several deux ex machina. It was pretty much fairy tale or Hollywood style, or whatever you want to call it. And she was very successful with that formula.

** This whole thing is rather besides the point. The entire canon series is severely constrained by its beginnings as a simple children's book, and Rowling's failures in world building. Don't get me wrong- she definitely can write, and she painted a vivid (if detail-vague) picture. It's a shame that the picture she painted is largely nonsensical and full of holes when looked at on any level.

So the question isn't really what makes Dumbledore great, but rather what did Rowling think constituted as "great"? What was she trying to communicate?

There are many archetypes and common literary themes, but Rowling was big on redemption, the idea of the penitent, often suffering sinner. You see this with almost every major, central character; in Ron's repeated betrayal of Harry, in Dumbledore's many actions and his regret of them, Severus Snape's story, and the other minor character.

These are all sinners looking for redemption, and at the end, you can see them be "saved", both figuratively and literally, by Harry Jesus Potter. Dumbledore did the same thing, in a way.

This isn't a religiously motivated comment in the least- I'm agnostic- but it would be foolish to ignore Rowling's motivations, inspirations, and the patterns that appear in her writing as a result.

So what makes Dumbledore that great? In reality, the answer is either nothing at all or everything, because Dumbledore and the rest of the cast represent the everyday, real-life person and their struggles to do what they think is right whilst living with the consequences of their choices.

I also agree with [[/u/judge_knox][u/judge_knox]] and his comment- what he lays out is also a continuation of this same theme.

Just as a side-note. I don't hate Harry Potter... and I don't hate JKRs writing. I absolutely adore her vision, the world-building and the character archetypes (like really, Dumbledore is such a uniquely designed character, with all the whimsical elements and weirdness, it was a really new way presenting the wise old mentor)... it's just her execution that is so... frustrating sometimes.

Why is his choice not to become Minister invalid? Why does he owe the entire magical world, and by not becoming Minister he's taking responsibility for all of these terrible things happening?

Yeah I noticed that possible inconsistency as well. I'm unsure how to phrase it correctly. The Dumbledore as we are supposed to see him, the great leader, the one who wants to do what is right, not what is easy, that one should have wanted to be minister. That one must be minister. But that's not who he is. He prefers to do what is easy, because being Miniser would be too damn difficult for him. And that Dumbledore, the incompetent one, yeah, that one probably shouldn't be Minister anyway (still better than Fudge though). That Dumbledore should have resigned from all his positions after the defeat of Voldemort and go be a farmer or something. He's clearly not cut out for the job and perpetually unhappy ("I must condemn a child to ten dark and difficult years" - no Dumbledore, no, you actually don't have to do that, it's all in your head).

So he wasn't actually fit to be Minister, which is what he was saying all along. I don't think there's anything in the text where he says being Minister was too difficult.

I get what you're saying with the quote haha. I just don't think that he was just sitting around doing nothing or the "easy thing" while he was headmaster. He didn't think he'd be a good fit for Minister. The power may have been tempting, but he took a step back, looked at his abilities and limits, and said that he couldn't accept the job. For him, that was the truly difficult thing for him to do. As a teenager he was arrogant and wanted power. As he grew up, he realized he would be unfit for the job.

I don't remember which book it was in, but the wikia says this:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore becomes enamoured with a nascent Dark Lord (Grindelwald), apparently seeing nothing but a lovable sweet guy with amazing philosophy, except when it resulted in the violent death of his sister Arianna (1899). His own brother Aberforth (deservedly) shuns him from that point onwards.
#+end_quote

Young Dumbledore who had just left Hogwarts. He himself admitted to his naivety, and Grindelwald himself was known to be a master of deception. The idea that Grindelwald revealed everything to Dumbledore is a completely fanon one.

#+begin_quote
  Personally recruits another nascent Dark Lord (Tom Riddle) from an orphanage. Of course - according to his own words (!) - he was suspicious about the guy from the beginning, yet (surprisingly) is completely unable to prevent Riddle from delving deeply in the dark arts, opening the Chamber of Secrets petrifying multiple students and murdering muggle-born student Myrtle. Did Dumbledore warn his colleagues, like Slughorn, about his suspicions on Riddle? Maybe make some kind of case against the student? Present actionable evidence? I mean, this isn't just silly schoolyard bullying, he suspects the dude of being a stone-cold killer, right? I've seen teachers who do more against illegal snowball fights than Dumbledore seems to do about a deranged murderer.
#+end_quote

Riddle was notoriously good at covering up his tracks, likely enough so that no one would notice him leaving the common room to open Slytherin's chamber. Any case made against him, he had an alibi, and Dumbledore himself was still just a teacher. He had no power in Hogwarts or politically at the time, so there was no real reason to trust his word even if he did share his suspicions.

The Hagrid point is a fair one, but that seemed to be a politically motivated move by the headmaster of the time, more than it was Hagrid actually being suspected. What evidence did he have that Hagrid didn't do it after he was caught with a beast in the school that he wasn't supposed to have?

#+begin_quote
  Maybe a bit more suspicious about Sirius supposedly betraying his almost-brother?
#+end_quote

I mean, wasn't Pettigrew like a brother to James as well? Apparently they all suspected Remus too. The war was a time of great uncertanty, and Sirius' family line didn't help his case.

#+begin_quote
  After - presumably - lots of moaning and griping about his terrible burdens, Dumbledore finally takes responsibility and defeats Grindelwald in a duel in 1945.
#+end_quote

A responsibility that was never his. He was a Transfiguration Professor from a school in Britain, he had no background in professional duelling, and to the public, likely no background with Grindelwald. There's also the fact that Albus could have been unsure of himself too, confidence for him must have been hard to come by after the supposed prodigy allowed his sister to die before his eyes, powerless.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore turns down offers for Minister of Magic multiple times... it's not like magical Britain is in desperate need of competent governance or anything.

#+end_quote

What did he have to tell about Voldemort? By then, Voldemort had already delved far away from his Hogwarts education. The point of giving him an identity is moot if it doesn't reveal anything else.

#+begin_quote

You mean, you think it's a whole movement? Muggleborns are treated incredibly well in wizarding society, to the point where a first-generation muggleborn can become fucking minister for magic, the highest position. If anything, there should have been more limitations on what muggleborns could do.

#+begin_quote
  Innocent guy is sent to prison without a trial
#+end_quote

As I already covered this, I don't feel the need to. But I would like to ask you, do you think everyone in magical Britain will hear, 'Fidelius Charm' and be like, "Okay, wow, cool"? The people in magical Britain view anything they don't understand as Dark, a spell that not even Voldemort knew, Dumbledore cast, and several people allowed, would only send more people to Azkaban and keep Sirius there. In the Harry Potter World there are probably several hundreds of mind-control spells or techniques, the thing about the imperius curse, is that it can let you cast unforgiveable curses. Meaning that it can actively change your emotional state, change your mental patterns, and change your very ideas of right and wrong. Top that off with the fact that these curses have ever-lasting effects (Longbottoms being insane forever etc...) you can't gauge very well what the truth may or may not be for them.

#+begin_quote
  Oh, also Dumbledore gives a hateful person, who has no interest in teaching, a potions job at Hogwarts, ruining potions education for a generation to come... out of pity or something.

I'm not 'blaming' Dumbledore for not fighting/confronting Grindelwald, but since he has a very unique relationship and maybe the unique ability to stop the guy from killing millions there's certainly a strong moral impetus for him to do something about it. Him taking his sweet old time just reflects sorta poorly on him. Not that I would condemn him for it. Nuances!

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort, most accomplished Legillimens in Britain, would be able to see those seeds and stamp them out one way or another.

How?! Do you mean he would change their minds through Legilimency? Is that possible?

I guess he could figure out what it would take to convince them to give their loyalties to a half-blood, but he would have to change his entire political platform to make it work. At the very least that would have helped muggleborns in the future. I mean Tommys Dad wasn't even a Wizard. He was a muggle. Snobs like Narcissa would be horrified, that's like beastiality to them.

#+end_quote

Again with the Legilimency. I'm not playing dumb here, I have no idea what you're getting at. How would that stop them from mutinying if he fucks up? Not to mention that you are shifting Dumbledore towards the evil category again if he casually invades the minds of his friends in order to keep them in line. That's pretty despicable and Dark Lord territory. You're not making a good case for liking the guy.

#+begin_quote
  And the fact that Dumbledore is trusted by every single person in that group.

Obliviation comes a bit closer, but even that is much more evil than the Fidelius (I find it slightly disturbing how everyone says the Imperius is so evil, but goes around obliviating people all the time... you know? Manipulating their free will and emotional state and all that jazz)

Just one more thing. I don't buy into that idea that you have to have 'evil' thoughts in order to cast the unforgivable (I'm sure strong will and intent towards what you want to achieve is helpful, you'll have a hard time casting crucio on someone you don't want to torture). This is totally my head-canon but I think that's just government and light-side propaganda to make them less appealing. That someone as crazy and evil like Bellatrix would buy into that is hardly surprising. Anyway, students at Hogwarts practice basic spells like Wingardium Leviosa for hours before they get it right, but for some reason someone is supposed to successfully cast a Cruciatus Curse on their first attempt? Yeah, that' just dumb. You just need to practice. Okay, had to get that off my chest, sorry for the tangent..

That seems like a silly point to make. A cutting curse on your earlobe can have ever-lasting effects. So can an obliviation or a levitation charm if it dumps a club on your head. Depending on the amount of brain damage you could be even worse off than the Longbottoms.

Permanently? Relevant quote from Wikia:

  When a correctly cast Imperius curse is terminated --- for whatever reason --- the victims become themselves again

That's my take on it as well.

#+begin_quote
  Wasn't it Craab that cast Fiendfyre on his first try? I think the point of dark magic, is that it comes easier than any other magic. Kind of like what Yoda said.
#+end_quote

Magic is not the Force. I hate those comparisons. I think Fiendfyre is actually the exception to the rule... I like to think of it like Napalm in spell-form. It "wants" to ignite. The question in skill-level in regards to Fiendfyre isn't whether you can cast it (anyone can, because it's so volatile), but whether you can control the fire.

#+end_quote

Literal quote from the book:

"I'm afraid he [Voldemort] had powers that I will never have." "Only because you're too...noble to use them."

This implies that Dumbledore didn't use Legillimency every second of every day, maybe he didn't use it at all back then. Or maybe Pettigrew expertly avoided eye-contact whenever in the presence of Dumbledore? Dumbledore can read people well without Legillimency, but seeing as Pettigrew's demeanour almost never changes, it would have been hard to tell if he was just skittish or was hiding something. If someone he trusted was suddenly acting cold to him, or being completely radically different (the sign of mutiny) he would have likely 'pressed on' with Legillimency.

**** I'd argue about the muggleborn Minister of Magic bit(first-generation muggleborn) The first Muggleborn Minister of Magic was Hermione Granger. She got it after the war, when because of Pureblood Movement(Death Eaters) they had to appease Non-Purebloods. That and she was Friend/Ally with Harry Potter, the man who, let's face it, single-handedly ended Voldemort's second rise.

***** Yeah no, that's actually correct:

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Nobby_Leach]]

It's from Pottermore though. There really needs to be a proper distinction between Book-canon and Expanded Universe.

Because... I really don't like a lot of the Pottermore stuff (the ideas sadly invade more and more of Fanfiction) and in this case of a Muggleborn Minister I don't really buy it. It doesn't mesh at all with the conservative government shown in the books. I don't really like the Hermione Granger as Minister bit either. I totally adore the girl, but it's a bit too sappy for my tastes. Not to mention that the job doesn't seem to be very prestigious considering its history. "Yeah congrats, you get to do the job that we usually give to utter imbeciles" ... "how about" no? Thanks, but no?". She'd be superb as a Lucius Malfoy, making all the important decisions in the background and dealing with the important shit, not as a public figure (she'd absolutely hate it after a week, Hermione is the kind of person who'd lock herself into the library for a week in order to figure something out if it is important, not someone who hops from obligation to obligation, giving press-conferences)

Oh, i love rants.

I'm totally on board with ignoring Book 7, but I also ignore Book 6. You're right, DH has the most plot-holes and insane wand-lore and stupid contrivances and pointless Horcrux-wearing and camping and deluminators and open-at-the-close and Ron abandoning his best friends and... but Book 6 was just such a let-down. Post-OoTP Fanfics will probably always be my favorite, because there's so much potential for a thematic shift, maybe redeeming Dumbledore or going literally *anywhere* with the story. Instead we got Hermione being mad about Harry learning stuff from a book for some insane reason ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H07zYvkNYL8][wtf JKR?!]] Was this written by a ghostwriter who doesn't know these characters?), Hermione being stupidly jealous about Ron snogging Lavender, Harry being a moody prat totally falling in love with Ginny out of the blue, Hermione for some insane reason thinking that Harry is paranoid about Malfoy (a guy that she should hate at least as much as he does), not even giving him the benefit of the doubt, Harry being all submissive with Dumbledore again instead of a true shift in the relationship (yeah right, we totally need to stretch out a few hours of Pensieve sessions over a whole year Alby, that's not totally stupid or anything).

Book 7 probably has the bigger quantity of things that are wrong, but Book 6 twists some of my favourite parts into some kind of mirror universe freak-show. It makes me a little mad still... and I actually liked the overall plot of Book 6 (like as an outline, the finale with Snape 'killing' Dumbledore is fantastic).

Basically I do agree with what you said, but I always found HP universe lacking character development.

- Harry - Typical Hero who sacrifices himself for others because plot demands so. Sometimes changes character if plot deems it necessary.
- Ron - Jealous prat who is good at chess. Lazy and Stupid(but is somehow very good at chess?) Serves to make Hermione and Harry look better.
- Hermione - Book worm with authority fetish. She seems like the most realistic person in HP universe. Also a Know-It-All. Kinda dislike her, but not so much.
- Dumbledore - Cliche

I am not saying it's bad. I am only pointing out that they have one, two defined purposes for existence. It's either that or I am starting to see world in Black, Black and Black.

Hermione issue in book 6. She was used to being Best and Useful. She made her first friends being useful. (Homework(after troll)). That and she hates cheating, and Harry, well he was cheating.

I do agree that Book 6 was a let down, while Book 7 was shit.

- He should have been able to persuade a court full of people who wanted to see someone punished today instead of seeing justice in a few months, before he had any clout.
- He should have personally taken out Grindelwald for having dated him forty years prior, which he did, but he shouldn't have waited so long, because the text doesn't explicitly say that he worked as quickly as possible to take him down.
- He should have been an intelligence field agent dedicating years (1945 to 1970, roughly) to tracking down Tom Riddle.
- He should have been ready and able to subdue Tom Riddle the moment he did anything against the law (if not beforehand).
- He should have been an adept general.
- He should have been an adept counterintelligence agent.
- He should have been a more adept security specialist.
- He should have been a better politician than he was -- because the text doesn't explicitly say much about the post-war political climate, you assume that the radicalized non-Death Eaters were suddenly powerless.

**** You're seeing Dumbledore posed as the best that the UK has to offer. You compare him to the Muggle UK's generals and politicians and so forth, and find him lacking on many fronts. But Magical Britain is not a country of millions. By all appearances, it's a town of /maybe/ five thousand people, plus half again as many spread out across the island.

I grew up in a town that size. We wouldn't have had /any/ security specialists to hire. No generals. No adept counterintelligence people. No training programs for any of that.

Relative to that population, Dumbledore could easily have been the second-best general (after Voldemort), in the top three for counterintelligence and security (along with Alastor Moody and possibly Voldemort), the best politician in his faction -- and still be worse at all of this than a second lieutenant in the British Army, a new hire at MI5, and an MPA student.

You want Dumbledore to be significantly better than each of these people without any training.

As for "banana republic" -- Dumbledore managed to get one person exonerated and got one other person a commuted sentence. Bartemius Crouch Sr managed to get one trial, for his own son, though it was open and shut. Money exonerated a dozen people who were obviously guilty. Fudge saw someone accused of being Barty Crouch and executed them on the spot. In Magical Britain, justice only exists at the whim of the Minister.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore becomes enamoured with a nascent Dark Lord (Grindelwald), apparently seeing nothing but a lovable sweet guy with amazing philosophy, except when it resulted in the violent death of his sister Arianna (1899). His own brother Aberforth (deservedly) shuns him from that point onwards.
#+end_quote

1. Dumbledore falling in love is hardly a negative thing. I, myself, have fallen in love with people who later turned out to not be that great. The human mind is very easily capitulated when confronted with emotion, even among the most rational of us.
2. To be fair, Dumbledore was trying to defend his family, even against the man he loved. It certainly ends tragically, and you could definitely lay a certain amount of blame on Dumbledore for it, but he did the right thing in the end.

#+begin_quote
  Personally recruits another nascent Dark Lord (Tom Riddle) from an orphanage.
#+end_quote

1. I'm... really not sure how you could come to the conclusion that this is somehow Dumbledore's fault. It was his /job/ to retrieve Tom Riddle, and he performed it. I'd be more disturbed if Dumbledore hamstringed an 11-year-old child because he exhibited negative traits after being raised in an unfit environment.

#+begin_quote
  he was suspicious about the guy from the beginning, yet (surprisingly) is completely unable to prevent Riddle from delving deeply in the dark arts
#+end_quote

1. I'm also not sure why you believe this to be Dumbledore's fault. He wasn't the headmaster at the time, nor was he Riddle's Head of House. He may have been suspicious of him, but you don't see McGonagall going out of her way to steer Draco Malfoy away from the Dark Arts, do you?

#+begin_quote

1. In a school full of self-proclaimed /Dark/ families in the midst of a Blood War (Grindelwald), I think Dumbledore would have had to have made some insane leaps of logic to accurately pinpoint that whole debacle on Tom Riddle who, so far as he knew, was a Muggleborn, let alone descended from Slytherin himself.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, this isn't just silly schoolyard bullying, he suspects the dude of being a stone-cold killer, right?
#+end_quote

1. No? Again, that'd have taken Dumbledore a huge, insane leap of logic to go from "this kid stole things from bullies and, perhaps, bullied children himself" to "yeah, he totally murders people".

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was also unable to exonerate Hagrid, even though it seems trivial in hindsight
#+end_quote

1. The Ministry has never been particularly adept at doing anything other than "appearing to be doing something". Dumbledore, who hadn't gotten his fame for defeating Grindelwald yet, wouldn't have had the political clout to demand a fair trial. Hell, even during his prime it seemed like he couldn't do much when the Ministry decided it was done with something. That says something about the corruption of the government, sure, but I'm not sure why you think pre-fame Dumbledore should have been able to do anything.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

1. In a school full of /Dark/ families, you're again assuming Dumbledore has any reason to suspect Tom Riddle. Or even a student at all.

Aside: I will say that it always annoyed me that Dumbledore, when all the dust settled, didn't act on his suspicions to get Hagrid cleared (during the height of the war against Voldemort, a lot of good could have come from outing him as Tom Riddle, but I'll cover that later).

#+begin_quote
  After - presumably - lots of moaning and griping about his terrible burdens, Dumbledore finally takes responsibility and defeats Grindelwald in a duel in 1945.
#+end_quote

1. Dumbledore was just a school teacher at the time. He admits that he was, perhaps, fearful of confronting Grindelwald. However, I fail to see why anyone should have expected it to be Dumbledore's responsibility any more than it was /Harry's/ responsibility to defeat Voldemort. Necessary, maybe. But there was no reason for Dumbledore to think that /he personally/ should have had to face against a self-proclaimed Dark Lord instead of, say, the government at the time. At least /Harry/ had a prophecy demanding his participation.

#+begin_quote
  Or maybe, just maybe, he's the kind of guy who constantly does the wrong thing for the wrong reasons (double whammy!) and he unconsciously knows it.
#+end_quote

1. I'm pretty sure that's exactly what he means. I don't think there's anything unconscious about that decision.

#+begin_quote
  Seems to me kinda like he's that guy who's responsible for everything, has his fingers in a lot of pies, but never puts his own signature on the final forms.
#+end_quote

1. I don't think you really understand what those positions entail. Ironically, Headmaster of Hogwarts is probably the most powerful of all those positions.

   1. /Chief Warlock/ pretty much just moderates the Wizengamot. He doesn't have any more power than anyone else, besides keeping /"order in the court"/.
   2. /Supreme Mugwump of the ICW/ is, similarly to Chief Warlock, pretty much just a moderator of a more significant body of governance.
   3. None of these positions come with any "extra" power. Or more "votes" in issues. They, perhaps, grant him a lot of respect and political power, but they're not, actually, individually powerful. That's why it's so simple for the Ministry to strip those positions from him.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

1. Here I'll agree with you. I'm not sure that he ever discusses it, let alone provides his motivations for not informing the general public of Voldemort's true identity. Perhaps his followers wouldn't have believed him? But even then, the reason Voldemort was so feared was because /no one knew who he was/. They only knew him by a scary name and guerrilla warfare. I, personally, believe that applying a face and background to him would have at least made him less scary.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

1. By what metric are you defining that? Voldemort was literally forced to focus on the unofficial militia. So much so that the two families who had "thrice defied him" were /in that militia/.

  Victory finally comes when Dumbledore fails to adequately protect three of his most valuable assets (the Potters).
#+end_quote

1. I'm not sure how you could possibly blame Dumbledore for this. He provided the Potters the /ultimate defense/ which, done correctly, could not have been bypassed. It was the /Potters/ who trusted the wrong person - Dumbledore wasn't even aware of the Secret Keeper.

#+begin_quote
  [You rant about how Dumbledore should have gotten Sirius a trial, Death Eaters getting out with lame excuses, etc]
#+end_quote

1. I, again, fail to see how this can be attributed to Dumbledore. He's /not the leader of Wizarding Britain/. As stated earlier, his role is purely as a moderator of the Wizengamot. I don't even think he /has/ a voting role among the governing body.
2. Outside of not getting a trial, there was some pretty solid fucking evidence against Sirius. A lot of people seem to forget that he was found surrounded by dead muggles, a seemingly obliterated Pettigrew, and was laughing his crazed fucking head off about how it was his fault the Potters were dead. I'm not saying he didn't /deserve/ a trial, but I can certainly see why a Ministry being run by Bagnold and Crouch Sr. would have shoved him away.
3. At which point is it ever described in Canon that Dumbledore has any influence over which cases the Wizengamot or the DMLE pursue?
4. We've been given several points of canon pieces which show that the Chief Warlock doesn't oversee criminal cases. Dumbledore, while present at some, never appeared to be in any leadership roles for them. So why would he even necessarily be aware that Sirius Black didn't receive a trial?

#+begin_quote
  Tell me again why this is supposed to be such a great guy and why anyone should listens to his advice?
#+end_quote

1. To be fair, a fucking load of the problems in the story revolve around the fact that people /ignored/ Dumbledore's advice. I'm not sure, specifically, when any single piece of advisory that Dumbledore gave was ever /wrong/. He may have not always made the best /choices/, but his /advice to others/ is always spot on.

#+begin_quote
  Really, what does he actually DO?! Besides defeating Grindelwald there's nothing in his win column.
#+end_quote

1. Some would say defeating Grindelwald is enough of an achievement for a life-time. Certainly more than most other wizards ever accomplish.
2. Ran the resistance against Voldemort - was losing, but he was striking home quite a bit without even the support of his own government.
3. Etc etc

  Woooooooooooooooo! First, I wanna say, thank you for this post. I disagree with a lot of your points (we'll get to that), but I love it when people open up a discussion with such well-thought-out points! :)
#+end_quote

Not that well-thought-out according to some (including you ;)

About the Dumbledore / Grindelwald thing.. yeah I already mentioned elsewhere that this was a cheap shot against Dumbledore from me. I don't really blame it for him. It still fits the pattern of a loser who fails to recognize Dark Lords for what they are. But it's really mean to point that out, I acknowledge it.

#+begin_quote
  I'm also not sure why you believe this to be Dumbledore's fault. He wasn't the headmaster at the time, nor was he Riddle's Head of House. He may have been suspicious of him, but you don't see McGonagall going out of her way to steer Draco Malfoy away from the Dark Arts, do you?
#+end_quote

Wait, are we shitting on McG now? Because I'm totally on board with that. She's terrible and totally ignores blatant bigotry and racism directly under her nose. She actually told a student to, paraphrasing here, 'suck it up' when he told her that he's being tortured by another *teacher*. What a pathetic excuse for a human being. She's a teacher and a Head of House (oh, also Deputy Head). *Yes* I expect her to steer Draco Malfoy away from the Dark Arts. How is this even supposed to be an argument in favour of Dumbles?

#+begin_quote
  No? Again, that'd have taken Dumbledore a huge, insane leap of logic to go from "this kid stole things from bullies and, perhaps, bullied children himself" to "yeah, he totally murders people".
#+end_quote

The lady at the orphanage told him outright that he was a Bully. Also that he killed the pet rabbit of another child in revenge. Typical sociopathic tendencies.

I mean, there was a death at the school. Someone must have done it. Hey how about that creepy kid? Yeah, I'd have my eye on him. Maybe investigate his ancestry. Maybe he's related to the Slytherin legacy in some way and could be the *gasp* Heir of Slytherin. Hermione would have cracked that case like yesterday. Dumbledore is supposed to be smart.

#+begin_quote
  Other than JK's ridiculous plothole of giving a 13-year-old a Time Turner, we haven't seen any other evidence that they're given out lightly.
#+end_quote

So what, it's a plot-hole and so you just ignore it and hand-wave it away?! It's a fact, they gave a time-turner to a 13 year old school-girl so that she can go to all her classes. Considering that this a reality in their world you could never convince me that Dumbledore can't get one if he needs it (or that he doesn't already have one hidden in that unkempt beard of his).

#+begin_quote
  So much so that the two families who had "thrice defied him" were in that militia.
#+end_quote

Yeah more like defied him despite being part of his useless militia.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was just a school teacher at the time. He admits that he was, perhaps, fearful of confronting Grindelwald. However, I fail to see why anyone should have expected it to be Dumbledore's responsibility any more than it was Harry's responsibility to defeat Voldemort. Necessary, maybe. But there was no reason for Dumbledore to think that he personally should have had to face against a self-proclaimed Dark Lord instead of, say, the government at the time. At least Harry had a prophecy demanding his participation.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore isn't obligated to confront Grindelwald, but he has a certain level of moral responsibility to do it since he's so uniquely suited for the task. Considering how horrible WW2 and everything at that time was it makes me really uncomfortable that he sat on his ass for 5 years and just watched the world burn.

Not sure why you bring Harry into it. He's chosen by fate. There is no choice for him that he can make. It's preordained. He doesn't get the privilege to choose. That's the whole point of his arc. But since I believe Harry to be a much better person, I'm pretty confident that he'd have confronted his former best friend at the first opportunity if he started killing people en-masse. It's apples and oranges in either case.

#+begin_quote
  I don't think you really understand what those positions entail. Ironically, Headmaster of Hogwarts is probably the most powerful of all those positions.
#+end_quote

Yeah I'm completely aware what those positions entail. Many very important state positions don't hold much formal power. The President (it's literally the highest office) of Germany (no, not Merkel) has not really any formal power. He's still the head of state. Everyone listens to him if he says something. He has power. Same goes for the Queen in Britain.

This "silly" moderator position that doesn't mean anything for example is actually the second highest rank in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Bundestag][German government]]. Yes, you heard that right, Merkel is only third.

I feel like you are trying to be only technically correct or intentionally obtuse. Dumbledore has been offered the Minister of Magic position *multiple* times. He just has to take it or ask for it if he wants to and he'll can make any decision (within reason) he wants. Saying he doesn't hold any actual power is supremely silly. The idea that Dumbledore holds less power than that silly Minister for Magic Fudge is laughable. For gods sake, even Malfoy has more power than Fudge.

#+begin_quote
  None of these positions come with any "extra" power. Or more "votes" in issues. They, perhaps, grant him a lot of respect and political power, but they're not, actually, individually powerful. That's why it's so simple for the Ministry to strip those positions from him.
#+end_quote

That's only possible after he already fucked everything up. Do you think they would have been able to strip his positions from him before 1991? Again, don't be silly. Malfoy is slowly eroding his power base and taking over. Dumbledore doesn't do anything against it, except grandiose speeches. Dumbledore loses.

#+begin_quote
  In a school full of Dark families, you're again assuming Dumbledore has any reason to suspect Tom Riddle. Or even a student at all.
#+end_quote

Okay. I've heard this multiple times now but I could swear that canon strongly implies that Dumbledore was suspicious about Riddle and didn't fall for his charm. Doesn't he at some point explicitly mention how everyone else fell for Riddles charm except him, the genius Dumbledore? Isn't he sorta derisively looking down on the stupidity of Slughorn for helping Riddle? A lot of this is subtext I guess...

Just looked it up, yeah, Dumbledore totally kept an eye on him: [[https://pastebin.com/raw/8JVd9A0d]]

Case closed. Dumbledore is an utter moron and totallly useless.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not sure how you could possibly blame Dumbledore for this. He provided the Potters the ultimate defense which, done correctly, could not have been bypassed. It was the Potters who trusted the wrong person - Dumbledore wasn't even aware of the Secret Keeper.
#+end_quote

I'm sure Pettigrew was part of the Order. Dumbledore was their general. It's his responsibility to vet members. I absolutely blame Dumbledore for not discovering the traitor. "Yo guys, everyone who joins has to swear an Unbreakable Vow not to betray the order as long as they are a member." Oh wow, what a simple and convenient way to make sure to never get stabbed in the back. Utter incompetence. Thank for bringing that up though, I totally forgot about Pettigrew.

#+begin_quote
  I, again, fail to see how this can be attributed to Dumbledore. He's not the leader of Wizarding Britain. As stated earlier, his role is purely as a moderator of the Wizengamot. I don't even think he has a voting role among the governing body.
#+end_quote

He's the de-facto leader. I'm not going to budge on this. If he demands naked dances every saturday in honor of the sacrifice of the Potters it will be done.

#+begin_quote
  Outside of not getting a trial, there was some pretty solid fucking evidence against Sirius.
#+end_quote

Do not care. Can't send people to prison without a trial and certainly not to a place that might be worse than death. Also, I think I mentioned this: Get that piece of filth in an interrogation chair, fill him up with Veritaserum and ask him about Voldemorts inner circle or anything else he might know. Even if you are 100% convinced that he's guilty, shipping him straight to Azkabhan is stupidity on multiple levels.

#+begin_quote
  At which point is it ever described in Canon that Dumbledore has any influence over which cases the Wizengamot or the DMLE pursue?
#+end_quote

"Yo guys *eye twinkle*. I really think we should pursue this case. I would take it as a personal favour my dear friends." Are you telling me they wouldn't humor him and possibly earn points or a favour in return? Really?!?!

#+begin_quote

He was the leader of the Order of the Phoenix. Sirius was a member and a former student. It's Dumbledore's business. Get your ass out of your golden throne and investigate what actually happened you lazy whiskered old wanker.

#+end_quote

"Oh hide in that cottage, under a Fidelius, it's an unbeatable defense, nothing can go wrong." Yeah look how that worked out. Since Dumbledore thinks Sirius is guilty he didn't vet him either when he was chosen as Secret Keeper, so don't tell me everything would have been fine... he could just as well have been the betrayer. Dumbledore is an incompetent leader who sends people to their deaths.

** Ok, first of all, obviously, amazing post. I mean that goes without saying...

Anyway:

_

Don't forget Dumbledore is one of the few (only?) good guys that can go toe to toe with the likes of grindelwald or voldemort. What does that require of a person? What does it take out of a person?

In a universe where *things to come down to climactic duels a lot more than you'd expect*, his foibles and weaknesses might be explainable by a past pressing need to break himself down around the arts of wizardry and fighting. He's absent minded, he doesn't pay attention to things, he doesn't think of things. Pretty bad traits in a planner, but when you step into the arena with grindelwald, how many flickering whispers of death and subtle feints do you have to ignore? How reckless and focused do you have to be?

Maybe the guy isn't a wise old wizard at all, just the same young idiot who finally woke up, signed his soul away for fighting skills (though not his conscience, or not entirely), then bumbled his broken way through the next Xty years and grew old somewhere along the way. An unworthy exarch who's path was tumbled down holding nothing back, now adorned with titles and responsibility, but still a creature built first and foremost to dance with death at its keenest edge.

-What if you're asking the fedor emelianenko of the wizarding world to be the Alfred the great? What if Dumbledore is a piece on the board trying to be a player?

_

So, I don't know why he's running a wizarding school, but going toe to toe with dark lords has to be much much much... harder than us non wizards can fathom.

Probably even much harder than any champion fighter can imagine. -When world domination is a potential prize, the pool of competitors is every wizard on the planet, and not as a hobby, not even just a vocation or a career or a /life/- In a sense, it's the chance to be a god.

That is a kind of competition we can't fathom.

Even if this is mike tyson I'm talking to right now, perhaps even you can't get it, because our world just isn't /built/ that way. The most a modern combatant can play for is fame and wealth and glory. But 'Archwizard' isn't like 'heavyweight champion', it's like 'Emperor', -except you can't even be assassinated.

_\\
_

Ok so that doesn't exonerate him from a lot of things you bought up, especially 'letting things get that bad in the first place', but it could explain why he isn't all there when it comes to other things, -maybe he literally isn't all there if he relinquished parts of himself to get as strong as the world needed him to be.

** Not only that, I have stuff to add:

Dumbledore is probably the worst headmaster of Hogwarts (even worse than Phineas Nigellus Black!)

- shoddy defense teaching...I mean GOD MAN, just abolish the position and call it Offensive and Defensive Magic as a "new" course or something...hell, rotate people through the job for all I care, but hiring Lockhart? Quirrel? Umbridge? - Hell, even Remus, Moody (Crouch!) and Snape are questionable decisions!
- ghost history teacher? Damned, exorcism and new teacher, please!
- bad potions teaching (has been mentioned, still I'll add it because this stuff is all about the school itself)
- bullying is allowed and not only by the students, the staff is allowed (and encouraged - because nothing is done against it!) to participate (Snape, Umbridge, Draco's badges, the "Heir of Slytherin" nonesense, allowing Harry to be slandered in the press etc. etc.)
- Bad/dangerous facilities (Hogwarts itself is not save IMHO...trick stairs? Doors that lead to other destinations on different days of the week etc. etc.)
- faulty/bad equipment (the school brooms which don't look particularly save!)
- Hagrid as Care of Magical Creatures teacher (that guy can't teach - he knows stuff, but creatures that he considers "tame" (he after all is stronger and tougher than a regular human!) are bloody dangerous - reminder: DRAGON and WOODEN HOUSE! Not to mention that Hagrid couldn't step in if something really went on a rampage because he never finished Hogwarts himself - hell, I doubt he can heal or temporarily patch somebody up!)
- dumping his work on others (it seems he couldn't care less about the school!), like having McGonagall as teacher for 14 classes (2 classes per year because 4 houses and 2 of them being in class together!), making her a head of house (which she is ineffective at...she always rebuffs Harry when he goes to her for help or advice! Not to mention she seems to care more about house points, the quidditch cup, her houses reputation (the dancing lessons in GoF come to mind!) and her teacher's pets (like Hermione) than the actual people in Gryffindor!) and deputy headmistress (head of house and deputy headmaster/headmistress should be mutually exclusive and every head of house should have a deputy head, too!)...she probably has to pick up a lot of his slack, too (he's often in London advising Fudge, attending wizengamot sessions or being out of the country at the ICW!)
- abandoned classes (either Hogwarts was far larger in population once or Dumbledore and his predecessors dropped a lot of classes (the school doesn't have an art programm - despite the fact that there's wizard paintings etc. - and that's just one example as neither languages nor economics etc. are taught either!)
- etc. (probably forgetting a hell of a lot!)

Conclusion: I agree 100% with the OP and that's without taking into account all the evil stuff you can accuse him of! Dumbledore is a misguided asshole and people are kind of blinded by his flashy magics etc. (he kind of is a Lockhart that really made it and doesn't even need to obliviate his victims because they are stupid enough to thank him for sitting on his fat ass doing nothing (some token effort here and there is enough!) while thinking about how nice it was being fucked in said ass by Grindelwald!)

I totally have a soft-spot for Hagrid, the lovable idiot, but yeah, he seriously needs to take some kind of safety course. Do you know [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChOHnSL7ZCg][Staplerfahrer Klaus? (warning: Blood &Gore)]] Probably not. He should be forced to watch a safety video like that with little children mauled and decapitated by wild animals, maybe that would wake him up. He'd be horrified if he knew how easily they 'break'. He just doesn't seem to understand that regular human beings are squishy and soft.

** Looks like someone been reading too much Evil/bashing shit and started taking it too seriously.

First off - pull your head out of a gutter. Dumbledore isn't perfect. He isn't all knowing. He isn't without his own pride, ambition and flaws.

Grindewald: he was 17. Lonely, idealistic and naive and meets someone equally brilliant in magic. Of course his head was turned. And he was 17. What more to say?

Tom Riddle: He is at this time just a teacher. He doesn't "recruit" him. Just delivers the letter. That's his job. He is not jury and executioner. He doesn't go around murdering children just because he has suspicions about their integrity. And Tom is very clever, very skilled and very powerful.

Hagrid: again Dumbledore is not all knowing. Doesn't have proof. Fact is there was a dead girl. School governors, ministry and public were undoubtedly demanding action. Headmaster Dippet blamed Hagrid. End of story. What do you expect poor Albus to do? Stage mutiny and take over the world?

Grindewald in later years was NOT his "responsibility". He was just a teacher. Why do you think it was his job to deal with every wanna-be dark lord that came along? And do you think it's easy to stand up to someone who was once a friend?

Dumbledore made a choice not to pursue career in politics. It's his right to turn down the offer.

As for his numerous positions: we don't really know what political power do any of those offices hold. And who is to say he didn't make anything for the better? For instance torture was outlawed at Hogwarts once he became a Headmaster. (shackles in the dungeons were student used to be strung up for punishments)

"Under his watchful eye ..." wtf you think it's his job to personally over see everything? To fix all wrongs? That is a bit idiotic and unrealistic expectation from a headmaster of a school. There is a whole ministry, aurors, hit-wizards. dementors. And who knows what else meant to keep public safe.

Anyway as I said go sober up. Dumbledore is a person, flawed, not all knowing and it's not his job to fix everything.

Your whole reply sorta misses the point. I wouldn't be complaining if Mr. Dumbledore were just a regular person filing papers in the ministry at his nine to five job. He's someone who people admire and who is highly decorated and holds some of the most prestigious positions in the country. He's not just "a person". If he wants to be just a person he can retire and live out his days in a cottage at a lake.

This is directly related to what you wrote above

But he's not some regular guy. I'm not expecting him to become some kind of superhero and catch all the criminals, but with power comes responsibility. He doesn't have to fix everything. Just the big things that could destroy their society. Something that everyone would want to fix anyway. It's not like I'm asking him to go out of his way or anything. Just like, do anything, instead of sitting there and managing Hogwarts, okay?

Seriously though. He is in the end just a person. Cleverer than some, perhaps more powerful than others, but far from infallible. He did what he thought was right often under very difficult circumstances. And whether in retrospect his actions were good or bad is another story.

In conclusion? He did keep Harry safe. He figured out Voldemort's horcruxes and was able to concoct a plan to save Harry in the end. And that's what matters.

I'm not expecting him to be infallible. He fails at (almost) everything (that really matters, you know, the big things). I'm sure he's a bowling superstar and a great alchemist though.
