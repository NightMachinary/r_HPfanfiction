Harry knew he had no chance of beating Voldemort with Wands, so what he did was... Challenged Voldemort to a Children's Card Game!

As the Duel began, Harry was thought to be a Dark Lord by the masses of idiots in Wizarding Britain even on his First Turn, as he summoned his partner, the Spirit that had been with him his whole life... The Dark Magician Girl.

Voldemort on the other hand wasn't sure what an Ojama was, but Malfoy insisted they were good, and he wasn't about to use Nott's suggestion of Cyber Dragons, because how could Muggles make a better Dragon than Wizards could. He was deeply shocked when Potter summoned a Dark Witch to assist him, and wonders if he'd accidentally created his own rival rather than enemy when trying to stop the Prophecy.


** This reminds me of a YA fantasy novel I read where the villain (a master bladesman) challenged the young hero (an ordinary modern kid who got sucked into the fantasy world) to a duel.

The hero gets to choose the weapons, so he gets a brilliant idea. His only real athletic accomplishment is being a pitcher on his high school baseball team. So as his weapon he chooses...billiard balls.

So the duel commences, and the young hero brains the villain upside the head with an 80mph fastball. Winner!

I think Harry doing something similar in a duel with Voldemort would be cool. Have Hermione research what the rules are for duels so Harry can gain an advantage.

“Alright, Voldemort. I accept your challenge. We will have a competition, and the loser shall die. Be at the Lion & Castle on Tuesday at 8pm sharp for their Dr Who pub quiz night, and we shall see which one of us is fit to lead Wizarding Britain into the future!”

...Although, come to think of it, that'd be better suited to a Chaser. Harry's a Seeker. Quidditch duel!

** Or a legal duel.

"Are you Lord Voldemort?" asked the well-dressed Muggle. Voldemort was confused, why wasn't the Muggle cowering in fear yet? "Yes, it is I, the Dark Lord Voldemort, the greatest wizard ever to live, I who have..." Voldemort began to monologue, only to be rudely interrupted by the distinctly non-cowering Muggle. "You've been served." said the Process Server, placing an envelope in his hand with a hearty smack. Voldemort gaped in shock as the Muggle walked away as if he only cared about his next target.

** I'd like to see a fic where Harry's raised by the spirits of the three Egyptian god cards, or somehow exodia. with said spirt(s) somehow physical visiting Hogwarts at some point, if exodia I'd love it if somehow Hogwarts is related to the seals keeping exodia's body separated in five pieces weather the founders were involved in splitting the forbidden one up or they were followers of the forbidden one trying to weaken one of the seals via Hogwarts powering it's wards by siphoning away the energy of the seal

** A full-on Shadow Game would be sweet. Harry's making sure he's going to win and playing Frog FTK or something.
