** Sometimes. Not always. Not even often. It also depends on whether or not the original author allows people to adopt the story or not.

Dunuelos made an entire series of fanfics based on The Professional's Lone Traveler.

/Luna's Hubby/ by Meteoricshipyards was based on a oneshot by Rorchach's Blot.

On the subject of Rorchach's Blot, several fanfic authors have made fanfics based on /Make A Wish/.

Those are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure there's more.

*** They don't need to allow them to continue it. If they want to use the pre-existing chapters, then yes, but if they're just writing a continuation or extension...

We call that fanfiction.

**** Yeah, but some fanfic authors are such primadonnas that they'll excoriate anyone who adopts their stories without permission.

**** I adopted some shorter fics for Percy Jackson a few years ago, but I've since discontinued myself from them, as the plot and my writing was rather cringe.

If I have to say anything, just make sure the new author is a decent writer (look at their old works or ask for their ideas) and if you can, volunteer to be a beta and give them your notes.

** Harry potter and the Natural 20 had an unnoffocal continuation, which I vaguely remember being ok.
