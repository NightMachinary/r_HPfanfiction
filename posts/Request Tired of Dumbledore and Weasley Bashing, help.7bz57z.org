I'm looking for stories, any stories that have very little to absolutely no character bashing. It doesn't matter the character, I don't want to see them bashed. (Of course Voldemort is an exception, but you get the point).

Am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Any rating is fine, would love for the story to be completed. Not okay with Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as pairings but if you can find me one with them being in character or as in character as possible and very little to no bashing involved I'll give it a chance.

Any other pairing is okay.

Seriously though, if a summary says Weasley or Dumbledore bashing I won't read it, I'm tired of the character bashing. Also please no Hermione written as perfect. I tend to skip fics that have her as a perfect character.

Doesn't matter what Era it is, can be canon or as AU as possible, if it's a rehash story please let it be interesting. Anyone can be the main character, not just Harry.


** Welcome to the next stage in your fanfiction reading career! You now see that, no, Dumbledore isn't out to steal Harry's money, and no, the Weasleys aren't love potioning Harry into being their thrall!

Here are my favorites off the top of my head:

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) linkffn(What You Leave Behind) linkffn(Grow Young With Me) linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) linkffn(Hallowed) linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure)

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

*** I never cared much at all for the bashing of characters and tend to stay away from stories that have Weasley or Dumbledore bashing in the summary. But sometimes there will be a story with bashing that I wasn't expecting because it wasn't in the summary, which is annoying in that case.

I actually read Grow Young With Me and Love it (which is strange since I tend to stay away from main character and oc). But it was really good and can't wait until it's updated.

I tend to dislike stories that are unfinished because then you get to the end and it sucks because it's over, but will still check them out. Thanks for the recs and sorry for the rather long post, if anyone knows any more let me know!

And since you didn't went more precise than that. (Jesus christ there are like hundreds of stories like that)

Most are Dark Harry, one is a doctor who HP crossover that does not need you to be familiar with Doctor Who, There are also mentor!Severus and LV/HP thrown in the mix. If they are not completed, then they are WIP that are regularly updated.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

*** I'm pretty open to most stories as long as they are interesting and don't bash characters. Or do the opposite of reverse bashing and have the character be perfect. Will check them out, thanks.

** Well, your requirements meet a huge number of stories, so I'm gonna take the opportunity to recommend an older duology. It contains the only realistic mentor/student Snape/Harry situation that's excited me.

Harry/Ginny, though romance isn't a significant part of the story from what I remember.
