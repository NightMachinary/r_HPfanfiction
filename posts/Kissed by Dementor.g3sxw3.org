**** Thanks for the link. Spend the past 5 hours reading it. I probably would have never read it if it wasn't for the recommendation, I don't normally read fem Harry stories. Really interesting concept, found the name chosen for fem Harry really unlike her, so much so that I never got used to it.

The concept of the 7 trials were very cool, but I think only the first two and 4th were well thought out. Number 3 was the most useful but wasn't really a trial. The story started off really strong. Tealeon had to develop a little for the trials, we could see the effect of her kiss on her friends with Ron changing for the better. The author showcased she wasn't afraid to change canon multiple times. But the story slowed down a lot after the first 25 or so chapters. I thought that Voldemort would have been defeated by the end of the story by how much was happening every chapter. But very little happens the last 15 chapters.

I found this very enjoyable nevertheless. Unique concept, which was executed relatively well.
