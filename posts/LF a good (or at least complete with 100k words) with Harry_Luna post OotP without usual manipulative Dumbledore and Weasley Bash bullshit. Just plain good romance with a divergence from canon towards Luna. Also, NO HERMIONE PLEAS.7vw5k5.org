#+TITLE: LF a good (or at least complete with 100k+ words) with Harry/Luna post OotP without usual manipulative Dumbledore and Weasley Bash bullshit. Just plain good romance with a divergence from canon towards Luna. Also, NO HERMIONE PLEASE !

I don't know if there's any like that, most Harry/Luna i've read are either complete AU, post-war, or Harry/Luna/Hermione. I don't mind AUs or postWar, but it gets a bit boring. However, I realy, really hate canon Hermione and most fanon Hermione. The only type of Hermione I enjoy reading about is battle-veteran Hermione, like in Ragnarok, Stages of Hope, To End in Serenity (which is hilarious). Or stuff like that. Doesn't mean I don't want her in the story, just not as a pairing.


** /Protection from Nargles/ and its sequel?

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

Is sort of H/G/LL

I don't remember them being particularly mean to Dumbledore.
