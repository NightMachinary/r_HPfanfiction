Is there a fan fiction where harry and Draco become best friends right off the bat and how that affects the rest of the series?

Also feel free to discuss the various ramifications of such a pivotal event.

I feel it would be very interesting because harry loves going outside the rules, Draco would love that, but harry isn't super impressionable so he'd temper Draco's more malevolent tendencies. And oh so many more possibilities.


** Are you looking for the infamous "handshake which changed history"? Because there are thousands of fics following that premise.

*** I think it would be a really interesting perspective to read an entire series that keeps certain requisite events that would have happened either way but how the whole thing could have turned out. I'm guessing I'm pretty much years behind.

**** The problem with such a premise is that either it has a massive impact and the plot diverges from the stations of canon or it is just a canon rehash with Draco along. Draco might be able to substitute Ron's part in the trio but then you have a Harry, Hermione and Draco trio which is a recipe for disaster. Remeber that Draco called for racial purges at twelve. Just how would they get along? Either you have to replace Hermione as well or you have to remove the bigotry which makes Draco Draco.

***** you're expressing some of the reasons I find the concept interesting. Harry would temper Draco's bigotry because he's never had a friend who would stand up to him and challenge his way of thinking. But he'd be drawn to the fame that is Harry Freaking Potter. So I think we'd see a more quick turn against the darkness.

Also having harry so close to dark wizards would be crazy interesting.

******* You remarry think someone of “lesser wizard if blood” could influence Draco? Harry is of mixed parentage but he has the celebrity to wear Draco down. Even in canon we see hints of his not being a complete piece of shit.

However Dethryl has written a rather complete work that I'm two books into and thoroughly enjoying.

** linkffn(7659033) The they shook hands series does that. Its in sixth year at the moment and updates quite slow. But to be clear, Harry and Draco both influence each other. And them becoming friends influences Harrys perception of a lot of things. For example Harry gets along with multiple people he hated in canon even when they have the same personalities because they treat him differently.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!
