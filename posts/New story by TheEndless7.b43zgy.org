** Ah, typical Endless7's fic.

They start so well and yet, they absolutely suck at the ending, the only exception being vitam paramus.

*** vitam's paramus's ending is not an exception. The epilogue was added like 4 years after the fact.

***** Honestly I prefered the H/D relationship over the H/F one. I wish that was the true ending.

****** It's not about the pairing that bothered me in alternate ending. It's more about how Fleur ends up with minor character suddenly after all the development upto chapter 19. It literally kills the entire feel of the story.

And also, there's these rumours that chapter 20 originally had Bill sexually assaulting Fleur before it was edited out. I'm highly sceptical of that though.

But then again...this raised my doubts slightly.

  "Not worried she won't find some boy at school when you're away?" Ron teased. Harry's thoughts shifted immediately to Bill, but he managed to not show his emotions.

  "No," he lied, squeezing Daphne's other hand gently. She stirred against him but didn't wake.

  "But you know what happened with-" Ron started.

Something must have happened. Though definitely not rape. But I wish he could have shown the conflict in the story slowly, not abruptly dropping the epilogue bomb upon us. I wish I had read this fic earlier.
