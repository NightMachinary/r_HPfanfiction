I'm kinda on a Dumbledore frenzy right now. Not bashing him, but like a good Dumbledore fic. A badass Dumbledore. He can have his flaws, he can make mistakes but ultimately he makes better choices than in canon. I would prefer if the fics contain a good relationship with Harry, or Harry-centric with Dumbledore as someone he has a good relationship with or as a mentor. Again, these are just preferences. But I would like fics that has a healthy dose of Dumbledore in it without all that bashing.


** I'm pretty sick of manipulative!dumbledore too myself. So many writers seem to focus on his negatives and not enough of his positives, instead of the Dumbledore that sits and broods in his office all day contemplating the best way to fuck with Harry's life without any rhyme or reason. Why don't we see more of the Dumbledore who likes ten-pin bowling and warm socks? Where is the whimsical and silly Dumbledore who said "Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!" during the opening speech in PS? And please don't say that's just an act to fool people into believing he's a doddering, old, senile fool. Well... What if he really is? The man is over 100 years old! Even wizards get old and old people are universal everywhere, and noone, absolutely noone is a master manipulator past the age of 80, I don't care who you are.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

The warlock's apprentice seems exactly what I'm looking for and the the merging sounds intriguing. The rest of them look interesting too.

  As Albus Dumbledore's apprentice, Harry is used to strange tasks. Visiting the opera, buying spices in India, tinkering with the River of Time: nothing new to see there. Yet when Voldemort enters the fray, injuring Time because he has the sensitivity of a German tank in Poland, Harry finds himself confronted with an adventure that brings him to the end of his wits.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** Back in the day I read and fell in love with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1458772/1/Here-Be-Monsters-I-Wizard-s-Lament][Here Be Monsters I: Wizard's Lament]] linkffn(1458772) and its two sequels (the last story unfortunately unfinished, I believe because the author wasn't fond of writing AUs and was in the middle of the third fic when HBP came out). It's quite...saccharine, looking back now, and therefore the main characters (Harry, Dumbledore, and Remus) are fairly OOC with their amount of emotional openness, but I still really love the author's style and it's nice getting to see some moments we might have gotten if their canon versions hadn't been so closed-up and private. Also by the same author is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1471928/1/Daddy-s-Favorite][Daddy's Favorite]] linkffn(1471928) - I know you said you're not a big fan of one-shots, but this is seventeen of them, inter-related to form a bigger story, and takes a look at Harry and Dumbledore's relationship from different characters' perspectives.

I always hesitate to rec fics I haven't read yet, but I have two open in my tabs right now I've been waiting to start that look like they fill your criteria and could be promising, both seem to be Harry's years at Hogwarts from Dumbledore's PoV:
