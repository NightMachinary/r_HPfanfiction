Anyone remember the name of this fic? The RoR sends the DA to before Hogwarts was created. The author posted the story here, I believe.

*** You know, if you haven't read the story and just go by the premise, it isn't exactly plagiarising. I'm pretty sure everything you'll write will be quite different from this one. On a similar note, I'd read the shit out of this.

**** Does the rule of plagiarism even apply when it comes to fan fic, legally, ethically or otherwise?

Isn't all fan fiction plagiarism of some form?

One could very easily read a story and create one very similar to it, changing the parts they want to change and retaining what they wish to retain. Where would be the problem in that?

Edit: I am aware of rule 6 of this sub. I am however not certain that it even begins to apply in this hypothetical case, regardless of the will of an author, so long as the stories are not identical on their face. But I admit I don't know, and this is simply an inquiry.

Edit2: Meaning, you can't very well make up a story about about how phoenixes have the power to teleport(themselves and wizards) between the realms of life and death, and then demand that nobody ever use that idea in another fan fic, can you?!

***** I honestly just feel that if someone takes your idea and run with it without asking for permission is kinda scummy. Not illegal or necessarily wrong, but really douchy. That said, plagiarism in fanfic is kinda counter-productive to my eyes.

****** isn't that all fanfics that hasn't gotten permission from the original author to be written? Sure, it's polite to ask, but I don't think it's scummy to use another fanfic author's idea, or even characters. It may seem a bit strange, but isn't that what fanfic's are in the first place?

What, like taking JK Rowling's idea and running with it without asking for permission, you mean?

I think you'll find you'll need to reevaluate your moral position on the matter, one way or the other, since otherwise you're contradicting yourself.

All possible art is plagiarism because nature itself is just as repetitive. But that doesn't mean you can't be unique even while "plagiarizing". In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find it would be extremely hard to do so unless you make it your very goal to do nothing but copy every single element of one's story.

The concept of holding ownership over an idea, creative or otherwise, in such a manner as it not be used as a source of inspiration is in fact the deeply immoral one, since it is illiberal and even tyranical to the core. It spells the death of art, it does not protect it. The only thing to be gained from such a thing would be the vanity of one single individual at a time.

****** I don't quite agree. Of course outright plagiarism is a douchy, and I'd be super upset if someone ever stole my fic of even just parts of it but just taking the premise and running with it? Meaning I would have inspired someone to sit down and write something similar to my idea? That's actually kinda flattering. I mean that's where tropes come from, isn't it? That's how we got 10000 coffee shop and time travel AUs and what not. Saying that only the person who had the original idea can do anything with it seems counterproductive to getting a lot of varied fic out there. Maybe you see a fic and love the premise but the ship is your notp. Why not write something with the same/similar premise for a pairing you like? Or with no pairing at all. I don't see the problem there.

  Faced with Umbridge's impending incursion, the Room of Requirement does its upmost to meet the fervent wishes of the DA and ensure that she won't find them - so, very suddenly, Harry and his friends find themselves a very long way from home indeed, with no idea how to get back. This might be a problem... (Group time-travel, with a minimum of bashing.)

**** [[/r/romesweetrome][r/romesweetrome]] famous bit of Reddit history!

The guy started writing the story on a sub and it picked up so much traction that WB tried to option the movie rights. Think that stalled as it's been forever but still a cool story.

Eeit: And it's apparently Marine special forces going back in time to Rome so update on that lol
