I am so sick of reading about the Gryffindor Princess Golden Girl Lioness and her star-crossed romance with the Bad Boy Death Eater Slytherin Serpent. I really like pairings featuring Hermione with Draco, Snape and pretty much any other Slytherin; I think Slytherin qualities complement Hermione's traits, and it makes sense. But I want to read about it like it's a normal romance, and their houses don't automatically make it forbidden (though fine if other factors mean it must be kept secret, I just think I might cry if I ever read another Lioness and Snake comparison). Finished stories only, please. Oneshots and short stories are fine, I just don't want to wait for updates.

If you get a chance, check out scum's "Self-Slain Gods on Strange Altars" too. It's unfinished but by far the best SSHG I've read. She also writes DMHG.

*** I have to agree, the author's totally unappreciated, and I really loved The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9037795/1/The-Spring-Turnover][Spring Turnover]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374460/Aurette][Aurette]] and [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewuser.php?uid=119][Lady of the Masque]] are also mentionable.

***** Yeah, I enjoyed her work too. Catherdral and Scum have a similar writing style. The poetic type that you usually only see in drabbles.

** I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but I have really enjoyed this story as of late. It's a Draco / Hermione, still there's a forbidden aspect that changes throughout the fic.

** I just read this one, and it honestly kept my interest the whole time. Very short story but the plot is well developed and makes you really think. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2418008/1/Icarus]] It's a different kind of pairing. a HGLV that isn't like any other I have ever read.
