** Do you want angst related to teenage suicide? If so, "Digging for the Bones" might be to your liking, but it's less about preventing suicides than dealing with the aftermath of one, and while Remus plays a role, Snape is central.

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

** Uh not to be a dick, but that sounds like a pretty shit fic idea. The most you could get out of the idea would be like a 1k one-shot.

It just seems like one of those ideas a 13 year old makes, where everyone in Hogwarts was horribly abused as a kid, and they all have to take a ticket and form an orderly queue to jump off of the Astronomy Tower.

*** There are ~1000 students at Hogwarts according to Rowling.

Child Protection Service guesstimate (lacking big sets of data) that ~2.2% of children are abused (in one or more ways) in the UK.

If we use those numbers, that's 22 students in Hogwarts that are abused and in need of protection and/or help.

I'd say thats plenty for a decent sized fic.

**** True, but the idea that Remus is going around and giving out chocolate like he's Hogwart's fairy godmother is ridiculous for a plot idea. There's no real /substance/ to the piece. It would be a series of interconnected one-shots that highlight Remus' past through flashbacks and conviniently abused children to fit a 'section' of his traumatic past.

And to play advocate, knowing the society that HP is set in, the abuse numbers are most likely significantly higher, considering the time period they are stuck in.

***** Then give it substance. Thats the goddamn job of an author. It doesn't have to be a series of one-shots. It doesn't even have to be 22 students. Maybe its just a handful, maybe just one. I'm not sure what image has formed in your head about this,... no wait, I'm pretty sure I know what kind of fic you speak about,... but I am certain that this idea could be made into something great if the right author picks it up. Cut away the flashbacks, cut away the cardboard cut-out OCs. Make this something deep and it could be really good.

And to also play advocate: The wizarding society is not /"stuck"/ in any time. It progresses and develops just like their muggle counterparts. Magical UK has its problems, absolutely. What war-torn nation doesn't? But it is not stuck. We see magazines describing new potions, charms, transfigurations. We know that magical things are being developed and refined (brooms, the wolfbane potion, whatever the fuck is going on in the DoM...) and there is active debate about culture and tradition.

Given that the only child abuse we actually see (of course not counting scenes where the children are enemies of the abusers - ex. Ministry of Magic battle), we only ever see mental abuse from the Dursleys - muggles, and Snape. That is hardly of any statistical value.

****** I see what you're getting at. I'd just worry about keeping the audience's attention throughout the entire fic. Perhaps the author would make it so he dotes on a single child who he sees himself in, or through caring for these children he learns to love etc etc.

To be perfectly honest, from the angle you're coming at, it could actually be quite decent. I had a much more cynical view, where Remus ends up adopting an african orphan with his gay lover Sirius Black.

/Eugh/

WIth regards to the argument of culture and tradition in the WIzarding World, we simply don't have any basis for how they run their society other than a terrible example of an atrocious Minister and a corrupt Ministry.

This is the problem, though. People tend to jump to the conclusion that the Ministry is /always/ this corrupt, but in fact Fudge was most likely quite a solid peace keeping Minister /after/ the war. Society as a whole would rather turn a blind eye to a corrupt government that doesn't affect them rather than deal with hard issues.

Overall, you're completely correct; there just isn't enough statistical value from Jo to go off of to make any sort of conclusions about child abuse or how they run their society on a macro to micro scale (not without taking some liberties from the fandom).

** What's wrong with only a one-shot? Cauterize is one of the shortest docs I've read and also one of the best. I think it could be a heartwarming/heart wrenching story of Remus helping students over the years anecdotally and then like they all come together to support him later, if it's short so what?

Every fix doesn't have to be 80 chapters to be worth writing or reading
