I have read The Arithmancer and The Accidental Animagus.


** linkffn(11191235) Is doing interesting things and has just about wrapped up year two, with regular updates being pushed out every fortnight or so. The first chapter is trope heavy but don't let that put you off. The characterisation is strong, it has a huge cast and multiple story lines developing.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

******* I got to about the end of year three and dropped that one. Should I push through to the end if I didn't particularly enjoy the early-middle?

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED
