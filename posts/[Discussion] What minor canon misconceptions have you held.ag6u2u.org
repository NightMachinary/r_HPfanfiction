I was just reading the first few chapters of PS again, and found I had been picturing Harry's cupboard/living situation all wrong for as long as I can remember. And I'd like to hear what

1) that he was without a bed, and at best had a mattress if not a mat.

#+begin_quote
  Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed...
#+end_quote

2) that his cupboard was tiny

#+begin_quote
  Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. ‘Where's my letter?' said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon ( 'a big, beefy man' ) had squeezed through the door.
#+end_quote

3) that he didn't get moved to Dudley's second bedroom until after returning from Diagon Alley (probably just me)

#+begin_quote
  'That evening...' (on the very day Harry receives receives his first letter) ...'Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking ... you're really getting a bit big for it ... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.'
#+end_quote

And (*Note*: this is not the main point of this post) I couldn't help but notice a couple other things 4) the idea that Harry had no freedom

#+begin_quote
  ...Harry-hunting.\\
  This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking
#+end_quote

5) that, I don't know, the abuse was towards Harry alone

#+begin_quote
  Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up
#+end_quote

I've never been a true believer in the abuse (mostly because it obviously isn't meant to be /real/), but Dudley smacks Vernon with his Smeltings stick more than once (and again indiscriminately along with Harry in a threeway tangle), Harry grabbed Vernon round the neck, Dudley gets hit, Harry steps on Vernons face, Vernon pulls out his own mustache hair etc.

It reminds me of Flanderization, and that any of these things could be exaggerated beyond recognition (Dudley abusing parents, Harry costing the Dursleys a fortune in haircuts and psychiatric bills, and running them into an early grave/early greying/balding etc.)

I didn't intend to have a 'point', but I guess I'm finding that the addition of these little details helps the balance of the story and are pleasant additions. And honestly the Dursleys don't need to made to look worse, Harry's situation doesn't need to be made worse, and for my money I'm /enjoying/ the canon Dursleys in a thoroughly reprehensible yet comic sort of way far more than any fanfiction I can recall.

In any case, what little pieces of canon have you found you'd forgotten or found renewed enjoyment out of?


** Because of the movies, I had completely forgotten that it was Phineas Nigellus Black who delivers the "Dumbledore's got style" line right after Dumbledore escapes being arrested by Fudge and Kingsley in OoTP. I also forgot that it was Tonks, and not Luna, who finds Harry petrified on the Hogwarts Express and then fixes his nose in HBP.

I had also forgotten that the Dark Mark on Death Eaters' arms was a well-kept secret. When Harry tells Sirius that he saw Snape show Karkaroff "something on his arm" at the Yule Ball, Sirius is baffled and says, "Well, I've no idea what that's about."

Most fanfic probably changes that because it makes no sense for the Dark Mark to not be common knowledge amongst aurors and members of the OotP after so many Death Eaters were captured, tried, and imprisoned at the end of the war. Sirius not knowing is like a cop not knowing about the existence of a notorious prison gang tattoo (such as Aryan Brotherhood).

**** Sirius is perhaps the only person it does make sense for, though: if the existence of the mark was only revealed during the trials post-War, he would have already been imprisoned. If no one thought to tell him about it after his release (why would they? After all, everyone knew after the trials), he might never have heard about it.

That would make for a great one shot where someone tells Sirius about the Mark and he blows up (rightfully) over the fact that no one thought to check his arm.

Actually, this could be more because of Sirius' imprisonment. Fudge was well aware of the Dark Mark - he snaps at Snape when the latter reveals the full darkened mark to him after Voldemort's resurrection, and tells him to cover it up.

** That's right. It's exactly why I like the canon portrayal of the Dursleys much better than fanfiction. It also has something to do with the fact that JK wrote it in the 90s when it was much more common to get a smack now and then from your parents and wasn't considered out of the ordinary. I know I got a lot from my parents for being an annoying little shit 😂.

I like stories that can make me feel like it's happening in the 80s and 90s. It adds more realism and immersion for the reader. (I am in no way condoning corporal punishment however).

For me, it has to be how Harry has a bit of fun in class, like when he and Ron are duelling with fake wands that turn into rubber ducks in McGonagall's class I believe (I may have forgotten the minutiae) or when they come up with that rubbish for their Dream Journal in GoF. Or how Harry and Hermione are jokingly debating about Madam Pince's 'affair with Filch' in HBP. Most Fanfiction makes Harry and Hermione a saint who have no idea how to have a fun conversation.

I may be in the minority, but I love to read about teenagers being teenagers (without being douches). That's why I adored canon in the first place.

I grew up in the 90s, and I've gotten plenty of whacks from my parents when I was being a little shit, but they certainly never swung frying pans at me, or locked me in cupboards for weeks, or starved me as punishment. I've also never had dogs set on me as Harry did when he was 7 or so when Marge came to visit. I've always had 3-4 full meals a day, unlike the one bowl of shit Harry got for the summer when he turned 12.

The worst punishment (to a 13 yo me) I'd seen was my neighbour's for screwing up his studies - he was told to sit outside in his verandah and read up on everything he gotten wrong, however long it took. He was to eat only once he'd finished studying. That was the strictest form of punishment I'd seen, ever.

So yeah, don't try and excuse the Dursleys' abuse of Harry by saying that it happened in a different decade - they were vile filth.

I've seen fics where they say Harry was made to always sit on the floor (when in fact there's a scene where he squeezes between Vernon and Dudley in the couch and even eats with them at the table), nearly beaten to death, raped and sometimes even things like he was made to stay in the cupboard without any trips to the bathroom and so he shit himself in his bed.

#+end_quote

It doesn't take a lot to beat a child to death - a couple of heavy frying pans to the head will do it easily. They set a fucking dog on him when he's 10 - that's enough to kill a child, easily. He's forced to climb and hide in a tree to get away. They don't call the dog off of him and allow him to get down from the tree until midnight. A ten year old falling from a tree can cause broken bones. That would have been real fun, I'm sure.

The next passage is from PS.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.

  Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day.
#+end_quote

Sure, the locking him inside the cupboard without even bathroom breaks is a bit much, but he is locked inside the cupboard for what looks like weeks in Chapter 3. And of course, we know about the many padlocks and the infamous cat-flap from CoS.

When there is such bad treatment in canon, it isn't a stretch to imagine it getting even worse because of accidental magic in Harry's childhood years that takes the abuse to a whole other level.

I'm not disputing that what the Dursleys did was wrong, however your timeline is rather off.

Dudley was born on the 23rd June. The 23rd June 1991 was a Sunday. I'm assuming that in the Potter world, Dudley's birthday took place on a Saturday so his birthday trip could proceed as planned.

While I cannot find accurate term dates for primary schools in Surrey circa 1991, I can tell you that primary schools tend to break up around the 23rd of June for summer holidays.

Since Harry and Dudley's primary school had obviously not broken up prior to Dudley's birthday it is very likely that they broke up in the coming week, likely not even going the full week, but instead ending on something like a Wednesday. Those final days of school - especially for a child in Year 6, who had already taken the newly introduced SATs - are likely to be comprised mostly of games and other fun things.

If Harry was indeed confined to his cupboard until the summer holidays started and slightly afterwards then it was a maximum of a week.

I'm not claiming that makes it better, since it obviously doesn't.

I'll be the first to admit I have no idea regarding the holidays for primary schools in the UK. In my country, our summer holidays used to start in mid to late March and end by late May or early June. Ah, the wonders of the tropics...it's hot all year round, but March-June is the hottest.

Your suggestion that it might only have been a week may be right, but PS does say that his punishment was the longest he'd ever had. And judging by the number of things Dudley breaks, it /feels/ a lot more than a week. But then again, kids do have endless energy, so that could be it.

Zoos may open on Sundays /now/ - although again, I cannot get my hands on zoo opening times circa the 1990's to double check - however in 1991 shops were still under the auspices of the 1950 Shops act, which mandated that shops close on Sundays but before the 1994 Trading act which allowed some opening on Sundays.

Saturdays are also not generally a working day here, especially not for a director. Maybe if there was an emergency but not otherwise.

If you read between the lines, we can see that what JKR meant was that Harry was grounded. Which meant he had to stay in his cupboard whenever he was at home. He wasn't kept away from school. Now, that would have been bad.

It was considered effective back when I was younger because all the really fun things, like television, phone, majority of the toys, the family computer or gaming console if you had one, snacks, bookcase, etc, were usually located in the living or family room.

It's large enough that Vernon can enter- he has to squeeze through the door, but there is no mention of him- a very large man- having to crouch, being unable to stand, or move around in. And this is with Harry and his bed- yes he had an actual bed- also in there.

Basically people think of something the size of a small closest, when really it's a very small room. That's not to say it's acceptable! Maybe if they were otherwise in poverty it'd be a best of a bad situation type thing, but no they have an unused guestroom and Dudley has two rooms.

Really the abuse here I think is more emotional- the size isn't really acceptable but people get by on less, it's the fact that he could have his own real room but they won't let him, that they consider him as being less worthy than Dudley's trash, that's the real abuse.

#+end_quote

The whole idea of being grounded is foreign to me - I never had those things, nor was anyone I knew growing up ever grounded. We were usually disciplined on the spot for our trouble-making.

But, as I understand it, grounding is supposed to be something like restricted playing or TV or whatever it is kids usually enjoy - but Harry has no friends to play with, and Harry isn't allowed to watch what he wants on TV since Vernon and Dudley hog it most of the time, so it's no great loss to him.

Also, there is a big difference between telling a child he can't watch TV or play games for the next couple of weeks and locking him inside a cupboard for a couple of weeks as punishment - the two things are incomparable.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Canon does a pretty terrible job at portraying his abuse. A child who is subjected to all that Harry is won't be as headstrong or as trusting of anyone as canon Harry is. He also won't stand up for random strangers like Harry does for Neville in the remembrall incident, or going to the bathroom to warn Hermione in the troll incident.

The finishing off Voldemort part - canon does the most gimmicky job of that possible. Voldemort is not killed because of anyone's courage, skill or plans - he's killed because of sheer dumb luck and a lot of Deus Ex Machina plot, because at the end of the day, HP will always remain a more modern fairy tale. A more realistic take would have nearly all the protagonists getting killed at various points in the series.

Harry Potter started out as a children's book and is often written in a comical and exaggerated way especially in the beginning. Trying to dissemble it in some ways is just a disservice to the book and to yourselves, you might as well start to talk about how unrealistic it is for people to have magic and decide the books are horrible as I know some people who hate unrealistic stories would do. Why would you do that? And with so much passion, too?

********* And sometimes, I wish idiots with nothing particular to contribute would butt out of discussions, but sadly, that rarely happens. Since you're probably confused, I'll elaborate - violent character death and torture are generally not a part of any children's books I'm aware of. In the very first book, we see a man being burned alive. The very next book, we have a little girl possessed into unleashing a giant serpent on a school, along with enormous man eating spiders. The next one, we have soul sucking demons.

Not sure which children's book you read had deadly situations as such an integral part of its storyline.

So please, don't give the BS children's book excuse like that somehow rights things.

********** Lol what. Lots of children's books contain death, and gruesome death to boot. Have you ever read /The Rats of Nimh/? /A Wrinkle in Time/? /Number the Stars/? /Watership Down/, /Where the Red Fern Grows/, etc? Any of the children's books out there that have won Caldecott and Newberry medals? There's loads of fantastic children's books that deal with disturbing material amazingly.

Maybe I'm just a lucky child but we had a "library" class when I was in elementary school and my librarian always encouraged me to read the more intense literature. All, again, still considered children's books.

Not to mention old fairy tales usually end in gruesome death, and up until recently a lot of popular children's tales were cautionary and ended in the death of the errant child. Even in Disney films, the Huns get stuck with arrows and drown in an avalanche, the witch in Cinderalla falls off a cliff, Ursula I believe gets stabbed. 101 Dalmatians was about how a woman wanted to /kill puppies to make clothes./

This is literally all off the top of my head. Children's literature is so important and I won't have you devalue it even if it's just a dumb internet argument.

  But, as I understand it, grounding is supposed to be something like restricted playing or TV or whatever it is kids usually enjoy
#+end_quote

Grounding can also include having a child stay in their room for a certain period of time.

#+begin_quote
  there is a big difference between telling a child he can't watch TV or play games for the next couple of weeks and locking him inside a cupboard for a couple of weeks as punishment - the two things are incomparable.
#+end_quote

Exactly. Harry doesn't have friends or isn't allowed to watch TV even on normal days. So it isn't sufficient punishment according to the Dursleys. And like I said earlier, he wasn't locked 24/7. He did leave his room to go to school.

#+begin_quote
  Canon does a pretty terrible job at portraying his abuse. A child who is subjected to all that Harry is won't be as headstrong or as trusting of anyone as canon Harry is.
#+end_quote

I have to disagree. I've seen instances of a mother (my neighbour) throwing a rolling pin at her daughter (my classmate) during some tantrum of hers and bruising her. She was around twelve then. She probably cried for a day, but then they forgot and moved on. They're pretty tight even to this day and she loves her daughter fiercely. This was an incident in a loving family.

Harry's only problem then is that he wasn't loved by his family. While that influences his selfless nature, I have no reason to believe that Harry would lose his core values because of it. This can also be attributed to a phenomenon prevalent today. People think even slight abuse would totally cripple a person's life. While it can be true in some cases, there are people who are much more resilient than that. Since the beginning of the story, Harry's pretty detached from his family. He isn't feeling pathetic or sad that he isn't loved or trying hard to please his aunt and uncle like a normal child would.

Stories aren't about ordinary people, but rather people with extraordinary qualities. Harry's greatest quality is that his loveless home life hasn't in any way affected his ability to love. That's why he's the protagonist. We wouldn't want to read about a weakling now, would we?

#+end_quote

This is the distinction you ought to make here - in the case of your friend's family, it was actually a loving family and the rolling pin thing was a one-off incident. If the rolling pin were a semi-regular occurrence, there wouldn't be much love present, right? In Harry's case, it's the direct opposite. There's no affection anywhere (as a child, Harry is called Freak every once in a while), and we see enough incidents from canon to see that Petunia swinging frying pans might not have been a one-off thing.

Now you're saying that his inherent qualities are things that can never change, no matter what happens, as though he was born with those qualities and that experience can have no effect on them. I mean, yes, there are people who are inherently good despite of their horrible upbringing, but there are just as many who have been twisted by their struggles in early life. The abuse that Harry undergoes isn't slight either - ten years of being told he's a burden, that his parents were worthless drunks, of the Dursleys' general disdain and contempt towards him - all of that has to leave a mark, but the only way canon does that is to make him incredibly reckless and brash, along with a twisted idea of what affection and love mean.

#+begin_quote

In the beginning, he dreams of a future where a long lost family member would come and rescue him from his hell, but by the time he's 11, he's let go of that fantasy. This implies a certain amount of detachment, but it vanishes the moment he steps foot on the Hogwarts Express.

I'm going to have to disagree. Canon HP has no idea what love is. He thinks Snape's twisted obsession with Lily was love, he was that deluded. Even after everything Snape and Albus do to him to screw his life over, he values their input enough to walk to his death. After all the lies and deceit of Albus and Severus, he names his second child after two of his greatest tormentors (who he thinks are great men). Sorry, but no - canon HP has an incredibly warped idea of love.

  That's right. It's exactly why I like the canon portrayal of the Dursleys much better than fanfiction. It also has something to do with the fact that JK wrote it in the 90s when it was much more common to get a smack now and then from your parents and wasn't considered out of the ordinary. I know I got a lot from my parents for being an annoying little shit XD.
#+end_quote

Aunt Petunia basically tried to hit Harry with a frying pan in CoS. I would say that would count as physical abuse even by the standards of the 90s.

#+begin_quote
  Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but *he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan*Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished. (Chamber of Secrets)
#+end_quote

A "heavy blow" at the head with a frying pan can literally kill you.

Also, Vernon implied that they would try to "beat the magic out of him" in PS.

#+begin_quote
  "Now you listen here, boy,” he [Uncle Vernon] snarled, “I accept there's something strange about you, *probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured*---and as far as all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion---asked for all they got, getting up mixed up with those wizarding types---just what I always expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end---” (Philosopher's Stone)*

**** Your second quote actually shows that they never actually beaten him though, at least until then.

And the first one happens right after Harry pretends to set the garden (and Dudley) on fire. And Dursleys fear magic terribly and for a good reason. I wouldn't count that as abuse.

The real abuse was mental, Harry should have all sorts of emotional problems. But Harry doesn't show any of them in the books, which you can chuck up to tone of the first few books, but I personally like the the idea of Lily's sacrifice protecting Harry.

It's my head canon, I think Harry just felt loved and approved of by his mother, no matter what Dursleys said or did. Like Dumbledore says that Lily's love left a mark on him forever, in his very skin, etc.

Taking a swing with whatever you have in your hands, especially as a mother figure (I will not dispute that Petunia was a horrible mother figure) while doing kitchen choires, especially with a frying pan because mothers are often portrayed as either preparing to cook, cooking, or doing dishes, is something that is really common and often portrayed in a comical way in movies, tv-series, and cartoons. Often they either miss their target or the target does not develop brain damage because it's a running gag, not supposed to represent heavy physical abuse, as I'm quite sure is the case with Petunia taking a swing at Harry.

** Frankly I think points 1 and 2 demonstrate JKR's fundamental lack of understanding about the sizes of under stairs cupboards.

Generally speaking there are two types of beds for kids. A UK standard single, measuring 90cmx190cm (3ftx6ft) or a toddler's bed which typically start at 70cmx140cm (2.2ftx4.5ft) but can be closer to 80cmx160cm (2.6ftx5.2ft). More importantly, they can be about 50cm (1.6ft) off the floor if they have space under the bed.

Which means that the under the stairs cupboard has to be a /minimum/ of 70cmx140cm. However, given that under the stairs cupboards tend to have a fairly steep gradient because there are stairs above them, the cupboard has to be longer than 140cm so that the height of the bed fits in.

More importantly, I would imagine that getting a bed of any dimension into the cupboard in the first place would basically involve deconstructing and reconstructing it, in whole or in part. Which is much harder than just putting the kid in a room in the first place.

I think that it was one of those things you just write without thinking. Especially given that the first book is very much a kid's book with traditional elements.

In reality, I think a mattress sans bed-frame would work better. They're not that hard to move, you can just throw them in and they can bend to shape.

But I'm just a pedant.

*** I think it depends mostly on the stairs themselves, or rather how much of the space underneath is hollow. My mom's house and grandparents house both have "cupboards" that run the entire length of the stairs and then have a "sideroom" of sorts at the low end. However, both are in a split entry house so it's two sets of stairs with a landing - the "sideroom" is under the stairs to the basement, the rest is under the up stairs. I remember thinking it would be an awesome room and was actually kinda jealous the first few times I read the books.

(Now I just think it'd make a great library - grandma's even has shelves because its the pantry - have the books get younger the farther back you go and put a kids reading nest in that corner.)

Of course, I'm aware that Harry's cupboard is not like that. I figure Harry's cupboard is roughly the size of that little room in the back... you know... the one I used as a fort until I was about 9. At 14 I introduced it to my baby cousins and laid down just to see if I still could - not quite but if the shelves weren't there I would have had space to spare.

These days, they store the old camp cot under there. You know, the kind that folds in half and had just enough space underneath to store a few things, the kind of thing that stops being comfortable at around 10. It fits in unfolded. The only real issue is the height but the doorway is halfway down the stairs... if Harry's door is firmly at the tall end I figure Vernon could JUST squeeze himself inside but he isn't going anywhere but back out.

EDIT because I was typing this when I should have been getting ready for work and then really ran out of time:

I'm not saying it would have been comfortable, would have been essentially wall to wall cot with maaaaaybe enough room at the end for idk a milk crate or two to hold his clothes. If he kicks too hard in his sleep, he's hitting the bottom of the stairs and, by 10, he's sleeping curled up because the stairs get in the way. Getting stuff in and out of the potential milk crates probably involves a lot of reaching through the gap between the top of the bed and the bottom of the stairs and hoping for the best.

He's definitely feeling more than a little cramped by the time that the letter comes and the Dursleys probably weren't going to be able to keep him in it much longer.

But it could work. Possibly.

I doubt they've ever gone camping. Maybe it's just something left over from the Evans' house after Harry grandparents died. Idk it just seems like an odd thing.

My OTHER theory is that... its Dudley's crib mattress on some sort of little platform possibly made out of the rest of the crib. Vernon's apparently surprisingly good with his hands what with the putting bars on the windows and boarding the house up to block letters and all that maybe he rigged something. And, again with the weird little things but... how often was Dudley using it? Petunia probably insisted he sleep with them for years.

****** - Dursleys throw young Harry into cupboard to make him shut up
- This becomes a routine
- Young Harry shows very noticeable bruises and poor health from the complete lack of comfortable bedding
- Dursleys resort to using a cot lying around/buy something to avoid nosy neighbors questioning things (while they can get away with bruising showing up on a child once they're old enough to be active outside, it's hard to explain on a toddler)

******* Never said I was fine with Harry living under the stairs... just that I never questioned the logistics of fitting something like a bed in there. And that I never understood their reasoning for giving him one in the first place.

So 15 month old Harry. He's in a house he's never been in before, with people that are, probably even to a baby, extremely clear about the fact that they don't want him around and he can't find the only two people who have always been there. He's lost, confused, and nobody will give him the comfort he's asking for... if they're even paying attention at all. And what do toddlers do when they want you to pay attention?

They cause a scene. They cry and scream and throw all the toys around. My cousin was a climber and would jump up and down on and off of anything she could get to the top of. And yes, he's probably talking a bit and knows how to ask for some things but... at 15 months you're still mostly nonverbal. Do you think Dursley's made any attempts to learn his physical cues?

So they shove Harry into the cupboard to contain him. He's probably got his blanket because he's carrying around the one thing he recognizes, or because they don't want Dudley to touch it. He eventually falls asleep and they leave him there.

On day two it happens again.

By day three its routine. At some point Petunia gives him another blanket because its November.

And maybe he gets a few bruises from sleeping on the floor so they give him a pillow. Maybe they have one of those sleeping mats they use in daycares floating around. As for a complete over all lack of health... they're not exactly feeding him right. Maybe a vitamin D deficiency. But from sleeping on the floor? My sibs and I all had stages where we insisted on it...mine lasted from Christmas to Easter the year Santa built a playhouse in my room because you better believe I slept in that thing until we moved it outside.

As for other people seeing bruises and being worried because he's a toddler... Little kids fall of the couch or down the stairs or while trying to climb the bookcase. They straight up walk into walls and whack themselves in face with a squeaky toy because they think it's funny. And they bruise easy. If I go to the grocery store and see a kid with a bruised forehead I assume he recently discovered the hard way that he's too tall to just walk under the kitchen table. Kids are kids, even when they're little. But if I saw the same kid every day and that bruise never went away? Yeah that's suspicious.

How many people do you think saw little Harry often enough to know that something was up?

So... maybe they give up on Dudley's crib or they find a cot in the shed come spring and they think "might as well."

Or maybe Petunia goes to the store when Harry's like three and come back with a cot because... "Can't have him telling other kids he sleeps on the floor."

Edit because I forgot: as for the being able to explain away the bruises as playing outside... Vernon straight up goes for Harry's neck at least once and Petunia tries to hit him in the face with a frying pan... they don't give a shit.

** Your points about the cupboard and misconceptions about it are fair, but the Dursleys were abusing Harry. Their treatment of him fit basically all the characteristics of emotional abuse towards children:

#+begin_quote
  Emotional abuse is the ongoing emotional maltreatment of a child. It's sometimes called psychological abuse and can seriously damage a child's emotional health and development. Emotional abuse can involve deliberately trying to scare or humiliate a child or isolating or ignoring them. Children who are emotionally abused are often suffering another type of abuse or neglect at the same time -- but this isn't always the case. (NSPCC)
#+end_quote

This also includes stuff like expectations inappropriate for the age or developmental stage of a child (like a 10 year old being responsible for cooking breakfast every day, and being shamed for making slight mistakes). And ignoring (even partaking in) persistent bullying. And at times they deny Harry food, they literally lock him in his room when he's 12, and they gaslight him through his entire childhood. That's abuse. And it's more than hinted at signs of physical abuse, like Vernon strangling Harry when he's 15, Petunia throwing a frying pan at him, and Dudley and his friends beating him up throughout his childhood with no interference.

** Upon my first few read-throughs I just went with the message Rowling intended to convey, even though I didn't like some of it.

So imagine my surprise when, a few years later, I came across stories from the Ardennes Offensive where German PoWs were executed within days for something I remember Malfoy casually doing in the books, committing acts of War without wearing a proper uniform. A quick Google search later and I found Article 23 of the Hague convention (which revealed even more war crimes).

#+begin_quote
  Art. 23. In addition to the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially forbidden

  (a) To employ poison or poisoned weapons;

  (b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army;

  (f) To make improper use of a flag of truce, of the national flag or of the military insignia and uniform of the enemy, as well as the distinctive badges of the Geneva Convention;
#+end_quote

So consider my surprise when reading again the main cast is perfectly fine with a war criminal walking amidst them in the epilogue. And canon is full of similar things, like Dumbledore staying Harry's hero after admitting a conspiracy to commit child abuse

Looking at canon through the eyes of an adult really makes the whole thing feel odd in a bad way. Romilda Vane tries to rape Harry, no consequences. Malfoy's war crimes, attempted murder and grievous bodily harm? No consequences. Snape abusing his power for almost two decades after voluntarily joining the magical Sturmabteilung? He's a hero. The whole muggleborn registration thing? Almost a carbon copy of the Nürnberg laws and no consequences. Dumbledore and child abuse? No consequences.

Honestly, I've come to greatly dislike HBP and DH in the last few years due to things like this. Because once you notice the disparity between what Rowling intended to convey and what she actually wrote, there is little you can do to enjoy it again.

However, I think that a number of the things you mention are influenced heavily by fanfic interpretations.

The books actually mention that Romilda Vane is using the potion to get Harry to ask her out to Slughorn's party. How exactly do you go from that to rape as the only possibility? Ron also ate a ton of chocolates in one go, giving him a potential overdose and strengthening the reaction. Not saying an overdose happened, but it can very well be the case.

But, if we were to consider stimulants to all senses, then shouldn't we be considering those to senses like sight and smell? A girl walking in a revealing outfit which causes guys to take more than a few looks at her - does that count as visual stimulation? Certainly, the targets have no defence against it, since they can't unsee her after they've seen her. What about perfumes? You can't remove the scent after you've felt it once, and any attraction will stay.

I don't know if this is book canon or retcon, but it is said that the potency of LPs goes up in time, and Ron eats the potion laced pastries after they've been sitting in Harry's trunk for 3-4 months. He also eats a lot of pastries and probably suffers an overdose.

Or it could also just be an out and out bad reaction, similar to alcohol. You've got drunks who are quiet, and those who rage at the world, and those who get violent when drunk (including lightweights). Doesn't mean that all alcohol will force a man to violence.

******* How you equate Love Potions as a date rape drug is beyond me. The love potions in question where sold by Fred and George as a common product in their store. If dosing someone with love potion is equal to using a date rape drug then I'd say they would not be allowed to be sold and Fred and George would surely have the moral integrity to not sell those to anyone either. There are also many different versions of love potions as stated in canon, I very much doubt that a date rape drug love potion is among the things offered by the Weasly store.

The only canonical evidence you really have shown is Ron's extreme reaction which can be explained by the overdose he received by eating too many and the way they strengthened by lying around for months (both canon occurrences). Beyond that, there is nothing that agrees with your points.

What exactly are you basing this on? Canon certainly does not establish that all love potions want to make you commit sexual acts. They cause an infatuation or an obsession. We only see the effects of a love potion a couple times. Once with Merope Gaunt and with Romilda Vane. Merope Gaunt's use of the potion and the effect is had certainly comes close to your interpretation of it (although it was only speculated that she used the potion by Dumbledore). The other use is Romilda Vane on Ron (target was Harry), whose reaction was obviously very strong but can be explained by the circumstances (possible overdose and strengthened due to expiration).

If this is your definition of a rape drug than simple alcohol is also a rape drug since it can very easily lower your inhibitions and make you do things that you don't want to do. However, giving someone a glass of alcohol can hardly be qualified as drugging them with the intention of sexual abuse...

But if it is that easy to get a dangerous result, the sale should be regulated. And even then, what kind of "harmless" prank could you play on someone with a love potion which does not have the potential to at least result in sexual harassment? Say you slip your mate some keyed to girl X and she agrees to his proposition by making out with your friend, who has no interest in doing so sober. Then you just helped X to harass your friend sexually

#+begin_quote
  . However, giving someone a glass of alcohol can hardly be qualified as drugging them with the intention of sexual abuse
#+end_quote

So a glass of alcohol has the same result like what Ron goes through in canon? You are comparing an airsoft gun with an artillery piece here. And if you unknowingly slip someone alcohol to lower their inhibitions, then that is an attempt at sexual abuse. If someone drinks alcohol on their own free will, they know what they are getting into. But it is not like Harry, Ron or Riddle Sr knowingly ingested a love potion.

***** You completely missed the point. The Conventions are muggle things. They're irrelevant to wizards. We don't need the Conventions to tell us whether or not someone did something morally wrong, and wizards need it even less, seeing as they function under different laws.

Use morality to argue your case, not laws that don't even apply to the people we're talking about. It'd be like if I used the age of consent in America to criticize an adult fucking a 14 year old in the Philippines. It's stupid. I'm going to criticize the person for fucking a kid, not because they didn't follow the laws of a society they don't belong to.

******* I'm not sure how to make it any clearer. None of that is relevant to wizards. Our laws aren't some god-ordained rules. They're an abstract set of ideas our societies have agreed to follow and that's it. Wizards aren't obligated to follow them. And they don't. Saying they must is like saying an older sibling has to follow the rules their younger sibling lays down.

It's implied in canon that wizards have countries (Transylvania, Assyria) that don't even exist in the muggle world anymore. They don't give a shit for muggle laws or borders or whatever. If they can have their own countries that don't exist in the muggle world, go around Obliviating muggles, and even manipulate the minds of Presidents (Ch 1, HBP), then why in the world would the Conventions matter to them?

TL;DR: Do wizards live on muggle land or do muggles live on wizard land?

*** It's a bit hard to bring Snape to trial after he, well, died. Harry also obviously saw him as a hero in the end (he never saw him during Death Eater revels, only his general unpleasantness in school, and a selection of memories of his childhood chosen by Snape himself, portraying a poor abused kid being hurt by parents and school bullies -- which is easy to symphatize with for one who has experienced the same thing), and Harry, being the hero to Wizarding UK, has a huge influence over how people see things. Personally, while I wouldn't exactly regard him as a /hero/ (he is selfish, petty, cruel at times, a bully, has a nasty vindicative streak...), I feel that, as a spy, bringing him to justice for being a Death Eater alone (rather than based on what he might actually have done as one) isn't right.

I always figured Draco walked free due to Malfoy's monetary influence, similar to how Lucius got away with the Imperius in 1981?

**** To quote Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  A posthumous trial or post-mortem trial is a trial held after the defendant's death. Posthumous trials can be held for a variety of reasons, including the legal declaration that the defendant was the one who committed the crime, to provide justice for society of family members of the victims, or to exonerate a wrongfully convicted person after their death.
#+end_quote

Some sort of grand trial would be necessary to establish who did what during the war. Especially the Death Eaters, the Snatchers and the Ministry who supported Voldemort.

A good deed does not wash away a bad one. You don't get off murder charges because you saved an old lady from a burning home on your way out. Giving Voldemort the prophecy is conspiracy to commit murder at the very least.

That Unforgivable curses can't be blocked. Snape does so handily in his duel with Harry in HBP (along with blocking other curses).

In old-school MtG, like first or second gen, there were blue Interrupts that basically acted "faster than instantly" to disrupt opponents' actions. Snape was like that in canon. Harry didn't even finish his incantations before his spells were Noped.

Snape, one of two canon characters who could fly unaided, was a badass.
