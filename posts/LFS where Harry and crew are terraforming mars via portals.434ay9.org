*** Shit, that's right. I saw this years ago I think looking at the post I was thinking what the hell is this guy smoking. But it had everything to do with fairies and terrafarming mars through portals. There were acorns or something they had to send to the various planets to keep the fae from extinction.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, slash

** Was it perhaps linkffn(Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) ? It's not Mars that they terraform, but a lot of wizards (led by Harry) travel to several other planets and terraform at least one of them. Been a while since I read it so I don't remember all the details.
