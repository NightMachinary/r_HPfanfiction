After the second year, Harry starts seeking out all the people Lockhart had Obliviated. Using both the information from the books and Gilderoy's notes for books he intended to write, he finds people for whom he can provide treatment to restore their memories, as well as a way to get some well deserved credit. The result? Dozens of grateful and capable spellcasters from all over the world on Harry's side. Even if not always with the best fashion sense.


** By Year three Harry stablishes a Book Publisher and begins cranking out a series of anthologies recopilating the real events Lockhart stole as well as claiming rights over every Book written about him
