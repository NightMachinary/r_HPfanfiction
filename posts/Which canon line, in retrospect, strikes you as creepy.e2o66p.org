Saw a Twitter post recently that commented on Dumbledore's line in CoS that, if Harry had not shown him such loyalty, Fawkes would not have been able to rescue him. That made me start thinking...

There's an exchange in the very first chapter of the very first book, that at the time I didn't give any heavy significance. Knowing what I do now, at the end of the seventh book, it seems distinctly ominous.

"He'll have that scar for ever."\\
"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"\\
"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in useful."\\
(Bloomsbury paperback edition, page 11)

So, even if he could remove the horcrux, he wouldn't have. He'd already decided the course of Harry's life --- and death. This of course ties in to the fleeting glimpse of triumph in his eyes when Harry tells him about the ritual Voldie used to get a new body. Things were on track for his Greater Good plan.

(There was a recent discussion on fridge moments, but it turned into mostly fanfic references. I'm looking for canon references.)

Dumbledore planned Harry to find the Stone, knowing the effort might kill him. He also planned for Nicolas Flamel to die. But it's fine, he and Perenelle are old, it's just like going to bed!!!!

**** My own headcanon - rooted in the paltry amount of medieval alchemy I've read which I'm a thousand percent sure is more than JKR did - is that M. Flamel cheerfully handed over the stone because it's a complete red herring invented by writers who were not, themselves, alchemists.

There are alchemical procedures for halting and reversing ageing and curing all known disease. There are also alchemical procedures for transmutation of elements. None of these involve the stone (the making of which used to be a test for students, synthetic ruby with late medieval lab gear is a /challenge/) and the elixir, on the historical record, was a wound powder (from the arabic 'al iksir', lit. 'the dust') whose mass market descendant you can buy for your first aid kit as Celox.

Anyway.

NIcholas keeps a lump of synthetic ruby worth about fifty quid in a safe in his office to distract thieves from stealing anything actually /valuable/. The one he gives Dumbledore to 'guard' is one he cooked up out of the aluminium in his recycling bin just for that purpose.

The affairs he's setting in order are establishing a new identity in another country and staging a fake funeral while quietly and ruefully enduring the 'I told you so' comments from Perenelle, who has always been of the view that Dumbledore was taking advantage of Nicholas's geniality and generosity and will he now stop complaining about all the other alchemists blackballing Dumbledore from the Invisible College?

I don't agree that this is an indicator that Dumbledore meant for Harry to go after the stone. He's simply remarking that Harry/Ron/Hermione were thorough in their attempt to find out what was hidden there and protect it. I think that most people are completely wrong that Dumbledore meant for Harry to go after the stone and are viewing the story as if it were written for adults. It's one thing to write a fanfiction and explore the things that happen in the series, but at the end of the day, in the real world, it's a children's story.

***** This is exactly what I meant when I said many people "are viewing the story as if it were written for adults." It's a children's story. There's no ulterior motives to Dumbledore's actions that early on in the series. When he, or other adult characters, act in a way that seems incompetent like that it's not because they have a secret motive, it's because the children need to be the heroes. JKR had Dumbledore hide it in the school behind a series of tests so laughably easy that children could get through them because she needed her child characters to be able to get through them. If Dumbledore had acted in a competent manner, there wouldn't have been a story to tell. This isn't unique to Harry Potter.

That's also what I mean by "in the real world, it's a children's story." If you're writing a fanfiction or examining a work of fiction purely within the context of the fictional world, then it's a (possibly) reasonable answer to Dumbledore's actions to propose that he meant for Harry to go after the stone, but when you're asking from a real world perspective and using all of the information available to you, you need to keep in mind how the author's intentions cause the story to develop.

They don't seem to believe people should even have the choice.

To be fair, Voldemort is taking that search for immortality into a stupid extreme where he clearly cares about literally no one else's well being and so is killing other people willy-nilly to do it, which is pretty unequivocally evil. But Dumbledore always speaks as if the most twisted thing about Tom is that he's cheated his way out of death instead of the, you know, killing and torturing people thing.

Fics with manipulative Dumbledore often go overboard and into parody and crack. But, damn, canon Dumbledore still left a baby on a doorstep in November to abusive relatives for 10 years. Sure, he makes an excuse about wards, but we're never shown or told if and when these wards actually repelled an attack. Why Harry continues to believe in him and follow him after this is beyond me. Ah, yes, there it is:

Which, if they'd done it in the non-wizarding system would carry anything up to five years in jail. Dumbledore can lay down for them the penalty from the magical side of things, whatever seems appropriate to the purpose. Possibly mentioning that his father became quite notorious for torturing three muggles to death while he's about it. They're still choosing to take Harry in and treat him right, it's just that the alternative has become choosing to be, eg., turned into a family of monkeys and donated to Chessington Zoo. They have a free choice either way.

The Dursleys abused Harry because there were no consequences - nothing in canon clears the extremely high bar for criminal prosecution at that time, and the civil side of child protection flat out didn't have the budget at the time and wasn't even getting to all the kids who were being beaten to death. Dumbledore merely has to supply the consequences that law enforcement and child protection social workers can't.

  ‚ÄúAt the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country.

  ‚ÄúThe Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?‚Äù Harry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks's parents' garden.

  ‚ÄúWhat you've got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,‚Äù said Lupin.

  ‚ÄúThey've got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we'd cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they'd come.‚Äù

Does Bellatrix strike you as someone who tried to hide her actions? Does Voldemort? You saw how easily Dumbledore could subdue his arrest squad, and V is his equal but does not have to hold back because he doesn't care if he kills someone. He could kill the entire Ministry in a single afternoon if he wanted to.

Maybe the second-line Death Eater cares due to lacking skill, but not Voldemort or his enforcers.

********************** Bellatrix sure, she barely did anything since she killed sirius except for the battle of Hogwarts.

Ans Voldemort himself makes clear at the beginning of the book that he is wary of Scrimgeour and doesn't want to face him until he has him surrounded.

** Even if he didn't know about Horcruxes when he left Harry with the Dursleys, he had to know that there was ~something~ in his scar. After all, there is no way that baby Harry wasn't examined to check for injuries, magical or otherwise (maybe Pomphrey, for security reasons). If he wasn't, then the fact that an obviously senile old man was responsible for a school gives me the real shivers.

Snape's "Always" feels straight out of some creepypasta too. Wouldn't suprise me if he had some of Lily's hair and possessions arranged in a shrine somewhere.

*** He probably did know something was up with the scar, given the "the dark lord shall Mark him as his equal" line in the prophecy. But that honestly makes it sound like the scar is going to be beneficial. It seems likely Dumbledore was taking a "wait and see" approach.

Though he did say "even if I could." And given what we know about horcruxes he probably didn't have the ability to remove one without killing harry anyway.
