As the title suggests, I'm bored out of my mind and have too much time so let me know what was the best m/m fic you've read.

My top two are:-

1. Turn by sara's girl (Draco & Harry)
2. Death of Today by Epic Solemnity (Voldemort & Harry)

Thanks in advance :-)


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]])

Something to maybe interest you until someone with more knowledge of this niche comes along.

This is just what I turned up with a quick search, seems relatively well received though.

Sorry if it isn't quite what you are looking for.
