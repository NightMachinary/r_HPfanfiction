  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

I don't know how you can, everytime a birthday or christmas was coming I managed to know what the present was before I even got there

Eleven year olds don't buy diamond necklaces to their girlfriends of a few months

And tell me if your parents would be fine with you marrying someone at twelve because they're nice, or would they be fine with that someone kissing you at 11 and not saying anything?

If you're a girl that is, if not then do you think the girl's parents would be fine making a wedding for twelve year olds who are serious about it?

****** First of all the stories are not real and therefore have no need to be related to real life. From your comments its obvious that your preference is for stories that at least link to real life in terms of how an 11 yr old would react. Time travel stories at least give you an explanation for why an 11 yr old character acts way more mature (eg 20 yr old, 30 yr old, 140 yr old, 200+ yr old, etc) who either goes back in time themselves or whose older memories merge with their younger selves.

For a lot of fics (especially super!harry, independent!harry, etc) the character is written way more mature than some 40 yr olds i know. And there is not a good explanation of why. (The standard wizards/witches mature faster than mundanes doesn't really cut it especially when the maturity level is off the charts).

For those stories that have excessively mature young characters I simply ignore the ages and focus on the writing. Eg how well are the characters developed, is the premise/plot of the story enjoyable, how well are the interactions between the characters developed, and do the reactions of the older characters to the younger characters make sense or at least explained for why they react in ways that wouldn't occur in real life.

Eg. I know of no real parent that would be happy with their 11 yr old child in a mature relationship.

In my opinion the story Luna's Hubby by Meteroricshipyards is a good example. In the story a 7 yr old decides she wants Harry to be her husband. So she goes and rescues him. The parents initial reaction is like any other cute little girl "declaring" her "relationship". When she keeps calling harry her husband she's told that he can't be her husband because they haven't had a wedding on said their vows. So like a lot of little kids they say their vows but in this case magic accepts. Now while the characters aren't excessively mature they are still way more mature than a normal kid

******* Oh I know that fic, it's actually explained semi well atleast in the beginning, (luna is being luna and harry is confused)

I don't think I could just focus on the writing in any fic, I love to notice the plot and try to predict the future of the plot, I hate anything that is way too obvious in the plot.

Those fics where Harry acts like a 50 year old when he's eleven because he read a few books on wizarding culture and how to act, I absolutely hate them.

Most types of time travel I can easily take, mainly because of the fact that the age that is seen is not the same as he/she really is, that's why I can take the overload in maturity.

Yes I'd rather take an awkward very knowledgeable 11 year old than a god!harry that knows everything and acts suave and charming immediately after getting rid of the dursleys for a few months.

  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.
