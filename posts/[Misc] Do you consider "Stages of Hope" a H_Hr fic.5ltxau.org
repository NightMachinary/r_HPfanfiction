Disclaimer: I don't mind either way, just wanted to know your view.

I know Harry and Hermione seem to be the main characters in this story, but are they romantically involved or just have a really strong friendship? I ask because tho the summary implies no pairings, I've often seen the fic recommended in Harmony threads in this sub. I'm trying to read something other than old Harmony fics - you can only do rereads so many times, after all, but they're still 2 of my favorite characters in the series, regardless of their relationship with each other in FFN. Thanks for the help x


** I can't imagine either of them getting into a relationship with anyone else, they are so close.

** Yes, it wouldn't take much for these severely traumatized people to get together.

The reason they didn't get together in the story was because Harry was convinced he had to die and had no future. They were also in mourning over their previous loves (Ron and Ginny). Such a process usually takes a few years.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** Yes and no.

It is and it isn't.

On the one hand, Hermione and Harry spend a great deal of time grieving their former partners, and it's clear that they're still haunted and feel like they've lost part of themselves. There's no indication that the relationships were flawed or that Hermione could be better for Harry than Ginny was. And there's no open declarations of romantic love or signs that either might have developed romantic feelings for the other.

However, Harry and Hermione have been through an extremely traumatic ordeal. The trio were already extremely tight, and Hermione and Harry have basically become codependent. And that codependence has obviously tightened the bond between Harry/Hermione, and softened some of the traits that made them incompatible.

For example, there's a bit where Hermione tells Harry to eat slower (after barely eating over the past week) for fear that he'll make himself sick.

In canon, Hermione spends plenty of time nagging Harry, and he usually doesn't handle it well. Hermione monitoring Harry's eating habits is pretty in-character, as is Harry's visible annoyance. What's more unusual is Harry's response. Canon Harry generally prefers to ignore, avoid, or lie to Hermione when she's trying to nag him. If that doesn't work, he will explode at her, often without really warning her that she's pushing him to his limit.

But in this scene, Harry's response is much more measured.

#+begin_quote
  "I understand what you're going through and that you need to reassure your control, Hermione," said Harry calmly, sounding more intelligent and understanding than he had the whole evening. "But I don't really need you to count my calories right now. I know how to eat."
#+end_quote

Given Harry's tendency to bottle up his feelings, his issues with authority, and his inate stubbornness, for him to calmly acknowledge Hermione's perspective then verbalize his own feelings is actually kind of a huge deal.

When Hermione continues to push the issue, he still doesn't get angry or ignore her, he calmly reminds her that he's a big boy and asks her to trust him. So Hermione apologizes for overstepping, and they move on.

When I read this scene, I don't see two people who were written in the stars to be together. I see two people who are still in many ways fundamentally incompatible, but who have become so close that they're able to bridge the gap. The bond between them comes not from mutual understanding but from a willingness to try to understand.

I absolutely think that they could end up in a relationship together. But they will always be each other's consolation prize.

** It is in my opinion one of the greatest Romances in the fandom. Now don't get me wrong, I know that by word of god they never 'Hook up' but that doesn't seem important to me. The truly important aspects: love, intimacy, trust, and fear. They are all in the story, and delivered better in the friendship then any 'Romance' fiction I have read in this fandom.

The only contender is 'Grow Young With Me' and that story is very much helped by the fact that so far it's fallowing the beats of a romance story.

**** I don't think there's a sequel, but most say the fic can be read as a story of deep, platonic friendship, or as a pre-relationship H/Hr fic where they get together sometime after the end of the fic. It's up to the reader, really.

** No. It's a deep friendship, but both of them are massively damaged people. If they ever get into a relationship again, it will be after a long while of healing and then probably with someone who has no connection to the war in any way. Neville and Luna might be fine though.

It is one of the best Potterfics out there in any case and by any measure.
