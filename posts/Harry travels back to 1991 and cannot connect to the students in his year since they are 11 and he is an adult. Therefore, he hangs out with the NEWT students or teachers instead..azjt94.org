  do you think he would resent her for leaving the child and fight or not?
#+end_quote

No. If the battle is lost, her and Teddy are doomed to be executed or deported to Azkaban (which is not that different). Fighting was a horrible choice, but it was the best out of many horrible decisions she could have made if you disregard simply leaving (since that would be the obvious thing to do for the entire Order if they are unwilling to fight for real). He might, however, resent her for taking Lupin back or marrying him in the first place since Lupin has a lot of issues, but that is a different debate.

******* Shipping the people around you based on an alternate dimension/timeline is a really psycho thing to do. And let me elaborate why "they were the parents of X" would not work if you want to ensure X exists.

Basically, you would have to ensure that the same sperm and egg get together. Even if you exclude the randomness of cell division, the guy would have to come the exact same number of times he did in the original timeline to deliver the same sperm cell at the right time into the right egg. They would also have to fuck exactly the same way to ensure the right swimmer makes it. You see why this is getting very close to statistically impossible, right? And even if you get that part right, unless the child grows up exactly as it did in the OG universe, it will not be the same. Which would mean doing everything as it happened before, rendering the whole time-travel moot.

You could, of course, settle for a similar child, but that's not what the average time traveller does.

  actually, I always feel weird about time travelers getting together with their loved person
#+end_quote

Oh boy, grooming is its own can of worms. Let's just say that it would be nearly impossible to not do it on an subconscious level while regularly interacting with them. The only way you can pull that off without being creepy would be to have the love interest older, but that also makes it weird since now they are the ones attracted to a child. And given the overall premise of the HP series, most time travel falls within the Hogwarts years, so adult travellers aren't really a good solution either.

Last time I checked, fathers generally do not lactate. And while there are substitutes, IIRC it does not make for the same bonding experience for the child. Nor does artificial milk include the same bacteria and so on. That can result in a weaker immune system.

** Hm that's very specific. Is a general feeling of alienation/isolation enough?

Backwards without purpose sort of has this... If I remember right:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12023166]])

Also he's quite isolated and removing himself in Returning to the Start. I think. But this one gets recced quite a lot around here and you definitely know it already:

**** Oh alright, not to derail your thread, but how would that even work? An 11-12 year old will never ever *ever* be accepted as one of the peers of 17-18 year olds. No matter how grown up and cool mentally.

***** They may not see him as a *peer* per se, at least not at first, but in my personal experience, /friendship/ at the very least /is/ possible. Granted, in my experience (from both the younger and the older position) there were definite maturity differences (because none of us are actually time travelers) and yet there was still friendship and respect. It would take time, but with Harry's increased maturity, I believe he could eventually be accepted as a peer by NEWT students (I especially see the Revenclaws and Hufflepuffs accepting him).

***** Eh. I dunno'.

Have Harry tear it up on the quidditch pitch. Show him being confident and witty among a crowd of the older students. Have him get into a fight with a bigoted 7th year Slytherin and kick his ass to the hospital wing.

Do that, and I'm pretty sure there are a certain type of people who would be happy to hang out with this ridiculous kid. The Boy-Who-Lived, no less.

  A re-do story full of cliches and cussing. I dislike the Weasley family in general and Ron in specific, so you may want to pass if he's your hero. Adult, Auror Harry is thrown back to his 10 year old body. What does he do? Kick @ and take names, of course. Rating is for the recounting of crimes by a Very Bad Man.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
