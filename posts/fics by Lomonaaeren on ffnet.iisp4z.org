I recently started going through Lomonaaeren's fics on ao3 and binge reading the ones that catch my interest, and I read a story ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/400822][Blood, Flesh, Silence]]) that had no sequels on ao3, but I saw a comment saying that it had two sequels on ffnet. Looking for those, I realized that this author has 585 fics on ao3 and 598 on ffnet, so, obviously, they have more fics on ffnet, but I frankly cannot use ffnet properly anymore (ao3's filtering system spoiled me lol), so I have no idea how to find those without going through all nearly 600 fics again. if you have read any story by them that you know hasn't been cross-posted on ao3, could you please recommend them to me? (also, idk if I'm using the right flair, I'm not very experienced in using reddit, sorry if it's wrong, and english is not my first language either)


** command f and then some keywords works for me.

*** Here you go! Ao3's linking of fics in a series is one of its major advantages over ffn, in my opinion. Usually on ffn, I end up going to the author's profile and sorting by date updated, since usually the next fic in a series will be written around the same time frame as the first and will be nearby in that list.
