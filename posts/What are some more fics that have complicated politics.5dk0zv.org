It's easy to write a fic where Light is good, Dark is evil, and the heroic Order of the Phoenix defeats the villainous Death Eaters (no thanks to the inept Ministry). It's also easy to write an ~edgy~ fic that starts with a small complaint about the light side---Dumbledore let the Dursleys abuse Harry, Muggles used to burn witches at the stake, the Cutting Curse can kill people too---and ends up with a Harry Potter whose body count is higher than Voldemort's.

I'm looking for fics with more complicated political situations. Probably darker than the canon books, since those began for young children, but not on the level of "Harry joins Voldemort and enjoys Crucio-ing his enemies". I'm totally okay with non-canon elaborations, or even an AU society, for the sake of keeping issues less black and white.

(Lots of political issues in the wizarding world have a naturally [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][blue and orange morality]]. House elves may be enslaved, but they really want to work for a wizarding family. Goblins don't have the right to carry wands, but their concepts of property and who knows what else don't match those of wizards, and they've rebelled violently in the past. Werewolves are unreasonably shunned for 27 days, but on the 28th they're compelled to attack people and spread their curse, and the Wolfsbane Potion may remove the compulsion but not the ability. Dark magic is focused on harm and sacrifice, but it's what the Aurors resorted to for the sake of taking down Death Eaters; and does light magic have ways to prevent death, or create a new body? These are not historical issues with "elf" substituted for "black" or "wand" substituted for "gun", they're fictional problems with their own pros and cons. The sides in the Wizengamot are not trivial satires of Parliament or the Senate.)

I've already read:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]]: "Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters." Politics that aren't just background to Dumbledore and Voldemort's war of good versus evil. The best recommendation I could get would be "Amends just updated, here's a new chapter".
- [[http://www.hpmor.com][Methods of Rationality]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits][Significant Digits]]: HPMoR is an original example of the "[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic?from=Main.RationalFiction][rationalfic]]" genre, which prioritizes coherent worldbuilding and sensible motives for both the protagonists and antagonists. The sequel (well, one of the sequels, plenty of people have written fanfic of the fanfic) goes deeper into constructing a magical /world/, with multiple magical nations that each have their own cultures and interests.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]: Harry was blinded by the Killing Curse; Hermione was crippled by the troll. Neither can attend Hogwarts. Outside of Dumbledore's influence, they become powerful figures in politics and magic on their own.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc series]]: a seven-part AU where Harry's brother is the famous Boy Who Lived, and Harry is trained to devote his life to guarding him. It's long, and dark, and deals with the politics of how a democratic Ministry can coexist with wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort, whose power vastly outclasses normal citizens; not to mention how /any/ wizards get along with werewolves, house elves, and other magical creatures.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird's Son]]: a trilogy AU where magical humans are less similar, both culturally and biologically, to Muggles; and witches and wizards also have significant differences. Lots of weird gender- and magic-related politics, in the sense that you can't draw obvious parallels with real-world gender issues.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]]: The Dursleys abandon Harry on a street, and he's taken in by a man who leads a gang of Muggle children. Plenty of differing opinions on Muggle-wizard relations, from the Order, the Death Eaters, the Ministry, the Muggles, and Harry.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]]: "Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future." In canon Dumbledore's Order was the "moral center", not the Ministry, and here there's no convenient pre-Voldemort's-return setup where the Minister listens to his advice.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]]: Hermione is Sorted into Slytherin. She doesn't become a stereotypical out-of-character evil witch, but she /does/ fit into the house of the cunning and ambitious. No spoilers, but I will say that Tom Riddle's plans turn out to have been more complex than "Muggles and Mudbloods should die". And the light side is not 100% unified and politically correct either.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]: Harry is Sorted into Slytherin. Again, he doesn't become a stereotypical out-of-character evil wizard---he still wants to defeat Voldemort, and mostly cooperates with Dumbledore---but he's also a genuine Slytherin, and his House isn't full of two-dimensional blood purist bigots.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10654712/1/Lady-of-the-Lake][Lady of the Lake]]: "Hermione and Draco team up after the war to overthrow the Order and take over wizarding Britain." Pessimistic to the point of character bashing about the Order's post-war conduct... but non-fictionally, if the government was overthrown by one group of outlaws, and then their leader was killed by /another/ group of outlaws who set up their own preferred leader, it probably wouldn't be much of an improvement for the average citizen.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]]: Ginny died in the Chamber of Secrets, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all changed by it. Not really a "political intrigue" story, but there is thoughtful magical worldbuilding, and the explanation for the Triwizard "binding magical contract" hinges on international relations instead of the usual "it somehow removes all your magic".
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1742156/1/Moon-and-Stone][Moon and Stone]]: more history than politics; a contrarian re-imagining (that's still compliant with what's shown in the books) of what happened between Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor.


** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom). The political side of this fic does take a while to really get going but one thing I love about it is that there is no clear good or evil. Voldemort's created society actually seems to work quite well (although he still does plenty of morally questionable things) and people like Dumbledore and the order of the phoenix members on the side of "good" are more like the antagonists at times. It's quite an AU with lots of focus on world building and magic, although the tone is fairly light and humourous at times with lots of action (even though the description makes it sound super dark for some reason)

** Well. I had a list, but all of them have already been mentioned except for linkffn(Again and Again by Athey)

Yes, it's a slash fic, but there's only like 2-3 actual smut scenes, and they are well marked. It's a do-over fic, and Harry is big in politics, so it goes in depts into the House of Commons and House of Lords, the seats and designations, how Dark magic is defined and how the political climate of the time influenced that definition... it's really interesting.

*** Oh, she's the same author as [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/272696][Descent Into Darkness]]! (abandoned [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/272706][sequel]]) Read that a long time ago, it was very much on the "Harry enjoys Crucio-ing his enemies" end of the scale, but hey, that's what I was reading it for. :P (It's a good depiction of why Dark magic has its bad reputation: it's basically a drug. You can get addicted to the feeling of casting horribly cruel curses. IIRC Harry started using Dark magic to get through the Triwizard Tournament, and ended up as Lord Voldemort's lover.) I don't have a problem with slash; thanks for the rec.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Linkffn(Renegade Cause) has one of the most complex, twisted plots in HP fanfic. Lots of politicking involving lots of OCs, so perhaps not everyone's cup of tea. Also, after rereading recently I have to it hasn't aged as well as some of my other favorites (first of all, it's too long at 500k words), but still top shelf fan fiction.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
