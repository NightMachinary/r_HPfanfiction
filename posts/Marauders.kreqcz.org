Just started getting into fan fics and was wondering if there are any good ones based on the marauders and Lily?


** linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89)

This is the best Marauder story. It's grown to a cultfic at this point but it deserves it. The characters are wonderful and really grow thoughout the book. The OCs are marvellous. It's completely cannon compliant so it fits right into the Harry Potter world. It's charming and heartbreaking and adorable and you'll cry as often as you laugh. Simply wonderful.

If your looking for a Jily fic particularly, linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) I think is the big one. The narration is wonderful. Its tense and dramatic and longing and really great!

After that there's loads of stories to go for. The Majestic Dolphin on ffnet does some Marauder oneshots that are like just mini headcannons written out but they're good insights into different characters. linkffn(The Stag in the Shack)

There's a series called 'The Rise and Fall of MWPP' that is veeery good. A collection of stories. linkao3(The Marauders Wagers) is particularly funny!

Marie Kavanagh on Ao3 does a lot of Black family stories of Sirius growing up which are a brilliant insight into his history. A deeper look into the Black family without being bashing or abusive.

If there's a particular trope or story you'd like to see them ask. I read a lot of Marauder stories so I probably know something. Otherwise I'd recommend All The Young Dudes ðŸ˜Š

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

  Each of the Marauders supports a different team in the British and Irish Quidditch League, which leads to a series of increasingly ridiculous wagers on matches over the course of their years at Hogwarts.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

  Looking around the Shrieking Shack for the first time, James felt the blissful naivety fall away from him like rain... James goes to scope out the shack, ensuring all 3 Animagus and a werewolf will be able to fit. He realises, for the first time, he has never truly understood what it means to be a werewolf. And what they were trying to save Remus from... A OneShot.

** linkffn(Crazy Little Thing Called Love by Breanie)

Warning, there's a rape scene straight off the bat so if that makes you feel uncomfortable then don't read it. However it plays an integral part to the plot and other than that the story is amazing. 9/10

  Lily Potter has second thoughts about hiding her family in Godric's Hollow. The alternative she chooses turns out to be nothing short of brilliant. One-shot.
