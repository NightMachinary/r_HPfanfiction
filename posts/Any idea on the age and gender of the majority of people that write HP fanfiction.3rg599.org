Just a little curious.


** It's obviously a narrow subset of the fandom and not representative of the demographics of FF.Net, but DLP did a survey this year.

Results are here:

[[http://dlpsurvey.krzaq.cc/]]

Now I think about it, I could easily adapt this survey for this sub... diversify some of the HP questions to be less DLP-centric, remove some of the stuff the denizens of this sub would find more offensive...

Watch this space.

*** I think this illustrates how hard it is to get accurate demographics for the whole fandom. DLP is overwhelmingly male, but if you look at, say, tumblr or livejournal, they're probably mostly female.

It would be interesting to see that kind of survey here, though.

** I'd say teenagers and young adults but the fandom is getting older everyday. It's mostly women though.

** I'd say with gender it's 60/40 female/male. The old stereotype about fanfic writers all being female is old and outdated.

** Considering the nuance, grammar and characters that I see in most of the junk I read, I'd say late teens/mid 20s women with a side of creepy basement dweller men masturbating over Tonks.

** For HP fanfiction I would guess that it's all a bit 50/50 between genders, and mostly younger than 30 y/o. But for, lets say Twilight, its mostly young'ish females.

*** I highly doubt it is 50/50 for HP. It's probably 80/20, with 80% being women. The 60k HG/DM fics (mostly written by women) is not balanced by the 771 HP/FD fics.

**** .... that is probably the case. They have experience, they have a sense of what passes for a good plot, they have pretty much the skill-set of experienced writers. For example, Inverarity is 47-48 years old (I'm not entirely sure), and he has the best writing of anyone in the fandom.

That would make sense. I can find /maybe/ ten or twenty heterosexual pairings in that fandom that aren't EdwardxBella. For HPxTwi crossovers, that same amount for any pairing, period.
