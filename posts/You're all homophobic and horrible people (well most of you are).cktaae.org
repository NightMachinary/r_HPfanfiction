** 34000 subscribers. 400 online at the moment. Probably 2-6 downvotes per post on those slash reqs, with maybe 20 for particularly accusatory posts.

Don't ascribe traits to the majority for the actions of a small but volatile minority, please.

** I doubt it's driven solely by homophobia, but rather on personal tastes and opinions and that's okay. Not preferring to read stories about gay characters isn't homophobic imo

*** Yes but with most people that dislike is driven but their dislike for home sexual pairings. Which is homophobia.

**** Not necessarily. Say I don't like reading stories about, say, gardeners, because I don't like plants and thus the trials and tribulations of plant-lovers trying to grow a beautiful garden leave me cold, that doesn't mean I'm /prejudiced/ against gardeners.

Homophobia would be acting like slash is /wrong/ and trying to stop people from writing or enjoying it because you don't think it should exist; but not wanting to read it is just a matter of tastes. Just as there are people who don't want to read shipping in general, whether gay or not.

Now, what [[/u/Bleepbloopbotz2]] said about people only ever wheeling out this argument for /male/male/ gay relationships, but not lesbian ones, is a very fair point. But the issue in this case is the fetishization of lesbians by straight males, not the perfectly acceptable statement of "I'm not interested in reading romances not involving people whom I could fantasize about romancing myself", which is a perfectly valid take on how to relate to romances.

****** That is fair enough, I suppose, but then your quarrel is with the way people downvote in general. There have been many, many, /many/ attempts to get people to understand they're supposed to downovte a comment if it is /unhelpful/, rather than because /they/ dislike its content /personally/. None of them have ever worked.

**** If I dislike vegetables am I a vegetaphobiac then? Or if I don't like reading bash stories am I a bashaphobiac? Your argument makes no sense.
