As the title says I need something to pass the time. Preferebly something lite like fluff and no slash.(don‘t have anything against homosexuell coupels, but I just don‘t swing that way.)


** Try this one for size

linkao3(The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights)

It's marauder era and pretty damn good (especially at capturing the teen atmosphere), at least IMO. There might be some slash in later installments but they're not up yet, and the first only has minor m/f.
