Being driven into madness by looking at Lily's eyes from his archnemesis's body, Snape performed a relatively unknown ritual on an unwilling Harry that replaced all of James's traits with Severus's. That is to say, the ritual makes Harry a clone of Snape with the sole difference being that he has Lily's eyes.


** Harry promptly commits "patricide" and because of his status, the fact that everyone hated Snape's guts, and after what was done to him, he basically gets a "slap on the wrist".

Snape is dying with the satisfaction of knowing that any kids Harry has will be Snapes (in blood), than Potters, and the Potter line is dead.

Harry promptly bursts that bubble just as Snape dies when he says "phew, it's good I knocked up xx a month ago, then!"
