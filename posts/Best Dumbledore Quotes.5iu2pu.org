Post here any quotes from Dumbledore that you have come across in fanfiction that interest you or you think are particularly cool/scary etc.

I'll start with this passage from [[http://keiramarcos.com/2013/11/harrys-mentor/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond by Keira Marcos]], a very AU (and IMO very good fic). Dumbledore is about to referee a duel between Krum and Harry and says this:

#+begin_quote
  "Very well," Dumbledore said gravely. "As the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, I have blanket diplomatic immunity across the globe. That should interest you both because I will say this - if either of you cast an Unforgivable today - I will deliver it on you without remorse." He stared pointedly at Viktor whose mouth dropped open. "That means, Mr. Krum, if you cast the Killing Curse at Lord Potter - I will kill you. Do you understand?"
#+end_quote

I think this is a good portrayal of a Dumbledore who is not afraid to throw his power around to intimidate others.

So now I'll open this up to the rest of you. Any quotes from Dumbledore that you particularly like for one reason or another?

** Not a pure Dumbledore quote, but there is this sequence from Wayfarer2000's Crosswind Of Fate that I really liked:

***** you could have linked the story. It's impossible to see the text on mobile and looks like crap on pc too but that's mostly the fault of the story itself imo.

****** Looks fine on my end(24in 1920x1200, 14in 1920x1080, 5.5in 1080x1920), Fireshot-taken pictures tend to be a bit blurry when combined with Windows's DPI scaling, but I've used it for a long time to take screencap of long pages, and you're the first one that's said anything about it having readability issues.

Actually, come to think of it, viewing it on low resolution screen may be the problem, since full zoom will get you like 4 words per line and it'll look like crap zoomed out because of interpolation.
