** I read it a while back. Good fic, but I don't think it's a masterpiece. Maybe I should have another go at it.

**** That trope is among my favorites, actually. Problem is, bad!Lily/James usually doesn't stick well for me. There have been exceptions to that though.

***** Fair Enough. I tend to enjoy misery of others(fictional) so bad!Lily/James is for me. That being said, this fic failed at making a good Bad!Lily/James element. They were more or less there to further the plot

*** Fair enough. Circular Reasoning is an amazing fic. Easily one of my favorites. That being said, I enjoy To Young To Die just a tad bit more.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
