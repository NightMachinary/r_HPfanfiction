Basically I search for Canon Complaint fics that would have been Canon if not for that thing that changes the the story.

Exemples: -Pettigrew doesn't escape -Sirius doesn't go to Azkaban -Sirius doesn't die -Lupin meets harry before his 11th birthday and explain things to him -Dudley is a mugle born ...

Even more extreme things :

-Lilly, James or both are alive -the Dursley are pro magic - Harry is bigger/younger than Canon -Snape didn't overhear the prophecy ...

Basically the story has to follow Canon rules but with a different plot,

I DON'T WANT a story that changes things but than still makes everything Canon (stupid exemple: Hermione is already friendly with Ron and Harry or already has friends in general, but she still is somewhat crying alone in the bathroom waiting for the troll),

NO OOC characters if not following some logical changes is the story, (Ex: If the Dursley didn't hate magic or abuse Harry it's logical to think that Harry has to have a different personality from Canon. The opposite a non bullied non abused but still canon Harry is a big NO)

No strange fanon magics or powers or OC characters that comes out of nowhere without logic or deus exmachina things.

Magic has to follow canon rules, new original things are fine If in part of the story unexplored in Canon (runes, artimancy...)

NO slash. if the story isn't heavily focused on a romantic plot I'm fine with any pairing, but if it is please warn me of the main pairing of the story as I can't stand some and I'll inevitably forget some if I make a list.

And just to make everything clear: is HAS to be the kind of story that you could mistake for Canon if you didn't know any better. Following one of my exemples: Pettigrew did not escape Sirius is freed the story starts form there, and continue in a way where it could fool someone that thats truly what JKR wrote after the prisoner of Azkaban.

Is fine even if the plot has nothing to do with Canon plot has long has the characters are not denatured and the logic and rules behind the story are still canon ( has long has it's the plot and not the word building is fine) HOWEVER there still has to be a clear event that starts this totally different plot.

Ex: Voldemort attack the longbottom Neville is BWL, if done well could be fine, but both his, Harry's and the plot in general have to be logical effects of this premise.

The MOST IMPORTANT thing is consistance to Canon characterization rules and logic.

Thanks for reading my incredibly long list of requirements, and thanks in advance for all the suggestions.

** I'm really recommending this a lot lately, but "Hogwarts Houses Divided," which takes place eleven years after the Battle of Hogwarts, is so damn near the tone and feel of canon that I could have been fooled; the only real divergence is that a certain Theodore Lupin is Sorted into Gryffindor (because this fic was written before we got the info that he was a Hufflepuff in canon).

The new students, and a few of the teachers, are mostly OCs, but pretty much all the canon characters appear, in bigger or smaller roles, and they're all pretty much perfectly characterised. This is the sort of fic I could see happening during the nineteen-year gap, easily.

It's also a /really good story/. I still think it's one of the best HP fanfics I've ever read.

linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided)

Almost as close, but not quite, is the "Weasley Girl" series. It's an AU where the change is that Ron Weasley was born a girl and given the name Veronica. It starts out with the scene where Harry's about to meet the Weasleys for the first time at King's Cross, and sort of goes from there.

The tone and feel is very close to canon, and the characters feel like the canon ones... (There's apparently been a few complaints that Snape is a little too nasty, but I think he seems perfectly IC.) The Fem!Ron is a little different, obviously; there's a lot of canon Ron in her but she's definitely her own person.

The plot, though... pretty much goes off the rails straight away. A lot of canon events still happen, but because the Weasley dynamic is different, Harry's experiences are different, and different reactions lead to different plot developments. Around the first Halloween things go off in their own direction... but in a way that you (or at least I) think "Yeah, I can see how that could have happened in the canon world."

It's not AS good as "Hogwarts Houses Divided," but it's still pretty good.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First story in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** linkffn(Secret Keeper by ermalope) If Dumbledore made Snape the secret keeper to Lily's and James home. Everyone is in character and the fic is canon consistent other than that one change.

linkffn(Percy take the wheel) Molly Weasly is killed in an accident that puts her husband in a coma and its up to Percy to take charge of his family so that they are not split up. This fic is a WIP, but interesting so far.

linkffn(The changeling) Ginny is sorted into slytherin. The style of writing is quite different from JKR but the fic is canon consistent of what could happen if Ginny was sorted into a different house. Does have some mild Harry/Ginny pairing moments I believe later on, but it's a very small part of fic.
