** Linkffn(Earl of the North)

It's Harry/Bellatrix. It's an okay fic, I guess.

There's also one where Tonks goes back in time at the end of Harry's 5th year and attends Hogwarts pretending to be a 15 year old. It's Harry/Tonks obviously. I forgot the name though.

Edit: It's linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in an Hourglass)

*** Both of these stories are mediocre at best, but this was an incredibly specific ask, and it's a sign of the amazing diversity of the fandom that they exist at all.

*** Earl of the North would have been a much better story if the author had more experience when writing it.

I really liked the premise, though my jaded judgement these days really works against my once amiable opinion of the story.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
