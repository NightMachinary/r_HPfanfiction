** Too young to die is a very good story about Slytherin mentoring him. I don't know if he's directly descended, but Slytherin calls him his heir.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
