I've tried reloading the page and restarting my device, but it shows a blank screen every chapter any reason why?


** I'm having the same issue, I guess it's a sign that I should go to sleep instead of reading another chapter lol

** Go to [[http://www.isitdownrightnow.com][www.isitdownrightnow.com]] and copy-paste the story URL, or even just enter the FFNet web address. That should tell you now, and any time in the future.

** Ffn has been buggy for a while now, but the app still works fine. And, of course, fiction press hasn't said anything on the matter.

** Have you tried clearing your cookie cache of FFNet cookies? Apparently that might help with blank screen issues.

I, like Franken10, am not having blank screen issues and I just quickly flicked through a 30 chapter story to test it.
