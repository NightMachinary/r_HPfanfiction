** /Better than almost all of the other fanfic places./

I know it's fun to hate on this sub, I've even felt this way a few times. However compared to other fanfic communities I've participated in, this place shines.

- (almost) everyone is welcome. This is not actually an industry standard. Most FF communities have strict guidelines, either expressly stated or developed over time like invisible walls, about the kind of content you can post/request.

- It's not an echo chamber. Sure there are "factions" that gravitate towards certain views, but you can disagree to your heart's content. Sure, you might get downvoted, but if your skin is even a little thickened, that won't stop you at all. You can still post weekly about why Dobby/Aragog is the OTP, or why all purebloods should be executed with a desert eagle by ninja!Harry. And that's a beautiful thing.

- The mods are barely seen or heard. I can't stress how much of a good thing that is. In most communities mods have an overbearing presence that can actually hinder participation.

- It's vibrant. Most of the other FF places have either stagnated, been abandoned or have grown terribly bloated (Spacebattles comes to mind). This community has a good amount of users, it's not small enough to be in danger of disappearing, nor large enough to feel impersonal.

- It's always on flux. Users are leaving, new ones are entering. You can participate as much, or as little, as you want. This, again, prevents stagnation.

*** I don't quite like Ron but his Character did take quite a few hits to become comic relief in the movies.

His jealousy became petty (Maybe it was the same way in the books) but it was amplified a lot more in the movies.

He did lose his chance to shine as the "Magic Culture Know-It-All" which became Hermione's schtick in the movies.

Ron is still annoying to me and Fanfiction has not made that better. The fact that I feel a sadistic glee whenever Ron is bashed in FF's allows me to understand that I on a fundamental level do not enjoy him as a human being.

I would not be Ron's friend in real life.

***** Funny thing is that I grew up in that big lower middle class family. Clothes were sometimes hand me downs and vacation might be a car trip to the countryside or visiting family. We had food but not a lot of stuff.

Oldest of five siblings (I know Mum and Dad didn't go the full Weasley seven) but still.. We just learned that we had to make our own money so I have had jobs on and off since I was fourteen. That's where I got my pocket money.

**** I'm not sure they really add much to the subreddit. Sure, they're sometimes funny (especially since the funny ones are usually the only ones upvoted), but they almost never lead to a short drabble, to say the least of a story. They're upvoted in favor of discussion posts, fic reviews, and the other posts that I enjoy most on the subreddit. Half the time, the "prompts" are a sentence in the title.

What I'd like is a weekly megathread for these short prompts to be posted. People would respond to them like they do now, i.e. jokes and comments, and the subreddit would have more room for other content. It'd be like subreddit quality moderation elsewhere where photos and certain type of posts are banned on certain days, though they might garner many upvotes.

Okay, I get it many people dont like bashing and that's fine. That's their opinion. But I happen to like it and I think it's dumb to say that if you like bashing, you're not creative and/or immature. People like what they like. I've seen many posts complaining about it, which is more annoying than the fics I come across that portray the bashing terribly

****** Sure

I just think it's interesting to see characters that are good and typically liked (Molly, Dumbledore, Ron, Ginny, Hermione-or others) and twist them so they're unlikable.

It's nice to have a different antagonist sometimes than the usual ones (Snape, Malfoy, etc)

I do agree that sometimes it gets laid on overly thick. I'm not a fan of Harry overhearing, say, the Weasleys where they unveil their plan with the most unrealistic, awkward dialogue ever.
