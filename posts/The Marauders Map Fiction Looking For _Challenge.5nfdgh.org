Hey Gang,

I'm looking for some fanfics, or challenging someone to write it. I would like to read some fan fiction where the imprints in the map recognize Harry being one of their blood, and take a more active role in his life be that in helping him change his home life, helping him with his studies, or simply helping him emotionally once Prongs realizes that Harry is his son. I dont mind over powered harry, I just want it to make sense.

Thanks again!

** This sounds fun, but remember that they were all rather immature teenagers when the map was "imprinted" with the marauder persona. I think the easiest way to pull this off is if you had access to an English teacher who could ask their high school students what advice they would give their teenaged son, otherwise you run the risk of just making the parchment a wise stand in dad figure. It's still an interesting idea!

** I'm totally fine with them being teenagers in maturity, I think it would add a cool dynamic to the story, Harry learning what his dad was like as a 15/16 year old.
