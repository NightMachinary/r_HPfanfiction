HPFF is meant to be one of the bigger fanfic archives specifically for Harry Potter, but I just can't get over how bizarre their ruleset is. My partner was watching me read through the rules, and just said, "It's like these rules have been written by someone who's been told about copyright but doesn't actually know what it is."

#+begin_quote
  Movie titles, quotes from books, quotes from poems, song lyrics, the names of real and living people and about 100 other things fall into the category of copyright material. Some of these things can be used as long as they are cited properly, while others are simply not accepted for legal reasons. ([[https://hpff.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/13000007355-hpff-site-rules][x]])

So like, this includes quotes from the Harry Potter series. I received a rejection saying that because I had the quote, "Harry, just Harry." it had to be cited to the book and page.

But also... Movie /titles/?

#+begin_quote
  In order to avoid a messy lawsuit, the site does not permit the use or mention of living people in stories. Historical figures as well as generic titles like the Queen of England may be used. References that are used in citing quoted material are also acceptable. ([[https://hpff.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/13000007355-hpff-site-rules][x]])
#+end_quote

You can't *MENTION* people? Like, I just... I don't understand this. How can you make a real, believable story with any kind of Muggle part to it and not even be able to mention an Elton John record, or any equivalent, without making up a name?

Does anybody still use this site here on the subreddit? Is it worth going through all these rules to post on HPFF? Has anybody had experience posting here, like, is there excellent feedback or a great readership or something that makes it all worth it?


** I posted nearly half a million words worth of stories there before a big kerfuffle with the site owner a year or two ago. The rules are very heavy-handed. My understanding - for what it's worth - is that the site had a lot of younger members back in the day, so the content rules were heavily skewed towards pre-teen and teen readers. As far as the rules on copyright, the site owner took the approach of "it isn't worth it to me to deal with any copyright issues, ever" and the rules reflect that.

A sizeable chunk of what used to be the HPFF community is at HPFanFicTalk.com now. A lot of time was devoted to modernizing the rules, although I don't know all the particulars on copyright.

** HPFF isn't technically dead, but it is practically dead. It was the first site I ever read fanfiction on, but it became clear pretty quickly how much better FFN is. They kind of killed themselves, since they never really tried to stay "up to date" (whatever that means with something like this. Their filter system was atrocious, as there were only a handful of options, and anything that was deemed too implausible or too far away from canon was not something you can search by... and that's half the reason the site got into the distressed shape it did. Not to mention I think the actual creator of the site went AWOL, so very little could be done to actually correct these things? (I might be miss-remembering this). Lastly, pretty much any story that is actually worth a damn was crossposted to FFN, so there was no real reason to actually use HPFF unless you really liked custom story banners.

** I used it many many moons ago when I was young (14-16ish). I went back recently and it just didn't appeal to me anymore, likely because of the rules.

** I used it for a while, but I thought the rules were arbitrary and badly thought through. I did like the fact that there was a vetting process which helped to weed out the worst of the worst. I liked that you could use a banner on your story cover page - though a lot of them started to look the same. There was a really good, active forum with loads of challenges but when that was taken down after a big row, I stopped bothering with it and later removed my stories from the site. Some of the disgruntled members started a new site but it's not very attractive or user friendly and I don't know how successful it is.
