Could you theoretically get mokeskin undies, so you never have to go to the toilet ever again? Don't even have to break stride, nobody would ever know! And, if someone was getting you down, you could hang it upside down above their front doors for a day or two and let it empty there!

What are the limits on mokeskin bags? Can you make one extremely small, ring sized, and use that to hold your wand? Could it hold a larger mokeskin bag that you carry your stuff in? Can you get recursive with that stuff?


** Just one gripe - Mokeskin isn't what makes things infinite in HP. Mokeskin is a security thing, being that stuff made out of Mokeskin cannot be opened by anyone except the owner.

Undetectable Extension Charms, however?

Infinite underwear.

*** Just because you've got an undetectable extension charm doesn't mean you still wouldn't be dirty. It can't replace toilet paper. Perhaps you could add a cleaning charm to them, but then that would defeat the purpose of the extension charm. And just why would you want to walk around carrying pounds of piss and shit? Hygiene and risk of infection aside, I can't imagine that'd smell good.

**** What if the charm was in your ass? Infinite ass-space means you never have to shit until you die and then your corpse just releases a lifetime of shit all at once.

**** I suppose you could Vanish it later. Or it could be more of an emergency thing--like when you need to go, but there's no toilet around. It beats pissing in a bush, imo, especially if you're a girl and need to actually take off your pants to pee.

** But if you were wearing expanded underwear it would be sort of like you're not wearing anything at all. It would feel completely open down there.

Which, depending on your preference, may or may not be a bonus.

*** If I recall correctly, it's a hidden dimensonal gate that opens into the orange crate of a wealthy fruit seller. There are a few amusing scenes in the later books - one where the gang is dumped into the ocean, and Nakor finds that all the oranges have been ruined (must have been a really bad day for the dude on the other end). Another is when they have to travel to a different level of the multiverse, such that all their magic works differently... and Nakor /still pulls oranges out of the bag/. The rest of the mages have a bluescreen moment, whereupon Nakor reveals that he merely had placed a few oranges in an ordinary sack and brought it with him. There are also a few times where they abuse the oranges to feed themselves instead of starving to death. You gotta wonder how much the profit margins of the merchant are being affected.

Could be an interesting concept for somebody to use in a Horcrux Hunt rewrite - have Hermione enchant a similar opject. You could even do a Very Potter Musical gag where it opens into a grocery store and the only thing Ron and Harry can pull out are Red Vines.
