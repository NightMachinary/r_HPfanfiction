** linkffn(7624618) Love and Love Again shows a Harry who's lived in foster homes and on the streets up until he's 13. Sirius finds him just in the nick of time, but rather than waking up and being fine and trusting Sirius after 5 minutes, it shows Harry being sick, going through the struggle to trust, being resentful of parents he thought abandoned him, etc. It's very well done and one of my favorites. But if it's not abandoned, it is severely neglected. :/

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

** I'd say Turn by saras_girl, everyone is wonderfully in character and nothing strange happens. Actually something slightly unrealistic happens, but that later turns out to be something that's organized, a bit like the unspeakables. It's brilliant.

Another one is coming of age in the house of black. It follows the five young blacks (Bellatrix, Andromeda, Narcissa, Serius and Regulus) and the events that shape them into the people we know. It's really good.

** The Alexandra Quick series is extremely realistic in its handling of how actually preteens and teenagers behave - which can turn off some readers who are used to them acting like adults. Personally, I think it's brilliantly done, but some find it annoying.

**** I have never read that fanfic before, but the reviews seem to be the stream of "a masterpiece! very good. wonderfully written," and it seems to be popular as well.

So, why are most people here thinkit's awful? o-o Or if it really is awful, then why are people at ff thinks it's a decent story??

You could read the reviews on the most terrible fanfiction to ever be written and you'll still find people saying it's great, so it's not exactly a good way of evaluating the quality of a story.

That being said, DAYD isn't the worst fic you could read, far from it actually, but it has some pretty bad character portrayal and some ridiculous plot points as pointed out by other people above.

I think the reason you might feel like people on this subreddit "hate it" is because it's one of those stories that would get recommended a lot, despite its many faults, and people who didn't like it eventually got annoyed of seeing it being presented as "the best 7th year canon compliant story".

Obviously it doesn't help that the author is a psycho.

***** Although the story isn't excellent or realistic, it is decent. This sub likes to circlejerk about how terrible it is, however. If you like it, there's no reason to feel bad.
