Are there any good fics where Harry and Fleur are just really good friends, and it's a prominent part of the story?

Serious, comedic, doesn't matter.


** My favourite idea for their relationship will ALWAYS be Fleur just sort of adopting Harry as her little brother. She gives him girl advice, sneers and throws hands with people who wanna mouth off at him and just is the emotional support he should have gotten from Dudley (who should have been his big brother if the Dursley's actually loved him).

** I read one once where Harry was adopted by Fleur's family and I was like "alright maybe this won't be so bad!" then he started having sex with her because he had more than sisterly feelings for her but I kept reading anyway.

Then he had too much stamina and he was starting to hurt her so it turned into a harem fic and I couldn't continue reading it.
