Not overpowered or aby of the harem bullshit


** I've only seen a single Snape SI. Its endgame seems to be harem, and it's also very much dead. Yeah, I realize this isn't what you wanted, but I think there simply isn't any other Snape SIs. linkffn(The Halfblood Emperor)

And who would blame writers? Who would /want/ to inherit his life? I mean, the only bright point of it seems to be a friendship with Lily... Poor halfblood in an abusive home in an ostracized house targeted by bullying from the most popular kids in school, then a membership in Wizarding Nazis followed by being a teacher who everyone hates. He's playing life on hardmode.

Allthough now I kinda want to see a fic starting off like typical SIs do -- "man I wish Hogwarts was real". Only to be inserted into the bundle of sunshine that is Snape's life. Be careful what you wish for and all that.

#+begin_quote
  This is the story of a person who died. It's OK though, he got better. Through some kind of cosmic coincidence he wakes up in the body of an 11 year old Severus Snape. What would someone in his position, with knowledge of the future and what can be accomplished with magic do? Liberally abuse it and live like a king of course! Snape!Harem SI-OC as Snape NO SLASH.

*** Honestly his difficult situation makes it an interesting concept, if not making him overpowered

**** True, but SIs are basically always done for the purpose of wish fulfillment. This would end up being a different beast alltogether.

I'd read it, but I don't have high hopes of such a fic being made.

***** Well the wish fulfillment could come from the SI getting themselves out of snape's abusive home life by telling cops and stuff, and then when they go to hogwarts they can try to stay friendly with james and stuff to stop the bullying from even happening, and then later the SI can just ignore joining voldemort because they probably got put into a different house anyways, and no sane normal person put into the harry potter world would choose to join him.

A totally different real world soul and mind put into snape's body wouldnt' HAVE TO stick to snape's canon life. I don't get why anyone WOULD. I'd change a million things instantly because it's my life now. Unless you want to go with that fanon concept of fate being immutable and stuff will happen anyway. But that's dumb and I hate that. I love free will and choices. It always seems like an excuse for canon railroading anyway because they can't think of anything good on their own.

There is lots of stuff a person could do to change things for themselves.

****** I'm not saying that you have to stick to his life because fate or such silliness.

It depends on /when/ you end up SS-wise. Before first year? Sure, you can do basically everything you said (but you still have to contend with Tobias...). But if you end up in, say, fourth year? The Marauders aren't just going to... stop. Seventh year or beyond and you're pretty much ingrained with the Death Eaters -- it's not like you can easily back out of it given that at this point, /nobody/ cares about you, and trying to get out will just make people suspicious ("are you trying to spy?").

******* Oh yes good point Fredrik. :( Yes I suppose if you end up too late into things it would be hard to make stuff stop. Yes and you cannot really leave the Death Eaters because like Karkaroff got hunted down for it. :(

** You know, this could be fun to write. What a nightmare start if he's already a teacher, even if it's post-war and early summer. There's no part of his life that isn't fairly hellish, but at least as the rat-poor abused kid you're not expected to know a gazillion potions and how to apparate.

Maaaaybe if he's still in there and just wished someone would take over and live his life for him, so now you've woken up and you've got a semi-detached Snape ranting in your head about your abysmal brewing...
