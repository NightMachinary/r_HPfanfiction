Hi there, everyone! As described in the title, I wanted to +shamelessly plug+ bring some attention to my first foray into HP fanfiction, titled /"I'll Keep Coming"/. I would've done some shameless self-promotion earlier, but I only found out about this subreddit a few days ago! Please enjoy, and let me know what you think!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12220797/1/I-ll-Keep-Coming]]

Summary: Time travel, AU. When all that Harry Potter ever loved is taken from him, when he cannot fight alone against the tide of Voldemort's evil, he has to take his one last chance. A lonely, damaged Harry returns to his past, in order to save his future. Rated M for violence, death and trauma. Will eventually include Harry/Ginny.


** I haven't read it yet, but I'll give it a shot tomorrow. I just wanted to comment on my first impression, which is that this is not a fic I'd read under normal circumstances.

You start your fic summary with useless shit. The only purpose of which could possibly to excuse your fic being bad. Then you start your fic with a long A/N, which in itself is a bad thing, where you reiterate the point that you haven't written FF before.

This is enough on its own to make me close the tab. Add in a fic labeled Hurt/Comfort, which is often enough to put me off on its own, and a time travel that by your A/N seems to be a rehash with a repeated pairing. It paints a very bad picture and I have yet to even read a word of your fic.

*** I understand that it might be everyone's cup of tea, and although I... appreciate your candour, if you already despise it so thoroughly I'm not sure if your opinion will change at all if you read further. Your choice, I suppose.

I would like to try and explain a few things you did bring up, though.

First, would you care to elaborate on the fic summary being "useless shit"? I've seen many stories that outline nearly every aspect of their plot in the summary, and wanted to avoid giving away too much detail whilst still keeping it interesting to a potential reader, not to "excuse it being bad" - although it might be bad in the long run, it wasn't some active deception my part. If you've a better idea for what to say, please feel free to say so.

As for the categories, the addition of Hurt/Comfort seemed only appropriate. I normally filter it or Romance out on my searches on Fanfiction.net, but honestly it was the only other one that really fit (after checking the definitions) other than perhaps Drama, which was arguably too broad and might lead to misinterpretations later on.

Pairings-wise, as Romance is not a key aspect of the fic yet I can't elaborate far on my decision to include it, but although you are welcome to disregard my story for any reason - pairing choice included - I fail to see how me using canon pairings "paints a bad picture", although that could just be your own personal preference (which is fine).

Nevertheless, I thank you for at least taking a look and letting me know what you think - particularly if the fic is not up your street, it means all the more that you'd take time out of your day to read a bit, so thank you!

**** Yeah, I have to agree on [[/u/EpicBeardMan]]

Regarding the "useless shit" in your summary: I guess he refers to the fact that you write about how it is your first fic, etc. Don't do that.

What bugs me personally the most is the A/N at the beginning. Especially the fact that there's one at the beginning of each chapter. I really don't like seeing something like this.

If you need to make annotations do it at the end.

I didn't read it yet since I have no time at the moment but your first annotation implies you describe things that are AU in the following ones. If so: Don't do it. It is really bad writing. You need to describe these things in your text.

I'm a new ffwriter myself, currently working on my first hp fanfiction, so I guess I know why you did these things. Just think about changing them, believe me.

Eventually, I'll find some time later today to read at least the first chapters and then I'll be able to give some more feedback.

***** To be fair, you both might be right about that - I'll take out the mention of the (1st fic) from the summary, as you're right, it doesn't add anything important.

As for the A/Ns, for the moment I haven't described any AU events, and thanks to your explanation, I'll avoid doing so in the future - however, I'll probably end up keeping the A/Ns at the start of every chapter, as I frankly can't be bothered to change more than that so far.

Even so, thanks for your feedback so far!

****** I looked through your fic a bit now. I didn't read much as it was far far too angsty for me to manage. So general criticisms are all I can give. You really should just go through and delete the authors notes, they really add nothing and take away a lot. The writing seems competent enough to be getting on with, the content not so much. Also you use way too many scene breaks that disrupt the flow of the story.

******* I'll definitely take your comments in stride, and I'd like to thank you again for taking your time to read it, particularly since it isn't normally up your street. Thanks for getting back to me!

**** When I say useless shit. I mean everything that isn't your story. Everything else is extraneous and should be removed.
