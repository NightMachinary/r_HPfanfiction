I was on Pottermore and came across this while reading about what our boy Gilderoy got up to as a student......

"He managed to create a massive, illuminated projection of his own face, which he would send skywards in imitation of the Dark Mark."

Has this ever shown up in a story?

*/Should it show up in a story?/*

What would be the best use of this fact in a fic?

** This is kind of awesome, in a very Lockhart sort of way. I wish I'd seen it a couple of month earlier when I was writing teenage Lockhart, I would totally use it.
