Looking for an old fic where the Potters lived and Sirius was married and had a daughter named Rhea (Rhia?). I honestly don't remember much except i think Harry and Sirius's daughter eventually started going out... I think she was a year below him. Might be other kids in the Potter and Black families but I'm not sure. I don't even know if the fic was very good, but I've always been big into AU fics and thought of it recently. I'd guess it's from around 2004-2006ish?


** A link would probably help if you're aiming to spread curiosity. I'd love to read that story.

*** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/529524/aks100?a=s][aks100]] is the author. The series starts off in James/Lily's seventh year with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1806045/1/The-Glittering-Masquerade][The Glittering Masquerade]]. The order is on their bio page, but order after is: To the End, Beyond the End, A New Beginning, My Happy Ending. Been ages since I've read it so I really can't comment on quality anymore.

** This is not the story you were looking for, as Harry is canon-compliant, but Sirius has a child. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic]]

** Edit: Well I apparently didn't look very hard and just now found it. Part of a series by user aks100, the Beyond the End series. Not sure if I should delete this post or leave it in case others are curious...
