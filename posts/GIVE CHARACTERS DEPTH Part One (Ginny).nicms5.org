I hate Ginny. But only when she's with Harry.

To be clear, I don't REALLY hate Ginny, I just hate the entire relationship between her and Harry but thats basically most of her character motivations.

These are my reasons

1) She's obsessed. We first meet Ginny at the platform and her role in the scene isn't too big which makes sense, Harry is about to meet his best friend, his adopted family, people who LIKE him after being shut away and abused by the Dursleys. I don't think of Ginny again until the second book where she begins her role as an obsessed weird little girl. I mean really, fanfictions where Ginny is a pyhco just make ALL the sense to me. Most of everything she does centers around Harry. I mean she has Quiddich but that's like the remaining 2 percent of her personality. And I wasn't going to mention Dean but SHE STRINGS HIM ALONG JUST SO THAT SHE COULD GET NOTICED BY HARRY.

​

Okay, okay maybe I'm not being fair. It's normal to have a crush. If you find someone and ya like their face and how they breathe it's normal to want to stalk them a bit. But GINNY IS LITERALLY THE WORST PERSON FOR HARRY.

​

2) She seems to only exist to be a love interest. DO SOMETHING! She comes in, gets saved by Harry, watches from afar for about two books, STRINGS DEAN ALONG, gets with Harry, stays at school, maybe fights in the battle(Not that her part is mentioned), and has babbies with Harry. Harry is the bloody CHOSEN ONE. He thinks of the Weasleys as FAMILY. To be honest, I would like Ginny in more of a spunky little sister role who causes mischief. Give her something other than being a girl. Put her in Slytherin, the first Slytherin Weasley. She can spy on the Death Eater children, she can be sarcastic and awesome, maybe she ends up with Draco in a sort of hate to love relationship which would be so much cooler than whatever "HINNY" is.

​

Think about it! It would be SO much better than Dramonine( Like WHAT??) Their both purebloods, they would both be Slytherins, it would make Draco's 6th year so much more interesting. It even fits the whole 'LOVE' theme going on. There would be an acceptance arc with the Weasleys, a redemption arc for the Malfoys(Or just Draco). GIVE CHARACTERS DEPTH!!!!

Ginny can still have Quiddich (MORE DINNY!!!) She can play pranks on the twins. She can help the trio with their plans or maybe she ruins them on accident or on purpose. Maybe Percy and Ginny could grow closer because Percy is an outsider too. Maybe, Molly has a difficult time accepting that her baby girl is a Slytherin but tries to be supportive but theirs tension between mother and daughter which is heightened when Molly tries to set Ginny up with Harry.
