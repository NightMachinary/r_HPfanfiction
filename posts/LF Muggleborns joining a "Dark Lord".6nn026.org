I never understood why Purebloods (who had the political power) need to fight with terrorism if they could archive their goals way easier through political means. So I'm looking for a fix where the Muggleborns start terrorism, I don't care if it is with Voldemort, Grindelwald, an other Dark Loard or even without a clear leader.


** I think the crucial aspect of the situation is that Purebloods were in the process of /losing/ political power. Thanks, in part, to Dumbledore's influence, there was progress in Muggleborn equality and Muggle protection. In 1962, Nobby Leach became the first Muggleborn minister for magic. His term coincided with Death Eaters' first rise; and after Voldemort's first fall, this loss of power continued. For example in 1992, the Muggle Protection Act authorized the Ministry to search pureblood households (e.g., the Malfoys) for Dark artifacts that could be used to target Muggles.

*** This is an interesting turn!

I think Voldemort going the magical supremacist route would make him far more dangerous.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I've read stories where Grindelwald stood for equality for all magical beings. Some of the stories explained muggleborn discrimination as a product of their mass following of Grindelwald.

On a personal level, I like magic-supremacist characterization of Grindelwald the best out of all I have seen.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I've always thought it would be neat if Harry and friends went back in time on an accident and decided instead of disrupting the timeline they'll just gather up all the disenfranchised squibs and muggleborns who were lost to history and never mattered and start a town for their kind. This massively fucks up the timeline because the town becomes too successful.

Fast forward several years and squibs hold the top rankings in all forms of non-wand based magics that is possible for a squib to perform. Every magic family who has a squib child ships them off to the town because it's the only option for a squib to learn real magic whereas in the past there were no options.

Muggleborns who attend the Arcane Academy rather than Hogwarts are consistently more skilled. The biggest timeline derail happens when Tom Riddle turns down his Hogwarts invitation to attend the Arcane Academy which he considers to be obviously superior. Tom still becomes Voldemort but he's more dangerous than ever because he attended a school where ability and results are the top priorities rather than social mechanics and family.

Voldemort invents a ritual that can turn a muggle into a squib and a squib into a wizard. He uses this to form an utterly loyal army of skilled magic users.

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM

The premise was Pureblood wizards were being banished from the wizarding world and Hermione was running some sort of half way house for them.
