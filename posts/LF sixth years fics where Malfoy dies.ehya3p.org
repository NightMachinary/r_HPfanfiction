I really dislike the last two books but i especially hate the part in sixth year where draco gets away with all of his attempts to kill dumbledore

are there any fics where he gets exposed by harry and actually punished rather than simply let go?

no slash no bashing and no death eater sympathizing

** I think Draco went through enough for his sins. He clearly didn't want to kill Dumbledore and that must've fucked him up pretty bad. Even Dumbledore saw through him and was forgiving and merciful to him by having Snape do the deed instead. I think people don't really see the amount of pressure he was under. His parents and his life was on the line. Imagine being caught up in such darkness and feeling like there's no way out. Not everyone is as strong as Harry to stand up for what they believe in. I feel like the Malfoys got what they deserved in the end. A fall from grace and shame that will come with their name for generations to come.

*** And yet Lucius Malfoy deserved worse. He was a willing death eater, in both wars. Sure he didnt want to be a death eater during the end of the second war, but that wasnt because he repented it's because he was no longer one of Voldemorts most trusted lieutenants. Even when Voldemort was "dead" he kept pushing for a world of prejudice and discrimination. Hell he gave a dark artifact created by a dark lord to an innocent little girl because she was from a family he didnt like, and this lead to that girl being possessed by that dark lord, almost having her soul destroyed, and a basilisk being released. If not for god level plot armour Hogwarts would be digging graves daily.

*** I respect your opinion but disagree because he is a bigot and an asshole and he was standing up for exactly what he believed in just not under circumstances of his control
