:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Potentially a massive longshot, but here goes nothing. Over a decade ago, there was this really well-written fanfic on [[https://fanfiction.net/][fanfiction.net]] that I turned away from for the stupidest reason, and I want to give it another shot. The problem is, I can't seem to find it, because I don't remember enough about it! Here's what I do remember:

1. Harry didn't get the letter to go to Hogwarts. Instead, he continued to live with the Dursleys. Eventually, he somehow gets into contact with someone (I don't remember who), and he ends up taking private magic lessons to get him up to snuff. I think this was when he was 16 he was found?
2. Obviously, Harry continued on in normal school. He also got a part-time job - I don't remember the specifics, but I think it was at a car dealership? One thing I remember for certain was that all of his paycheck went to the Dursleys, and there was a big point about how all of that money was being used to pay off the police so that Dudley wasn't arrested. I also think he may have been adopted by somebody he works with, or his boss, but I don't quite remember...
3. I don't remember all the subjects Harry took - I feel one was some sort of home economics class? Things like learning how to cook, decorating a house, planning a wedding? This one could be way off base, though, I don't quite remember it. I do know, however, that he took chemistry, because:
4. Harry has a much better relationship with Snape. He actually goes to Snape to complain about the first year textbook, because all it is is a recipe book. Instead, he asks Snape for something that explains WHY each ingredient acts the way he does, and compares this to chemistry for Snape. I don't remember the exact example he uses, though - just that he compares it to chemistry. I also don't remember exactly why Snape likes him this time around, but I think it was something related to Harry being really interested in Snape's subject and not being a conceited 11 year old. In fact, Snape maybe doesn't like him this time around, and I'm remembering wrong - but the comparison to chemistry I remember extremely vividly
5. And finally, the reason I originally dropped the series - Harry's first encounter with Dumbledore doesn't go well, and they basically have a massive fight where Harry storms out on him.

I would appreciate ANY matches, however small or big they may be. Some (or a lot) of the details may be wrong, because it's been that long since I first read it. But I would really, REALLY, love to read this fanfic if anybody can find it.


** I believe it is All at Once by Aurilia. Not sure how to link on here but that's definitely it

*** A few paragraphs in - I think this is it!! Thank you so much, you have no idea how long this has haunted me for. Might not mean much to you, but it's worth at least this much to me. Thanks for your time :)

**** I knew it at once because it's one of my favorite fics! It's so well written I think and I'm so bummed it's not been updated although I think the story gets a little lost at the end! Hope you enjoy!

  AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info.
