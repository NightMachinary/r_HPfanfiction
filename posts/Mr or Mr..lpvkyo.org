So this is a simple one. Do you prefer to fill your fics with mentions to "Mr Potter" or "Mr. Potter"... at some point I thought the period was the right way to go and I think the books have it, however, it does look kind of better without it and some gramma correction tools seem to advice for its removal. What do you guys think?


** Mr is grammatically correct in British English, Mr. is correct in American English. I'm not sure about other forms of English!

I'm British, so I strongly favour Mr - I actually find Mr. a bit off-putting as I can't help but read it as a full stop, so it makes reading it quite stilted.

** Isn't this a matter of British English vs American English? As far as I know, the former favours omitting the full stops in things like Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, etc. I know JKR omitted the full stops in her writing.

** In British English, the full stops (periods) aren't included. In American English they are included. It doesn't matter as long as you're consistent.

** Mr, but that might be because I've thought of Mr. as somebody who's married. Mind you, English ain't my native language, so it's quite possible I've gotten that wrong. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*** There's no distinction for married/single men, but I like that logic! I go by Ms so I don't have the Mrs/Miss issue, but everyone calls me Mrs anyway.

**** Which is perfectly OK, but PLEASE, nobody (especially not very conservative and strict Professor McGonagall) would ever call her female student ‚ÄúMs‚Äù in the middle of 1990s'. There was no such animal as ‚ÄúMs Granger‚Äù, only ‚ÄúMiss Granger‚Äù.

One of my pet-peeves.

** Mr.

Which is weird as I grew up with Mr as is the British way. I just like the aesthetic of the period.

** I believe that British English doesn't use the stop when the abbreviation ends with the last letter of the word being abbreviated (like Doctor/Dr, Mister/Mr, Missus/Mrs, Mistress/Miss), but does use it when the abbreviation stops in the middle of the word (like Professor/Prof., Captain/Capt.). American English doesn't make this distinction and uses the stop for all abbreviations.
