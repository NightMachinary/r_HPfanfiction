One of the earliest stories I read was linkffn(The Fire and the Rose), in which Snape and Hermione get in a potions accident (a bit less cliche when it was written 15 years ago than it is now) and are stuck in each other's bodies. Shenanigans ensue.

After more than a decade of reading fanfiction, that's the only story I've ever read with that premise--that of swapping bodies with someone else and having to pass as the other person because you can't un-swap at will. I like the idea and think it's interesting--does anyone know of any stories that I've missed?


** Take a look at [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=34397][In Essence Divided]] in my fic archive. It's old and unpolished but it fits the bill.

** The Fire and the Rose was such a good laugh, the tampon scene ruined the gravity of Dumbledore's "power in a name" speech for me...I would just chortle every time it came up.

  Imagine that one person that irritates, infuriates, & insults their way under your skin to the point where each moment with him or her becomes a pop quiz in self-control. Now, imagine that you've woken up in that person's body. For Lily Evans & James Potter, learning to navigate this unfortunate and stressful new reality is truly a walk through hell.

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.
