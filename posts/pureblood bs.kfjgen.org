*** I think making the mc a girl would work really well bc of the sexism that they'd face (and possibly be a good starting reason for rebelling) and in regards to the house I think that the age the mc decided to rebel would influence their sorting a lot. A Sirius-like mc wouldn't be in Slytherin but someone who rebelled later like andromeda would

Also I hope you do end up writing this bc I love this premise! I get tired of the idea that pure blood culture is superior and that muggleborns are ruining the wizard of world
