Bonus points for long fics with lemons


** For Harry and Gabrielle the one that jumps to mind for me is Hope by Jeconais. Its pretty long and at least in my opinion its well written. Its a post-hogwarts fic so it may not be everyones favorite type of fic to read, but I feel those work best for Harry/Gabrielle pairings.

Also you will note if you read further into the thread that many of those warning signs for the future of the fic did materialise. I stopped reading the fic around chapter 35, where the author jumps through innumerable illogical hoops to arrange events to rehash the canon resurrection of Voldemort.

***** I agree it's a pretty well written fic. My problem and and a lot of other's problem as I've noticed is the utter disregard for the plot and story the author shows about half way through. Basically the whole fiasco with Katie and Fleur.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
