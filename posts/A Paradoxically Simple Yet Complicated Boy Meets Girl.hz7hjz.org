Boy meets girl. Girl likes boy. Boy and girl begin dating. Boy and girl become serious to the point where they discuss more serious life-goals during and after Hogwarts.

A common romance trope that's oft seen in real-life, too. Some marry their sweethearts and make it happily work.

In this case, however? Harry's new beau has a secret she's keeping from him and his friends... at least, ya know, until they're married and there's no (for her) feared chance he might run for the hills on learning it.

Royalty of some type, like in the few stories involving veela royalty?

A mafia princess/daughter of someone /very/ nasty (not quite on Voldemort's level, but still), who's worried that his daughter's beau might bring the light of attention of very powerful people (e.g. Dumbledore, Voldemort) on them?

A young goddess or demigoddess or an old pantheon, like the Olympians, who's worried her extended (and fucked up) family might take an interest in Harry? (Culture clash: since she's young and around Harry's age, she was raised 'modern' compared to the values her family have/share).

A recently-fallen angel that decided to hide out on Earth?

An alien that grew up on Earth after her parents were stranded?

A spirit or entity possessing a girl's body, either completely (the former owner is either evicted by it or had already left e.g. brain-dead) or in a Goa'uld parasitism or Tok'ra symbiosis way?

The more unusual, the better.

Thing is, Harry isn't clueless: He knows there's /something/ strange about his new girlfriend, but he can't put his finger on /what/...


** You know the funniest version of this would probably be a fem!Voldemort thats hopped demensions to be with the only love who can be her equal.
