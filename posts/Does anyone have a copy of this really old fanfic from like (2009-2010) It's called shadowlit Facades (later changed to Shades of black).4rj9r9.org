It was written by Sera dy Relendrant, and it was a story about a female Harry, Neville being the boy who lived, and a really excellent deep characterization of Bellatrix. The female Harry (called Rose) was sorted into Slytherin as is Neville, and they interact with Draco etc. The author took it down a few years ago, but I thought I'd try my luck and check if someone saved a copy of it or know where I could access it. Thanks!
