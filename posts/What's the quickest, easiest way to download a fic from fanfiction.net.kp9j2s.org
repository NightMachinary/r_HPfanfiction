I'm mostly making this post so that I can leave a comment on it and use the fanfiction bot to get a download link tbh, but this doesn't seem like the most convenient way - do I need to create a post every time I need a fic so that I don't flood other people's posts? I just wanted some easy quick website that would give me a file after I insert the link to fanfic, without giving them my email or anything. The FicSave didn't work, so here I am.


** Or just use something like fanfictiondownloader from fanfictiondownloader.net

** You can message the bot directly so that you don't need to make a new post.

Edit: Direct message the linkfnn(insert fic name name) to [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]]

** You can directly to [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/]] with your browser and put URL of the story there. However, the quickest, easiest way is to get [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] (either as the command-line application or Calibre plugin) and download EPub directly.
