I was reading through Deathly Hallows and I was just curious what would happen if that was the decision.


** It's especially infuriating when you realize that Dolohov is the one who cursed Hermione in battle at the Department of Mysteries. He cursed her /nonverbally/ and messed her up so badly that she had to take 10+ potions daily for quite some time to recover. This was definitely someone who needed to be permanently incapacitated.

While I respect the creative decisions taken by Rowling and I agree that legal justice would be the best in an ideal world, Harry's approach only caused many deaths and suffering. He remained pure at least haha. But that won't make Sirius or Remus or Fred go back to life. Harry as a war orphan SHOULD know that the passive approach to a terrorist hate group and later an oppressive goverment only brings pain

******* I gotta say that this is an unfair standard to put on the characters of the book. While I'd agree that killing Dolohov is the "right" thing to do I really don't think it's wrong for others not to do it or be incapable of it. Yeah sure it's frustrating to see, but would you blame (hypothetically) a thirteen year old child of being incapable of murder? Like yeah sure, HP in particular has had to grow up and it's war and there's endless problems resulting from withholding information from him because "he's just a kid!" but he does have a very reasonable right to not think of killing them at that moment or just not be capable of making that cold, calculated decision.

Suppose HP for some reason thought that torturing and raping Dolohov for information would definitively save lives (suspending the realities of this for a bit, but what matters here is what HP thinks. maybe we as the omniscient readers can even know that Dolohov has some critical info and is weak to rape). Would you blame him for not going through with that?

The point is that these are lines in the sand that are different for different individuals and while you can blame people for their decisions or indecisions I don't think you can expect everyone to be very cold and strong and determined in this sort of decision making.

Although actually, come to think of it, that's not even true, because JKR made it a point to let us know that Voldemort was killed by his own rebounding /Avada Kedavra/. So technically, Harry made Voldemort vulnerable enough by destroying his Horcruxes that Voldemort would kill himself when he tried to kill Harry and Harry whipped out the old /Expelliarmus/, *but Harry didn't kill Voldemort* which means the kids didn't have to kill anybody and their souls can all stay pure and all is well in the Potterverse.

And yes, there was that whole bit at Malfoy Manor, but with Wormtail dead, Voldemort wouldn't have been revived in GoF - maybe not ever, in fact. At least, not by Wormtail. Crouch might have still gone looking for him... but Cedric might not have died...

******** Hmm, too many points of divergence to have a single answer. Here's my rebuttal.

First, Remus Lupin is a 2nd class citizen. His word is worth next to nothing. Think the word of a woman in Saudi Arabia. Second, Fudge is a man concerned only with his public image. He wants this Black problem gone ASAP. The last thing he wants, is the information that a man has been innocent in Azkaban for 13 years to leak. He'd probably cover it all up, similar to how he had Crouch Jr. kissed.

I think Voldemort was always destined to return. Setting aside plot devices, Voldemort is a single-minded, brilliant individual. Maybe it gets pushed until Harry graduates and he's an adult without the blood protection and constant monitoring from Dumbledore. Maybe Crouch Jr. (at that point has already been growing stronger) escapes and finds out on his own. There're simply way too many variables here to try and present a single, definitive answer.

I disagree, they shouldn't have such extreme qualms about killing the enemy who wouldn't hesitate to kill them in an instant for so long into a war. If I was Ron or any of them in that situation (even at that age), I'm pretty sure I wouldn't think twice about killing people who are trying to kill me, and I don't think many people are different from me.

One thing about Harry Potter that has always bothered me (really only in 5-7), was how "the good guys" could never kill anybody. It was nonsensical; if it wasn't fiction then there was no way they could have won. Death Eaters are walking around shooting Avada Kedavra's and lethal spells everywhere, but the Order and friends are fighting with kid gloves on by only using stunners. It's like fighting a war where one side uses guns and the other uses tasers, complete nonsense.

***** Making yourself end a life is, in fact, very hard to do. VERY hard to do. There's a reason soldiers go through so much training; a good portion of it is meant to desensitize them to ending a life. Moody, Snape, and Dumbledore are three of an exceedingly small group that would be mentally prepared to end someone's life. Dumbledore straight up won't, Snape is a double agent which means killing anybody on either side is bad for his cover, and Moody would do it if pressed to, but is otherwise a staunch believer of law and justice.

Harry is practically the only person in his age group who has stared death in the face enough times to become inured to it. If any of the kids could, it would be him. However, he's still a teenager, with all the emotional baggage and immaturity that comes with it. It's not unreasonable for him to refuse to kill.

***** What's the best "Harry and/or Hermione and/or friends decide to be much more lethal"? Possibly assassinating the opposition etc. Maybe Dumbledore decides to or whatever. Does anyone have a good one?

****** Depends on the specifics of what you're looking for. Pretty much anything with the Dark!Harry tag will satisfy a "more lethal" Harry.

And there are also a good deal of one's where he's just flat out ruthless or a sociopath and doesn't really care much about killing people one way or the other.

The only other option I've seen is where you basically still have canon Harry, or he's pretty normal, but it has a more realistic take on war and fighting. And because of that realism, the Order and Harry himself usually end up actually killing people.

Which did you want?

******* Any kind of Harry where he basically decides to make a list and check it twice. Find the Death eaters and kill them. Bonus points for fun and/or intricate assassinations ala Hitman etc.\\
Extra bonus points if Hermione is helping him.

****** Harry and his friends getting lethal is very common. But having Dumbledore supporting their actions or himself getting tough is rather rare, but there are still some very good ones:

** A good compromise might have been a Memory Charm aimed at their magical knowledge and skills. If they had to relearn how to transform matchsticks to needles and the Levitation Charm from scratch, all without the neuroplasticity of youth, they would have been nearly useless to the Death Eater cause, suitably "punished" for abusing their magic, and yet alive and with their personalities intact.
