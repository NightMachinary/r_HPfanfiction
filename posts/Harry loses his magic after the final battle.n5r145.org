Perhaps it was the horcrux inside him giving him more than just the ability to talk to snakes, or perhaps the broken connection broke something inside of him. Either way, Harry couldn't cast Lumos to save his life.

Basically that, just Harry had magic, and now he doesn't. I'd be really interested to see if he would manage in Wizarding Britain without magic, or if he would retreat to the muggle world and try to hide from surviving death eaters, or maybe just get a job and go to university or something

** Ginny's Gift

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/601108/29/Ginny-s-Gift]])

And its sequel, The Long Road Home

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/994611/1/The-Long-Road-Home]])

Very well-written but YMMV because of the massive canon-divergence (both fics were written and finished /before/ the release of OOtP)

And yeah, just by posting this I'm giving away a crucial plot point - so I'll keep further specifics under this spoiler tag, in case anyone just wants to jump right in:

The first fic ends with Harry losing his magic, and the second one deals with the fallout

There's also:

we can't control (watch me unfold)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16044434]])

This one is not exactly what you're looking for, but Harry does start losing his magic at a point, and needs to deal with the aftermath. Also... I can only describe this fic as... porn with plot. Suuuuper explicit stuff (tastefully done, imo, but still). So YMMV on this one too, I guess.

edit: I just want to clarify that the plot (when it starts to kick in) is very, /very/ good.

It's canon divergent as well - Harry never attended Hogwarts in this one, so things start off a bit confusing, but it all gets explained as you read on.

Sorry I don't have better recommendations, but hopefully by commenting it can attract other people with better recs!

  It's a simple arrangement. Between her grueling quidditch schedule and his mysterious auror duties, Ginny and Harry find time to have spectacular sex with no strings attached. It's incredibly uncomplicated. Except when it isn't.

** I don't know if this qualifies or not, it's also a crossover, but one of my favorite fics' premise is that Harry loses his magic, but he can still use potions and still pretty much BAMF, but after he lost his magic, he got cursed with something that attracts spirits and the dead to him.

Unfortunately, this fic isn't fandom-blind reader friendly, so you'd have to be familiar with MDZS to enjoy this wonderful fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29441526/chapters/72321579][Flag Flying High]]

Summary:

/The final lines were.... the only clear instructions given to him./

/It seemed as though Mo Xuan-Yu was seized with sudden ferocious clarity and drive -- a single demand for the Yiling Patriarch: Whatever he was to do in revenge to the Mo Clan, he was to protect Hari above all. The child was not to be harmed./

When his life was not enough to trade for the protection of his friends in the Final Battle, Harry gave up his magic and found himself cursed. Travelling to the Cultivation World was his only chance to survive, to break this curse that drew the resentful dead into his orbit. While there though, he finds himself caught up in the life of the tormented Mo Xuan-Yu and unable to ignore the echoes of himself in the man's pitiful circumstances. But when Harry's curse draws the dead to Mo Village, the Junior cultivators of the Gusu Lan Sect are close behind, and his life takes a dramatic swing in a different direction, towed along in the wake of Mo Xuan-Yu now that he has been freed of his oppressive family, Harry finds himself in the Cloud Recesses, and involved in a whole new mystery that the 'adults' are determined to keep him away from.
