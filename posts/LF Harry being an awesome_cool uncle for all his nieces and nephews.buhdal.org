Title. Being an awesome godfather to Teddy could count too I guess. I'd prefer little emphasis on Ginny or his canon children, even better if they aren't present at all.


** Linkffn(The Sum of their parts)

Teddy Lupin's future isn't looking too great. Harry decides to do something about it. How about some nice fiendfyre?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  After losing everything and on the run, Harry will do anything to keep Teddy safe, even if it means to travel back in time. He hadn't counted on their family growing, but Dark Lords, noisy old wizards, werewolves and much more keep uprooting his peace. Slash. EWE.
