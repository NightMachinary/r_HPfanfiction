So, I've dropped on here a couple of times and asked for Snape recommendations, I usually get a really good list of Recs, I just wanted to come back on here again to see if anyone can think of any new ones? Generally speaking I love anything to do with Snape, as long as it's well written, good grammar and punctuation and a good developed plot. Ideally something that's completed, or being updated and not abandoned. Like I said, I'm happy with any pairing, pre-or post Hogwarts, I particularly love Snape and Harry mentor or friendship relationships. I'm also not opposed to a Snarry if it's written well. I'm really in the mood for a muggle AU though, I have barely found any decent ones. Or something similar to A fic I've just finished reading, that hasn't been updated in a few months, the gates of Azkaban by mirrormarie. One other preference is that I do prefer fics written on ff.net as I'm blind, and AO3 isn't the most accessible with my speech software. However, I am prepared to deal with accessibility issues if you guys think the fic is well worth a read. cheers‚ò∫Ô∏è


** If you don't mind self recs, I have a series that is mostly female Harry POV, but has Snape POV sections in each chapter, he takes on a parental role for female Harry. The first fic is complete, the second updates every Saturday.

  Book1 When Rachel Snow, the Girl-Who-Lived, is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic.

** If I may self-plug, I started writing Snape and Harry mentor/adopted fics last year and have 3 AU and/or travel fics.

The completed story is about an AU Snape who had adopted Harry in his universe and travels into the canon world trying to fix his biggest regret. I'm working on the sequel to that now which gets updated 2-3 times a week. Plus I have another one started that is full AU with Snape as Harry's stepfather in a world where Voldemort won. It has a good start, but has been put on the back burner until my sequel is a little further in.

All three are long and very plot heavy.

The completed one is call The Choices We Made and the full AU is Finding Common Ground.

  James takes the Dark Mark to save Harry. Lily survived, but he died in battle and Voldemort took over the Wizarding World in 1984. Growing up as a Death Eater's son in an oppressive regime challenges Harry in a way no one expected, most of all his stepfather Severus. When tragedy strikes, they must overcome their differences to rid the world from Voldemort. Full summary inside.

** linkao3(Of A Linear Circle by Flamethrower)

This is an incredible monster of a story centered around Snape and Salazar Slytherins brother Nizar who falls out of a portrait one evening. It's got everything. Lords, titles, magic lore, war, history, language just everything .

It's brilliant. I cannot recommend it enough.

I had a look and unfortunately it's only available on Ao3 im sorry? BUT they are making a Podfic of it that you can listen to? If that helps? I haven't listened to it and theyre only on chapter 16 but you could give it a go and see if it's worth the hassle of reading it after?

The link to the Podfic is here üòä enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27221125/chapters/66494521]]

*** Thank you for this rec, generally stories like this aren't my type of thing, as I find all the Lord stuff quite complicated. However, I'm going to make note of it and wait and see if the podfic gets completed. If that's the case then I will 100% listen to it. I've made a note of it though so thank you‚ò∫Ô∏è

** For Snape-centric stories, I highly recommend both Snape, Head of Hufflepuff and Advice from an Old-Timer by Sheankelor. linkffn(11062798; 12730972)

Muggle AU Snarry: Stockholm Syndrome, The Art of Coffee, and Escorting Trouble by Snarry5evr. Sorry but these aren't on ffn. linkao3(6681373; 8970022; 21929188)

Some of my favorite Snape-mentors-Harry fics:

Finding a Family and Finding a Home by HestiaA1 linkffn(4360923; 4486541)

Harry's New Home by kbinnz linkffn(4437151)

Harry Potter and the Battle of Wills by Jocelyn linkffn(2009130)

Hindsight by Loralee linkffn(3160980)

Redefining Life series by OliverSnape: The Definition of Home, The Definition of Family and The Photo Album linkffn(5878880; 6030400; 6273177)

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2375&chapno=1][Harry Potter and the Enemy Within]] and its sequel [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=3026&chapno=1][Harry Potter and the Chained Souls]] by Theowyn. What I liked about these is the premise that Occlumency has different levels/stages. These are on The Sugar Quill; I don't know how that will work with your text-to-speech software. Summary: As Harry enters his sixth year at Hogwarts, Voldemort's lengthening shadow stretches across the wizarding world and Harry is tormented by the knowledge that he alone can end this reign of terror. Worse, his mysterious mental link to Voldemort is stronger than ever and threatens to overwhelm him. Only Snape can teach him to control the nightmarish visions, but can Harry and Snape learn to trust one another, or will an old grudge that refuses to die destroy the wizarding world's sole hope of defeating the Dark Lord?"

#+begin_quote
  This is an epilogue of The Definition series. It's basically little scenes that didn't make it into the series, presented as photographic short stories. There is no set timeline, some are from times in the story, and some are after it finished.

*** My goodness, what a list? Thank you so so much. I read a couple of these, but there are some on here that I haven't read, and a couple that I read years ago and would love to revisit, but completely forgot about them. The ones on AO-3 look fab, so I'll be sure to try and check them out.‚ò∫Ô∏è

*** Also, I forgot to add. I've read the enemy within and its sequel on FF.net, oh my goodness it's amazing. Up there in my list of favourite Snape fics. I also loved the battle of wills, I have a couple friends who really don't like Snape but even they love that one. That author is brilliant.
