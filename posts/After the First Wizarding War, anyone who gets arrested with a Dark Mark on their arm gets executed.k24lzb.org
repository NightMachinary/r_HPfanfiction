** The problem I could see with this is that it would mean that the first wizarding war would likely continue well after the point it ended in canon. In canon many of the rich death eaters were handed an easy out when the dark lord disappeared by coming forward and claiming they only acted under duress and weren't in control of their actions. It was an easy out for the death eaters, but also an easy out for the country too. Both sides got to cease the violence and begin rebuilding. Sure there was a lot of very obvious wink wink nudge nudge to how obviously corrupt that system was, but from canon we learned that the war was already not going well before Voldemort's disappearance. Obviously this out wouldn't exist for either side once the first one of the lords came forward claiming to take the mark only under the Imperius and was executed for his or her trouble. Instead of peace, that would only escalate the conflict as the death eaters became more desperate and/or vindictive. While they were certainly evil, many of Voldemort's followers weren't exactly stupid. Many would likely go to ground or even go into exile out of the country if it became necessary. Either way in the underground on the run, or out of the country on the run the DE become far more motivated than they are in canon to seek out any trace of Voldemort. The signs and rumors of his continued existence were there, it was just that in canon there was little motivation to even begin to seek them out. In this timeline I can easily see a scenario where Voldemort manages to find a way back to a real body far more quickly than in canon.

I could see a scenario where if it wasn't already an adopted tactic death eaters beforehand, death eaters would target their enemies and forcibly make them take the dark mark under duress of some manner whether by use of the Imperius curse, or threats to the life of the target's family. Then after the target has the mark, the DE pass along information covertly to their sympathizers which likely still exist within the Ministry. That would lead to their enemies their enemies being executed legally for their supposed crimes. Sure you'd get some of Voldemort's followers, but you'd also end up executing innocent people too if the no tolerance policy was adopted. Ironically that'd likely be able to draw more people to the DE's cause as a reaction to the ministry's action. The dark lord was dead, and yet the Ministry continues to execute his (supposed) victims who were "forced" to take the mark. You might even see a scenario where there is a schism within the ranks of the death eaters. While some death eaters search for Voldemort, others may co-opt the movement to continue the war against the ministry for a different aim under different leadership. Sure Lucious may not be as powerful as Voldemort, but he could certainly be dangerously charismatic in other ways assuming he wasn't the one who came forward to be executed.

On a final note what would such a ministry do with the mini death eaters? Those who were still in school, not yet ready to take the dark mark themselves, but who certainly sympathized with the cause and now had far more reason to hate the ministry. These children would likely inherit the assets their family's had assuming the ministry didn't try to seize whatever wealth those families had. Assuming the ministry DID try to seize it would the goblins allow them to do so? If they did not would the ministry risk escalating the war even further by risking another goblin rebellion on top of the continued civil war?

All in all I could see this idea leading to a much darker new world in a myriad of ways for Harry to find himself in when he turned 11. Could make for a great fic.

I loved your whole analysis but this particular point is one that I always questioned myself. I think that storywise it makes more sense that the Goblins don't allow this, as it would ease the canon explanation of the death eater's forgiveness in the 1st war.

A country in a post-war setting would be more willing to look to the other side when a rich person is involved. Coco Channel is a perfect example of this, in the real world.

That's a fair point. In canon I truly don't know if that's the case or not, its entirely possible you're right about that. In a fanfic context I would argue the author should be free to determine if that's the case or not. I think it could be well written either way, but personally if I was writing it I wouldn't have it be the case. If it were that case it'd slam the door on what I think could be an interesting plot point to explore. Were I to write it if anyone who has the mark would be able to bestow it upon others. The head-canon I'd run with is that the the spell to grant the dark mark is the same spell used to produced the version raised over the site of a death eater attack. When it is applied to the skin instead of cast into the air, it takes the form of the dark mark that is marked upon death eaters. While Voldemort himself created the spell, I'd write it so that it was possible for those he marked to in turn mark others. I think it's entirely possible that the news of death eaters doing what I suggested would anger Voldemort once he discovers a way back to a body however long that takes. If that was the case he could then forbid death eaters from employing it afterwords, but I think doing so would be a case of him catching the villain idiot ball. Assuming it isn't possible though, I could think of other ways around that restriction too that desperate death eaters may try ranging from Glamour charms applied in a permanent manner to something as mundane as a muggle tattoo or brand to make it a passable enough facsimile to where questions are raised. Are unspeakables or some other manner of subject matter experts verifying at a trial that every mark is legitimately a proper dark mark and not just a forgery? Or is anyone found with the mark subject to summary execution on the spot?

#+end_quote

I'd argue that once again this is a fanon environment so the capacity for the goblins to cooperate or make trouble ultimately is the author's prerogative. That said in canon I think there's enough evidence just from Harry's time in history of magic class to suggest that historically the goblins have been relatively quick to attempt a rebellion when they aren't satisfied with the state of affairs. In this fanon story-line the ministry would be attempting to mount what is essentially a financial coup while in the middle of a decade long civil war that has left it significantly weakened due to both outright losses and covert infiltration by enemy sympathizers. I see several ways the ministry's attempts could be written in this story. You could assume the ministry does have the capacity to force the Goblins to comply with their demands and that they do so without offering any form of concessions to goblins in exchange. At a minimum I think this option is likely to build resentment in the goblins making them more susceptible to possible recruitment by surviving death eaters or a returned Voldemort as he attempted to do with other oppressed magical species in canon. Alternatively the goblins could be convinced to go along with the ministry's plan perhaps if the gold itself remained within the goblin controlled system in ministry maintained vaults. I could easily see a subplot within that manner of story where a non-marked yet sympathetic to the DE cause official within the ministry could either co-opt the money for the cause indirectly, or use it to empower himself while he makes a play for greater power within the ministry. The potential splinter faction I mentioned previously could also easily play into that story line. Both this option and the last option leave a scenario where the families of death eaters are stripped of their wealth, their families are (from their perspective) unjustly executed. That'd be prime recruitment material among the next crop of Hogwarts students once Voldemort returns to a new body. Finally I can see a story where the ministry tries and fails to force the goblins into compliance due to it's weakened state from the civil war. The consequences to this failure could range from anything from a begrudging rebuff from the goblins without a lot of change to the status quo to an outright war between the ministry and the goblins in another all out goblin rebellion.

#+end_quote

I decided to address these last two points together. I think you've got a point about the first part of the first quote, but as it's directly linked with the second idea I still wanted to address it together. While financially it may be somewhat harder with some, a majority, or even all of his richest supporters cut off I think in some ways Voldemort would ultimately have a much easier time of continuing his campaign if he was able to come back sooner. Yes in the short term in the political arena his options may be more limited than in canon, but this is also a timeline where he does not need to rely on supporters to advance his objectives politically as opposed to continuing his terror campaign/civil war. Clausewitz said that war is a continuation of politics by other means, and I think that would very much be the case for Voldemort in this story line. In canon most of his supporters pay lip service to their devotion when Voldemort finally returns, but in truth they were largely content with the status quo that had arisen after his first downfall. They had convinced themselves that their former master was gone for good, and even if he wasn't truly and completely dead he had no realistic way to return to whatever height of power he once held. In canon it took the actions of just two death eaters neither of which had any assets of any significance of their own to see of to return Voldemort to power. What could a properly motivated network of 20 do? Or 200? 2000? The scale of his remaining forces the author decides on ultimately isn't nearly as important as the fact that he'd have significantly more than two sufficiently motivated followers utterly devoted to returning him to power. Completely motivated and largely united in purpose to search out even the faintest whisper of his presence it wouldn't take nearly long enough for him to return. And once he does what would that return from death do psychologically to both his supporters and his enemies? To his supporters it would be a massive moral boost to have their lord back from the dead so soon, and it an absolute affirmation of their fanaticism to him. Yes Harry Potter may have lived, but he did not defeat their lord. And at this most desperate moment he returns to them, ready to rise again and continue what (from their perspective) is a righteous cause. What sort of zealotry would that inspire in his followers? And what sort of terror would it inspire his enemies. Financially a more rapidly re-risen Voldemort may start off on the back foot, but what rallied so many people his cause in the first place was his charisma, and I certainly don't see him lacking in that once he's back. Longer term financially the death eaters could finance operations via liberal use of veiled threats to those who are still wealthy, overt coercion and intimidation against the populace through force, or subtle use of the imperius on useful targets.

I have to say I just started some preliminary work on my own first fic that has nothing to do with the idea that started this thread, but I could envision so many ways you could write this sort of plot hook into a fic in it's own right. Personally I'd really like to try my hand at it at some point. I think it's a plot bunny begging for a proper story, whether it's you, me, or anyone else on the board that happens to come along and see it that writes it.

** 1. Peter and Barty survive ( his mum convinces his dad to let him live & to let her be executed) and Voldemort comes back to life as in canon.

2. Since Lucius is dead, the diary remains hidden in the manor and Dumbledore cannot figure that Voldemort has horcruxes or he will figure it out later than canon.

3. Without an audience, Voldemort may just shoot a killer at Harry at the graveyard and as there's nobody to lie and even if Wormtail lies to Voldemort about Harry's death, Voldemort may have enough time to shoot a killing curse at Harry's back when he's running to grab the portkey.

4. If Sirius is executed under false charges, then the Order never gets No. 12 Grimmauld Place and the hunt for the locket will be prolonged if everything else goes according to canon.

Going by your initial post that doesn't naturally follow. Malfoy not being able to at least reduce his sentence makes it more likely they're also more extreme in case of Sirius and execute him on the spot instead of "just" throwing him into prison without trial.

I assume you have a specific set of circumstances in mind for the start of the story - i.e. all Death Eaters dead and Sirius going free? What might lead to this is the government wanting to root out support for Voldemort on all levels. They still wouldn't necessarily give Sirius a trial but question him to find more unmarked agents and in result discover his innocence (major ramification in Peter getting exposed) or at least weird inconsistencies.

Tangent: there's potential for a (noir) detective story here. Veritaserum seems dependent on the questions asked. For all they know Sirius acted spontaneously, he cannot name a reason why he betrayed the Potters, wasn't instructed by anyone, didn't work with anyone. He is convinced certain people are Death Eaters (similar to Ron thinking all Slytherins are evil) and names those. An auror investigates because someone beloved is implicated. What do they do when saving the beloved comes into conflict with saving Sirius, whose innocence they discovered.
