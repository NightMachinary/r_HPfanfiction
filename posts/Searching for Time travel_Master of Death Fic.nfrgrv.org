:FlairText: What's That Fic? Master of Death
:END:
I'm looking for this fanfic I had read awhile ago, I believe on Archive for our Own, with Harry who time travel back or was reborn as a baby. Lily and James were alive, and he even had two younger brothers. Harry didn't talk as much and was thought to be mute by others. I remembered that he either didn't have normal magic or something, because he couldn't really use a wand, but he had necromancy magic because of Death. He had caught the attention of Voldemort (Who was leaving Harry gifts on his birthday signed with Tom Riddle).

Harry was close with Death, and even let his brothers meet him. He could also travel through Limbo, and met Tom's mother, Mersope or something.

I looked though my bookmarked stories under different tags like "Time Travel", and "Harry Potter Master of Death." I can't find it, and I hope it wasn't deleted.


** oh sounds familliar, but what i am thinking of was a Wrong boy who lived thing but may also be tied into that, sadly cannot remember the title

** I think Nose to the Wind by Batsutousai is the one you're searching. They tagged it as dimension travel not time travel.

  While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right?
