I doubt there would be much of such fics as most authors seem to enjoy re hashing the golden trio or making a bigger group which isn't a bad thing but i prefer a one or duo set up like in the uncharted series, just Nate and sully on a great adventure or i would prefer if it just wasn't so much of the old cast. that's one of the reasons i enjoyed harry potter and the boy who lived by santi so much.

So please, if you know any other good fics out there that doesn't seem so bent on following most of the canons plot and old cast and has a competent and powerful harry/OC. Not interested in pairings that much and would prefer no slash.

some of the fics that i think were top tier : harry potter and the boy who lived, a cadmean victory( got a bit too edgy but at least the author finished it well), jbergs stuff are good too...and that's all i remember of the top of my head. thanks in advance.
