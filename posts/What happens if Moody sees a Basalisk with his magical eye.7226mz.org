** Yeah, I pretty much agree. There's the possibility that it could have some kind of counteracting agent, but that seems both difficult and expensive, and the basilisk's gaze probably gained power as it aged.

EDIT: There is the consideration of just how much detail Moody's eye gives him. If the fake eye mimics human sight exactly, then it would probably work as a filter and petrify him. However, if the Basilisk's eye is not properly defined, then it's power could be greatly weakened, if it worked at all. Even if that was the case, it's still a bigass snake, and moody would probably default to spellcasting rather than trying to pierce it's brain in the few seconds he had to fight it. We don't know how spell resistant the basilisk is, but it is probably dragonlike in it's resistances, which is to say, very.

** If Moody is using his eye and sees it through a wall, he's fine. But if he's in line of sight, then he probably gets the splash damage petrification.

** We know from the books that direct eye contact kills, and indirect eye contact reduces the power of the basilisk's gaze, petrifying the victim. So my first guess would be that it would petrify Moody or have some sort of similarly diminished effect.

My second guess is that it would destroy the eye, but not directly harm Moody. We also know from the book that when someone attempted to take a picture of the basilisk, it damaged the camera and fried the film. So it's established that nothing can hold the image of the basilisk's eyes without damage, person or not. So there's a pretty good chance that the eye would get fried.

The real question we need to answer to figure this out is how exactly Moody's eye works, as there are a number of possibilities that depend on this.

** Moody's eye is definitely a very powerful magical object on its own. He was able to see Harry through his true Cloak of Invisibility for example. It's hard to say what effect magical sight versus optical sight would have on the gaze of a basilisk.

*** I don't believe Harry's cloak has any special attributes over any other cloak of invisiblity. It's just extremely long lasting and does not stop working within a decade or two like all the rest. While I do /like/ the idea of the cloak being super powerful, that doesn't seem to be the case in canon.

**** It's been handed down all the way from Ignotus Peverell to Harry Potter, which means about 400 years, and remains in perfect condition. That alone makes it more than just a normal invisibility cloak. Add in that it's been shown to be spell resistant, and it doesn't matter if Death itself granted it to Ignotus or it turns out he was just a master craftsman. It still remains a powerful magical artifact.

***** True, but the question is whether it grants /more/ invisibility, when working, than a regular cloak does. Being long-lasting or spell-resistant may set it apart from other cloaks in practice, but that is irrelevant to the matter at hand.

** My theory of how the Deadly Basilisk Gaze works is that for some reason, the saying that "eyes are a window to the soul" is literally true in the Potterverse --- which is also why Occlumency works through eye contact. In a more malevolent exploitation of this link, the Basilisk Gaze has the same effect as a Killing Curse, namely severing the soul from the body. When the Basilisk's curse is filtered through something else however, the weakened magic ends up Petrifying the victim instead rather than performing as planned.

So it all comes down to how Moody's Eye works rather than how the Basilisk Gaze does. Does it work like a normal muggle prosthetic, only with an enchanted lense so that the picture it sends back to Moody's brain is infinitely better than a normal eye's? Or is it more arcane magic directly connected to Moody's own magic and soul? In the first case, someone bring Mandrake Draught immediately, but in the second... goodbye Moody.

** In /Harry Potter and the Iron Lady,/ the Basilisk caused petrification.

[[/spoiler][But it also caused the magical Eye to be destroyed, and shards of it pierced Moody's brain and killed him.]]
