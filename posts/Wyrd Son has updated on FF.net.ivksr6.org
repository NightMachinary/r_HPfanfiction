The premise of Wyrd Son is that Harry is somehow magically transported to the Kingdom of Lancre on the Discworld, where he's raised by Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick. The style of the fic uses Harry Potter characters to create some of the absurd and punny shenanigans expected of Discworld style. Of course, the author is no Pratchett, and few of the jokes truly land the way Pratchett could make you chuckle while making a profound point about life.

I'd still recommend this fic to anyone who enjoys both franchises and would like to see what a blend of the two could be like.

  Maybe the insanity of the wizarding world isn't best countered with logic and rationality but by a more resilient sort of insanity. Alt Upbringing in which Harry ends up in the hands of the Wyrd Sisters and is excited to become the very best witch he can be.
