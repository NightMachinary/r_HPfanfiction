I am tired of reading a fanfiction where they describe Hermione as having curly hair and then she finally manages to tame it and make it look better and we discover that she "just learned that hairs should be brushed, now would you look at that!". The girl has curly hair for goodness sake, she should not be brushing it AT ALL! Let alone say that that was the reason for her beautiful hair. So, as many have butchered Hermione's hair over the years, here's a reasonable guide to Hermione's(and anyone's) curly hair.

1. If you want Hermione's hair to be a frizzball and as bushy as you could possibly imagine, make her brush it as many times as you want. That is good for her younger character since she is a child that a) does not know how to take care of her hair(most pre-teens don't), b) she just doesn't care and c) she's stuck up and doing something as "unnatural" as not brushing one's hair would seem ridiculous to her. If she brushes it, she'll destroy her curl pattern, triple it in size and it will look similar to a broom. Plus, there are hormones to consider, since she's just entering puberty and her hair will definitely suffer for it.

2. If you want a 5th, 6th year Hermione with a more defined curl pattern and tamer hair, then brushes are not allowed within 10 meters of a dry curly hair. It is also normal that her hair should be a little easier to tame by her sixth year, cause she's 17 and that's usually when your hair tends settle into its own style. Before that her hormones would be raging a war against her hair. The key for her taming her hair(without any muggle products nor LITTERS of sleekeazy, mind you) is to wash it, comb it ou detangle it while wet and let it settle and dry into it's own pattern. It will problably still be very voluminous, but it will be less frizzy and not bushy since the curl pattern is not being slaughtered by a brush.

3. For stories that take place during the war or while they were on the run. Her hair, as well as Ron's and Harry's, should be lankier and dull. They can't wash it properly so it will get oily af, and you wouldn't believe what stress and worries can do to your hair. It should be a lifeless tangle of curls, and definitely thinner.

4. I will repeat it, brushes are her worst enemy. So, if you want her to start caring and having better hair, cut the scene where she's taking care of herself in a mirror, brushes her hair and it looks beautiful! It problably looks way worse now she's brushed it and way bushier. If you want her to continue not caring for what her hair looks like, brush it away.

5. Curly hair is not wavy hair. Stop describing it as wavy, if you want it to be curly.

6. It is normal for curly hair to tangle. And it is not as easy to run your fingers through it as it would be with straight hair. Expect her lover to get their fingers "stuck" in there now and then.

7. Curly hair can be soft. If she takes good care of it, it can be really soft. It will not avoid tangling, though.

8. The shorter the curly hair, the bigger it gets. If she cuts her hair short, it will not become more manageable, it might be worse, cause it will have no weight to it and it will grow in volume. The heavier the hair, the less voluminous it gets. Decide which one you want Hermione to have before describing it.

I think that's about it. I hope this helps someone. I know is not such a big deal, but having curly hair, everytime Hermione passes a brush through hers, a part of me dies. And then if the result is a super brilliant and defined hair, that part of me that died is now being tortured in hell. Besides it pulls me right out of the story.

Thanks for reading my tips/ passive aggressive rant!

Edit: I'm not making a case for Canon Hermione. My post is directed towards fanfiction that have Hermione as a curly haired witch. Nothing more. If a fanfic doesn't have Hermione's hair as curly, that's just fine by me. But if it is curly, don't butcher it hahaha. And you see canon Hermione however you want ;) Edit 2: even if her hair is not described as curly in a fic, is wavy or straight, but still described as bushy, she still shouldn't be dry brushing it, it wil only make it bushier.


** This! This! This! I also have thick, curly, frizzy hair. Let me add a few more things.

1) The shorter the hair, the bigger it gets. Mine gets super curly and bouncy when I've cut it short. Almost ringlet curls. If it's long, it has some weight on it to drag it down.

2) Frizziness comes from several different things. If it's dry and damaged, it will frizz up. Also, new hair will often appear frizzy around temples. This is especially true for puberty, when hair naturally gets thicker and curlier. When I was 12 and 13, I had little baby hairs on my hairline that stuck straight up. I used to always go to the bathroom and pat them down with water.

3) You might not have to wash thick hair everyday. That would dry it out. It's better to go every third day or so. To wash and dry thick hair is a long process, so it might take us awhile. When I was playing sports as a kid, I would just throw my hair up in to a ponytail as soon as I got out of the shower, but it still took 20-30 minutes to wash it when it was long. And as OP said, absolutely no brushes. A wide-tooth comb in the shower will do the trick.

That's exactly what I meant for her younger years. You can't control your pre-teen/teen hair. There's baby hairs that make you look like crazy, there's the person not knowing how to take care of hair and there's the freaking hormones that will play a big part in your adolescence years.

DEFINITELY! I wash it 3 times a week and many people tell me it's a lot already. It takes forever to dry, but having very voluminous hair but still thin, it doesn't take that long to wash it. And for me ponytails mark the hair so much, that I only wear them pre-washing day, cause there's no way it will go back to normal.

That's one of the most important. The hair will curl more and I said it up there because I've seen so many instances of war!Hermione cutting her hair to make it more manageable but not shaving her head because is not attractive i guess??? The only thing she managed with cutting her hair soulder or chin length is to make it even bigger, even if more defined.

**** If your hair is curly I'd skip the shampoo, it dries out the hair and makes it frizzy. Curly hair, even wavy hair, needs the natural oils from non shampooing to get its definition. If you don't want to cut out shampoo entirely they make low poo which is good for wavy/curly texture too

** I have straight, thin, baby fine hair, but I went through "the poodle years" with perms, and also my youngest sister has thick, curly hair. This is spot on! Curly hair should NEVER be brushed.

Most of those stories are clearly written by people with straight hair, who not only don't have a clue, but clearly mentally judge people with awesomely wild curly hair (I'm thinking Melina Kanakaredes in CSI: New York) as unkempt.

ETA: I didn't know puberty affected curly hair. The more you know. *shooting star*

Puberty is hell for hair. Puberty is hell in general, like, your skin is a mess, your whole body changes, the desires you start to feel are strange, etc etc. BUT, no one talks about how it also affects your hair and that's why most people have extremely different hair in comparison to their younger years. And also there's the rebel years where we cut it the wrong way, drown the hair in dye or bleach and those things kids won't really care about haha.

** I have hair very much like (how I always imagined) Hermione's. Something I feel I should mention is that curly hair (of this sort) generally holds whatever shape you put it in after a long enough time. This means straightening and braiding and other hair manipulating techniques tend to work especially well, where straight hair often won't hold a curl or will fall out of braids, etc. I used to French braid my hair, and then after a few hours I'd take out the hair tie because it would stay without one.

Also, curly hair generally takes much longer to look oily, and when it does, it won't be as obvious as for someone with straight hair. Different people have different levels of oil production, but curly haired folks usually don't have enough. I, personally, can go about two weeks before it is visually obvious. It will still make it look thinner and hold less curl though.

And, finally, the knots. Curly hair that is taken care of doesn't actually have as much knotting as straight hair. Most of the time, you can (disastrously) run a brush all the way through curly hair until the last few inches. You know that makeover scene from the Princess Diaries with the stylist trying to run his brush through and it gets caught? That won't happen unless you've already brushed it dry and made a mess of your curl pattern. HOWEVER, if Hermione was anything like me at age 13, she probably often left her hair in braids or the same pony tail and didn't brush it for a few weeks... this causes matting. It looks like dreads, but it's all one bit chunk (or a few if she braided the same sections) and it's not healthy for that kind of hair the way coil-y hair can handle dreads naturally. It would take HOURs to untangle, she'd loose a ton of hair, and it would hurt quite a bit.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk, please treat Hermione well.

My hair doesn't knot a lot, not like straight hair has those tiny knots over the hair, but it does tangle in lots of sections, and when I run my fingers through it, they only get stuck at the very end.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes!! I can go for about 6/7 days without washing it, any longer and it's stuck to the crown of my head. Not cool at all hahaha. But it is different for different people. Still, curly hair shouldn't be washed every day. If not for the health of the hair, for the amount of time it takes to dry(a drying spell could work tho, but would probably do more damage than good)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Mine just straightens with a straightening iron, but it looks very naturally straight when I do it, and it holds for a week without washing and doesn't look oily. However, I can control the curl pattern by the amount of scrunching I do right out of the shower. Leaving it just combed usually softens the curls, while scrunching it hard produces ringlets. And ponytails or any hairdo when taken off leaves it extremely marked. But my plaits hold like a charm.

and yes, please treat Hermione well!

*** Omg yes about the straight hair and knotting & curls. My pin-straight Asian hair gets knotted as soon as the wind blows, causing me no small amount of frustration and agony. Those Asian dramas/movies where the characters' straight hair is always perfect and neat? COMPLETE BS. I was always so jealous of my curly-haired and wavy-haired friends who could curl/wave their hair for school in 10 minutes and who had never experienced how absolutely frustrating it is to curl your hair over several hours only for it to fall apart a couple hours later. It took me more than 10 years to figure out how to get curls to properly stay.

It's also a bonus that it helps keep our often fine strands of hair from getting split ends. Just be aware that it does smell a bit... champagne-y? But the smell will decrease in strength after about 30 min. Hoped this helped, let me know how it turns out if you decide to try it! 😊

But many authors see hair as this untouchable institution and the the defining aspect of a girl's beauty. The simply refuse to make her shave it and instead make her cut it just making it worse.

I said this in another reply: "The hair will curl more if you cut and I said it up there because I've seenso many instances of war!Hermione cutting her hair to make it more manageable but not shaving her head because is not attractive i guess???

** Yes! Thank you! This is awesome.

When I cut my hair short I called it the pyramid effect, it just puffed out into a horrid triangle thing and there wasn't enough length for the curls to settle.

If anyone is interested, I would add a couple of interesting (maybe?) details based on my own curly hair experiences:

- It's easy to 'hide' the true length of your hair, so people tend be surprise if they see you with hair wet. When dry, my hair sits around the middle of my back (bottom of the shoulder blades) but when its combed out after a shower its down to my hips.
- If someone wears their hair up in a pony tail or bun, they may end up with a straight layer of hair over the top, with the curls hidden underneath. This can also cause the pyramid effect.
- Probably not as much an issue with magic, but you have to commit to a style. I wear my hair tied up a lot, so I do comb that top/outer layer and once done I cant style it curly without washing my hair to 'reset' it. If I style it naturally and let the curls free, there is so much volume that it's very hard to get it tied up again.
- Finally, and I don't know if it's just me, but I swear my hair adapts to anti-frizz products. Something will work for a while but then the power of the frizz overwhelms it lol. I feel like this could be used to humorous effect, especially in a world with magic hair products and talking mirrors!

She can have good hair, but as she states for Harry in Goblet of Fire, she just thinks is not worth it to waste so much time with hair, and the Yule ball was just an especial occasion.

My hair used to tangle around my bag straps in the 5mins between classes, and the only way I could wear it down was spraying it into submission with leave in conditioner ánd detangler/anti frizz. It calmed down around when I was 17. Part of that was learning the balance between taking care of it and 'loving abandonment' but it's structure also just mellowed out because I could never have gotten away with just washing it, no further products, in my teens and I can now.

** OH MY FRICKING GOD THANK YOU. You have done God's work here, I agree with everything! /Please/ let her hair be tangled and wild, that's how frizzy bushy hair works! In fact so many people with curly hair go through the same process: they brush their hair when they're younger and once they grow older and figure out what is best for their hair, they stay away from brushes and started taking better care of their hair!

Personally, I was always confused how Hermione's hair is never tied up, in a ponytail, or away from her face when she works. As another person with curly hair that frizzes A LOT, having my hair in my face while I work is the most annoying thing in the world for me. It's hot, makes me feel scratchy, and it's just easier to keep under control and neat when it's tied away while working. Even if she didn't tie it up regularly, I imagine it would be even worse while doing potions, with all the fumes frizzing up hair, with your hair getting in the way too. Major security concern for everyone with longer hair in general. And of course, most of the time, Hermione is practical.

I HEAR YOU! YES! IT'S ANNOYING AF. and besides, how is it not potions safety procedure to have to tie one's hair. Is just like in a muggle chemistry lab in schools. There's tons of safety procedures, and tying one's hair is one of them. And a strand of hair could fall into a potion and react badly. So she def should tie her hair even if not for personal choice.

Don't have to imagine this, we definitely have a scene in the books where this happens. I think it's in HBP in their first potions class with Slughorn, when they're competing for the Felix. Harry's like "OMG my potion is perfect! LOL at Hermione slaving away over that while her hair goes mushroom cloud." TL;DR theory confirmed.

I was in my 20s before I learned about Biosilk and such. When it comes to Hermione's hair, I think a lot of it has to do with people not being experienced with curls. Though there is also the fact that Rowling never described Hermione as having curls, and she also based Hermione on herself. Does JK have secretly curly hair?

My wife is a [[/r/curlyhair][r/curlyhair]] girl and I'm constantly hearing about the intricacies of the art and science of managing hair properly. As a dedicated world builder, I have of course converted this into fodder for my AU fanfic, and now I have suites of spells and potions for various hair needs. Squish to condish? There's a charm for that. Need more protein? There's a potion for that. And so on.

So yeah, I have Hermione be OCD about brushing her hair because "that's how it's done" and won't listen to "wizarding foolishness" and "impractical and vain" charms etc. Gradually as she matures and opens up more to the WW having some things to offer she starts trying some of them more and learns how to properly care for her hair. It's not her being slovenly and then suddenly taking care of herself, it's her being stubborn and then learning to be more humble.

My theory: everybody hates their hair. People with curly hair wish they had straight hair, while straight-haired people long for curls. Thin-haired people envy thick-haired people, and vice versa.

I used to wear my hair long, but after having it short for years in the military, tried growing it out and couldn't stand that it was was always in my way, especially when trying to sleep, so I keep it mostly at shoulder length (it's grown out a bit now so I keep it in a ponytail or clip).

Lots of talk about manipulating Keratin bonds at different temperatures and discussions of how moisture affects them. It's a fun sub-plot because the skills she gains from doing that are later used to make badass war weapons, so there's a point to it besides "let's make Hermione's hair manageable."

*** Get your point, but if your going to write a fanfic and you're going to use "curly" as a descriptor, you should do it justice. And I think the movies also made me and lots of people biased. And a curly hair can be bushy, is not really mutually exclusive. So, it's kinda safe to say, that even if it's not canon, it's definitely fanon by this point. But sure, she /is/ described as having bushy hair, not curly, but as it has been many years since I last reread the whole thing, I can't say for sure if it is never ever used to describe her hair.

***** Every Hermione centered fic describes it as curly, so idk. But is rly up to the writer. And although bushy does not imply it is curly, does not imply any other type of hair either, so it's anyone's guess. Is not really a very good descriptor. Like Harry has all types of description for his hair, we can paint a clear picture, hermione has one word. The movies have her with a curly hair with the exception of the 1st(but for me that's a heavily brushed curly hair) so I guess that's the image that stuck around. Again, idk, it's just something I got tired of seeing. If someone doesn't describe it as curly, that's just fine by me. But if they do, just do it right so the story can feel more real.

I think at best it can be described as wavy. But mostly it just looks like straight hair.

Also I think the only adjectives used to describe Harry's hair are "black" and "messy".

******* Hermione's hair in the first two is what's called crimping. It's basically a hot iron with a wavy pattern. Definitely not bushy or curly. I hate it.

******* The 1st and 2nd images are definitely curls, they are loose, but they are curls. And specially throughout the 4th, 5th and 6th movie she has way more defined curls. And the deathly hallows one just proves my point of how her hair would probably change while on the run. Curl patterns are not consistent. For example, if my hair is brushed straight out of the shower and I leave it to air dry without arranging the curls just right, it wil look way straighter than it should, specially if it's longer because the weight will pull it down. I would still describe it as curly tho.

******** I think that's a stretch, to be honest. None of the pics depict someone whose hair curls naturally. They depict someone with straight hair who either 1) hasn't brushed it so it's a bit messy or 2) has curled parts of their straight hair around tongs.

*** At the same time, many people with bushy hair just have curly hair that is brushed out. And assuming it isn't that and it truly is just bushy, if fanfic writers choose to write it as curly, which many do, this would be very helpful.

Providing a writing resource is one thing. But that was not OP's (original) intention. Rather, OP was making argument that Hermione's hair /is/ curly and that any writer who describes it otherwise has "butchered" it:

#+begin_quote
  The girl has curly hair for goodness sake, she should not be brushing it AT ALL! Let alone say that that was the reason for her beautiful hair. So, as many have butchered Hermione's hair over the years, here's a reasonable guide to Hermione's (and anyone's) curly hair. [...] I know is not such a big deal, but having curly hair, everytime Hermione passes a brush through hers, a part of me dies.

***** As the OP, I can say for sure what my intention was. As [[/u/MiserableSpell][u/MiserableSpell]] stated, the post was targeted at people who do write Hermione as a curly haired witch. Or people that want to write her as that. Or people who are tired of seeing curly hair care being butchered. I did not mean that any other type of hair is butchering the character's description. I meant that if you do write her as curly haired, do us a favor and search how such hair works.\\
The trigger for this post was a fanfic I was reading where Hermione's hair is constantly referred as curly and she sees an amazing result after brushing it. That's what I meant. Nothing more. Never meant to offend anyone not even the ones who butcher it, it was a little aggressive, but never meant to hurt.

That is clearly not referring to canon. I'm not making a point for her canon hair. At all. Rephrasing it: "If the girl has curly hair for goodness sake, she should not be brushing it AT ALL!"

I meant me. I have curly hair and a part of me will die everytime curly haired Hermione passes a brush through hers ;)

****** Sort of unrelated but I am curious as to how the author of the fic you read seemed to know that people with curly hair usually don't brush their hair (hence why when Hermione /does/ brush her hair it gives a different result as usual), but didn't seem to wonder /why/ curly-haired people don't brush their hair? That's really interesting! (...or of course they could just assume that bushy wild hair is the result of not "taking care" of hair)

******* I'm afraid is the parenthesis option... They seemed to think that her hair was a mess because she was simply not brushing it enough, or at all in that case. And that's why it was so untidy and untamed. And then she brushed it and /BAM/, perfect hair! Hahaha

***** I see OP as having two intentions here: both to provide 'pro-tips' (and these really are helpful for anybody who wants to write this sort of Hermione) and to, as you say, make an argument that Hermione's hair is curly. While Hermione's hair could definitely be just bushy (I'm not saying that it is absolutely not), I think OP was targeting those who write Hermione's hair as curly. And honestly, there is an argument to be made that her hair /could/ be curly. /So many/ people think their hair is just bushy growing up (me included- I was even called Hermione Granger sometimes) and find out it is curly later on in life. Not to mention Hermione does appear to have a vague curl pattern in some of the movies, encouraging this idea. She can be relatable to a lot of people and seeing /that/ depiction butchered in fanfiction, where a lot of people describe her hair as curly, annoys some people.

I do agree, however, that writing her hair as anything other than curly, like just bushy, does /not/ mean butchering her hair. I'll just assume the best and assume that OP just doesn't like it when a curly-haired Hermione is written in the way they describe (though of course they could just mean any non-curly Hermione is butchered, which is wrong).

** What sort of magic would be good for hair stuff for Hermione? What would a fast drying charm do, and would it be better at a certain temperature? Also I was thinking about some sort of charm or potion that would make it look like curly hair was subtly glowing, sort of through the curls like hair advert lighting, maybe when the person moves (Katniss fire dress style). Feel like that would look cool on Hermy on account of her magic level hair volume

*** If it involves magic, I think you're free to make it up as you want. I've seen many instances of drying charm frizzing up the hair more than it should, and not only with Hermione. And if it's anything like a blow dryer, it should be avoided at all costs rs. I really liked your potion idea! Go for it, invent it away, don't see why not! (For the temperature, for my hair texture, the lady who used to do my hair told me to never go higher then 190/200 degrees(celsius) and never without heat protector. About magic in general, we know sleekeazy worked although she had to use lots on her hair and it straightened it. So perhaps a magic line of cosmetics? Something Parvati and Lavender would talk about all the time. Or some beauty spells to define the curls or end the frizz at least, but unless forced, I don't think Hermione would come near those ahaha. Hope this helps ;)

*** In one of my fics, I gave her a silver wide-toothed comb inscribed with ancient runes, a shopping bag full of potions, and a scroll of instructions. I didn't go into detail, but the end result was a cascade of gleaming ringlets. Of course, she complained about the frivolity of it all.

** I don't know if this is with all curly hair or just mine but If I go to bed with wet hair (I typically get showers at night) and I sleep on my side, half of my hair will be straight and the other half will be curly +I suspect it's just a my hair thing because my hair started growing curly out of the blue last year+

** This! I have wavie curles. (It was a nightmare befor I got hormone under control). I love short hair, but sadly, the shorter my hair, the more it frizzes if I do anything to it other then letting it air dry. Currently, my hair is past my shoulders(i normally keep it to my ears) and because my hair is heavy I have more wave than a curl (soon it will be pulled straight). If I want it to curl( without using things such as irons and blow dryers) I have to towel my hair dry, and even then I risk the frizz. And when I mean frizz, I mean the size of my head.

Also! I personally don't use a lot of conditioner because of how much oil my hair traps. It also tends to way it down, so For Hermione during times of stress, specifically test and finals time, I would recommend her hair looking less frizzy and more shiny. Greasy. She would also likely do everything in her power to pull it back and out of the way at that time. She's to busy studying to deal with the added oil and witness to would need. But, after the stress is gone she would most likely up her shower time(as well as shampoo amount) for ~ a week to try and get it more manageable.

These are simply my tips as someone with similar hair. Also! Don't recommend bangs! Again, shorter the hair, more bounce it has.

*** Curly hair tends to be very dry, mine is not as much, so I still use lots of conditioner to help hold it down and it last for a week without ever looking oily. It depends of what the author wants to do with Hermione, I guess, but within the limits of a curly hair please dear authors.

And about the stress, YES! Your hair suffers a lot during stressful time and it become duller. And with Hermione, I think that she would run her hands through her hair a lot durings final and such, i know I do. I'm really like Hermione with school and college and everytime I take a break from writing to think, my hands are up in my hair, running through it, putting it in a low pony and undoing it... if it's teste week, it becomes an oily mess.

** This was a really interesting read. Makes me sad I killed my Hermione and Ron off in the backstory of the AU.

Actually, related question: how would Hermione be best off disguising her hair assuming she had no access to potions?

*** Well, if is disguising like going undercover and such, I would really resort to a transfiguration spell. If she can't spell and doesn't have access to muggle products, I would just braid it very tightly, like a french braid or a fish tail(while still wet is the best), but if she's disguising herself, her face would be more exposed.
