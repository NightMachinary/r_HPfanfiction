From what I remember, they meet by literally running into each other and they might be hiding from Filch? They become friends and there's another chapter where Harry spends the holidays with Tonks' parents when he's maybe 2nd/3rd year. I'm not sure if it's an eventual pairing or just a friendship.


** Harry Potter and the Halfblood Auror? It fits the description although I'm pretty sure Harry meets Tonks' parents in his 5th year. Author deleted his/hers ffnet account but you can find the fic's copy [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=23314&page=3][here]].

  "That date was the reason I was shocked to death when I saw that troll. Of course my hero Harry then came to save me and defeat the big bad troll." Tonks ended dramatically, placing a sloppy kiss on Harry's red cheek. He would die before he admitted this to her, but when she said that, he felt rather proud of himself.

** Old Friends, new friends.

Can't link from mobile but its definitely this story. Up until 4th year it is awesome and heartwarming but the ending is not satisfying.
