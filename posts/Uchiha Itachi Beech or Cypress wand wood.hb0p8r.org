Beech: for those who are young and wise beyond their years, rich in understanding and experience

Cypress: for those who will die a heroic death.


** I feel like he leans more towards cypress. The Pottermore description references nobility and the son of the head of Uchiha clan does show a higher standing than most other people. It also has masters of a “self-sacrificing” nature and that fits Itachi really well. Beech wands apparently possess a lot of “subtlety” and “artistry” and while I'd associate both with Itachi, not many concrete examples of either trait come to mind. Maybe his genjutsu abilities for “artistry” but that's all I can think of at the moment.
