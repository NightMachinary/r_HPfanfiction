It's rather baffling that this theme is as underused as it is, I can only mentioon Magicks of the Arcane, if anyone knows of another one PLEASE recomend, I don't read slash by the way so don't bother with those


** The classic (and, arguably, best) story of this type would be linkffn(5201703) and sequel, linkffn(5971274).

I wrote a Dumbledore mentor story as well (/Dagger and Rose/) but it hasn't aged well and I wouldn't recommend anyone read it nowadays. (Hence, no link.)

*** Bullshit. Dagger and Rose is still a great story. It needs some touch ups and revisions, but it introduced some decent balanced magic where there is still challenge for the main character, and opponents that are beyond him that he has to face. It is above and beyond most stories, and into the fantastic.

Still, if you didn't like it anymore, and are still into fanfiction, I'd recommend you rewrite it to improve the story how you think it needs it.

Shit, when I saw the title of this post, I immediately thought of Dagger and Rose.

**** Heh, I wasn't trolling for compliments but thanks nonetheless. It does need a fierce rewrite, not the least of which because I'm a decade older and more experienced as a writer than when I penned it, my rookie novel.

I'm about 2/3 of the way though (I'll often download a chapter or two and work it when taking a longish flight) and I'll post on here when it's done and re-uploaded.

***** I've been reading StrangerOrders rewrite of Gaemon the DragonSteel, an ASOIAF story, and the way he said he's doing it is by taking what he intended, looking at where the flaws were, and reworking the story so that he's telling the same thing, just, without those.

That might be helpful? I'unno. And yeah, I'm a bit of an arsehole, I won't compliment someones work if I think it's shit. I look forward to seeing it. If you want feedback while writing, I'd recommend posting it to a fiction forum while you're doing it. SufficientVelocity is pretty good at feedback.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I'm kind of glad that it's underused. To make it work, you have to rewrite Harry's character to the point where his name might as well be "Herman": make him much smarter, more diligent, more motivated to learn magic beyond immediate need.

Otherwise, what's the point? Harry is plenty bright, but he finds the Hogwarts curriculum challenging enough, and that's with being taught slowly and in detail. What could Dumbledore teach him that someone whose time is less valuable couldn't?

***** as you said, it comes down to taste, I always found canon Harry both unremarkable and unrealistic.

unremarkable because he is always flying by the seats of his pants, the only I remember him doing something to preapare for the threats ahead of him is when he learns the patronus

unrealistic, because he doesn't behave like a child that is subject to neglect, physical and psycological abuse from such early age

****** The way I see it, if you're going to rewrite Harry's personality from scratch, have the integrity to name him something else. If Harry is an inadequate protagonist, pick a different character to be the protagonist.

The Dursley abuse is the literary equivalent of cartoon violence. They exist only to provide a mundane foil to the amazing wizarding world. When it comes to their effect on Harry, one might as well complain about lack of symptoms of concussion in Daffy Duck 30 seconds after Bugs Bunny dropped an anvil on his head.

For that matter, are you /sure/ you want to be "realistic" in that respect? Most fics that seek to portray the consequences of Dursley abuse "realistically" go one of two ways:

1. Make him out to be this scrappy badass (who is also very scholarly, plans ahead, etc.). Is that actually more realistic?
2. Make him meek and helpless. For some reason, fics like that tend to be slash, with Harry being the bottom.

******* in respect of it being "cartoon violence": yes you are rigth, the fact that in the first book Harry doged being hit ,with a frying pan I believe it was, witout so much as a major remark, does make it look like cartoon violence.

the thing is that HP books doesn't feel like cartoons exept for certain especific parts

In regards of making him more "realistic": is not about being necesarily realistic, is about being compeling, canon Harry Potter is a rather unremarkable kid that when push come to shove saves the day by the seat of his pants, while avoiding dead by the skin of his teeth, just because that what he does, he doesn't really have much character growth until year 5 and even then I don't really fing the growth compelling

about "having the integrity to name him something else": the thing is that even though I don't like Harry, the fact remains that he is the Hero of the story, if I just take an wall paper character or make an OC It would feel like a satellite charater to the "real story".

Dursleys, in particular, are cartoonish in every way.

Realism was about the impact of Dursleys' abuse. I think that given that he was practically unaffected by that, how little planning and preparation canon Harry does is unrelated to that.

Harry is only the hero because he's the BWL. So, if you want to replace him with a different character, just indicate it by renaming the BWL; call him "Nathan Potter", or something.

It's about doing what is right versus what is easy. For example, Belial666, when writing a clever Muggleborn witch in Slytherin in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/1/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House]]), chose to replace Hermione with an OC, because they felt that it was too much of a personality rewrite to call the protagonist "Hermione Granger". They would have certainly gotten far more readers had they not done that, but they chose integrity over readership. (Ironically, I believe that the reason they thought it was too much of a rewrite is that they had bought into the AuthorityWorshipper!Hermione fanon.)

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
