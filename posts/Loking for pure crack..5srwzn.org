Looking for a very cracky harry story. Preferably something with a harry from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby]]. Or similer to him and ones that are difficult to find and at least up to fourth year or beyond.


** Well, if you don't already know him, the master of HP crack is arguable [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][nonjon]], and his most popular story is linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon).

This story is extremly well-written crack, with /some/ plot in the middle. Other than that? I personally liked linkffn(4536005).

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]] is a time travel one that has a similarly murder happy Harry. You've likely read it already though.
