Do you know how absolutely annoying this is. Like Phoenixes are supposed to be LIGHT CREATURES SO DONT LINK THEM WITH DARK HARRY BE IT FAMILIAR OR ANIMAGUS FORM.

I remember reading â€˜Rise of the dark angel' and Hedwig was actually a phoenix in disguise. This didn't bother me that much considering this was technically a grey harry fanfic.

But oh god in â€˜Dark repercussions' Harry's animagus form was a phoenix that I literally had to switch to another fanfic for a bit. Like in this story Harry is a feared assassin named Sang Lys. He has killed, raped, tortured and called muggle borns mud-blood constantly AND HIS ANIMAGUS FORM IS A PHOENIX????

Like if you are going to write a Dark harry don't link him with Phoenixes


** A phoenix adds to the badass, edgelord factor. And who doesn't like Dark Harry getting yet another bonus power (Phoenix-Apparition whenever and wherever he wants) which doesn't end up doing much for the plot anyway?

You ain't a proper Dark Harry unless you:

- Visited Gringotts.

- Got that inheritance test revealing Dumbles' blocks and machinations.

- Found that grimoire or two in the vaults.

- Got a super extendable trunk.

- Swapped your shitty canon!wand for an overclocked Quad-Core wand featuring something to do with Slytherin.

- Got a (Dark) phoenix instead of some shitty snowy owl. Like, who needs to be a normie anyway?

- Have at least one of the above do nothing for the plot, and never be mentioned again after the Diagon Alley trip.

- Hate the 'Light'.

- Literally ride the slash with Draco and/or Voldemort and/or Lucius and/or [insert random male Death Eater]. The more the better.

*** I second this comment

He also must have infinite magic and thus doesn't actually need a wand, but keeps his wand just for blending in

**** And whenever anyone checks his magical^{TM} core^{TM} power^{TM} level^{TM,} it always has to be an absurd arbitrary number that just so happens to be bigger than Dumbledore, Voldemort and Merlin combined. Of course 90% of this has been blocked by Dumbledork, but with the power of goblin magic and/or an underage orgy he can break the bindings and use his ultimate power.

***** And of course, as this is a dark!Harry fic, it must be noted that the 90% of Harry's magic that was blocked was dark magic (as all magic is inherently divided into dark, light and neutral magic of course) and dark magic is actually just magic that is just more powerful or misunderstood

(I've never seen an underage orgy unblock Harry's core block?)

****** What started as a reply to your comment just kept on getting longer and longer until i decided to just post it as it's own story. I've had writer's block for the past couple of weeks and barely worked on my WIP, yet I somehow managed to churn this out in the middle of the night lmao. Thinking back, the underage orgy was used to destroy the scarcrux rather than Dumbledore's magic binding of doom because of course the purest form of love involves a harem doing harem things.

** Umm can someone provide a source in the books that claim Phoenixs are exclusivly light creatures. Just went through the fan wiki page on it and it make no mention of that. It just says that Phoenixs are really hard to domesticate and are therefore rare. I think Phoenixs being light creatures is fanon based on Dumbledore being the only person to have one.

** Dumbledore had ideas of subjugating the muggles and showing them their place together with Grindelwald when he was younger, then he knowingly let Harry be abused for 10 years, isolated him after he went through extremely traumatic events, and raised him for the sole purpose of having him die, yet Fawkes is completely okay with this.

Phoenixes being "light" is fanon and I see no problems with Dark Harry having a Phoenix as a familiar or an animagus form.
