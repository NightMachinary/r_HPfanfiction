I've been messing around with writing a short fanfic and I've been thinking about the writing process. I'm interested in hearing how others approach it, specifically:

- Do you outline a story before starting to write?

- If yes, to what degree? A simple list of plot points you want to hit, the series of transitions, every scene in detail (almost like a screenplay)?

- Do you find you constrain yourself by outlining, i.e, is something lost in the creative process by setting limits before starting?

- If you write with no outline at all, how do you keep track of all your ideas, what to include and what to remove?


** Some people can write as stream-of-thought while others (such as myself) prefer to do things in a more organized fashion. It really just depends on what you're most comfortable with. I would recommend however, that any writer ought to have an understanding of what it is they want to write about, what major points they want to hit, and where they want to end up. How much more detailed you go from there is really up to personal preference, but without knowing where you want to go with your writing you're liable to end up writing yourself into a corner with no idea where to go from there. Additionally, by having a goal in mind, you have a conclusion to strive for and complete, without which it becomes easy to meander off on tangents or simply loose interest in the work. Don't make your goal too lofty though, keep it reasonable and achievable with consideration to how much time and effort you intend to spend on the project; remember you can always set a new goal once you reach the first.

** For long fics I plan it all out. Timelines, xhapter by chapter synopsis, quotes/clues i have to get in, the whole shebang. I usually deviate quite a lot, but it helps me get my thoughts in order and generally keep on track. For short humour/romance one shots, I just see what happens as I write. :)

** My planning process:

Step 1: establish the beginning and the end.

Step 2: Break the story into three arcs: beginning, middle, and end. Working backwards from the ending, establish a major plot development that occurs at the end of each arc.

Step 3: Go into each arc and establish the basic steps that are required to take the story from the beginning of that arc to its ending. One chapter for each step of plot progress.

Step 4: Come up with some subplots, find ways to tie them into the central plotpoints already decided on, and disperse said subplots across the chapters.

You now have a chapter plan that tells you what has to be achieved by the end of each chapter. That is where I stop my pre-story planning.

Step 5: Before writing each chapter, familiarise yourself with what that chapter needs to achieve from your chapter plan. Think of a series of scenes that will achieve that goal. This is your scene plan.

Step 6: Write the chapter.

** So my writing process is a bit odd, but it works for me. First, I print out a month by month calendar that will span the timeline of the story, including any relevant backstory. I go through the calendar and mark down any fixed events, birthdays, start and end of term and holiday breaks, things like that. Then I get out the sticky notes. I write down plot points that I want to include on the sticky notes and stick them on the calendar. I can adjust things until the chapter is written, but once I actually write the plot point, it gets written on the calendar and the sticky note gets tossed.

I do it this way because I really need a visual representation of the passing of time. I want to look at the calendar and know that I've got too much happening in October and than nothing happening until the winter break, I want to see that these two events happened too close together, or too far apart. And putting in the fixed dates before I start makes sure that I don't forget some event that may effect the story even if it's not directly related to whatever plot point I'm working on (like a character's 17th birthday).

I also do personal timelines for each of my main characters, and "knowledge flow" timelines, where I list everything that a character knows before the story, and then add information as they learn it, like when did Snape learn the second half of the prophecy, when did Harry learn about horcuxes, things like that.

As for mapping out the actual plot, not so much. I have, as I said, plot points. Specific scenes in my head that I want to write that will advance the story in some way. But I don't plan beginning middle and end. In fact, one of the stories I'm working on right not has a "Dark Lord Defeated" sticky note sitting on my "unknown time" page lol. I'll get there eventually, but I'm not sure how or when yet, and I'm ok with that.

*** It's not odd. The level of detail depends on the requirements of the story and the worldbuilding.

While outlining a fic recently, I found out the hard way during that looking at dates were necessary for longer /Harry Potter/ fics. At least ones that are set during Hogwarts.

**** Yeah, and I'm a horrible not-picker lol. If an author says that something happened on a Wednesday two days before the start of term, then September 1st better fall on a Friday that year lmao! I know that that is pretty ridiculous of me, but I can't help it. I even have my own crazy head canon about the whole attack on the Potter's (Saturday, October 31st) and Harry being dropped at the Dursley's (Tuesday, November 3rd).

Yes.

#+end_quote

To the point of excess. I've had to remove dozens of plot points that led to sideplots that went absolutely nowhere. When you're planning everything out, it's hard to imagine just how much work it takes to bring all of those minor details to fruition.

#+begin_quote
  Do you find you constrain yourself by outlining, i.e, is something lost in the creative process by setting limits before starting?
#+end_quote

Definitely not, but I can see how that might be a problem. I think the trick is to not be married to any one particular way to solve a problem as the first draft develops. If you think of a better way to complicate a characters life after you've moved on from outlining, don't be afraid to make large scale changes. Just be ready to deal with all of the ramifications to deviating from the outline.

** I outline rough plot lines. For example, I'm on fourth year of a fanfic right now, and I know how the main events of the next two years are going to go down until the fic's finish.

Outlining every scene, though, I definitely would never do. It removes spontaneity and the fun of the writing process; there are a few scenes, especially deaths, I might have written versions of in advance, but never would I plan the whole story out scene by scene.

At the moment, my general process is to look at my main plot, write up a rough chapter outline (main ideas to hit) and almost always write the chapter whilst ignoring the outline. I still cover the intransigent points, but those I'm writing are still entertaining.

Too much outlining can make you afraid to incorporate great ideas when you come up with them later in a fic. I might come up with an incredible side plot TODAY to incorporate, and I have the freedom to do so without having to go over two years of plot events.

** Best analogy I can give is I think of writing alphabetically.

I know where I want to start and have a few key points mapped out where everything in between just happens organically.

I start at point A, know a few thing i want to include later on, EFG, and an ending sometimes I know the ending, but most often I know when/how i want to wrap a story up, ( using my analogy I know Y but not Z)

** I assume here a serious work. I do fanfiction in a non-serious matter, without much plan or direction because typing is almost meditative for me, while planning, plotting and outlining is not. That's hard, creative work. Work that I simply won't use for something that isn't 100% my own afterwards. Hence my answers concern my original work.

1) Yes, I do outline a story. Before and during the writing process.

2) I plan through the entire plot from start to finish. Then I add the character arcs to it. After the character arcs I refine the plot to go logically with the characters decisions. Then I refine the character arcs,........ until I finally have a plot and character arcs that I like. Then I moodboad scenes and places. I try to get into my characters heads, write some origin stories for them and play their lifes through in my head - which is a process I tend to do several times during the writing of the story to remain in-voice and character.

3) The outlining is part of the creative process. People always think that to be creative means to be without limitations. I'm more of the opinion that being creative is to set your own limitations. True, the writing itself is then only a "completion process". Its the assembly of pre-done parts.

** I do the [[http://i.imgur.com/V6jip1l.jpg][outline thing]] like JKR does (or did) for the HP books. I find it to be very useful with pacing/timing of specific events.

I expanded on that some and wrote a slightly more detailed thing in a text file, which is mostly what I reference nowadays. The above/first outline was instrumental for the basic idea and plotting though.

When I begin a new file (which I do for each chapter), I briefly jot down a list of all the scenes to take place, and then systematically tackle each of those.

I'm all about planning. I can't fly by the seat of my pants.

#+begin_quote
  /Do you outline a story before starting to write?/
#+end_quote

For short one-shots, no. For the nine billion multi-chaptered fics that are languishing on my computer, yes.

(But for my non-fic works, I tend to outline short stories too.)

--------------

#+begin_quote
  /If yes, to what degree? A simple list of plot points you want to hit, the series of transitions, every scene in detail (almost like a screenplay)?/
#+end_quote

All three of those are what I use in various combinations. I outline each chapter. Sometimes that outlining is scene by scene, going so far as to contain dialogue and specific reactions to dialogue. Sometimes it is a scene summary with required reactions, symbolism, etc. Other times, it's a single line or two that acts as a placeholder for more details until I have the rest of the plot figured out.

I very rarely get specific with things like clothing or setting to a fine degree unless those things play into the plot.

As an example, one of my recently finished outlines is around 30k words. The story will be about 3x that, an appropriate length for its genre.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  /Do you find you constrain yourself by outlining, i.e, is something lost in the creative process by setting limits before starting?/
#+end_quote

No. It may seem counterintuitive, but it's made me more creative.

My style of writing, to borrow a bit from George R. R. Martin's idea of architects vs gardeners, is less architecture than it is planned gardening. I have an idea of how I want the end result to look, so I make very specific plans. Sometimes, those plans alter before I can start on the actual project. But sometimes, when things start growing, I decide that what I've planted looks a bit prettier when I don't prune it so much. Or when I remove a tree that is beautiful but utterly out of place. Or when I suddenly have the thought that it would be really neat to have a series of strange, almost hidden shrubs, planted everywhere starting at the front gate.

The *tl;dr* of it is that since I know what's coming, I'm free to play in the parameters that I've set.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  /If you write with no outline at all, how do you keep track of all your ideas, what to include and what to remove?/
#+end_quote

I used to write like that. Basically, I'd have character lists and a general idea of the plot. It was hard to keep track of what came before and even harder to know what would come after. I frequently waited for "inspiration." I was editing as I went, which was a nightmare. Stories fizzled a lot.

In the end, it was a lot of wasted paper and wasted time.

Outlining personally works for me, so I stick with it.

** Plotter or Pantser. Architect or Gardener. It's a question I get asked frequently.

I'm plotter/architect to an obsessive extent. I like having a full grasp of the world and its rules so I can maintain an internally logical and consistent narrative.

I should point out I don't write one-shots/shorts. All my work is long form/feature length.

I start with dot points for the seven key "beats" needed for a three act story.

These then become summary paragraphs.

I then write dot points for scenes necessary for plot and character development and see where they fall logically to link the seven key beats.

I then write summary paragraphs for those.

This document goes to my alpha readers for a check on tone, flow, and consistency.

I do a pass based upon their notes and make changes.

If I have any clear set pieces, snippets of dialogue or drafts/part scenes I add them as placeholders now, as part of doing a scene breakdown for every scene.

The scene breakdowns are written onto coloured index cards. Colour designates the key plot element/subplot to which the scene pertains. These are placed in order. Then holding one edge I look at the top of the cards and let my eye tell me if there are any times too much of one colour is clumping together or dropping off unnaturally so I can go back and assess the flow and move scenes around as needed without having to rewrite huge slabs.

Once I am happy with the flow/integration of plot elements, I start on a first draft.

I know, I'm a lunatic. However, it's the system that has gradually come together over years that works for me.

** Do you outline a story?

Yes, very brief. Usually it's a matter of only writing a summary-sentence (MC, problem arising, why it's a problem, the goal of MC or something like that.)\\
I tend to lose myself into my outlines, details so much that I end up with a very stiff model that never brings me any pleasure to write, so I decided to skip outlines altogether and just write.

I make a first draft usually as fast as possible. Leave myself notes (I don't even know the name of my characters at that point, or barely. I just have a vague idea of what's happening and the end in mind and aim to that ASAP.) Seriously, it's the ugliest piece of shit you'll ever see, but it works and it's a story.

Once I feel I reached the end, I go back to my notes, fluff things out, and go on the second draft. Once the second draft is done, I then split into chapters my story, and go on the third draft, and so on until the story is finished and polished.

From there I revise and make second, third, fourth and fifth draft, until I feel it's all polished.

I write a first draft based on the summary

** I don't outline. Tried it a couple of times; one story abandoned from loss of interest, the other ended up the worst thing I'd written since I was a teenager.

I have a notebook for jotting down ideas, but they're basically just the barest premise of a story. For example my most recent one just says "All the knowledge in the world". If I have a particular idea that needs expanding on I might make a couple of extra notes, but generally I don't think about even vague details until I turn my attention to writing that specific story idea.

For stories I am working on, I mostly keep it all in my head and just write. If I have ideas at 4am, I might make a note of it so that I don't forget come morning, but other than that I generally rely on my memory. If I forget, I figure it probably wasn't that great anyway (or it'll come back to me later). I only make exceptions if my brain is slamming with me with details, but even then I only jot down the barest notes I need to remember everything and I don't bother with form or organisation.

As for when it comes to deciding what stays and what gets cut, I figure that out when I write it. Obviously some ideas you realise you can't keep because it's just not plausible with how the story has gone up to that point, but with other things I don't decide until it's written out. Every story I write has a secondary document named "[Title] Extras" and has any bits I've written and decided not to include, just in case I change my mind.

**** I couldn't say; I don't discuss writing methods with people much. I know that I don't do most of things mentioned in this thread. I just get an idea and I write and see where it takes me. It's like setting out on a roadtrip without planning your route: you might know where you want to get to, and have a few stops along the way that you want to hit, but you don't know what roads you're going to take to get there until you reach them.

Of course, this has it's problems--unplanned routes means you can get caught out by roadworks and p(l)ot holes--and to be honest I would advise most people to use outlining to some degree or another. Frustrations that I face after already writing 30k words are things that outliners figure out in the planning process, but this is what works for me. I've written several long stories this way, and while they might not be masterpieces I would say that's a matter of skill and practice rather than lack of outlining.
