So, I'm planning a fan fic where a majority of the Hogwarts staff is replaced by characters who survived DH. I'm currently struggling to come up with people who would be good for a couple of roles.

*Head:*

*Head of Gryffindor*: Neville Longbottom

*Head of Hufflepuff*: Ernie MacMillan

*Head of Ravenclaw*: Luna Lovegood

*Head of Slytherin*: Draco Malfoy

*Ancient Runes:*

*Arithmancy:* Ernie MacMillan

*Astronomy:* Luna Lovegood

*Care of Magical Creatures:* Charlie Weasley

*Charms:* Ron Weasley

*Defence Against the Dark Arts:* Harry Potter

*Divination:* Parvati Patil

*Herbology:* Neville Longbottom

*History of Magic:*

*Muggle Studies:*

*Potions:* Draco Malfoy

*Transfiguration:* Hermione Granger

*Caretaker:*

*Matron:* Hannah Abbott

*Flying Teacher/Quidditch Ref:* Ginny Weasley

*Gamekeeper:* Rubeus Hagrid

*Librarian:*

This is what I've got at the moment. Can you suggest any characters that may or may not be good fits for the empty roles? I don't mind having to come up with OC's but I'd rather try and fill each role as best as I can before it comes to that.

The only rule I have is that they must be alive at the end of Deathly Hallows. I'm setting the story in and around 2010/11 so Harry and co would be roughly 30 years old.


** I guess you could sling Padma Patil in for Runes, but what I want to know is why all of the professors would be from only a couple of graduating classes or why many of these people would even be professors in the first place (what with Malfoy and Harry being so rich and all). Look at any school in the real world and you'll see a vast range of ages amongst teachers (and Hogwarts was the same, with Dumbledore being so old and Snape being Harry's parents' age), so I don't see why the staff would become staffed nearly entirely by a couple of years' worth of students.

*** Seconding this. Obviously you can do whatever you wish for fun but to assume the entire staff is from a couple years worth of people, that's a bit unrealistic.

*** Yeah I think I probably wouldn't read this. It goes beyond suspension of disbelief because its just lazy.

Not to mention Ron being a teacher is laughable. Unless it's flying, he could totally be the Quidditch guy.

** Just a thing- most everyone you've named came from within a year of Harry's class, suggesting that all the older Professors died or retired soon after the Battle, despite surviving through it. There's no particular reason to replace Sinestra, Hooch, Babbling, Trelawney & Firenze, Vector or Hagrid (though Charlie is more likely to have NEWT students for CoMC, I'm sure). Madam Pince still defends the library from all intruders and Poppy Pomfrey was an able healer. Besides which, most of the main cast have more fitting careers in the wizarding world than just running Hogwarts.

I'd also question having Luna in a Head position, and unless she lost the use of her legs she probably wouldn't want a job that prevents her from roaming the world in search of fantastic creatures.

But hey, if you need names you can use these:

*History of Magic*: Andromeda Tonks

*Muggle Studies*: Arthur Weasley (with monthly guest speaker Hermione Granger to provide corrective instruction)

*Librarian*: Cho Chang

*Ancient Runes*: Padma Patil (probably a better candidate for Head of Ravenclaw, too)

Headmistress was and should be Minerva McGonagall, but if that just doesn't satisfy the need for incredibly contrived insular youth-led shenanigans, you could always use Fleur Delacour Weasley. Everyone would pay attention when she spoke and yet she would often be difficult to understand, following a long tradition of passive Headmastery.

** Ancient Runes- Cho / Bill / Daphne Greengrass (I think all of them were mentioned as having taken Runes. My choice would be Bill though)

History of Magic- Binns would still be there I think

Muggle Studies- Arthur Weasley (It's really the only choice)

Caretaker- Goyle or Crabbe whichever one didn't die they're basically interchangeable.

Librarian- Terry Boot? He was a Ravenclaw seems like a good fit
