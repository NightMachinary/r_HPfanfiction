Inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ckqdh2/not_a_bad_theory_can_be_idea_for_a_new_story/][Tom Riddle is Slytherin theory]], because I've got an even better candidate for you.

Who has a history of keeping deadly beasts inside the school? Who's so good at magic that he manages to do it just fine even with a broken wand, something neither Harry nor Ron could do? Who's loyal to Hogwarts above all and passionate about teaching?

Hagrid is Salazar Slytherin.

He hates the Slytherin House, all because it pains him to see what has become of it. Everybody thinks he's gullible and simple, but that's just the cunning disguise. Throughout the PS, he played Harry like a fiddle. He swindled a dragon egg out of Voldemort while keeping the information about Fluffy until the right moment, despite how easily he blabbed to Harry. He's dating a woman way out of his league.

Does this leave Voldemort just a poor orphan with Daddy issues and delusions of grandeur? No, it doesn't!

Bonus prompt: Tom Riddle is Helga Hufflepuff.

Hear me out! Helga is a Scandinavian name. Maybe our future founder came to the British shores with bloodthirsty Vikings and did her share of murder and pillaging before settling down at Hogwarts. Now, disgusted with how wizards see her and her house 1,000 years later, she'll /work hard/ to remind them about the true meaning of fear and destruction. Note how the war mostly involves Slytherins and Gryffindors, and an occasional Ravenclaw. Because Helga looks out for her own. Except for Hepzibah Smith, of course. She enjoyed reminding that inbred descendant about family legacy.

And is it really a coincidence that those two were at Hogwarts at the same time?

His wand /isn't/ broken. That's what he tells people because a lot of awkward questions would be asked if the public got wind that Albus Dumbledore owns a wand with which he can casually fix snapped wands for his friends. (And because he legally /isn't/ allowed to carry a wand anymore, of course.)

...or simply because he has a cover to maintain, seems more straightforward to me.

If we're talking seriously, then I agree, of course.

Or that. He's so cunning, our Hagrid!
