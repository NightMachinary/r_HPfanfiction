** I'm not quite sure what exactly you're looking for. Is it a racist Harry, or simply one prejudiced against muggles/muggleborn?

Buuuut, if you want women to take a backseat and a Harry that's actually in control..I can heartily recommend linkffn(6254783)

** linkffn(Too Young to Die)

Harry doesn't take shit from anyone, has sex with a bunch of different women and doesn't give a shit about any of them, and masters Obliviation by obliviating the memories of pets from random muggles on the street.

And honestly its ending made me more hyped than any other fic I've read.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

Very few people want to see racist Harry, because that's... horrible... in a way that most other kinks and squicks aren't. Few fics are written to go against the central tenant of the books; I suspect you're looking for something to validate your... uh, nonconventional attitudes. Most Harry Potter fans are against racism and sexism. If that's what you want, whatever, but don't act surprised that nobody else wants to cater for it. Why not become an author, and be the nasty little squick you want to see in the world? I have faith in you.

And fyi, mpreg is objectively horrible. Yet you don't see me going on requests for mpreg stories and moral-fagging about how they must be awful people.

Guess what? Choice of fiction doesn't reflect on what a person's personal beliefs are. I enjoyed Man in the High Castle, and half the cast were Nazis, and quite a few were likable despite that fact. Doesn't mean I dream of a resurrected Third Reich.

***** If people want to see prejudiced character what is so bad about it? There are also plenty of fics where Harry is super dark or evil, often a murderer. It's so sad that we live in a time when being racist is considered a greater taboo than being a killer.

I am not saying that it's a good thing, but let's not pretend that there are no racists, homophobes, misogynists or whatever. And guess what? They are people too, and they are often kind and caring when not confronted with their prejudices.

Prejudices have their own roots. People have their bad experiences with certain groups of people and they base their judgements on impressions. And they are not obliged to always "know better". They are within their rights to hate on whomever they want.

******* I get what you mean, but I still stand by my opinion. And HP fanfiction is no vegan restaurant. It is the biggest fandom ever where you can find literally anything, with lots of violence, explicit sex scenes and morally questionable characters.

You say: "Very few people want to see racist Harry, because that's... horrible... in a way that most other kinks and squicks aren't. "

Not true, you can find lots of fics where murder and stealing are morally justified. Maybe even half of them are.

"Few fics are written to go against the central tenant of the books"

Again, completely untrue.

I guess what I wanted to say is you are within your right to call others on bigotry, but you are also implying OP's opinions are even worse than awful things we can see in HP fanfiction, like torture, murder, stealing, lying, etc. And I feel that it is under the influence of overwhelming political correctness. Being racist is bad, but you can just tell that there is stronger taboo on being a bigot than almost anything else.
