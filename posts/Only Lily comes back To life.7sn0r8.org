Hello ! I am desperately looking for a fanfic I read years ago where only Lily came back to life and I think it was after Harry's last year or sixth year in Hogwarts.

When she came back, At first she was in the muggle world and she had a hard time remembering who she was but when she did she went to seek Harry who doesn't believe her and tied her to a bed if I recall to interrogate her.

Then it was proved to be her and she reintegrated magical society such as the order and stuff as Voldemort was not yet defeated.

She then had a house and Harry had a room in it. Other details : Drago Malfoy becomes part of the Order at one time, and Ron killed Nagini at the end of something like that.

Please Help me it was really well written with good characterization and I do believe it was complete.

Does anyone know of this fic?

  Harry knows now what he has to do. He's the only one who can. Everyone helps him out with the fulfilment of the prophecy, but he receives help from last person he would have ever expected, a relative long thought dead. AU DH
