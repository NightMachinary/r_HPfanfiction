Hi! Please don't bash/downvote me for being cliche!

Is there any fic out there with Harry seperating from his friends, when they betray him? Both Hermione and Ron and everybody else in Hogwarts? Then...they realize he was, and still is being, abused, and try to make up with him, but he suddenly becomes ever-powerful amazing and unforgiving Harry? I mean, doesn't forgive /anybody./

Or a HarryxOC story, where the OC is an extremely kind pureblood girl he meets preferably in his First year, they become best friends, are sorted into Slytherin...This one is my idea. If anybody finds anything even remotely similar, please, I beg of you, recommend it!

Fanfics with Slytherin!HarryxDaphne, in GoF, and he suddenly gets a glow-up on the Yule Ball?

Sarcastic and Sassy Harry fanfic where Harry is no-nonsense, and shoots Hermione down the minute she starts showing off on the train?

Harry is my favorite character. Anything Harry-Centric, no Slash preferrably, definitely a pairing, character bashing is welcome!

Thank you for anything you can suggest!

Here are some fics I liked:

1. Oh, you didn't know? Yeah, he's awesome.
2. Feral
3. Twins: A different Life

Some cliches I like:

1. WBWL
2. Azkaban Harry
3. Cunning Slytherin Harry
4. Raised by Voldemort


** I was going to suggest [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637][this]] one but then I realised he keeps his friendship with Hermione, I think. It's been a while since I read it. You still might like it because he and Hermione have to work through stuff, he doesn't just let her keep berating him and stuff, and he becomes very independent from her linkao3(harry gets smart and takes control)

  Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he's had enough, he's sick of pretending to be stupid, he's sick of constantly fighting against the whole world. It's time to step up and take control of his life.
