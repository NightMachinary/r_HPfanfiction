Can be Het/Slash/Femslash, couples or moresomes, can have any warnings, be on any site, anyone can be the main character.

Can be finished or not. can be recommended a lot by other people, or not that much, or not at all.

Just whatever it is, as long as you really enjoy it. Feel free to recommend as many as you'd like as well.


** Linkao3(14340108) It starts with the number 3. Voldemort died at the DoM battle and Harry wants some freedom but the order make him stay the whole summer at the Dursley. Harry rans away and start living alone working as a waitress. Harry/George/Fred It's really good and the author has another story that is time travel.

Linkao3(12391806) One shot with a really good take on Harry, Ron and Hermione's friendship

Linkao3(14016627) Paranoia and puns. One the best short works that I've read. It's Cedric/Harry, really funny with great takes on the characters

Linkao3(14164617) An hour of Wolves. It's really dark, Harry's been raped and deals with the aftermath, it hasn't been updated in a while but it's not abandoned. At the end it starts getting better, so if you can put with all the bad things at the begining at the end we see a little bit of light.

Sorry if my descriptions are kinda bad, English it's not my first language. If you like the fics I have a lot more

  Another take on WHAT-IF Harry got rid of Voldemort in fifth year? Oh yeah and WHAT-IF he just so happened to fall in love with certain twins? In disguise. Under a wrong name, that is. And even a different gender? Or maybe not. (No fem!Harry)Love the clichés and maybe create some new.Or the one in which Harry gives the headmaster the finger and decides to go exploring the Wizarding World on his own.

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

  “So, I was thinking---” Neville cut off, causing Harry to peer up curiously. Neville's eyes were narrowed on the flower, small frown marring his features. “Oh, how rude.” “What's rude? It's just a flower. Strange, since Malfoy sent it to me. Do you think he was cursed? I mean, it's not like him to be nice.” Neville snorted, mouth twitching rapidly. “No, it's not,” He agreed readily. “Malfoy sending this makes perfect sense though. The flower means, Beauty is your only attraction."- Or... the one where Harry and Draco have a flower war. Their tamest fight yet to date as they trade silent insults, cutting barbs and even a few compliments sprinkled in.

** My favourites would be the works of FloreatCastellum, inc her latest, Wood for the Trees. Also Annerb, Queen of the Changeling story and its wonderful sequels. She has also written other Hinny stories which are great. I have to recommend the Its TeaTime series by frombluetored. And I have to add Jenorama to this list, she started writing back in the Checkmated days, and she has written a great series of one shots and small stories before she wrote the multi chap California Dreamin' and several more short stories, all in her Potterverse. Shout outs to gryffindormischief and the distantdusk, they have great stories worth checking out. All the above authors write the characters so well, so realistically, and their stories are Hinny. I will give a shout out to starlightpeddler's The Quietly Series too, which is Scorbus based. Im sure Ive missed heaps of great writers and stories, but these are ones i can read over and over!
