I have recently been on a Harry x Daphne binge! Send me your best fics!


** So many solid Haphne fics. How about:

- Harry Potter and the Unexpected Friend - CaskettFan5
- Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - Petrificus Somewhatus
- Harry's Secret Friend - James Spookie
- Harry Potter and the Slytherin Ice Queen - Hugo L.R Reed

That should get you started. Happy haphne!

** I would suggest [[/r/Haphne][r/Haphne]]

You can look for a few fics there but you have to ignore the memes though ðŸ˜….

As for few suggestions, read works of Dorothea Greengrass, CaskettFan5, Shygui etc

Lots of Harry/Daphne with a tiny bonus of Harry/Astoria
