By oddball, I mean like Sirius/Petunia or Cho/Dudley -- unconventional, probably wouldn't work in canon but in this specific fic it makes SO much sense.


** I thought the pairing in /The Second String/ was clever--Harry/Gideon Prewett. Most time-travel slash tends to have Harry with traditional enemies or with Sirius, both of which aren't for me. I liked this because it recalled canon a bit: Harry still becomes part of the Weasley family, Gideon is the youngest of the current generation of siblings (Molly, Fabian, Gideon), they're about the same age, and they both fight in the war against Voldemort. linkao3(15465966).

I'm more commenting, however, to see if anyone remembers a really wonderful fanfic set in sixth/seventh year that focuses on Madame Malkin's search for her longtime secret friend/lover Florean Fortescue (I think he got kidnapped by Voldemort in canon book 6). It was a spectacular drama/action fic about adults living in Diagon Alley as Voldemort took over, very much inspired by stories of resistance to Nazis in WWII. The pairing was great, the story was great, the writing was great. I'm pretty sure it wasn't on ao3 or ffn, and that I read it in the later 2000s. Maybe livejournal? Anyone else remember this (unfinished?) fic?(EDIT: also, seconding /In the Language of Flowers/)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  (I am the one who says 'fuck you') - Benjamin Garcia, 'Ode to the Corpse Flower'.Petunia drips magic the way she drips anger. Sparingly. Subtly. Nothing overt or obnoxious. Nothing that attracts the stares of other children or the suspicion of adults. Just things that help her. Her dolls line back up after the football Lily was kicking about ruins their perfect symmetry. Her bed makes itself while she brushes her teeth meticulously. Tea that is slightly too hot or too cold settles to the perfect temperature. Magic maintains the realm of order she has built around herself.(A witch!Petunia and muggle!Lily AU, covering the Marauders' years at Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War).

  “I don't have to justify my place here to you.” Millicent's voice is like ice, and Hermione can't help herself from flinching, pulling back in her seat to put more distance between them. She's faced down dark wizards, but this feels different. Hermione feels her cheeks warm and thinks about trying to apologise, to take back her words or say something to take away the sting of them, but before she can say anything Millicent snaps, “Why are you here?” After the war Hermione tries to make up for her wartime by working in the Department of Magical Accidents. She's not expecting to end up working at a desk opposite one Millicent Bulstrode, but she'll put up with whatever she has to, if it gives her a chance at getting her parents' memories back.

** Arthur Weasley/Amelia Bones. I've seen several fics do this one, usually ones that bash Molly Weasley. I'm not really a fan of the "Amorentia Out Of A Firehose" Molly bashing that almost always accompanies these things, I honestly don't really like Weasley or Dumbledore bashing at all, but this particular pairing has something very... pure, about it. The idea that something happens to Molly that leaves Arthur a widower, and Amelia comes back into his life as some old flame or first girlfriend from their Hogwarts days to help him put his family back together.

They seem to fit very well together to me; Arthur with his frank and honest attitude, and his whimsical, almost Lovegood-like obsession with his hobby that he's managed to turn into a career, juxaposed against Amelia Bones, the straight-laced no-nonsense director of magical law enforcement, hard boiled and somewhat jaded, a survivor of having her entire family massacred by Voldemort in the first war. She's hurting, she must be, and she's used her career to cover it. She knows what it's like to struggle as a sole parent to a child she's terrified she cannot provide enough for. But when Arthur is destroyed by the loss of Molly, Amelia can't just stand by and watch Arthur crumble. So she doesn't. They find comfort together. They complete each other. Arthur without Molly is a broken Willy Wonka, and Amelia who shares childhood history with Arthur is a hard-boiled detective who understands his pain.

There's something very pure and traditionally romantic about the pairing, that I never really saw or considered until some of the bashing fics showed it. Dare I say, it's even rather adorable.

Sadly, I don't think there is any one genuinely good fic where this pairing is actually done good justice. It's almost always an accessory added onto a major Weasley bashing story, and even then only rarely. I'd really like to see a story where this is pushed more towards the front, and where what happens to Molly is something more traditionally tragic, like a death (maybe she takes Arthur's place and is bitten by Nagini), as opposed to something as anvilicious as being carted off to Azkeban for mass bottled rape.

** Minerva McGonagall/Amelia Bones in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21381508][When Silence Gets Too Hard]]. It's set in OoTP year. Really shows the tensions at Hogwarts under Umbridge. Minerva leaning on Amelia's support really stood out to me. I really liked the interactions between Amelia and the Hogwarts staff - that probably made this pairing work.

Voldemort/Viktor Krum in [[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/19343.html#cutid1][Epic of the Forgotten]]. It shouldn't work at all but the fic pulls it off beautifully and somehow packages romance, plot, smut and gender identity exploration in a single fic. The characterizations and the writing is brilliant and won me over.

** As far as I know Theo/Hermione is not as uncommon as I used to think but this is the only fic that I read it about the pairing linkffn(2407704).

** Hope by Jeconais. It is hp and Gabrielle. The couple usually has her far too young for my taste but this one is done well imo. This is the fic that got me in to reading fanfiction.

** Okay, I'm really throwing a wtf one in here, but Extinction for Hermione/Narcissa Malfoy. Man, is this story good! It has a solid plot and none of the characters get bashed, not even Ron, who is portrayed as an overall good friend, which really is a breath of air compared with stories in the fandom's niches I usually dabble in.

Anyway, yes, totally sold on Cissamione here!
