So, Petunia and the rest of the Dursleys, are living their lives, without having a clue that magic exists.

But, when Lily and James are killed, Dumbledore still leaves Harry on the Dursleys front doorstep with a note.

So, the Dursleys end up with a mysterious baby with a mysterious note claiming 'magic', 'Voldemort', 'blood protection', etc. What do they do?


** This is the thought I had when I read the post title....Lily and Petunia were really close and Petunia liked magic. Dumbledore knows this. Lily memory charms Petunia to hate her and magic so she will stay away and safe from the death eaters. Dumbledore doesn't know she does that. Dumbledore leaves Harry with Petunia believing she still likes Lily and magic. That's why he never checks in and believes Harry is in a loving home.

** If they remember Lily's existence, then they'd probably try track down people who knew her, take out ads and stuff. Probably consult the police, too. Try finding out where and how they actually died, and where the hell the baby came from.

If they didn't remember Lily, they'd go straight to the police.

*** Well, I was hoping for fics in particular where Petunia doesn't remember having a sister at all, certainly not her having magic.

I wonder, what would you do if it happened to you in real life? A live baby deposited on your doorstep one morning, with a letter, with your name on it, but talking about a supposed relative you've never met before, and about magic and curses and some blood sacrifice and such?

...Yeah, I'd probably go to the police too. Or the hospital, or whoever deals with 'what the bloody hell' cases like this.

** wouldn't they think it is a prank and then just raise harry normally or give him to an orphanage.

*edit what, is this not realistic, I can totally see the dursleys giving a random child that they don't know with a letter claiming "magic" on his blanket, to the authorities or an orphanage.
