You know the ones I'm talking about. The ones that make spelling mistakes every sentence, have a wholly linear plot, and the you read it and think "this is fucking dumb". But you can't stop reading, because it's sooooo good.


** My 'favourite' awful fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4357909/1/A-Kiss-Can-Save-The-World][A Kiss Can Save The World]] by Robst. This one is so mind bogglingly stupid that it has the Chamber of Secrets repurposed into an athletics track.

  When you kissed a soul bond formed, which in the wizarding world counts as legally binding marriage, so you both immediately became adults thus releasing your inheritance. You are now Lord and Lady Gryffindor, owner of Hogwarts and all the land for miles around including the village of Hogsmead.

** My go-to for fics like this is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power]]

It's full of cliches, many of them are facepalmingly stupid, there are entire passages that are borderline unreadable, there's an uncomfortable vibe to the jokes about women, and it's abandoned.

That being said, it's entertaining as hell. This is a classic case of the difference between "entertaining" and "good." The best fics are both, but that doesn't mean that fics that have just one of those characteristics can't exist.

** There was one that I wish I saved just for the lulz that had several misspellings and grammar errors in the summary and title, as well as saying it was inspired by Robst. I'm almost positive it wasn't a troll either.

Also Life's Big Joke. the whole story -- if you can call it that -- is one big joke.

** Harry Potter & The New Life (written by Silveraegis and re-written by everyone ever) is a guilty pleasure. I know it's awful but I just can't stop.
