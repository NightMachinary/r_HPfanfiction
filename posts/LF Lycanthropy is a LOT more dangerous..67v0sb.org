You know, lycanthropy isn't all that scary in Harry Potter, not in the grand scheme of things.

Sure, victims of it turn into ultra-nasty slavering hungry human-hating werewolves each full moon, but it's harmless the rest of the time and full moons are easily predicted.

So, does anyone know any fics where werewolves are ultra-disasterrific and are right up there on the lists of 'threats to the Statute of Secrecy' and 'probable causes of human extinction'?

Super-strength and speed, un-detectability in human form, transform every night instead of full moons, et-cetera? Or just incredibly widespread infection?

Resident Evil crossovers where some smart-alec from Umbrella experiments on the werewolf virus to make it worse are acceptable.


** Obligatory linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Lycanthropy is a plot point starting the last half of the 2nd year (so the last 1/4 of the fic so far), because Werewolves in human form still retain their psychopathic man-eating urges and beliefs. The werewolves also have regeneration powers.

That said it's a very small part of the fic, so depends on whether you think it's worth it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
