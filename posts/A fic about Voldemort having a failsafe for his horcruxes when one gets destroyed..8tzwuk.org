I remember the plot is when one horcrux is destroyed, all other horcruxes posses the nearest living thing.

The tiara possess Trelawney, the locket possess Kreacher and so on.

Anyone else remembers what this fic is?

Any help would be appreaciated!

TIA!


** It's been years since I've read it, so I'm not 100% sure, but is it linkffn(souls abound by robst)?

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr
