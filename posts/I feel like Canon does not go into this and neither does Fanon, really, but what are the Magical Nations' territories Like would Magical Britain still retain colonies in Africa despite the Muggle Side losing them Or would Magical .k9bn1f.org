#+TITLE: I feel like Canon does not go into this and neither does Fanon, really, but what are the Magical Nations' territories? Like would Magical Britain still retain colonies in Africa despite the Muggle Side losing them? Or would Magical Britain have colonies in the first place? Thoughts?

** Yes, the administration of the Wizarding World seems to differ from the Muggle world. For example, Transylvania has a Quidditch team (according to book 4), while Charlie Weasley works with dragons in Romania, and Hungary also appears as an independent entity in the Cursed Child. These three entities were never independent at the same time in the Muggle world.

** Most, if not all, British expansion happened after the Statute of Secrecy was put in place. So I would say Magical Britain never really had any colonies in the first place.

** They may have kept the national borders that were in place when the Statute of Secrecy took effect, since that's when the magical and muggle cultures diverged. Of course, their borders may have continued to change after that, just like ours did, but there would generally be no reason for them to change in the same way as ours.

** Magical Borders are a fun thing to worldbuild with. Really the fun thing is to just decide whether you feel the wizarding population would go along with the muggles or not. Split and unify countries as needed. My favorite is the creation of the United Nordic Commonwealth, a magical country whose territory is composed of the muggle countries Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland, whose magical populations opposed the Christianization of their lands and began a slow separation from their muggle counterparts centuries before the start of the Statute of Secrecy.

** I think government can be different from muggle counterparts. So nations in wizarding world can contain more than one muggle nation. And muggle nations can contain more than one wizarding nation.

That being said, UK has like 20k wizarding population in HP... Surely closer to 10k a couple of centuries earlier. No way they control their territory and other across the globe with that. I guess wizarding nations would be domestic.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] does this fairly well IMO. It's a good read

** Obviously JKR didn't say very clearly one way or other, so we are free to believe what we want. One is that Magical nations just follow the fate of their Muggle counterparts. Simple, and it makes a lot of sense to me.

Or they got stuck in 1692, but it won't work. With the proportion of 5000 Muggles to one wizard/witch (which is roughly how Rowlings number seem to turn out), you get some nations certainly under the level of self-sustaining number (200 Czechs, and that was one of the biggest states in the Holy Roman Empire and one of second class bigger nations in Europe), so there has to be some kind of whole-Empire Magical unification.

** I think the main thing would be Muggleborns from other colonial nations coming back to Britain for school, or to another place that speaks their language, since their need to be looked after somehow.
