** This is a fic where Canon!Harry immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts gets pulled into an AU by an Order that's on like their fourth Harry Potter. It's been awhile since I read this, so I forgot a good portion of it, but I remember enjoying it and that a line from the AU Dumbledore went something like: "In your world's Voldemort, he was insane. This one isn't."

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

**** I'm honestly not sure why it gets so much flak, considering there are far worse fics out there. The thing I've seen pop up a lot is that Harry is too [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] or that there's way too much going on in a single year to be realistic and that the author spends too much time on certain philosophical or scientific ideas that don't advance the story. All those criticisms are valid to some extent (and I know there are several more critiques, I just can't remember them). I remember that my personal gripe with the story was that one of the characters gets resurrected like a comic book character.

That said, this was the story that got me into fanfiction. After I worked through that boring first chapter, I laughed my way through the next half dozen or so. I spent all my free time for a week just reading through the story. There was so much going on, from all the philosophy, math and science, to the Ender's Game styled battles.

***** I don't have a problem with people not liking it, people like what they do and don't what they don't. But part of the point of the story is that Hatry's iamverysmart-ness comes back to bite him in the butt. That's one of my favorite things about it. It's also one of maybe 10 fanfictions I've read that holds up or gets better on a reread. I liked what you had a gripe with, but I get why you don't.

I get really strange obsessions and really bad memory so I've read it all the way through 4 times since it's finished and listened to the fan-made audiobook maybe 10 times? I also listen to it while just doing stuff sometimes. So I have a lot of analysis of the themes, and I think the thing you have a problem with actually adds to the theme that we have the power to defeat death. But. Anyway. I'm glad you like fanfiction now.

Mine too. It's like one of those indie!Harry fics, where Harry feels superior and mouths off, except the adults behave like actual adults and don't really give a shit about the opinions of an 11 year old. It's a neat subversion of that kind of trope.

Edit: Oh and of course how being smart doesn't give you a guarantee on being right. I really like the whole vibe of the protagonist not just being the author's pet and always being correct about everything just because of author fiat.

**** From what I've seen? Mostly because of Harry, who is frequently arrogant, condescending, and inconsiderate.

I'll say, though, that I didn't find that that spoiled the story. He isn't actually /malicious/, he's actually very loyal to people he respects. He wants to save everyone in the world from dying and combine magic with science to advance the human race beyond anything imagined before. He hates bullying and injustice. And his character flaws do come back to haunt him, repeatedly.

** Voldemort in my story "Patron" should qualify. He and Dumbledore fought the war like a game of chess- move and countermove, and they had plans that advanced their goals even if they failed. For example, Harry was forced into the tournament as a way to distract Dumbledore from preventing Voldemort's resurrection, to make him lose face at the breach of security, and if Harry died in the sabotaged tournament, that was a bonus.

************ In canon, he casually pondered murdering a random child in canon, on his way to murdering Harry and his parents. He and his followers murdered children and started a genocide of muggleborns, tortured a teacher to death as evening entertainment, and scared Britain so much, even after his apparent death, they were afraid to say his name. He murdered his own family - both the Riddles and the Gaunts - and committed murder as a teenager and then again and again for his rituals.

It's just that in canon, most of his crimes aren't happening on screen, so to speak.

************** I meant, I don't think I did have him do anything worse than in canon. Just that more things happened on-screen.

*************** Yes Starfox that's what I meant! I don't really have his stuff happen "on screen," like how canon doesn't really. :)
