So, in like 99% of fics I've read that feature Harry as a dad, Harry is some sort of auror or government figure or occasionally a Quidditch player, he has the requisite two point five kids going through Hogwarts, and a wife. (Sometimes the wife dosed him with love potion -- usually when the wife is Ginny because the author has this desperate need to bash the Weasleys -- and is discovered, all so that Harry can end up with his one /true/ love.) The kids have to deal with their dad being famous, Harry has to juggle his family time and his work, and they all have to deal with the usual family drama.

A couple of them feature Harry going back in time and acting like a father figure to some person in the past: Riddle, Snape, a younger version of himself, etc.

I'm looking for something a little different than the usual formulas. I want to see Harry adopting a character from another universe (like someone from, say, Naruto or Star Wars or something). I want to see Harry raising a kid while still at Hogwarts. I want to see him become a sort of father/older brother figure to a first-year or three after he becomes Head Boy. I want to see Harry stumble through fatherhood in new and interesting ways, and not follow the old formula of being over-protective, getting angry, realizing his mistake, and reuniting with his kid. I want to see Harry struggle with figuring out how to be a father because of his childhood. I want a story (that isn't pure smut) that has Harry fall in real, romantic love with his own child and have to deal with the very serious consequences. I want a super powerful "Master of Death" Harry that gets saddled with a kid for the first time.

So, do you guys have any recommendations for fics where Harry is an unusual father figure? It doesn't necessarily have to fit any of the above ideas.

NO mpreg. Again, note, this is ONLY Harry ONLY as a father figure (so no fics centered on someone else raising a kid or someone raising Harry... or Harry raising himself, for that matter, unless the focus is on the adult Harry and not the child one). I would also prefer to avoid slash, but if the story and premise are /really/ good I am more than happy to give it a shot. Also, I'd like it if the children were kids, not adults, but that's not strictly necessary if the focus is still on Harry being a father.

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm looking for fics that don't fit the criteria in the first two paragraphs, but are unusual like the ideas in the third paragraph.


** I've been looking for those as well. Pretty hard to find quality with those criteria. There is linkffn(2993199) which does match at least somewhat.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10716188/1/Have-Fox-Will-Travel][Have Fox, Will Travel]], Linkffn(10716188)

Naruto finds out about Kurama early and freaks out. He somehow finds his way to Harry, who he is somewhat related to.

Minor spoilers, but I'd recommend reading this before you read the fic. These events happen very early.

[[/spoiler][Naruto tells Harry about Kurama, but doesn't really know all that much. To learn more, Harry attempts to summon Minato's soul with the Resurrection Stone. In doing so, he accidentally comes face to face with the Shinigami. Harry doesn't realize what he's dealing with, he thinks it's just a weird Dementor, and tries to force the Shinigami to give up Minato's soul. Shinigami is not amused, but because Harry is the Master of Death, he can't just kill Harry. Shinigami lets out Minato's soul but puts the other half of Kurama into Harry. Without training, this will kill Harry and unleash Kurama on the wizarding world. Harry packs up and goes to Konoha.]]

*** Ah yes, I've read this fic and sort of enjoyed it. It's got a lot of problems, though. The author insists on using Japanese words unnecessarily (like "ohayou" or "urusai"), which drives me mad. Harry is pretty super-powered, but not in a particularly fun-to-read way. And it gets very focused on unnecessary or boring details. The premise is exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for, though.

**** Yeah I pretty much agree completely.

Jesus, reading through Harry & Co preparing to leave was a chore.

Yeah. Harry is a weird mix of over powered and not. He's clearly shown to be less powerful than, say, Kakashi but at the same time the author says things like Sarutobi surely wouldn't want to anger Harry.

I feel like this fic had some cool ideas and a lot of potential, but it falls fairly flat.
