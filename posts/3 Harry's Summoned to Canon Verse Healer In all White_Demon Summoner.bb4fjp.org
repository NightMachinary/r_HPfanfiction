I read it a few years ago but i remember that it 3 different versions of harry summoned to what i think was canon or pretty close as james and lily were alive i think. Anyway there was the healer who dressed in all white and was calm all the time had potions and possibly loose morals. There was a dark lord or "evil" harry who had a Imp as a pet im pretty sure and was a could care less person and i remember that they went out to knockturn alley and drank a lot enough that they the healer or 3rd harry was handing out his personal hangover cure potions.
