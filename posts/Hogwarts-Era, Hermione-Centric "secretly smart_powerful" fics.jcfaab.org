Hi everyone,

One of my favorite fics is "Looks Can Be Deceiving" by corvusdraconis, and I just finished reading "The Problem with Purity" by phoenix.writing. I didn't realize how similar they were, and now I'm craving more like them!

If you haven't read both/either of these fics, it's sort of difficult to explain, but they are both set in Hogwarts-era and Hermione is the main character in both fics. Although we all know that Hermione is already smart (or, more specifically, book-smart) in canon, these fics cast Hermione (and often friend/side characters such as Harry, Draco, etc). as extremely magically powerful and skilled, and often (with powerful friends) does extraordinary things.

I'm open to /most/ het Hermione pairings (except Ron), and I'm only looking for finished fics at the moment.

Thank you for reading & for any recommendations!

When you mention fanfictions, it would be kind to link them. I don't know if they are on fanfiction.net but i took a guess.

  What if Severus Snape had taken Hermione Granger under wing secretly during her time at Hogwarts? What if Draco Malfoy really wasn't the bigot he let everyone think he was? (Follows canon mostly up until the end of GoF, and then detours off into AU territory w/Severus as father figure)

*** Hey, thanks for the tip! This is my first time posting here so I have never used the bot/didn't know how to use the bot, so thanks for helping me out. Both are on ffn (and ao3), so that's nice :)
