** Have you ever heard of being "sent to Coventry"?

I once came up with this Dark-ish ritual called the Coventrian Curse, which grows in potency with time. The target is just gradually ostracised from the outside world, the extreme of which is inversely proportional to their initial influence.

Early symptoms include being casually misheard in conversation and/or mistaken for other people. If the Curse lasts long enough (and the target was unfortunately "influential" enough), they're ignored altogether to the point of their entire existence being denied by reality itself - though one person garnering that amount of influence is statistically impossible if the limits of the spell are set properly... which means back to the drawing board for me, lol.

** Name = Creeping Paralysis curse

Incantation = Rigor Tergum

Effect = 'Freeze flesh', an alternative to Petrificus Totalus, it freezes at the point of contact. The longer the wizard holds the spell on the target, the further the paralysis spreads. Better than Full Body-bind in that a strong and focused wizard could use it to petrify any beast no matter how large. Multiple casters can link their effects together. A dozen wizards with enough time to make it work could petrify a kaiju.

*** Isn't that just canon spells?

Hardly good enough in my opinion. The list of canon spells provides little variety in magic to use.

** Expecto Patronum variants (construct aids in battle for as long as it lasts. form is animal you associate with that emotion (Patronus is cast from happiness (or, in some fanon, [[/spoiler][life or ignoring death as existing or being bad]])))

Expecto (meaning) - emotions of memories it is cast from, (color according to DC Lantern corp spectrum/color in system for my own fic that I'm writing) [wand movement]

each variant has an area-effect emotional aura

- Vindicum (Avenger) - anger/hate/vengeance (Red/Red) [sharp leftward jerk, angry stab forwards]
- Timorum (Terrorizer) - fear/desire to cause fear/awe/desire to cause awe/shock/desire to cause shock (Yellow/Red, Red & Blue, Red & Yellow respectively) [circle, then an X over the circle]
- Eligum (Chooser) - willpower/choice/fate (Green/Green) [Z, continue up & left diagonal ending on center of other diagonal]
- Praesperum (Hoper/Nurterer of hope) - hope/calm joy/solemn joy/certainty (Blue/Blue & Green) [S made from bottom to top]
- Exultum (Exulter) - ecstatic joy (NA/Yellow) [Z from bottom to top]
- Patronum (Protector/advocate) - peaceful joy connected to family/friendship/brotherhood, triumphic joy (Indigo/Silvery Blue & Yellow) [Spiral inward, 1 and bit rotations (canon according to Pottermore)]
- [[/spoiler][Patronum 2.0 - Triumphic/peaceful joy of defeating Death/Hope of defeating death (Life/Entire set of magical colors]] [Circle starting from top of circle, then triangle from where you ended, then line to down from where you ended (i.e. Deathly Hallows)]
- Nuntium (Messenger) - the message patronus, Appended to end of any Expecto spell [same as base Expecto, but continue into a small circle of wandtip centered around where you ended, first moving wandtip slightly rightward to begin circle]
- Accusator (Prosecutor) - death/despair/depression. Similar aura to dementor. (Death/Absence of light) [vertical line from bottom upwards (think elder wand)]

** The Lesser Body-Bind Spell (weaker counterpart to Petrificus Totalus)

Incantation: /Petrificus Minimus/

Wand Movement: Circle split in half (You know, [[http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/40500/40521/pie_01-02a_40521_lg.gif][like this]].)

Effect: Paralyzes the area of the body it touches (rather than the whole body).

Pros & Cons: Like the Full Body-Bind, it's easily blocked by experience combat wizards. Rather than in combat, the Partial Body-Bind is mostly used in healing as a temporary alternative to a physical cast. Of course, in a duel between children, hitting your opponent's wand arm is always useful.

------------

The Ear-Splitting Hex

Incantation: /Kakophonia/

Wand Movement: Three quick dents.

Effect: Makes the victim's eardrums vibrate at a high frequency, causing them to hear an unbearably high-pitched sound.

Pros & Cons: Unfortunately easily blocked, but hard to get rid off during a duel once the target's been hit; it prevents the target from hearing your next spells properly and thus reacting.

------------------------

Also, from White Squirrel's /Arithmancer/ series, many many new spells invented by Hermione, including /Commotio Cordis/, which stops the heart and is thus a non-Dark alternative ot the Killing Curse.

** Hellus - a dark hex bordering on the line to a curse, the Hellus hex is done with a simple jab and the incantion "hellus". The flesh that is hit will darken to a grey color, and feel dead. It will be circleshaped at first, but will spread out in "veins" and will leave permanent scarring without exception. Left untreated, it can be fatal if hit in torso. The "veins" spread more easily over skin than into flesh, so permanent damage will not be likely.

*** Sorry to say this but that incantation has to be one of the most boring and flat I've ever heard, with a fairly bland effect. You need to give a reason it's dark magic beyond 'it hurts a lot and can't be healed'. To make it not be broken as shit you need a way out: even the Imperious can be fought off with enough willpower. And finally, giving the spell a tiny bit of backstory makes it feel more alive in your story and less like one of the thirty-three spells your edgy Harry launches at opponents while thinking about how much he hates Dumbledore, muggles, puppies etc. Without further ado, let's break out the creative guns and make some proper weird/dark magic. I'm not bothering with the incantations and wand movements so much as that's secondary to the worldbuilding and effects of these spells.

*The Stuttering Starlight jinx*: a wide-area temporary ward that causes everyone within to perceive the world in a strobe-like manner. There is no actual strobe flashing effect, it just makes them perceive the world as a new frame every half-second or so. This is of course completely debilitating in a fight, and it is classified as Dark Magic because if you remain within the ward for more than thirteen minutes the effects start lasting beyond the duration of the spell, with them becoming fully permanent at twenty-seven minutes. It is also a ward, so applying direct counterspells to your allies does not work. However, if you know the relatively easy counterspell, and cast it on yourself quickly, you can still perceive the world normally while standing within the effect. The effect does not work on blind people/people who use other senses than eyesight to fight and enchanted objects such as Moody's eye. The spell and the countercurse were once well-known but have since been forgotten outside of all but the oldest of records.

*Lover's Loss*: a Dark tracking spell that requires part of both the target's and tracker's bodies to work. A hair is fine, but so is a fingernail, hand, ear or anything, just like polyjuice, but it must be the same type of material from both the tracker and the target (a hair for a hair, an eye for an eye etc). The caster of the spell does not need to be the tracker, it can be cast on a third party. It allows the tracker to get a general idea of the target's distance and direction from them, but the effect is quite weak at first. However, it grows in strength over a period of time, and after three weeks they know the target's position well enough to apparate directly there. After five weeks, they start knowing the target's emotional state. After that, the tracker's state quickly declines as they mentally turn into an insane version of the target. Most trackers eventually end up loving their target because of this, although some go down the other end of the spectrum and grow to hate their target above all else. The advantage of this spell is that it cannot be stopped by standard anti-tracking charms or wards, and allows the tracker to apparate straight through defensive wards to their target's location if it lasts long enough. There are ways for the target to counter this spell before it grows to the 'apparate at will' level but the difficulty lies in finding out it was actually cast on you in the first place.

*Pain of the Protector*, more commonly known these days as *The St. Mungo's Malady*: appearing as a relatively simple effect at first, this curse drastically weakens a target's immune system for a period of time, making them very susceptible to infections, diseases and parasites if they're not careful. However, if the curse itself is targeted directly by healing spells, the curse passes to the caster as well, and so on and so on. This curse was the signature of the Dark Wizard Hendrick Callaghan in the 1780s, and was used to almost completely shut St. Mungo's down when used in combination with his inferi crafted from muggles killed by the influenza epidemic of the time (there was actually one happening in that time period). This made them far more deadly than they had any right to be, with them not just killing people in battles, but infecting the survivors, their families and those who tried to treat them as well. This went on until some bright spark found out that if you merely treated the symptoms of the contracted diseases instead of directly fighting the curse then it did not pass on. Within three months St. Mungo's was fully operational again and Callaghan was chucked in Azkaban, where a vindictive guard used his own curse on him. He succumbed two weeks into his life sentence to an infected sore on his ankle, and the curse has been well-documented since and countering its effects is part of the standard training all healers at St. Mungo's receive. However, not every healer was trained at St. Mungo's, and the curse is no longer well-known outside of the staff of magical hospitals, so any battlefield healer, or healer not attached to St. Mungo's, would likely contract the curse as well should they attempt to treat it.

**** This is a glorious piece of work you have written there. Reason for not spicing up the spell a little is I was afraid to lose the idea at the time.

I imagine it would have been developed in the 1880s of Germany, were many student clubs at the universities were fascinated in dueling (fencing). This was in the muggle world, so I imagine there was something similar in the wizarding one. The thing about the duels was to impress ladies. Either you won, and walked away with honor and prestige (and ladies at your arms), or you lost, and got an awesome scar that was a "chick magnet".
