  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** Is there a story that you would put on the level as of "Backwards with a Purpose"? I think it's my perfect fic, just a bit above "The Changeling". BwaP has the typical time travel stuff but things, change, their time travel has done stuff and there are consequences. I think it's a fantastic read and I was so sad when it was over.

** As per my previously stated plans, I've started reading Harry Crow, because it's in the FFN top ten and I figure I should read it before I can properly evaluate it.

Despite that, I'm struggling to continue and I'm only on chapter 6 (out of 106). I can let slide the fact that Harry is peak-human or inhumanly handsome, skilled, ripped, can perform magic that wizards previously thought impossible, etc; not really my thing, but some people like that kind of power fantasy. What really turns me off is how he interacts with other characters.

Half of them are doormats, who instantly find him attractive and polite and intelligent and perfect, and in the case of several teachers, are willing to promptly abandon any prior loyalty to the Headmaster and proclaim unswerving loyalty to Harry, or in the case of students, start planning to form a harem (which of course he turns down since he identifies as a goblin and will therefore be faithful to one partner for life). The most egregious case is perhaps Professor McGonagall; the first words he ever said to her were a horribly rude tirade against her involvement in leaving him on a doorstep, but she's then first in line afterward to endlessly declare how polite and wonderful he is.

The other half of of the characters, the ones who dislike him, are reduced to caricatures of themselves. Professor Dumbledore is obsessed with controlling him, yet also supremely incompetent, such as somehow thinking that forcing Harry to be sorted under his birth surname would be a great victory and a foolproof plan. Professor Snape has all of his canonical bitterness, but none of his intelligence or competency. Ron Weasley is unfailingly rude to absolutely everyone. Draco is orders of magnitude less subtle and cunning than canon, if that be possible. There are no nuanced or complex villains here.

The fact that Hermione, who is drooling over Harry from first sight, writes to her mother for exercise clothes (so she can duplicate Harry's godlike physique) and gets a bunch of spandex in return, also bothered me. She's eleven years old, what kind of mother does that?

I think I'll continue as far as chapter 10, for the sake of fairness, but I might not be able to stomach more.

Despite the superficial similarities, I'm not sure how anyone puts this in the same bucket as Methods of Rationality. MoR holds its protagonist to account for his actions, it shows that other people can often be smarter and more competent than him, it justifies his friendships being formed, and in the end, it acknowledges that for all his precociousness, Harry has been just smart enough to make bigger mistakes than anyone else. And all along the way it's teaching lessons about ethics and thinking about how you think; even if you eventually decide that you disagree with those lessons, still the process of thinking that through and making the decision is beneficial.

"Professor, I'm really sorry I overreacted like that and broke Ron's wand. I can pay for a replacement." "Oh, no, Mr Potter, we can't go punishing Hogwarts' champion for other people's bad behaviour." "I just feel like I shouldn't have lashed out so strongly. I get why he felt upset."

*** It gets worse, save yourself the time and frustration. Ironically, this is the fic that my best friend shared with me that ended up getting me into HP fanfic. I read the whole fucking thing out of duty. The author does this awful thing where, not only do you have to live through the scene through the protagonist, you then have to endure the protagonist explaining the scene afterwards to another party. If you cut all of that unnecessary exposition you could probably cut 25% of its interminable length.

Instead of Azkaban, Sirius settled down in Little Whinging to keep an eye on his godson, and hired Remus Lupin to run his bookshop for him. Then one day when Harry was eight, Sirius found out how the Dursleys treated him, and stole him away. "

It has Sirus/remus raising harry but with help from some unexpected others. Little harry in the story is adorable. It is kind of serious but in a good way. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/58157]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/Phoenix-Insurgent]]

Ousted from Hogwarts by a gang of corrupt, incompetent officials, Albus Dumbledore comes to the understanding that Voldemort is not his only enemy. Now, fighting on two fronts against the Ministry and Voldemort, he knows he needs an ally. One, who like him, possesses an extraordinary amount power and skill. Deviates from canon in the middle of The Order of the Phoenix. The fic is not 100% complete yet, but it isn't abandoned.

I am about halfway done with the story, and I enjoyed immensely so far. I really loved the concept of Dumbledore deciding to take matters of the Ministry into his own hands, and also the concept of Dumbledore finally deciding to use fear and power in order to deliver justice.

It's really well written and I love the storytelling and the ideas the author came up with, but Albus Potter is quite literally the dumbest person I've ever met. He's so easily manipulated, his moods always get the better of him and as of yet there's no sign whatsoever of why he should be in Slytherin. He's honestly a mini-Harry, just not as intelligent.

** Kinda been on a break from Harry Potter fics but this is the last one I've read that really caught my attention.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14403330]]

Chained - " Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he gets captured by the Order of the Phoenix. There's a catch --- from the moment they set eyes on Harry's forced Dark Mark, they despise him. "

I know time travel fics seems to be a bit overdone but this was written way too good to ignore. I haven't read a plot like it for so long -- or at least nothing that was written well. This fanfic keeps you on your toes and leaves you desperate to read more. I nearly cried when it updated twice two weeks ago.

** "Before the door of hell lamps burned"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22220911/chapters/53056576]]

So this is a 4th year AU where Pettigrew was captured 3rd year and Sirius takes care of Harry

Reading this felt like a mix of 4th year and 6th year

It is refreshing as there is no bashing for once. The trio's friendship is strong and they learn about the prophecy from Sirius. This leads them to proactively prepare for voldie - however this is not some OP magic. They do practice dueling but also learn some magic theory - one interesting point converges with what exactly is the DADA curse.

There is politics but not lordship style - moreso learning how Voldemort came to power/ was in plain sight via propaganda, misinformation, etc.

Character wise everyone seems similar to canon counterparts if bit more open minded/flexible.

** The Time Spiral by MemberOfDumbledoresArmy on fanfiction.net “Sirius Black never expected to fall in love. That was James' thing. It wasn't that he wasn't interested in finding the right girl, he just didn't think she existed. The problem is she does exist, just in the wrong time.” Rated M for language and smut. It's a next-gen time travel fic to the marauders era. I know time travel fics aren't up a lot of people's alleys, but it's done really well imo. And it sticks really close to canon, a few very minor details are changed but the author explains why. I'm 5 chapters from finishing so far and don't want it to end.

UPDATE: I've finished and I'm sad and happy, it was great

** I've just read linkffn(Prisoner by TheLoud) and then I read everything I could find by this author. It's all excellent.

The Prisoner looks at Remus's infiltration of the werewolf pack as a spy for Dumbledore. It has wonderful characters ( Remus yes, but also others) and plot. Unlike some fanfiction authors I've read, TheLoud is expert at dialogues.

The only downside to this story imho is it ended too soon, or ( here's hoping) it's unfinished, although it does halt in an appropriate place.

Snape tells Voldemort that Harry is a horcrux to save him from certain death. Malfoy gets a new mission: befriend Harry to bring him to Voldemort. It has the typical tropes of a "manipulative Dumbledore" Story but turns them on the head. For example: Malfoy says Dumbledore steals Harrys votes in the Wizardgamot - but Harry don't believe his childhood enemy and instead talks to Dumbledore who has a really logical explanation why he holds the Potter Vote. And: While Dumbledore is manipulative and cunning he actually means well, loves Harry and is not only sprouting "the greater good".

She has an amazing way of writing OC's or characters that are very unexplored in canon (she's my go to when it comes to second generation fics). I don't read a lot of mystery/case solving Auror stories but when I'm in the mood I always go for this trilogy. I love Theia and love seeing how her relationship with Harry progresses. I love how the case always seems to tie in with the characters' personal lives so the story is not only about the case (which is the main reason I avoid auror case stories, they get so boring when all I'm reading about is the case and not the characters themselves) The first tow stories are finished but the third only has 5 chapters and I just got my hopes of her continuing it crushed today on tumbler.

Basically a crossover with the 2010 tv version of Sherlock Holmes in which Sherlock and John adopt Harry and pretty much unfuck his life bit by bit. Narration is fine, the language is good, and characterization feels pretty appropriate in general.

I'm still only a fourth of the way in, and I have enjoyed it so far. At least, I've enjoyed the pre-Hogwarts chapter and the first year. However, the OCs who have been featuring pretty heavily through the fic are now starting to take over more and more, and getting rather plot-breaking characteristics, so I expect the enjoyability to drop off pretty sharply in the next chapters.

Harry Potter, M, English, Romance & Hurt/Comfort, chapters: 300, words: 263k+, favs: 7k+, follows: 4k+, updated: May 12, 2016 published: Aug 10, 2015, Hermione G., Draco M., Pansy P., Theodore N.

I really enjoyed it. I can see myself rereading this a few times. The reason I enjoyed it so much was that it was entirely different and new from anything I've read before. Some of the characters eventual life goals are surprising but really charming. Lots of character development. Lots of satisfying conclusions.

** I just got finished reading linkffn(One Step Forward, Two Decades Back) by corvusdraconis. Very much an AU story that starts with Hermione getting thrown back in time to an AU. I love AU stories; more interesting to me than canon style stories. The wilder the AU the better. This story is very heartwarming, uplifting and sweet and just enough 'overcoming tragedy and darkness' to balance things out. Plot is kinda complicated which I like. I like the author's take on time travel, kinda complicated but the author ties it all together nicely. A lot of the character behavior is kind of trope-y and cliche :-( but the heartwarming feel more than makes up for it. Recommended if you enjoy well-written WAFF. Be warned that there's LOTS of fluff at the very end. I'm a total sucker for stories that celebrate and highlight characters who are good, kind, thoughtful, smart and compassionate. Only a tiny bit of sex and violence.

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius & Regulus Black, & member of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.

** I've been re-reading "Running on Air" again. This is a story that always makes me shed a few tears, the writing is a literal masterpiece. Where Draco Malfoy has been missing for three years and Harry Potter is an Auror on the case. As he solves the case through memories, he slowly fall in love. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378]]

I'm also reading Time to spare, where both Draco and Harry are sent back in time by Harry's future self. It is the Marauder's seventh year, both of them are Gryffindors but Harry distanced himself from them and befreinds Snape. Draco doesn't want to be a Death Eater and is being friendly with the Marauders. It's very good so far. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare]]

** Just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation by R-Dude]]

I thought it was brilliant. I loved this Harry and his interactions with Daphne. The romance, the politics, the writing itself. I now accept this as canon.

The only problem is my expectations are high coming off this story so the other post-Hogwarts fics feel meh.

*** Definitely one of my favorites out there - it's very well done, and deals well with the tropes it used.

For other post Hogwarts fics that I've enjoyed, you might want to look at Novocaine (another Harry/Daphne one) and Grow Young with Me (a Harry/OC muggle one). Not sure if you've read either of those, but they're worth a try to see if they're up your alley!

**** Another vote for both of these. I regularly re-read both of them and really enjoy them. Grow Young with Me is one of the only romance based stories that has really got to me and made me sigh with pleasure.
