***** There's a lot of immature writers writing fanfiction. By immature I mean not very skilled yet, it's not necessarily about age. Neil Gaiman said writing fanfiction was a good way to hone your craft and I think that's good advice. Inevitably though, it means there's going to be some not very good ones. It can be annoying as a reader but great for the writers to have this place to practise.

** Linkffn(11160991) has hands down the best system for divination in any fic I've ever read, where it's a full, perfectly legitimate field of study, but people gradually forgot that as they focused more and more on prophecy, which is its most enticing but also least reliable branch.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, while I don't recommend the fic itself, has a (mostly) incredible system for occlumency and legiligency that several other fics, most notably Ashes of Chaos, have just straight up stolen.

***** But if you gave the credit I don't see a problem tho. For example, I really love the fanfic 'I'm still here' and stories based on it (by Kathryn518) and the stories based on it give her credit too. I actually first read a story based on it and that's a beautiful way to not only use ideas, but also make fanfiction authors more known and thus everyone wins. And it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission after all

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** One of my favorites was a fic that linked virginity with magic in a non-ick kind of way. It had implications about how virginity had been used in the past to enslave witches, etc, but focused more on the witches of Hogwarts using their virginity with powerful, ancient magic spells to create a giant ward that protected the school from a Voldemort invasion.

It had its share of smut, and the key to the ward being permanent, of course, came from losing virginity, but it was just really a neat concept. It included goddesses chosen by the witches who also afforded them protections while their plans were in motion. But the catch there was the goddesses only came out once when called upon.

And the last thing that I thought was fascinating was how the writer wove in religion. In the story, Hermione was a Catholic who struggled with the ideals of purity and abstinence and got great comfort from a Sister of the church during the summer holidays. That turned into a very interesting plot point all its own that I loved! It didn't denigrate religious beliefs but somehow wove them into the story with some plausibility.
