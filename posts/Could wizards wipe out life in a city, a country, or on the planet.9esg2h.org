I was thinking about a wizard enlarging a rock high up in the air, using a Banishing Charm on it, and then practically destroying a city. Would there be any other ways for wizards to destroy life on a mass scale?

** Sure there would be, and you could even make it specific to Muggles!

What do Muggles in the western world need, but wizards don't? Electricity!

I think around 5-10 wizards using apparition and a few well-placed blasting-curses could take out (and keep it down) most of the European power grid, same for the US.

A study by the German government came to the conclusion that for an europe-wide blackout within 1-2 weeks most of Europe would go into a civil-war-like state. Oh, and if you like fun, also attack the water grid, that's bound to be fun in a city like London or New York.

Back to electricity: we can also creatively imperius a few of the people working on nuclear reactors. A few of them exploding wouldn't be too bad now, would it?

Imperius is also a good idea in general, pilots can do a lot of damage if you point them at the right targets. Imagine 10-20 pilots suddenly going rogue, all at once. Not nice.

And of course your ideas work too, just look at the destruction of the obscrus in the FB movie, and how quick they repaired it.

If you use a bit of creativity you can really kill a lot of people easily.

*** What I'm going to say comes up every time in these "Wizards vs Muggles" threads, but it's important to point out: In canon we see an expert on muggles who doesn't know how to pronounce electricity and the average Wizard is unable to pick out appropriate clothes to wear in muggle society.

I therefore find your ideas hard to accept. Though they make a lot sense on a theoretical level or in a "what if muggles had wizard powers" scenario. In practice Wizards appear to be way too isolationist to come up with any of these tactics.

The wizards victory argument is based on the premise that wizards know what the electric grid looks like and what a nuclear reactor is.

** This... isn't exactly a response to your question. Rather, it's me free-associating along the lines of your question.

With that said...

Can curses self-replicate? That is, if you cursed something, could the curse apply itself to something else? We know the gemino curse can exponentially clone objects, especially when someone touches it, but could it exponentially clone spells?

The most basic application of this is a magical plague. Touch the infected and you too are infected. It'd take a lot of work to calibrate it to spread like a pandemic - it can't be too weak (it'll die out) /or/ too strong (it'll kill all potential hosts or will be quarantined too fast) - but you could make something really dangerous.

Then, could you do that with a non-physical spell? Say, anyone who is infected spreads a confundus-like compulsion. It doesn't have to be lethal, or even harmful, but now you've got a mind-control plague.

And what if you tweaked it further? What if it was a subtle compulsion or a delayed reaction? And what if it could spread through eye-contact like a viral form of legilimency? Or better yet, if you tied it to a taboo-like effect, spreads through performing (or even witnessing) certain actions. Hell, if you set it right, could you design a curse that curses anyone who reads a specific line of text and compels them to write more of that text? Well, now you've got a magical meme.

Or, in SCP terms, you've got a Euclid- or Keter-class memetic hazard.

Indeed it can. The vaults deep within Gringotts used the Geminio curse to replicate the objects in the vault, and the other enchantments on the contents of the vault were carried over to the cloned objects too. Like the Lestrange vault had all the objects cursed to burn at the touch, and all the copies were had that curse too in DH.

** I've had to find ways to avoid this scenario multiple times in the Arithmancer-Verse. Self-replicating spells degrade or run out of power before they can go full grey goo. Mandrakes only kill at point-blank range, and /Sonorus/ doesn't work on them. Fiendfyre will burn itself out pretty quickly if left unchecked. Imperiusing someone to Imperius more people like a virus (even though that only extends to wizards) is unreliable. Unbreakability spells can be overwhelmed with sufficient force (so you can't leverage them to initiate nuclear fusion or something). Radioactive materials cannot be transfigured, period. All of these things as described in canon could have catastrophic city-destroying effects or worse, but my headcanon is that magic is self-limiting in ways that it simply takes too much "power," for lack of a better word, to make them work.

As for a dedicated group of wizards bringing down the muggle world, that it scarily plausible and could only really be avoided by wizards as a society self policing. Magical terrorists destroy the electrical grid? Aurors Apparate in and magically repair the transformers. Imperius world leaders to start nuclear war? Someone (maybe the ICW) is keeping an eye on that. (I hope, anyway. Fudge sure didn't seem competent enough with the muggle Prime Minister to even know what a nuke /was/.)

**** No, electricity does work around magic. that's a misconception in a lot of fanon. Arthur Weasley did lots of magic at the Dursley household and it broke no electrical things. People are confusing Hermione's statement that lots of magic being around Hogwarts stops electronics and think that means any amount of magic stops them. It doesnt.

** Is it cheating to use the imperius to unleash nuclear armageddon? Legilimency+memory charms to gather the necessary information on who to target, then a small number of wizards (potentially even just one very powerful one with a few international portkeys) order the relevant individuals to initiate simultaneous launch of the world's whole stockpile.\\
If the wizarding world in general was out to do it then they'd probably survive too, wards, unbreakable charms etc. could make for some rather impressive bunkers, bubble head charms, aguamenti and similar spells could likely handle fallout quite well by providing clean air and water to grow plants and breathe/drink.
