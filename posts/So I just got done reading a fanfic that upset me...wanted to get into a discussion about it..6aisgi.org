So I just finished reading the series linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/series/338101]]) and while I enjoyed the first book in the four story series because of the character development it gave Draco and Harry as a whole it slowly but surely started to devolve into one of those pureblood stories...where "non-traditionalist" are basically as bad as pureblood supremacists because they want to change wizarding culture and disregard tradition. Theirs a scene in the story where Harry almost sneers at Dumbledore because he chose pork chops as his dinner at the Yule Ball instead of something more refined and It really started to get on my nerves. Like...I get it changing a culture can come off as ignorant or possibly evil, but the way Pureblood culture was portrayed in this story really bothered me...Did anyone else have that issue when reading the series? AND I'm not harping on the author if they are on this Sub, I enjoyed the story even when I was getting a bit upset about things, but I do want to have a discussion about it.

This story is the opposite of alot of Harry Potter fics, where Harry and Hermoine praise muggle culture and tear down wizarding, but at the same time it left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth the same way those fics do.

(Written at 1 in the morning so might have some errors)


** It's kind of funny, since there's not really much of a "pureblood culture" that we can see in canon. Several core parts of a culture (religion, views on marriage/family, political system) are either not mentioned at all, or pretty much the same as muggle Britain, sometimes with a little bit of magic added. The "key differences" seem to be robes, hats, quills and Quidditch. Even the entertainment seems to be rather conventional - radio shows, bands, books and comics, etc.

So, in order to set up a divide between muggle and pureblood culture, you need to make up a pureblood culture first that's not just a copy of "Old England with some magic". Preferably with both more positive and more negative aspects compared to modern Britain. Otherwise, any "muggleborns can't understand us" speech won't work - not if any muggleborn could simply read Jane Austen et al. and be at home among purebloods.

Although you also have to consider if the portrayal of a culture is done with limited (and very biased) 3rd Person POV. Hermione, full of fire and passion about injustices she can see, will portray the same culture very differently compared to Harry, who sees a refuge from his shitty muggle life.

*** Popular culture would definitely have a divide, I'm guessing the adventures of Martin Miggs would be funny to muggleborns in an entirely different and unintended way. And I doubt someone like Draco or even Ron would be able to fully understand the humour of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, which would have probably been very popular among muggleborn kids.

Although Yes Minister might be universally popular in the Fudge era.

** I too get really annoyed at the aristocrat!Harry fics, but I actually prefer fics that portray conservative culture in a more positive light, because it's a lot more interesting than the alternative IMO. There's probably hundreds of fics that feature completely muggleized wizarding societies (usually American) where everyone lives in democratic harmony and uses guns for some reason, and thousands where Harry bashes every facet of wizarding culture. Seeing fics that embrace elements of wizarding culture are refreshing IMO

*** I agree. If you're going to highlight an element of the world, then do something interesting with it.

Giving everyone modern mindsets is lazy. Worse, it feels like bad world building.

Modern culture, and the values we care about, is a product of modern circumstances.

Wizard society has totally different challenges than we do. Its priorities, customs and sacred values should be correspondingly different.

Like, we moderns value privacy and individual agency. Restricting access to books is a mark of a dictator.

But give everyone the capacity to start a zombie apocalypse and suddenly "unrestricted library access" is a lot less appealing as societal values.

Aristocratic culture, if it's worth exploring, should make sense in its context.

** Yeah, it does bother me, and I first saw this trope in a fic by Colubrina that was recommended to me. It is annoying, and it really shows that many authors don't understand culture, how it is constructed, or how to navigate an alien culture. Even assuming their arguments make sense, there is a lot wrong with how these are written. Hamfisted attempts at assimilation by the MC, Dumbledore being bashed for rebelling against tradition(for no reason), and occasionally, the token pureblood who still hates the MC.

The MC(usually Harry or Hermione) just sheds their old worldview like an oversize shirt, and it is not that easy to do, even if you hated where you came from. Tom Riddle managed it to a degree, because he was a sociopath, but even he was unable to let go of his past entirely.

More importantly, don't let it distract you from the fact that an author named BakenandEggs wrote Harry sneering at pork chops.

****** What I mean is, Harry becomes irrational and erratic, Dumbledore is for some reason ineffectual. They get flaws, while the Malfoys suddenly aren't so prejudiced.

To be fair, the people shedding their worldview part is common to most stories where Hermione or Harry are paired with death eaters or Voldemort. I tried reading Pygmalion too but my suspension of disbelief only lasted until [[/spoiler][Hermione's being waited on by imperiused muggles]].

I don't generally have a problem with reading stories about evil protagonists, linkffn(3090351), but the way Colubrina writes them makes me not want to root for anyone in the story.

Yep. But the Blood Purists don't compose the entirety of the British wizarding world. There are families like the Malfoys, but also those like the Weasleys. It's not a homogeneous thing.

***** It's not a homogeneous thing, yes, but even your example of the Weasleys is not a great one. They are held up as this great family of muggle loving purebloods, at least by Blood Purists, to the point they get called blood traitors. But if they are the best the Wizarding World has to offer, it is a very poor showing for the magicals indeed. Arthur, well intentioned as he may be, is clearly not knowledgeable about the nonmagical world and if he truly is the Ministry's expert in that subject, it's clear that Oblivations are only reason the Statue of Secrecy hasn't been broken. As far as the rest of the family goes we don't see them necessarily have problems with other Muggles (depending how you take Arthur's reaction to the Grangers: innocent curiosity or unconscious condescension on the level of British explorers gawping at foreign tribesmen.) But the one nonmagical that they are actually related to? It's someone that the family doesn't talk about, a disgrace. So it seems that the gamut of treatment of nonmagicals runs from genocide to at best either extreme condescension if they don't know you or the sort of treatment homosexuals even now still to some extent have in the US.
