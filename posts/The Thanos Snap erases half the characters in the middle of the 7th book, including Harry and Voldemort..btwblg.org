This prompt has been asked for before, and this came up, it's actually a collection of one-shot stuff with three-and-a-half chapters of snap-stuff rather than dedicated to it, but oh well.

I mean, movie-version Strange, I could see Dumbledore actually going for a draw in a duel, and at best winning against the Supreme Sorcerer. But, Harry? Yeah... right... stupify stupify stupify .... jeezus i'm so sick of that spell.

** This could be interesting because such a large-scale event that is unquestionably supernatural would basically have to destroy the Statute of Secrecy.

You'd have people reeling from the loss and secondary destruction, and suddenly there's a convenient scapegoat: those wizard bastards. They /must/ have done this. Some one, somewhere, was doing some sort of illegal magical experimental bullshit and murdered half of everyone.

Would be a fantastic endtimes story about wizards fighting for their lives against billions of angry Muggles, all while the world falls apart due to the sudden deaths of essential people.

*** Why would it destroy the Statute of Secrecy? It'd be viewed as a supernatural event, of course, but it's not as though muggles would all go "There must be a hidden society of wizards among us!" That'd be a crazy giant leap of logic, even if it would be right. They'd just view it as an act of God.

And even if that knowledge still somehow came out, muggles would be far too busy trying to survive. Their economy would collapse. Everything would collapse. Muggles in their normal, functioning society would have trouble killing wizards. Muggles in a society completely falling apart in chaos couldn't do anything even if they wanted to.

That's why Thanos's whole idea is stupid as fuck. You don't kill just half the population, you kill literally millions more from all the consequences of half the world going missing.

Wizards would be much better off. They'll lose loved ones, they'll lose access to certain magical store for a time, but they'd otherwise be relatively fine.

Well, I mean, it's fiction, you can do whatever you want with the premise. But it seems to me that with millions of magicals all over the globe, all it takes is one small group somewhere to "come out of the closet" to blow the lid off the whole thing.

Maybe it's a group of Native American shamans using their magic to benefit the Muggles on their reservation; maybe it's a group of Magical-Supremacist extremists who see this as an opportunity to make their move; maybe the sudden death of half the ICW sends people on a magic-using blitz to uncover which member nation broke the treaty and was responsible for the snap (because surely they would see it as an out-of-control magical fuckup, having no knowledge of Thanos).

Or maybe it's even simpler than that: it takes constant, ongoing effort by the Ministry to maintain the statue (e.g. covering up after some idiot schoolkids take a flying car out for a spin) and the sudden chaos of the snap leaves them disorganized and dysfunctional. And post-snap Muggles are now much more likely to believe in supernatural explanations, so images of magic broadcast on TV are going to be believed.

This is certainly true, and the insanity of their world falling apart would lead to some really extreme behavior that could make for a really compelling story.

In a large scale, way, yeah, but at least during the initial upheaval, there'd be a whole lot of angry rednecks and/or gangbangers with firearms and a hankering to express their blame on somebody via bullet. Many magicals would surely retreat behind all sorts of muggle-repelling charms and whatnot, but at least in the very short term, things would be ugly for everyone. Violence would beget violence and the process of establishing a new world order would include everything from political intrigue to military action to simple stories of families trying to heal from the loss.

Sure, but the process of re-finding that equilibrium is where the story lives.

One of the things I found sort of unbelievable about Endgame was that the world wasn't actually /worse/ off. Surely an event like that would spark a dozen major wars and hundreds of smaller conflicts all across the globe.

The movie was fine and all, but I found myself not giving the slightest shit about how they dealt with Thanos, and much /much/ more interested in exactly what happened during that "5 years later" period. Did Tony just deploy thousands of autonomous suits around the globe to quell wars? Did Professor Hulk come up with a way to solve the ecological crises caused by key personnel disappearing from nuclear reactors, off shore oil platforms, nuclear subs?

I'd love to see that period addressed in the HP universe.

Even if they could, why would anyone want to suddenly fuck with a group of people that's been hidden among them for centuries and that's apparently capable of killing off billions of people instantly?

That's like me finding out a kraken lives in the lake near my house, blaming it for my child's drowning, and then going to fuck with it with nothing but a shotgun instead of focusing on feeding the remainder of my family. Maybe some lunatic would go for it, but most people would just try to get their life back on track.

Anyone who's going to go nuts and try to kill "the secret wizards" is going to spend more time killing their own people than actually bypassing magical protections. At most there'd be a few isolated incidents, but wizards would largely be fine from muggles.

I just don't see muggles causing enough believable conflict /for/ that kind of story, that's my problem with it. There's plenty of reasonable stories to tell with this kind of thing (I could see a scenario where wizards at least try to come out of hiding and help muggles), but "billions of angry Muggles" actually killing off wizards (to any significant degree) isn't one of them for me.
