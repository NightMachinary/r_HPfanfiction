I've seen the whole secret child of Voldie and Bella theme a few times (Not cursed child lol), but I was wondering/hoping there were some fics out there that follow this theme in some way without being too predictable, stereotypical, or what have you.

I've seen some recs on here before of Voldemort "adopting" Harry in some fashion or another, and I'm open to those sort of things too since I've not read much of the genre.

I'm not sure how I feel about stories with Hermione being Voldemort's secret child; I'm hesitant, but only because that idea was ruined for me by some fic ages ago. I can't remember the name of it, but it was bad. If you're curious and want to know what my fanfiction nightmare was, here's that under this convenient spoiler tag: >! Basically Voldie learned how to love, became a doting father, gave up his world domination schemes in favor of family or some such nonsense. Snape was a vampire lord with a penis as big as a horse's and he would just kinda bang Hermione wherever and whenever (At one point Draco comments that Snape's dick puts him to shame or something like that because he was having sex with Hermione and she went into labor, so of course everyone had to come see) everyone lived in Malfoy manor like one big gross family, and it was just weird. Ugh. !< So yeah, maybe give me some good summary or why you liked it if you're recommending a Hermione Riddle fanfiction ðŸ˜…

TL;DR - does anyone have some good daddy Voldemort recommendations for me?


** That spoiler is...horrific.

If self-promotion's okay, I'm writing an unconventional father!Voldemort series.

It doesn't exactly focus on Voldemort being a father, but the entire series revolves around it.

** The Pandemic AU has two kinds of daddy Voldemort.

He kind of ends up adopting Narcissa by accident in one of the side stories. This is honestly one of the best written stories I read with a unique premise. Voldemort learning to parent isn't really said outright. Actually nothing is really said outright. It's a rare fic. The parenting part is only around ten years. Narcissa is the one in charge after that because he starts losing his sanity. Great father-daughter dynamic. No smut. Angsty. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29310402]])

There's also Voldemort as Delphini's father in the main story. She is a healer at St. Mungo's during the Wizarding World Coronavirus pandemic. The relationship between them is written in a way that sold it to me. The main story has slash. Hard avoid if that's not your thing.

I have recced this before because it's so good and underrated. I don't like many of the author's choices in this AU but definitely digging how creative and original they were. They don't regurgitate tropes how I got used to expecting in fics.

** The "Methods of Humanity" series by local_doom_void on ao3 is pretty solid. Essentially, Voldemort ends up retiring after getting the philosopher's stone, becomes the new DADA professor, and ends up psuedo-adopting Harry along the way. It's a found family fic, and although he's retired, he's still Voldemort and has unconventional morals at times. It's a series of one shots and the first is called "You Asked if I Were Happy," but Harry and Voldemort don't get to talk until the second one. Here's the link:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22008067]]

Happy reading! (As a side note, that fic with Hermonie certainly does seem... traumatizing.)

** In 'Her Unknown Past' it's implied that Hermione is the daughter of Voldemort & a OC Rosier who died around the time she was born. Ollivander, Dumbledore & some of the Order seem to be in the know of her heritage. It's pretty canon-compliant up to the fifth year where things were just starting to change but it has yet to update. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18911065/chapters/44892322]]) 'A Mother's Love' MC is the daughter of Voldemort & Bellatrix. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9641978/1/A-Mother-s-Love]]) 'Harry Potter and the Girl with Silver Blue Hair' is a nice one-shot with a Delphini Black who is Harry's age. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13150189/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-with-Silver-Blue-Hair]]) 'One Night Stand' is pretty AU with father!Voldemort & sane!Voldemort tropes; Tom Riddle & Lily Potter had a one night stand in a muggle bar making them Harry Potter's parents. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12884573/1/One-Night-Stand]]) And finally 'Elsewhere but not Elsewhen' where Harry is catapulted to a alternate universe where his parents are alive & no one knows who the child-who-lived is. Harry meets Bellatrix & Voldemort's daughter who was raised in the muggle world. Voldemort's daughter is the Girl-Who-Lived IIRC linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7118223/1/Elsewhere-but-not-Elsewhen]])

  Hermione was just a normal girl with an abusive father who didn't care about her. At least that was what she thought until one day she received a letter that said she was a witch.But surprises don't end there. After that, she sees herself being forced to deal with the truth about her real parents, a crazy Azkaban prisioner who's on the loose trying to kill her for some unknown and odd reason, and more. Way, way more.

  Bellatrix gives birth to a daughter after the first wizarding war, without the Dark Lord's knowledge. As Persephone Black grows both sides want her for their own. But nothing is more powerful than A Mother's Love...right? Very slow burner, starts off fairly innocent, lots of character development but a lot of messed up stuff later on.
