Sup fellow HP fans,

I was wondering if people could suggest quality works with an OC? Not necessarily romance-centric, as adventurer/mystery etc is also the bomb.

I'm widening the search from the Maurader's era to Next-Gen because I just want a good read. So preferably a complete story or at the very least a story that has good traction (unless it's a one shot).

This might be too broad, but hey, now's the thread to post your favorite OC story from any of these eras!

FanFiction.Net is solid but if the story is worth it, I can travel outside my comfort zone...

Preferably no slash, just a preference and in no way am I bashing that tango.

Sincerely,

A lost 20-something who likes reading good stories to get lost in

** The best next gen series you will ever read is easily [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation]]

It is completely planned, with all 7 books written and finished. Very adventure/mystery, it'll keep you hooked for all 7 books. The OCs are amazing, they integrate with the original characters really well. The series is complete and the author is still working in prequels and sequels to his series. You will definitely get lost in the series- tbh, I've taken most of what I've read in it as canon now because it fits so amazingly well with the original books.
