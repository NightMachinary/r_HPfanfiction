I dont remember much but what I remember is harry gets put back into his younger self (I think 5) and he ends up going to the three Broomsticks to go to Gringotts and meets the Malfoys. He evokes some rule and becomes the guardian of Neville because his parents where Nevills god parents or something. He and Neville move into a manner and get taught by the paintings (along with Draco after a while) . And once they all make it to the school Harry beats all the court and becomes the boss of Slytherin.

Oh I also remember harry "playing" with the troll after telling the Slytherins to stay put and protect eachother and after getting hit he kills it. (He is in a coma for a while after that)
