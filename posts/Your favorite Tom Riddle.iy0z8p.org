What is your favorite rendition of Tom Riddle that you've come across? I love that he's one of the characters who changes depending on the genre or story.

** I can't for the life of me remember what it's called, maybe someone else can help out, but there's a fic where Harry becomes close to Snape and has private potions lessons with him. At one point he accidentally creates a sentient soap bubble creature. But the connection with Voldemort is much stronger than in canon and Harry and Voldemort have genuine mental conversations and form a sort of weird relationship. Riddle was more than just the stereotypical "evil wizard" he is in a lot of fics

The fic sounds silly when I write it like that, but I think it did a good job toeing the line between crack and a real, more serious story.

*** I know what you're talking about! I love that one! Such a creepy use of the horcrux, especially when Harry and snape are brewing together and Harry says something like “you always were an academic, Severus” and they realize it's Voldemort speaking through him. I remember straight up gasping when I read it for the first time.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** My favourite 'good' Voldemort would be Emily Riddle from Limpieza de Sangre. She's ridiculously fleshed out, human but still noticably Voldemort, as opposed to the usual two-dimensional Voldemort you see in fics.

My favourite /Tom/ Riddle, and favourite evil Voldemort in general, is sort of a tie between Earl of the North by Lord Silvere and the Voldemort from the Black Queen series by Silently Watches. Both of them are terrifyingly intelligent and shown to be ridiculously powerful. The one from Black Queen actually kills the Boy Who Lived and conquers Britain before being barely defeated at Hogwarts.

** A dead one.

Lol no, I honestly can't think of any fics where Tom is actually a character.

**** I don't know, I just usually don't like tom riddle fics because probably 80% have him at canon age paired with harry or Hermione, or they have time travel harry/tom, which I also don't like. Also I don't like reading about you know, /a total sociopath/.of course they could have a time travel redemption kind of thing, but I also don't like /that/. Basically most Tom riddle fics hit on every trope that I just can't read.
