The idea came into my head a while back, and made itself at home. I'm genuinely curious about the possibilities here, since Percy did seem to enjoy the idea of being a model Prefect. I also find Percy would be far more likely to turn the Diary in to McGongall or Dumbledore if he realized it was a charmed artifact and he remembered "Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where it keeps its brain."


** I'm into the idea of Dark Lord Percymort, Minister for Magic, who owned the book /Prefects Who Gained Power/ and took it to heart. Percy's greatest weakness is his ambition, and even though he believes in following the rules, he could be persuaded into the Dark Side with the right argument. Because what are rules and laws but the writings of fallible men?

To quote Fudge, "Laws can be changed!"

I'm sure Percy would agree that the power to make big decisions---like writing and passing laws---should be put into the proper hands.

The little black book had been left in the glowing embers of the Gryffindor Common Room's fireplace. White ash coated the leather cover, but the pages inside were smooth and pristine. Unmarked by soot or ink, Percy deduced it must have been cunningly enchanted with some sort of advanced /Impervius/, which Professor Flitwick had only started going over the previous week.

To test it, Percy dug into his pocket for a quill---he'd gotten into the habit of carrying spare quills around---and wrote a sentence on the first page.

/Ex libris Percy Ignatius Weasley, Gryffindor Prefect./

He had always liked Latin; it was a language that resounded with strength and authority, two attributes he'd long admired.

To his alarm, the words disappeared, sinking into the paper like pumpkin juice on a tablecloth.

*/Hello, Percy. My name is Tom Riddle./*

Percy pushed himself up from the table. The diary had written back. It had recognized and repeated his name, implying that it was enchanted with something more complicated than simple weatherproofing. And /it had its own name/.

The name sounded familiar to him. Hadn't he seen it before? He scoured his memory for where he might have encountered the name "Tom Riddle". The O.W.L. score ranking records, the Hogwarts Trophy Room, the list of prefects in the last century and a half?

/I've seen your name somewhere,/ wrote Percy. /Did you earn a Special Services accolade at one point?/

*/Yes,/* the diary wrote back. */Not the finest of my Hogwarts achievements, of course, but I could hardly have refused it when they gave it to me. I digress---I'm sure you've done plenty of impressive things yourself, as a prefect./*

Percy felt his ears grow warm, pleased that the diary found his prefectship worthy of merit. There weren't many who did---many in his House found him to be a nuisance, particularly his brothers, who tried to charm his badge to read "Pinhead" as often as they could get away with it.

/I earned twelve O.W.L.s last year.../ he wrote, deciding not to turn the little notebook in to Professor McGonagall's lost and found box.

*** Oh goodness, this is going to turn into such a horrible disaster... I mean, he's bright, and he /did/ think Umbridge was a very fine witch, didn't he?

Thank you for a snippet that gives me an awful feeling of doom.

Of course, he'll be drained dry in June.... sooner if he fights less.... You can go in several directions from here, none of them very good for the Weasleys, Percy or Harry. If he's saved as Ginny was, what will that do to his perceptions of evil? What would he be like, later on in the war?

Brilliant start and horribly promising, thanks.

A politician in my country started his first speech in goverment in Latin, probably thinking the same thing. He was promptly cut of, and told to speak normally. I can definitely see someone as pompous as Percy doing something similar at some point.

**** Because him being a Gryffindor is an ambition of his. He always looked jealously on to the relationship his brothers had with each other, how Ginny idolized Bill, adored Charlie and goofed around with the twins. He saw the little twinkle in his father's eye when the twins cracked jokes with his older brothers. How his parents paid more attention to everybody else. He knew he was "different", more ambitious than the others. He also knew that Charlie and Bill were popular and everything came easy to them. So when the Hat offered him the choice between Ravenclaw (for his studiousness), Slytherin (for his ambitions), Hufflepuff (for his hard work and loyalty) or Gryffindor, he leapt at the chance to become one. To be with his family. To belong

**** Because he is a Weasley, and Weasleys go to Gryffindor.

Ginny - Could have gone to Slytherin, Hufflepuff, or perhaps even Ravenclaw if she valued her friendship with Luna enough. However, the rest of her family was in Gryffindor and her crush, Harry Potter, was in Gryffindor.

The Twins - Could have gone to Ravenclaw, Slytherin, or Hufflepuff.

There is also Charley and Bill Weasley, one of which could have at least gone to Ravenclaw.
