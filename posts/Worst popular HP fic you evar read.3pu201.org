Because ranting about something terrible is fun. Honestly, I don't have much to choose from because if a fic is crap, then I'll normally quit by chapter 2. I've heard that In this world and the next is ball burstingly awful though and the time may come when I force myself to see what the fuss is about.

** I'll go with my standard copypasta for these types of threads:

Oh God Not Again!

It's basically a retelling of canon. It does some things differently and then has to jump through hoops to make sure canon happens anyway. +Sometimes+ So often it has to retcon things to fix the plot holes it makes.

Harry is this weird pseudo-soapbox for the author and he has these random thoughts (usually to try and fix a plot hole and explain why it makes sense that everything is still following canon) that feel completely shoe horned in. Sometimes it's just the author replying to reviews by having Harry have some random thought.

None of the characters were likeable, except weirdly Lockhart. They all have the "speak like grown ups" problem and they often don't even seem like friends. Harry is completely obnoxious, the worst of a bad bunch.

**** tl:dr the author steals a bunch of major character traits and plot points from FMA alchemist without giving credit and then proceeds to try and jam them into one single character which makes for an abomination of a story for those who have seen the series itself.

It's been a year or more since I've read it, and I didn't get past the first 10 chapters but the relationship he has with his brother is that of the two brothers in FMA, his sparking fire powers is identical in every way to that of Roy Mustang. his swordsmanship is identical in both the style of the fighting itself and even the swords of King Bradley. the progressive militarization of society and his training of more mages in wand less magic follows the same framework of Amestris' (the fictional country in which most of the show takes place) military and their society. the problem isn't that Marquis black has borrowed these elements to implement in his/her story, that's what writing fanfiction is all about.I personally would love to see a well done harry potter/FMA crossover (although some would say that the two universes are mutually exclusive since in FMA they rely on the alchametical principals of equivalent exchange while wizards can make wine, water and birds (to name but a few) appear out of thin air) but I'm sure authors could write around that the problem is that the author took all these elements without at least giving due credit. what's worse but mostly expected of fanfiction is that the author took all the elements from a mirrad of characters that made FMA so awesome and then crammed them into one character, Harry Potter. and what we end up with is a story that seems like it's well written, original etc... to those who don't know any better (not trying to be pretentious here, I'll be the first to admit that FMA is a pretty long animé to watch for those that don't enjoy anime in the first place) but to anyone whose seen even the abbreviated version of the series it's becomes painfully obvious what the author had done, and done incredibly poorly at that. it feels almost like a slap to the face that author would steal all these elements without giving credit and then use them so terribly. one of these days once exams are done I must just read through the entirety of this terribly rage inducing fanfiction just to document every single thing that the author has stolen and then used horribly.

Anyways sorry for the wall of text, typing all this out on mobile makes things hard to format.

While I've read a bit of the manga, it's not enough for me to comment be capable of commenting on the FMA thing.

However, I'd like to talk a bit about the things I like in Emperor.

First of all, it does it's own thing. Well, according to you, it does FMA's thing, but the point remains that it's so very different from pretty much everything I've read.

While there are plenty of fics that have intrigue, politics, and tactics, few have it rise to the level that's seen in Emperor, much less pull it off half as well as Marquis Black does.

Also, it's not exactly unknown, but I still feel that it's underappreciated.

And I agree that it's always hard to find stories that break the mould successfully, and when we do find them we cherish them dearly. It just so happens that we happen to disagree on whether or not this story has done that, again, there's no problem with that.

As for the politics involved, I can't really speak for that since I didn't get far enough into the book before being righteously offended, that may have been a mistake on my part.

As a fan of both FMA and Emporer I am curious but unconvinced. I'm not writing the idea off, but I think the arguments are to broad. To say that all the characters are copy pasted, I think you'd need to put up a chart showing the similarities between characters.

#+end_quote

He doesn't spark fire, he does a wandless cast of fiendfyre. Also, producing fire at the snap of a finger and fighting with swords are not original to FMA. I could see Harry being a mashup the Ed/Fuhrer/Mustang I suppose...

**** while I will concede that arguments might have overly broad in regards to the characters I still say that there is a startling amount of similarity between the ones in Emperor and FMA.

As for making a table to prove my point...I'm not really sure if your serious.

As for his wandless casting of fiendfyre, that is what the author gives as an explanation but Harry always initiates it by snapping his fingers to create a spark, just as Mustang does. I haven't read the full fanfic so maybe there was some roundabout explanation further in.

I think that your misconstruing my argument a bit, I never claimed that control over fire and sword fighting was unique to FMA, that would be ridiculous and making it seem as if that's my argument makes my argument look ridiculous as a result. What I am saying is that when you combine; the way the fire ability manifests itself, the style of sword fighting, the character traits, and the way to society is set up you get a story that seems to hage taken multiple elements of the FMA universe.

Sorry about that, I did go overboard there. As a note, Harry's use of snaping thing drops off further into the fic when he is no longer on the frontlines, so it's not a consistent presence in the story.

 

The fire and sword similarities are minimal on my mind and not convincing. If I looked into it and found more evidence ot would take on more weight of course.

 

Something that I remebered that does support your argument: later in the fic there are fighters that use a copypaste of the 3D maneuvering gear from /Attack on Titan/. That shows a clear instance of the author copypasting, and from an anime, same genre as FMA. That being said, there are two caveats 1. it is awesome and 2. I think they credit the source in the author's notes.

*** First off, before I start ranting, I'd like to say that I actually enjoyed it as a break from fics with actual conflict. I'd also like to say that despite how much I dislike the flanderization of some characters (like Hermione), the story has relatively few grammatical errors and it's dialogue is actually quite good most of the time which is an area that a lot of stories are quite lacking.

HOLY SHIT I hate that one just for the way it goes about its fucking premise. It has the whole goddam wizarding world go "Oh, hey, you know what I'll do today? I think I'll let a column from the Wizarding Worlds equivalent of [[/r/conspiracy]] shape my opinions because I, being an inferior British sheeple have never thought about them before." I mean seriously, /nobody/ even thought to compare scores from Hogwarts to schools abroad?! What the actual fuck? I don't know about what you think, but I'm pretty sure that the parents of actual Lords wouldn't be stupid enough to funnel their children through a expensive death trap without at least doing some fucking research into alternatives.

AND THEN there's that weird shit where suddenly EVERYONE is reading the Quibbler just because of how edgy this one writer is and EVERYONE knows this guy's handle and EVERYONE is suddenly questioning EVERYTHING the ministry has told them because obviously, being the magical sheep they are they've never thought to question ANYTHING the ministry has told them about their precious school.

Oh, and as a side note, I hate that stupid fucking practice of appending the names of every fucking house that anyone happens to accrue onto the end of their last names. If they actually followed that practice pretty much everyone would be Lord Percival-Potter-Malfoy-Greengrass-Hufflepuff-Weasley-Macnair-Pettigrew-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Dumbledore-Prewett-Gaunt-Lestrange-Black-Ravenclaw ^{^{^{so}}} ^{^{^{mote}}} ^{^{^{it}}} ^{^{^{be}}} just because of how bloody inbred they all are.

**** Thanks for the rant. The biggest problem with the fic is that despite the perceived intelligence that is being stuffed into Harry to make him seem 'revolutionary' or whatever, he's not actually intelligent, he's not actually edgy, and his arguments aren't really that clever. Anyone with more than two brain cells to rub together would be able to see right through the flimsy plot progression. Somehow, 15,843 people managed to have the wool pulled over their eyes.

Yeah, I am kind of very stupid. It took me a while to figure out what the "HPLV" in the summary meant...

Harry was this ridiculously OP and intelligent renegade who, other than being OP and intelligent, also happened to write shitty yaoi stories in his free time. (that was revealed later on...)

I also like that there is real conflict, as well as significant failures, so that although Harry seems strong he doesn't feel that much like a Mary Sue.

The author tracts didn't bother me much since I largely agree with some of them, and the others (e.g. the 'turning into a cat' thing at the start) I assumed were meant as a joke.
