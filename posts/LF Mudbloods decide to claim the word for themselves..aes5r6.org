Having Hermione and Colin greet each other "Yo my Mudblood" "Sup Mudblood" and it actively annoying Malfoy and Co.


** The wish fulfillment Garry-Stu fic /Knowledge is Power/ by Serpentsannin/Oblong/Fettucini/etc. (the author changed his moniker a lot) did this as an otherwise unmemorable throwaway moment. The story is incomplete, was taken down by the author, but has since been reposted to fanfiction.net by Defenestratable. I won't provide a link since site rules forbid such, but this should be sufficient to locate it.

** linkffn(9241207) does that to a degree-but it was more proving a point than completely appropriating and regularly using the word, starts at chapter 10. Decent fic if I remember right.

Edit: Started rereading it, starts off with super harry then quickly subverts it, so don't get scared away by Super-Duper-Harry. It's still a bit of the ole crack but not as bad as some.

  The usual story. Manipulative Dumbles, Harry gaining his independence. This takes place after Harry's third year. It was a perfectly normal day in Privet Drive. The birds are singing, the bees are buzzing, and the Dursleys were their usual cheerful selfs. Then suddenly...Now what on earth is going on this time!

**** You don't take the power away by using insults for your own group. Insult is always taken, so it only has power because you gave the word the power in the first place. The far easier way would be to not give a fuck in the first place. I mean, who cares what some inbred bigot thinks?

***** Well, I'm really glad you, Hellstrike, apparently know it all so much better than actual communities who've actually done it twice over in history! Why didn't they all just use YOUR far, FAR superior way instead?! Were they all stupid or something?! Just IGNORE IT in the first place! Oh my gosh! It's so FUCKING SIMPLE AND EASY!!!

This is sarcasm. You don't know better than everyone else, and it isn't that easy. And it isn't using insults, it's taking the insults and turning them into positives, into marks of pride and honor instead of something that every time it's said stabs you inside. That's why we do it, because it's already the way it is to begin with, and it has to change and stop. Just ignoring it doesn't work, or else everyone would have been doing THAT instead. Ignoring things doesn't make them stop, it doesn't make it go away.

****** It does not work. The word which cannot be used proves that it is still a grave insult and I know for a fact that despite attempts to assimilate the German word "Kanacke" (badly integrated person from the middle East), it remains an insult and not a word of empowerment. I'll give you queer though. So the score is 1-1 in English.

I mean, to keep with the HP example, if Hermione and Justin would start calling each other "Mudblood", what do you think Draco would think?

1) Oh no, my words hold no power. Whatever will I do?

Or

2) Finally the scum knows its place!

********* Hey, you were presented with 2 examples of the first result occurring, and now you've presented 2 examples of the second one. Surely that means that it can go either way? It depends on a multitude of factors such as the nature and the depth of oppression, whether it's religion- or bigotry-based, whether it relates to an immutable characteric (such as the skin colour), whether it can be normalised (that is, I think, the most important one).

And normalisation of anything is best done by overuse.

I really feel the empowerment coming from that one. That will teach the KKK a lesson for sure.

You might make a slur your rallying cry, but that won't change its meaning for the bigots using it.

And if we go by the argument that this was a proven way to deal with bigotry and therefore good, the way antisemitism was rooted out of my home country was by the might of thirty-five million Russians fighting and later raping their way from Moscow to the Elbe while the Western Allies systematically levelled entire towns. There is de-facto no antisemitism left in Germany outside of Muslim communities. Therefore that is also a proven way and good. Perhaps the Muggleborns should try that as well... /s

************* Yeah, this is cultural. American English is constantly evolving and the meaning of words are being appropriated and changed by different groups, cliques, and ethnicities. We do the reverse too where the appropriate scientific terms get turned into insults. "Moron", "retard", and "idiot" were once the agreed upon polite terms. Now they are insults.

In Britain, where the story is, it is less likely that they would do that.
