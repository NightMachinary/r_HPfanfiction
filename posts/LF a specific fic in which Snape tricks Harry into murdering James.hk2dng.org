:END:
It was a time travel fic (oneshot I think). Snape is portrayed at first as being a typical "redeemed, secretly good" character, but by the end we realize he's bitter and hates Harry. Harry is tricked into killing James who is in his animagus form at the time.


** You know, it's stuff like this that ensures the first spell I would ever learn is the Animagus reversal spell. I would cast it at EVERYTHING. And Umbridge. Because I want to see if she is a Toad that is a Humimagus.
