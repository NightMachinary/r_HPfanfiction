I've tried Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness and was put off by the militaristic characterisation. Are there other good fics telling the story of Hogwarts while the Trio was away?


** Bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh

linkffn(Not From Others) by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] is *THE DEFINITIVE* fic for that request.

...

This comment seems real familiar.

**** How is that going? I would have volunteered but

A) I lack voice recording technology

B) My Midwest, kinda Canadian-like voice can't do a British accent worth a damn

****** I'm more of a lurker but I think what you're doing is brilliant and I'd be happy to lend a hand if you'd like. I don't have a mic or experience, but I do have a British accent if that helps

***** Well, I've gotten the lines for Polly Beckett and three chapters worth of Ginnys lines (Thanks, FloreatCastellum)

I still need to buy a mic, I know the one I want.
