we've all seen fanfics where ron is a disgusting eater or eats alot but ever seen one where it's a gift or ability? IF you have ever played yoshi's story you'll know that the idea is to eat plenty of fruit so the yoshi's can get happier and save the super happy tree

anyone ever seen a concept like this?

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
