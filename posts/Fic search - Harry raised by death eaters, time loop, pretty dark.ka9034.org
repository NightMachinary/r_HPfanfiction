:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Here goes, I've been searching for this fic for ages and can't find it!

‚Äã

From what I remember, Harry isn't Jame's son and when the potters are killed he is taken in by Snape. Snape is killed by death eaters and Harry is taken to the Malfoys and there is some kind of soul bond situation to keep him from running away and he is raised as a good little death eater kid.

‚Äã

This Harry at some point messes up either a time travel either spell or time-turner and gets stuck in a loop where he is in the same AU as another Harry that ends when that Harry dies. In the loops he can't really do anything because the soul bond still exists with that AUs version of the character (I think it was Lucius). This Harry is pretty much insane, pops up in the narrative to give cryptic hints to the AU Harry but under a glamour and calls himself 'the assistant' before he later lets on who he really is.

‚Äã

Random things I remember:

Harry lost an eye and has a fancy replacement one

There is mention of a specific potion Strawberry Sleep/Strawberry dream?

The bond gets transferred to another death eater at some point

The bond is basically a mind control thing, that Harry has to do what he is told to do but can bend the rules a little with interpretations of what he is being ordered to do and exploits that

Lots of torture/gore

Really long fic

‚Äã

Please, if any of this rings any bells let me know. It is driving me insane that I can't find this fic and it was years ago that I read it.


** That'd be my fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12955299/1/][For the Price of a Soul]], though I've since rewritten it to improve so there may be a few things that seem unfamiliar.

*** You are an absolute diamond. It must have been at least 4 years ago that I read it and something about it came back to me the other day. I've been looking for it ever since with what random details I remembered with no joy! Thank you üòÅ

** Yeah this vaguely sounds familiar. I remember him calling himself the assistant when he spoke to his other self. And that he'd disappear for a bit and there was torture involved. I definitely didn't save it because it wasn't my cup of tea, but it was on FF.net at the time
