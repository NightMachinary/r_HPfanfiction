I have started this fanfic at least 3 times but couldn't bring myself to finish it for some reason, so I though I would ask you guys if it's worth reading or not.


** Could have been good if it was four times smaller.

*** Was gonna post something to that effect. It's not like it doesn't have /something/ going for it, but it's bogged down in hundreds of thousands of unnecessary words.

**** I'm currently reading this story so thought I would put in my 2 cents.

I would say it's not the extra words so much, as I've read plenty of easier to read fics that padded as much if not more, as the word selection. If we go back to Word and paste this story in and check the writing level, I'm sure it would weigh in at 11th grade level at least; most fanfiction doesn't go beyond 7th or 9th probably.

It actually reminds me of some classical 18th or 19th century romances, decent writing but rather dry, which is what got me thinking about why it was so difficult to read.

***** In other words, smarter word choice/better writing could have conveyed the same content in a shorter word count. Basically we've said the same thing differently.

****** Yes, but the author might not be an expert writer, as fanfiction authors usually aren't. About 90% of the time they're young and just getting into writing, retired and taking it up for a hobby, or ESL and writing for the experience. By the author's previous pen name (Jedi Emeritus, which you can see in some of their author notes), I suspect they're retired. Given this, and the fact they're not getting paid and we get all this for free, I'm inclined to cut most of them some slack (while leaving constructive criticism where I can, of course).

For that matter, if it weren't for my inherent laziness, I suspect I would be the overly-wordy sort of author as well. /shrugs/

** I liked it, but the only reason I was able to read it all was because I started when it was only 7 chapter old and followed it to the end.

** The author was a Molly Weasley hater and it came up quite glaringly a few times. That was my biggest beef with the fic.
