Just breached 77,000 words!

Not sure if it's bad form or not to keep promoting it here when I've updated, but no one has complained yet so idk...

Based off a prompt where Lavender was chosen as the fourth champion, instead of Harry. Prompt can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/99s775/discussion_lavender_brown_vs_the_goblet_of_fire/]]

** For anyone unfamiliar with this fic:

It's a well written, non-crack story with Lavender as the champion. Why Lavender is the champion is not yet known, but it doesn't appear to be an accident. I think it captures the dynamic of Lavender and her friendship with Parvati, and rather more loose friendship with Hermione, really well, and it also involves the development of some other characters, mostly Slytherins.

I've so far found it really interesting, and I've been enjoying reading it. There's a bit of mystery to go along with the plot line, which leaves you guessing a bit.

Warning: it looks like it's tending towards Draco/Harry as a side pairing, and it doesn't have a warning about that anywhere in the fic (unless I'm blind). I usually hate that pairing, but I'm not going to drop it, because I like the rest of the story. I know a lot of people on this subreddit don't like it, so I felt it would be important to let people know.

**** There is definitely slash, it was first introduced in the last chapter. Whether or not the final pairing is Harry/Draco is still unknown, but it seems likely.

** I found this chapter difficult to read, it jumped around too much.

Glad the author didnt decide to drop Ron in favor for Draco, would've dropped the fic.
