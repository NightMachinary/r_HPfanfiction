I have decided to write a fanfic where a war-hardened Harry finds himself going to the different world when he discovers not only has he dimension travelled but time travelled too. He finds himself at the start of Iris (his younger 'sister') worst: the Triwizard tournament. I need your guy's suggestions on how should the story go from there? Should Dumbledore be a good guy? What about Iris's friends?

** Subverting expectations helps in engagement. If you are writing in a category dominated by other fics that have set 'standards' or 'tropes', it helps to do something different.

** The thing with Dumbledore is that there is no way you can make him good without making him absolutely incompetent or you make him Machiavellian (willing to sacrifice people as long as he BENEFITS from it in some way). Dumbledore did absolutely 0 for Harry, besides showing him a Voldemort home movie. The guy was an absolute powerhouse, who could probably have walked into the Ministry and taken over by his own, just look at his fights against the Ministerial Escorts and in the Ministry (and Voldemort could do that as well). And yet he did nothing about any danger Harry was in, be it a Basilisk, Umbridge, Sirius Black/the dementors, Malfoy the Death Eater, Malfoy senior nearly killing Harry in front of his office and so on.

The best path would be for Harry to work for Iris (not a fan of this flower name, Holly or Jasmine are better IMO) and only act against Dumbledore when he does something which goes against his sister's interests, like forcing her back to the Dursleys, ignoring Snape's abuse or watching Umbridge torture her.

Iris friends are a difficult subject since you have to ask yourself if there's still the same dynamic between them (especially if Ron was her "best mate" despite their opposite genders) or if there is someone else (you can take one of the background characters like Fay Dunbar here). Also, Iris would probably take offence from the things Ron said about girls in general around the Yule Ball, and with their friendship already shaken, that could bury it forever. And for example, if in Harry's future someone made a mistake which cost them dearly or betrayed them, Harry would make sure that Iris stays away from that person at any costs or, if the person is above a certain age, simply kill him/her preemptively (not the most rational decisions, but people are not rational).

What you also need to consider is what Harry will do with other people. The Hermione he knew doesn't exist anymore since she is 15 again but some of his future friends are still adults (Tonks, Hestia Jones, Aurora Sinistra; that's your choice to make) and could probably help if he can prove his time/dimension travel (embarrassing stories only very few people know). It could be a place to sleep or something more. IMO, do not put the remaining Marauders on a pedestal. Sirius has more than one psychological issue and could probably use a mind healer (Harry could arrange that) and Lupin was a shit-tier husband, who needed a 17-year-old virgin to talk some sense into him. They did not interact outside of Harry's third year and Lupin showed no interest in helping Harry outside of his DADA job, and he was getting paid for that. So Lupin is not going to be that awesome, insightful and loyal guy you often see in fanfics. Also, just because he trapped Tonks in that shitty marriage does not mean that Harry would try to get her and Lupin together just so he would eventually have his godson. It is an alternate dimension, things should not happen as they did in the canon verse.

As for Harry and Iris, he would probably train her for both, the specific tasks and for an encounter with Voldemort. And he would make sure that the graveyard plot would not work, like removing the bones from the grave, exposing fake Moody, hunting Babymort, catching Pettigrew and advising Iris to abandon the third task once she began it and fulfilled the contract. You can kill Voldemort's body despite the Horcruxes, he just turns into a fancy ghost instead of dying. But you can blast him out of any body, which buys you time to do something about the Horcruxes.

****** It really depends on how you envision the story and how you want Harry's timeline to look like. Is the focus going to be on him or his sister? Generally speaking there should be some kind of romantic interaction for the protagonist since love is one of humanities largest driving force on a personal level.

There are several ways you can play this out, the easiest being Harry's love interest time travelling with him so you can have an established relationship. A more interesting twist on that would be someone else dimension travelling with Harry but they were not together before the travel and perhaps it takes some time for them to find each other because both thought that they were the only one who shifted realities.

You could have him seek out one of his alternate dimension friends and, unlike in the original universe, they fall in love. This can also be done with someone who used to be his lover/friend with benefits with little romantic attachment. Or Harry is hanging out near Hogwarts to help Iris and he falls for someone he never really interacted with before (Hogwarts teacher, random Hogsmeade shopkeeper, someone from the visiting school staff like Karkarof's assistant or a Beauxbaton teacher). The choice is yours to make.

You could also have Harry seek out his dead girlfriend/lover/wife, who was originally murdered but that one is difficult to write without being creepy since she is not the person he remembers.
