Please help me. I read a story the other day now I can't remember the name of it. Harry and Hermione travel back in time and Hermione takes over Sirius Black body and becomes him. Please Help me. Thank You.


** Is it this one? It hasn't updated in awhile but I remember it well enough. It's a nice read at least! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6125328/1/Black-Phoenix]]
