You all have been wonderful with your help for when i requested fics. So i thought i'd recommend one of my personal favourites.\\
linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1755901/1/Rebellion]]) So this is a humour fic, with a surprisingly good storyline. It never fails to make me laugh out loud and i've read and reread it numerous times. The grammar isn't always great but the story is a most enjoyable read.


** For a crack fic it's not bad.

*** Relatively speaking that's some fairly glowing praise.

Edit: having read the first few chapters, unless it gets significantly better I'd have to say it was in fact bad, and not the ironic sort either.

**** I was being sarcastic. This was some of the worst drivel I attempted to read in YEARS.
