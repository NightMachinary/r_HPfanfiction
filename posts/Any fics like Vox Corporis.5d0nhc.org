So I was a bit of a late arrival to the world of Fan Fiction and have been playing catch up ever since. I finally got around to reading Vox Corporis, and man was it good. I did not expect to like it so much as I tend to lean towards more action, and more fantastical stories (darker harry, more powerful harry, more romance harry). This was a breath of fresh air and simply had me locked in from start to finish. Of course, it doesn't hurt that I am a huge Harry/Hermione pairing fan and was always pissed JK did not make that happen.

So that said, are there any other stories like Vox Corporis to read? And by "like" I mean focused more on the relationship or of the same quality level?

It does not have to be Harry/Hermione although thats my preferred Harry pairing. I also enjoy seeing him with Luna, Tonks, Daphne, and Tracy (and to a lesser degree Fleur). To be blunt... I am not a Weasley fan. Dont like Ron/Hermione one bit, and while I like Ginny, I generally dont like her paired with Harry (sorry those who do). Feel free to suggest whatever, but figured you should know my interests.

No slash. I dont mind multiple/group relationships. Preferably M+ as a rating (like Vox is) so the story is not treated with kiddy gloves. Preferably complete as its always annoying to read romances where there is no ending. Preferably Harry focused.

Thanks!

** linkffn(6574535) is great. I've recently read that one so you I can trust my memory when I say it's good.

linkffn(11080542) this is equally as good as the one above, but /very/ AU. It changes how Wizarding Society functions altogether.

linkffn(7525570) this is a Hermione/Ginny fic if you're into that. It was alright although it suffered from being overly long.

linkffn(11185533) Just a really cute story. Harry/Daphne. Very short.

linkffn(3867175) Another one I enjoyed. It's too far back in memory for me to insist that it's amazing but I recall it was very good.

linkffn(4200568) I think this is the first fic in H/Hr I ever read. I loved it when I started reading fanfiction. I don't know how well it holds up though.

linkffn(10034363) This is a neat one. Goes quite AU after Book 4, but it's an interesting ride.

linkffn(9766604) If you want powerful Harry this is a great choice. It's fairly well written too, but it can be a little self-indulgent with Harry's power. Still not nearly as bad as most PowerfulHarry! stories.

  Ranma didn't always like his dad. But Genma had one major advantage over his LAST dad: He wasn't an insane scientist from the Silver Millennium. Meet the Senshi, Ranma. I hope you're friends, because you're stuck with them. (Contains much Old Shame, newbie mistakes, and no IC-ness from anyone involved. You've been warned.) (Shut up, lots of stories have a decade plus hiatus.)

  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.
