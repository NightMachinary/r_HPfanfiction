** I'm very much enjoying this story.

I find the characterization of Albus enthralling, and the narrative leaps to be engaging and not overdone.

Very solid work, definitely the best next-gen story I've read, and one of the top fanfictions in general.

** I have both read and reviewed this story before, and I will re-iterate what I said before :

- Too much /tell/ in chapter two. Albus's story could have been better shown or told in stages rather than a big info-dumpish scene. It's not immediately important to the plot, so........

- I really don't know what JKR's poor sorting hat did in canon to be painted as an object that takes pleasure in torturing kids, its voice "snide" and "repugnant with glee".

- You push Albus's handsomeness and silky voice and all that a bit too much, and it makes you come across as a fangirl at times.

- Action scenes are rather rushed and lack tension. Need to work on those. Probably the biggest complaint with the story.

- Why don't any of Rose's huge family help her out? I mean, I do understand their security concerns, but they fought a whole war for fuck's sake, they wouldn't just abandon Rose like that. It seems like a contrived way to get Rose and Albus isolated and alone.

- Not really a complaint, but the story might come across as a bit GrimDark at times, with all the mass deaths and riots and all. It hasn't crossed the line yet, but something to keep in mind.

- You push the whole mystery a bit too much. I love a good mystery as much as anyone else, but it might be good to have a few answers before piling up more questions.

That's it, I guess. Most of them are nitpicks (other than the action stuff, which really does detract from the story) are easily shrugged off, but since you asked for constructive criticism, I had to mention anyway. Despite the rather long list of nitpicks, I do like your story, and most of the elements -- the characterizations, the dialogue, the mystery -- are really well done. /Original/ and /intriguing/, perhaps the two words I would use to describe the story.

I don't /think/ it needs a rewrite, although reworking the two fights would be a really good thing IMO. Thing is, regardless of how many times you edit the thing, you'll probably keep finding stuff to improve on. The part that is most important is the resolution of the mystery, and that lies ahead, so perhaps it's better to focus on it than look back. Besides, it's been two months already and I want the story to update already, dammit.

** After a skim of the first chapter, one thing that bothers me is the amount of dialogue without dialogue tags and that aren't part of a larger paragraph. Granted it's used to decent effect in the first section, but it's something that will often make me drop a fic the moment I see it as it generally implies that I'm going to have a hard time following who's saying what in a fic's dialogue.

I second this. It is a style thing, but it seems a little sparse at the start and when it happens later. The lack of dialog beats (not tags, but action markers) makes things hard to read. Usually people who use little or no dialog tags write stuff attached or very strongly anchored to descriptive paragraphs, then it sort of flows out naturally from there.

Single word or sentence back and forths, like at the start of the first chapter, are very clunky to me. Perhaps that's not a good way to start things off. Certainly not ten or more in a row without additional material. It lacks pacing and that certain natural progression that makes eyes float down a page from beat to beat.

Fanfiction usually isn't written that dry, though plenty of good novelists make it work. So this isn't /wrong/, except maybe for a fanfiction audience. That's my opinion.

--------------

One last note. When used, dialog tag phrase formats are sometimes a little off. This isn't optional style for standard format prose. Examples:

#+begin_quote
  "Rose." She interrupted, her eyes bright. "Call me Rose."

  "But that's why you're here isn't it?" She said, with a half smile, "A graduate. A..."
#+end_quote

Should be:

#+begin_quote
  "Rose*,"* *she* interrupted, her eyes bright. "Call me Rose."

  "But that's why you're here isn't it?" *she* said, with a half *smile.* "A graduate. A..."
#+end_quote

Always use comas before dialog tags inside quotes. Also, always lower case after dialog for the tag phrase, even with question marks and exclamation points. Periods before new dialog that doesn't continue uninterrupted after the dialog tag, like in the second example.

Just to be totally clear, if it is a totally different action being interjected with a new sentence, like a new dialog beat for the same speaker, it is capitalized. Of course, that often results in a new paragraph anyway, depending on personal style.
