As the title says the story was updated. You can fine the update [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/27/Grow-Young-with-Me][here]]


** I'm double-posting, because I'm half-way through this chapter and I don't want it to end.

This is one of those stories where I check my scroll-bar while reading, to make sure I'm not too close to the end. Even though, inevitably, I know I will be.

*** Oh fug, I thought I was the only one who did that. You know you're reading a good story when you can't stop reading wanting to get to the end, but at the same time you dread that moment because you don't know what to do with your life after that.

** It was nice. A bit too much of "will they or won't they" throughout the chapter and little got resolved, but it was still nice. Basically because it is this amazing story and I can't wait for more plot to happen. [[/u/taliesin19][u/taliesin19]] make plot happen, dammit! Faster!

** I think Harry should propose just before she finds out whether she got the job. Maybe even when she has the letter in her hand but hasn't opened it. Because that's basically his last chance to ask before he might lose her forever, but by doing it before she actually gets the news, there's less "marry me or get mind-wiped" pressure; if she really isn't ready, she can still turn him down and take her chances.

Edit: That said, I wouldn't object if he took the plunge sooner than that. But it's already pretty soon, and I can't see him rushing more than necessary when his kids are hesitant.
