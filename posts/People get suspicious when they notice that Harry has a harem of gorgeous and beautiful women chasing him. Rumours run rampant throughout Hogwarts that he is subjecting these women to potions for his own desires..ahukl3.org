** Well, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6586583/1/The-Prince-s-Harem][The Prince's Harem]], people are pretty suspicious of Snape, though they do think they know the reason they have one, they are just more scandalized than anything. It's the only harem fic I've ever read, but I think it's probably a very subversive of the trope. It might not be what you want.
