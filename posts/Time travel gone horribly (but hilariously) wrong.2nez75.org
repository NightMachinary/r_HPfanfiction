Has anyone found/read a fic that assumes things don't go correctly with time (or i suppose dimension) travel?

Like if Canon Harry goes back in time from the epilogue to save Sirius... but when he returns to his present he finds himself married to some woman named Daphne instead of Ginny and only has the original timeline's memories and so he has no idea what happened differently or why he's being told Draco will be over for dinner later with a story?

I'm expecting this sort of thing would most likely end up being a parody or crack'd fic, but serious would work too.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/6/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Two Thirds Blood Prince]], one-shot. Just read it and wonder how the author could have possibly come up with it.

*** The same author did a couple more of note, both complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother-In-Law's Love]] - Harry goes back in time to save his soul-bonded wife, Ginny, from her death at the hand of Walden McNair, but the soul bond gets confused and settles on Molly Weasley by mistake.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5116751/1/The-Life-of-Brian-A-Super-Harry-Parody][The Life of Brian: A Super-Harry Parody]] - at the end of his life, Harry tries to die, but metamorphizes into a super-ultra-mega-Harry. He goes back in time, but things don't quite work out.

**** Ooh, I loved A Mother-In-Law's Love. It's the only soul-bond fic I've ever liked.

***** Thanks so much--glad you liked it. That was the story I had stewing in my head as I wrote /Dagger and Rose/; it was my reward to myself for having finished my first novel-length piece.

*** This was very silly but fun to read. Also, the math Severus did checks out, I think, but gave me a headache trying to puzzle out.

**** Well from what maths I can remember I think Severus is right, but with limits rather than arithmetic. But like one of the reviewers said, one-quarter of each of their genes (the Y chromosome, black hair, etc) should be completely unique that came from the time travelling, or perhaps Lily's potion.

***** Yeah, it was trying to remember how to do limits that gave me the headache...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors Never Die]]

The most ridiculous time travel fic I've ever had the pleasure of reading.

The summary says it all: Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

*** I tried reading that once and wandered away halfway through the depressing prologue. I just tried it again, skimming down and starting at chapter 2... this looks hilarious.

...And Harry is now flirting with Minerva...

** It hasn't updated in a while but I found it funny.

Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

Hermione goes back and forth in time a few times, and each time she comes back to the present she's dating someone else (and of course has no memory of doing so).

** Not exactly time travel, but you must try a black comedy by nonjun if you want entertaining and screwed up.... The idea bachelor pad comes to mind.... Long lost relatives discovered in the most unusual manner.
