Does anyone know the name of the story where HArry is Tom's Grandson. And Tom is still Dark but he isn't evil and I think he makes Harry come stay with him (maybe kidnaps him) and Severus helps. I don't think Snape was Harry's father but I think him and Tom were working together cause Tom wanted to get to know/Teach Harry and Snape had loved Lily and wanted to protect Harry. I can't remember much more than that sorry. If you don't know the exact story but know similar please post links, I might have things mixed up. All i know for sure is Harry was his grandson and Snape was acting as a parent. Thanks.
