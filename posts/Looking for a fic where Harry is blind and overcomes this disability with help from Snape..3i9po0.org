It's been a while but I remember Harry staying at Hogwarts over the summer I think and being very self-pitying until Snape comes a long and gives him the kick in the ass he needs to get over it. At one point, Harry plays Quidditch blind as well.

*** This is an interesting premise but the spellchecking, or lack thereof, is distressing. I appreciate the link.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
