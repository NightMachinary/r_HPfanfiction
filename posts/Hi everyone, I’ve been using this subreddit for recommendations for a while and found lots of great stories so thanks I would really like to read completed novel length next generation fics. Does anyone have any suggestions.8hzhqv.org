  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

**** I figured, but that was the common one.

On AQ. I loathed the first fic, I really did. The heroine was unlikeable, the supporting characters were stupid or useless, and the teachers were among the most unhelpful individuals ever to grace a page.

But.

The second and third fics are about as good as writing gets. Very different from, but as good as, Rowling's work. The characters are interesting, the plot gripping, the mood dark and uncertain. I only have one other thing where I like it so much I can't bear to experience it all (pushing daisies - I've got three episodes left and I can't bear to watch them . . .) But yeah. It really is that good, and I was dead set against reading it and really did not like the first fic. Hope that helps.

Each chapter is a character profile of one of the next generation kids. Although you could call it a collection of stories instead of a novel, it's quite well-written and I enjoy how the stories build on each other. It's almost complete, the last chapter was posted a few days ago and we are only waiting for the epilogue.

** linkffn(Questions and Answers) is... just great. It isn't technically completed but between this main story and all of the shorts and one-shots attached to it, it may as well be, and it is still updating (albeit quite slowly). I basically consider it canon.

+1 for Hogwarts Houses Divided, another favourite.

Another one that I enjoy: linkffn(Ignite), but it gets a liittle bogged down with too much arcane detail at times. Features the next-gen kids as basically students on a gap year getting in way too deep on everything they look at.
