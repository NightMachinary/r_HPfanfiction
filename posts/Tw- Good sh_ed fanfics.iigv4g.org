This may sound like a weird request, but could you give me some recommendations for good self harm or eating disorder fan fictions? Thanks!


** i find myself looking for fanfictions of a similar vein- there are quite a few, but none that were particularly memorable- most of these tend to be extremely angsty and badly written- more vent projects than fics imo, and theres nothing wrong with that ig. ill look around and see if i have any decent recommendations, but bear in mind these often come with graphic trauma/abuse
