Sooo parts of this idea are not mine anyway here it is: harry owns a bar (not mine) and shortly before order 66, a familiar togrutan walks into his bar looking for a drink.

(Optional)

- Harry is immortal like other HP/SW crossovers I've read

- Harry maintains a strict non-violence in the bar and considers it neutral ground, he'll let anyone in as long as they play nice

- harry eventually leaves the bar to explore the galaxy (to look for something or just cause he's bored, author's choice)

- palpatine goes to his bar for a drink at some point and meets harry

- bad batch?


** Good idea? Bad idea? Dumb idea? Im genuinely curious.

*** It has already been done, but never completed and it's usually pretty edgy, but the over all idea is good, for me at least.
