I've only really ever read two and I'm not sure how to find more. Probably because I'm a fussy reader-- prefer slash between Harry and salazar lol


** Got a link to the two you liked?

This is still ongoing!

The second one was finished and I know how the title looks like but it was in Welsh or something so I can't spell it. Something with a G and a P and then in essence? You'll definitely find it if you go onto ao3 and sort by Harry/Salazar and then word count (and the timetravel tag if necessary). I would link it but I don't have access to ao3 at the moment :/
