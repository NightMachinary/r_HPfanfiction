Hey guys, so as the title suggests, I'm looking for good, well-written fics where Harry is the one who has feelings for Hermione before she has them for him. I've been noticing that in almost all of the fics I read, it's always Hermione whose harbored feelings for Harry or it's always her who discovers them first.

Do you guys know of any fics where perhaps Harry is initially into Hermione and she doesn't reciprocate his feelings until later, or maybe one where she is initially into someone else? Maybe one where has tries to woo her or something of that nature?


** Damn Id be into that too.

Actually id be into any well written fic these days.

** Yes, unfortunately it's gone as portkey.org seems to be down indefinitely. If anyone has a mirror or an archive, I'd really appreciate a link.

"Love Lost, Love Found," had an epilogue compliant H/Hr romance where tragedy strikes their families and Ron and Ginny perish in an accident. Harry and Hermione grieve, but eventually fall in love. It's fairly typical H/Hr romance, but Harry spends a few chapters harbouring feelings before Hermione reciprocates.

** I'd like to see this too, but not so much with the woo-ing (this is totally just me though, I get people who get the woos).

I'd be interested in seeing her being surprised at his feelings and struggling to decipher her feelings, whether they should risk their friendship, insecurities about never having been in a relationship before, etc - lots of ways you could go.

** See, a girl liking a guy unreciprocated is the guy being clueless, while gender swapping it makes the guy a creep. Guys should move on if she isn't interested, not work at it. Girls are the ones who wear a guy down until he's finally admits that he probably always liked her, but didn't know.

What if he's too clueless to realize that she isn't interested?

#+begin_quote

This is not how the real world works. Also, creepy. That's the kind of stalker girl featuring prominently in the "don't stick your dick in crazy" stories.

**** Honestly, the way the fandom portrays him, yes. He supposedly spent 6 years embarrassing Lily in public frequently, hoping that eventually she would say yes. When you keep going after one no and a little time, maybe a changed strategy, that's one thing. When you keep asking after a dozen no's with the same exact approach, it really gets old. When you would keep going after as many no's as it takes to finally get a yes, you're basically giving an ultimatum of "Go out with me or I will never stop bothering you." And that, that right there, is at the very least creepy.
