This sub has milked fanfiction.net and Archive of our Own for every Haphne and Hansy fic they have.

Looking for good fics where Harry gets with a Slytherin girl that isn't Daphne or Pansy.


** Harry/Fem!Blaise used to be super popular, but its been years since I've seen any new ones worth reading, and I can barely remember the good ones from when it was popular, other than the apprentice potter trilogy.

** I read one once that was Harry/Millicent Bullstrode, and I remember it being quite good, but the name is slipping my mind at the moment sorry. However, it is a pairing I would look into because it can be good when done well.

**** I don't believe that's the one I'm thinking of, since I'm pretty sure I never finished that one, but it's possible I guess.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Undead Alliance by sloth)

Post OttP sixth year fic released in 2004. The slytherin girl is an OC named Kari. She's competently developed.

I like sloth's Harry a lot. He stands up for himself, doesn't take shit from people and is proactive, all without turning into a cliche douchebag.

*** "Kari" sounds familiar, and so does the name, but not that familiar. This must have been one of the first HP fanfiction stories I read then. Pity I remember nothing of it.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller
