I'm not really much of a community person. To be frank, I don't really interact with any HP community other than this one. Which means, of course, that maybe this a question that can simply answered by putting down a link elsewhere. Or maybe not. I've relied on two of my close friends as betas in the past, but neither of them are really available anymore. Does everyone just rely on their fanfic-writing friends? How should I proceed?


** It kind of depends on what you're looking for. You can group it into two broad categories: the writing or the story.

Are you looking for someone to help you convey your ideas? To articulate your ideas in their best possible form? Or do you need someone to help you actually generate your ideas? Someone to be a sounding board who can steer you around cliches and bad plot points?

For the first case, I'd say [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/index.php][DLP's]] WbA section would be a good bet. For the second, you might try PM'ing authors of similar stories and seeing of any of them would be amenable to chatting about plot bunnies. For example, if you're writing a post-epilogue Harry/Hermione fic, make a note of some of the stories that have already explored this, pick the ones you like, and then contact the author.

** I've never had a friend beta. I have a friend that reads it over and tells me if it's good, but not edit etc. What I did first was I used ff.net's website and chose from their list of beta readers. Then when I posted my fic here over a year ago to promote it someone very kindly offered to beta for me, and while the first beta reader I got from ff.net didn't work out my beta reader from here has been working with me for well over a year. Also, usually readers that follow and like your fic will offer. There are a few beta readers that follow mine and every once in a while they will PM me and tell me if I ever need another beta they would love to help. So what you could do is go through your followers and see who has a beta profile.

I would suggest that you go through your list of followers first, see if any of them have a beta profile and if that doesn't work just start reading the beta profiles listed on the site. Ask a few people, give them a quick synopsis and see who bites. If no one bites do it again, or post here asking if anyone would want to beta read for you.

** Personally I don't much rely on betas. When I'm writing fanfic I use a style of review similar to how I handle it with academic writing. I write a section or chapter (or collection of chapters) over a fairly short period of time and then leave it to sit for at least two days while I do something else. I then return to it with fresh eyes and basically beta it myself. I generally repeat that process at least two or three times before the chapter gets off my hard-drive.

It has a disadvantage of not throwing up thematic errors or oversights as well as third party beta readers, but it also ensures that the person doing the beta reading (you) has the same expectations of the story as the writer (also you).

For the thematic side of things and a 'final eye' I can recommend something like [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/index.php][DLP]]'s WbA as suggested by Lane.

** I look for real world friends to beta my stuff and beta their stuff in return. I have no idea where you'd go online to find a beta, sorry. Maybe there are forums?

** Found my first one through a thread in this subreddit, but that fell through.

I now beta for and am beta'd by someone I entered an FFN writing competition thing (Quidditch League Fanfiction Competition) with.
