I can't seem to find a certain fic I read a few months back, either on Harry Potter Fanfic Archive or AO3 or Fanfiction.net. I don't remember much about it except it was long, decently written (in my opinion) and towards the end Harry fought Voldemort in their animagus forms, wyvern and basilisk respectively. Any help finding it would be great, thanks!


** I don't remember that one and magical creatures aren't usually Animagus forms but I do remember Harry as a mongoose fighting Naginimort. Linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter)

*** Chapter 47, and use find-on-page â€˜basilisk.' I do believe this is what you were looking for (it's what I was looking for at least). Thanks dark_case123!
