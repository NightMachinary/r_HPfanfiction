****** It probably isn't that bad. I mean, there's probably plenty of "muggleborns" who are born from normal flings (that aren't magic-rape) or whose magical parent is for some reason taken out of the picture before the spouse/child becomes aware of parent's magical nature (i.e. parent dies/leaves/abandons magic altogether/etc. without telling kid about magic). And then there's all the squibs and such.

But think of the internet: animosity towards a group + anonyminity = super dickish behavior. Now imagine if all the worst 4chan trolls and incels could wave a wand and get pussy whenever they wanted to, from a group generally considered "lesser" by wizard standards? Even if not every muggleborn is a half-blood rape baby, there's still a high chance any one of them could be.

** I adopt headcanons so quickly and have been in the fandom for so long that I don't know where most of my headcanons came from. Did I make them? Did I borrow them? Were they just straight canon - as in my original, instant upon reading interpretation - that became a headcanon when i discovered that somebody else had a different idea.... nobody knows. But here's a few of my favorites, anyway?

The whole horcrux thing started as a theoretical exercise in combining various type of magic and was never actually intended to be attempted. The parts about "what happens if a person is the horcrux" were just extrapolating off of that. And then some bozo tried it. It may not even work as immortality has yet to be achieved.

Voldemort's soul halved everytime he made a horcrux because theres just simply no way to control the break. Besides, even if somebody WAS stupid enough to try this, surely they're smart enough to not try it again. Or something.

Dementors are obsessed with Harry because of the horcrux and once its destroyed, they don't affect him nearly as much. He certainly never passes out again. And... (okay, I pretty sure this ones mine, lol) Harry's worst memory changes Halloween 1981 is the one night Harry and the horcrux had in common so it's what got pulled to the front.

Bellatrix had moved on to Neville by the time help arrived and his magic's all screwy because it was 'fixing' him.

Hermione stays Granger.

Ginny's a Potter in private, but a Weasley professionally. She worked hard to make a name for herself, to separate herself from her brothers and from Harry and... by the time they get married "Ginny Weasley" is essentially a brand.

Harry and Dudley become.... something? Not quite friends, not quite brothers but it's relatively... healthy? More than Christmas cards and the occasional awkward family dinners anyway. Dudley's the one that reaches out.

The first DADA professor after the war lasts something like 25 - 30 years. Both because the curse is lifted and because McGonagall was damn careful when hiring them.

Neville is, at various and not necessarily different times in his life, the Herbology professor, Head of Gryffindor, Deputy Headmaster, and Headmaster of Hogwarts.

Harry does the Auror thing and does it well. Is the youngest DMLE head ever, etc. And at the top of everybody's short list when the DADA professor retires.

** The whole Goblet of Fire plot made perfect sense, because it was the only way to unobtrusively get Harry to the sacrifice site.

Moreover, the whole "double Portkey" thing happened because Crouch took the original portkey spell on the cup (meant to teleport to the winner's circle) and layered his own on top (to the graveyard).

We know Crouch was excellent at Confundus charms- its said that only an exceedingly powerful Confundus Charm could have messed with the Cup.

*** I see two possibilities for the return portkey, either it's an unavoidable consequence of how it works, i.e. you can't just change the destination of a portkey, at least not without effectively remaking it (and that would mean it was a different portkey not keyed in to Hogwart's wards) but you can sneak an extra destination on, or it was to allow Voldemort to immediately send death eaters/himself to Hogwarts (less likely since it seemed he was happy to hide and grow his powerbase, but maybe if Harry had died he'd have seized the opportunity to inflict some serious damage on a gathering of important people).

**** Voldemort was still trying to keep his resurrection a secret. Having Harry die during a part of the tournament where there were almost no witnesses and where a multitude of things are trying to kill him is easier to explain away than vanishing in broad daylight in Hogsmeade.

This applies to a lesser extent in year 5 - plus after Voldemort's resurrection first Dumbledore and later the ministry probably had watchers on Harry when he was outside Hogwarts to present precisely this sort of thing from happening.

My favorite explanation is that Krum was put under the imperius not just to take out Cedric and Fleur and ensure Harry won. Harry dies under mysterious circumstances and the two other champions honestly testify that the foreign wizard from a school infamous for its use of Dark Magic was willing to cast unforgivables to win. Maybe throw in Krum's crush on Hermione and jealousy and suspicion as another motive. Maybe you could even loop Kakaroff in as he would sense Voldemort's return and flee the scene of the crime immediately after Harry's death, which would appear suspicious without full information.

All of this was a way for Voldemort to embody himself in the strongest way available, prove to his wavered followers that his loss to Harry was a fluke, and explain away one of his major enemies dying under circumstances where suspicion would be pinned squarely on people other than him, allowing him more time to marshal his forces in the shadows and gather strength unopposed.

Harry's improbable survival just made a brilliantly calibrated plan seem superficially stupid because we never saw how it would have played out had all the pieces come together in the likeliest way.

******** You know what always gets me? That Snape had the gall to show his face around Sirius. Sirius never knew that it was actually Snape's fault that the Potters were murdered.

********* Sirius almost got Snape mauled/infected/killed by a werewolf, never apologized and bragged about it to his face over a decade later. Not to mention what seems to be a pretty serious and vicious bullying campaign over a period of years.

Each one is an awful human being from the perspective of the other and that's why they snipe at each other whenever they're within earshot.

********** Snape had been snooping around trying his best to get 4 kids he didn't like expelled (which is pretty serious because as we can see from Hagrid, if you get expelled from hogwarts they snap your wand and your life is over). Sirius didn't tell him ‘hey snape, show up at x at x time'. He just intentionally said something about where he was going to be when snape was nearby. He gave snape rope and snape nearly hung humself with it.

*********** Where are we given that detail?

Also if Sirius intended to put Snape in danger why does his means of doing so matter?

******* He could have married hundreds of other witches to make an heir, dozens that would have been a pureblood, which might matter if an 'heir' rather than 'child' mindset was present.

I also think he hated Snape because he wanted Lily, not the other way around.

*** This is by far the most common background explanation given for Severitus.

I was personally never a fan of it, but to each their own (personally I don't mind a good /Sevitus/ but never liked the "Sev is Harry's biological father" version of it).

Obviously "Jily was loveless" doesn't necessarily imply Severitus, but I've never seen the trope used in other contexts.
