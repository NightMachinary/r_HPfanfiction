I have a plot bunny that I'm really considering writing.

Slytherin oc-centric

Some political stuff but minimal since they are teenagers

Draco Malfoy/Pansy Parkinson/etc redemption, sort of, in which they are not bad people but still spoiled brats

Almost no bashing- some, like Dumbledore, have the right idea but no one is perfect so mistakes are made but he isn't evil (my opinion is that he is slightly manipulative in canon and I'm keeping that element)

__ In which OC found an old ritual book from her seer ancestor that helps them get clearer premonitions and decided to try it for fun. Not knowing that descendants of seers are more sensitive to stuff like this and the ritual kinda works. She sees some incidents from the future that are the most impactful to her and those closest to her as they are the easiest to see.

OC does not like what happens and considers changing them to her advantage.

So, she assembles a squad of her closest friends, and some that are necessary to get things done, to help. Their first mission, convince their parents because they are 14 and adults are needed (but only those who won't tattle to Voldemort and make things worse).

Then, they need Potter to trust them. When else better than when he is seemingly abandoned by Dumbledore and half of the Wizarding World?

Cue the Slytherins collecting horcruxes as a bargaining chip to come out of this war secure and respected because Voldemort is doomed and they are NOT going to end up in disgrace and paying for the older generation's mistake in choosing the wrong side.

Slytherins are self preserving, they aren't doing this for the good of the world, they are doing this to save their own skin. They are cunning, they'll do whatever it takes to come out on top. And they are smart, they know better than to do it by themselves because if they think they are good, their parents are /better/. __

This is still a rough idea that needs some details to be ironed out. What is your opinion? Would it be worth a read? I'd rather not have this turn into an unrealistic cliche so I'd appreciate any advise to better it.


** Whether something is cliche in a bad way or not depends entirely on quality of writing. Some of the best fanfics I know have premises that sound HORRIFICALLY cliche but are compelling enough that it's enjoyable.

Don't worry too much about whether what you're doing has been done before. Just write

** I'd definitely read this one for sure! I do have to say that you need to be careful in making sure that your OC doesn't become too powerful, make sure they have flaws and are bad at certain spells, classes, etc.

Another thing is the parents, I don't think it's likely that parents would allow their children on a horcrux hunt (Ron was an adult by wizard standards so I don't think The Weasleys had much to say in that regard).

And with the wizarding world turning their backs on Harry, I don't think the Weasley's would do that and if they did it'd be pretty OOC. But this sounds quite promising and I'd love to read it one day!

*** Sorry for the late reply, my Reddit didn't notify me till today. Question, are the parents going hunting with them, and is Harry or the Order involved with the story? Just curious, this premise interests me very much and you should definitely tell me when it's put up!

**** (Is something wrong with reddit? I didn't get a notification about your comment at all. I decided to check in today and saw it then.)

Knowing how dangerous it could be, the parents will be doing most of the hunting with the kids chipping in when they have no other choice. The kids have a different task to accomplish while their parents deal with the riskier side of things (not to say the kids don't have to deal with dangerous situations of their own).

Harry and the Order are definitely involved! In fact, they would be key players for the Slytherins' plans.

I will let you know when the story is up! I'd like to get some chapters written up first so I can arrange a steady updating schedule.

*** Thank you for your advice!

My plans for this OC is for her to be pretty normal by Slytherin standards, no extra powers other than her slight seer abilities. Any extra spells she would know would be after lots of practice and studying with her friends or parents.

For the Horcrux hunting, it will mainly involve the parents with the exception of maybe one or two instances when the children are needed for one reason or another.

When I said the Wizarding World turned their backs on Harry, I meant his 5th year when Dumbledore keeps ignoring Harry and the public is slandering him for saying Voldemort is back. And Harry feeling betrayed by his friends cutting contact with him during the summer.

What do you think?
