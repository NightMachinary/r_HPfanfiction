****** Not just after book 4. Basically, attitude from the beginning is "I will try to stop you from breaking the rules --- unless it's my idea and then you MUST do it."

First year: tries to stop Harry from getting Neville's remembrall back, tries to prevent them from going to the after-hours duel (and when that fails follows them: how does that make sense?), /petrifies/ Neville and leaves him on the common room floor ALL NIGHT when he tries to stop them ... but instruts Harry to break into the restricted section (while she's conveniently gone for the holidays and can't get into any trouble for it, and is a willing participant in both hiding a dragon and smuggling it out of the country---both not only against the rules but flat-out ILLEGAL. Oh, and don't forget SHE SET A TEACHER ON FIRE!

Second year: illicitly brews (against the rules) a restricted potion (against the law), in order to drug, kidnap, and impersonate other students. Steals the ingredients to do so, by having the boys (again, so they'll take the brunt of the blame if caught) create a potentially-lethal distraction in the most dangerous classroom environment they have. She's have probably done more if she hadn't been petrified for several months toward the end.

Third year: time turners are strictly regulated by the Ministry, so why was she granted one just because she is unable to make a goddamned CHOICE between which classes to take? Granted that's more Dumbledore/McGonagall breaking the rules than her, but she is made very aware of the absolute secrecy she must maintain because it's not actually a kosher use of the device. After academically cheating for the entire year, with the collusion of both of the highest school authorities---yes, it's cheating to be have more time to study than the other students (and she is a big fat hypocrite for giving Harry such a hard time about that potions book in HBP)---she uses it to break the law---that the law is being corrupted in this case and the actions are morally just does not change the lawbreaking aspect. At least in this case she was in equal danger of facing legal repercussions. This was an early sign of the vigilantism---which she was praised for in this instance---that drives her to memory charm her parents. This example is not strictly bullying, but it does show her deciding when the boys are allowed to break the rules (taking Harry with her on the save-Sirius-and-Buckbeak adventure) and when they are not (not telling them about it the whole year, while gaslighting them about her abrupt appearances). Not to mention she punched Malfoy in the face with no repercussions at all.

Basically, every time in this series that the trio take the law/rules into their own hands, they are praised and rewarded. Is it any wonder she has no sense of boundaries? She's being taught high-handedness by the one person in canon who is shown to ALWAYS thinks he knows better than anybody else. Both she and Dumbledore seem to believe, "I'm smart, so I know what's best." She already worshipped him on the train first year, so that she takes her moral cues from him is no surprise.

  Hermione only gets a few extra hours so she can be in all her classes.
#+end_quote

I don't believe this for a second. She had TWO more classes than could be attended in person. The time-turner allows her to turn back in FIVE-hour blocks --- and is in no way limited to one block per day. With as obsessive as she was about studying and learning, she was NOT only using the two hours she needed to attend the classes, while sticking to "normal" hours for everything else. She was turning back time whenever she felt she wanted to read one more chapter, get in one more trip to the library, add one more foot to her essay. With as exhausted as canon showed her getting, you will NEVER convince me that she only used it to attend the doubled-up classes. (But wasn't clever enough to use it to give herself extra sleep to make up for her extended days---or to go back in time when she accidentally slept through a class, to make it so she didn't miss it after all.)

​

#+begin_quote
  Hermione just studied more.
#+end_quote

What the hell kind of school did you go to, where class rank meant nothing? Even just making prefect was a reward for studying more. Teachers give out class points for answering questions which, let's see, more study time gives her a clear advantage. Plus, I'm quite convinced that there was at least one occasion where she used to to avoid being late back from curfew.

Hermione got 10 O.W.L.s, because she dropped two classes (and thus no longer needed the time-turner). Percy and Bill had 12 O.W.L.s each, which meant they both took all the classes. So either they changed the schedule in the two years since Percy's class, or the ministry regularly allows students to have extra time. Do you think Percy's 12 OW.L.s contributed to his early career advancement? Damn straight it did. Thus, *using the time-turner gives a reward*.

But, you're clearly in the "Harry cheated but Hermione did not" camp, so I'm not sure there's any value in continuing this conversation.

I'm somewhat sure that rankings, if they are as common as you seem to indicate, are a major cause of bullying. I never encountered bullying before in any of my schools, but maybe I'm just blind.

** I like the fics that point out that obliviating their memories and giving them new names, does not give them the proper documentation to enter Australia, which is known for having very strict immigration standards.

One such is The Games They Play, in which a cynical 30-year-old Harry travels back in time and takes over his younger self's custody at the trial for underage magic. In this fic, Obliviate is a permanent spell, so there is NO chance they will ever recover their memories. Double slash: older Harry (known as Blake) with Snape and younger Harry with canon males.

#+begin_quote
  “They never got into Australia,” Blake revealed darkly, keeping a keen eye on Harry and his spell casting. Each spell the fire grew in small proportions, yet he kept control. He wouldn't be able to continue for more than thirty minutes, maybe an hour. The spell took a lot out of you. “They were refused entry: with Granger's spell, they will absolutely be terrified to come back to England. They could be anywhere, and more than likely, the money they have will run out quickly. They will need to work odd jobs, that will barely get them enough money to get by, that's if they're lucky. They may be dentists but their qualifications mean nothing abroad. That is nothing on the hole in their hearts where their memories were ripped from them. No doubt it will cause depression, perhaps even suicidal tendencies, questioning everything in their lives... She may have meant well but what she did was horrific, really.”
#+end_quote

There's also a fic---can't remember which one---in which Hermione retrieves her parents and the end of the war and restores their memories, only for them to completely NOT forgive her. She'd sold their practice for less than it was worth, and liquidated their house and belongings at rock-bottom prices, so their retirement funds are now completely gone AND they no longer have an established practice for income. They confiscate her college fund and tell her that she must pay them back all the money they "lost" through her poor financial transactions.

**** Eh. Their daughter was in the front lines of a civil war and has all the evidence to prove the reality of the danger she (and by extension, her parents) was in.

If Hermione's parents are anything like her, I figure the reconciliation would look a lot like how Hermione reacted to Ron returning in DH - a lot of hurt feelings, an unwillingness to forgive, and then forgiving anyway after some time had passed. There would be consequences and lingering hurt for sure, but not a total break in the relationship.

I personally think their relationship would look something like the one in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20618525][Uncle Bobby]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19662142][Tea with Mrs. Granger]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17243501][Trust A Few]], or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25575292][People Who Never Were]].

And even then, she could have changed everything she told them about Harry into false information if it was about operational security.

That still wouldn't have been as dehumanising as making two people forget they had an adult daughter in whom they are invested, only to drop back into their lives after she's survived the war.

***** The point about the entire thing is that Hermione doesn't know. She doesn't know how to keep them safe. She doesn't know if her measures will work. She can't be there to protect them, and she doesn't know what the Death Eaters are capable of or how far they'll go. So she piled on protection after protection, each and every single thing she knows for both her parents and the mission.

Get them as far away as possible. Make them forget their names so that they will never slip and reveal themselves. Make them forget so any possible information she might have slipped over the years (whatever that information is) would not come out right even if they did get caught.

I agree it's overkill and dehumanizing but the point is that Hermione is desperate enough and paranoid enough to do whatever it takes to ensure that both her parents and the mission are as safe as she can possibly make them. You are asserting that the more human methods you're proposing should have been good enough for her, but at that stage, /nothing/ was good enough. Hermione was well past taking into consideration things like agency and diminishing returns (which was not something she was good at even on the best of days anyway). In her mind, it was better safe than sorry.

Hermione's decision-making here is both cold-blooded and extremely desperate. She is going to give best level of protection she knows how to give because she can't let herself do any less. And it was a greatly unsavory and dehumanizing method yes, but if that's what it takes to keep the mission safe, then so be it. /It is not good enough/, but it's as good as she can make it.

This is the very flawed decision-making of a brilliant teenager with no mentors or peers to help her out. And it leaves a horrible taste in people's mouths, but at the end of the day, it's a quintessentially Hermione decision - one that is as reflective of her flaws as it is of her strengths. It is decisions like these that make her a complex morally gray character.

(Please note that I'm not saying that her actions are moral or ethical. I'm simply arguing that they make sense given her character and her circumstances.)

***** The keeping them safe part was her sending them to Australia in the first place. The memory modification is the contingency plan in case they get caught anyway.

More generally though, Hermione is acting like a soldier here. She is trying to fulfill the mission at all costs. It is her usual tunnel-vision at work when she found a cause or a mission to champion. What that means is that yes protecting her parents was part of the consideration, but it was not her main priority at the time.

Like I said in another comment, she is morally gray through and through.
