Basically any fics from the brief period in the 6th book when they dated. Can be one shots of small moments with just the two of them or more moments between the four (Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione) like the tattoo one from the books.

*** You wrote some of the finest Ginny-centric stories in the entire fandom, so I can't think of a better endorsement.

I'll add this to my list of fanfics.
