It's a fanfic where Snape, harry and voldemort are locked in a room together. And hogwarts gives them each a paper which has lists of things they should share to each other to leave the room. They are allowed to bring one person each, Harry chooses the twins and Voldemort chooses one of the malfoys. The more they reveal the more they get in terms of resources. In that room there are also portraits of the founders. Umbridge disrespects Salazar and he comes out of the portrait. Rowana Ravenclaw says that they need to recite something to make hogwarts' magic stronger. That's all I remember though.
