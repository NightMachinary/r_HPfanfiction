So we all know the stories where Harry is sorted to Slytherin, befriends "the right sort", every 11-year-old knows The Prince by heart and he is bossing the Wizengamot around before he turns 14. Or the Ravenclaw stories where everything is solved with enough studying and the Hufflepuff stories where everyone stands together as one(although there is a lot less of those around).

So what would you want to see more of in stories where Harry is not in Gryffindor?


** What I would really like to see, and have encountered very rarely, is a true divergence from Canon. There's all these fics out there in which Harry is supposed to be so different, and yet just give you a retelling of canon with sarcastic comments added here and there. No real changes, everyone's still in the same place doing the same thing, with the same friends and at the same time. Boring af

*** I get what you are aiming at, but a lot of the canon stations are outside of Harry's influence. No matter what Harry does, Quirrel is going after the stone. The Muggle protection bill passes (unless somehow Harry manages to block if for some reason), Malfoy gives Ginny the diary, the basilisk in unleashed and so on. The TWT will be held regardless.

This does not mean that Harry has to get involved, but there is no reason for Quirrel to stop going after the stone just because Harry is in Ravenclaw. Ginny's fate is somewhat open because without Harry, the Diary stays in Myrtle's bathroom longer and he might not save her, but until that point, there is no reason for a divergence in that regard. The "Heir of Slytherin" accusations and the Polyjuice episode are avoidable, however.

Which brings us to the first real opportunity for a massive divergence, Sirius. If the 2nd year goes differently, the picture of Pettigrew is not bound to be in the prophet (maybe Ginny died and they did not make the trip, maybe the attacks get more attention), possibly without an escape for Sirius. But given that most writers love him and want to free him, you either need that escape or have Harry catch Pettigrew through some means.

From there on a lot more can change. With no Pettigrew escape, there is no one helping Voldemort to return. The TWT will be held, but Harry's involvement is unlikely. No graveyard, no Ministry at Hogwarts... You get the picture.

Tl;dr: The first 18 months at Hogwarts have no reason to diverge much.

**** I agree with you that real divergence in the first years is more complex. However, Harry could still react differently to the unavoidable happenings.

As you say, he could ignore Quirrel. You might even let Quirrel get the stone, and roll with a completely different story from there on, with a revived Voldemort from year 1.

Also, Malfoy giving Ginny the diary is a just a chance encounter, he wasn't aiming for Ginny (not that we know of). He just takes advantage of a confrontation that happens when Harry is with the Weasleys buying his school books. If Harry had not been there, the Weasleys might have done something else, or been quicker (Lockhart does take Harry with him to take pictures for a while). Some other student could get the diary.

Then, from year 3 and on, major changes are even easier, as you say.

What I miss the most usually, however, are other possible sub-plots. In first-year Harry helps Hagrid get rid of a Dragon, but if he had different friends in another house, who's to say they might not get into different trouble? In summary, I miss the addition of new things.

My main problem with the stories is not only the repetition, but the fear from the authors to make a change that completely flips the story. Then you lose the pattern you could follow (the 7 books), and that makes writing harder.

Wasn't he? I think it's implied Malfoy did it as a revenge on Arthur for the Muggle Protection Act, because of which his house was searched for dangerous artefacts. He probably expected Ginny to be caught with the diary and then use the scandal ("Weasley's own daughter in posession of an extremely dark artefact!") against Arthur and repel the Act. I think it's very unlikely Malfoy knew what the diary really was, or he wouldn't part with so easily. Voldemort certainly wasn't happy later with how dear Lucius lost a piece of his soul.

That's said, if there are enough changes in the first year, Malfoy might have other reasons to dispose of the diary differently.

Edit: diary, not dairy, lol

Though I agree with you completely that Malfoy did not know what it was) before another search was conducted in his house. Then he ran into the Weasleys, and perfect occasion. Since none of this is specified in canon, you can play with it in any way you like.

As far as we know, the Mirror works just fine and Voldemort could not get it. That's why Harry's actions in the first year do not matter much unless he publically exposes Voldemort or helps him get the stone. Kinda stupid for Rowling to make her entire plot pointless, but that's what we get.

I mean, it's a great point of diversion, but with Voldemort's biggest opponent being a moron of the highest order and Harry being 12 it's not looking good. They don't even know about Horcruxes and have little chance to figure it out without the diary. If Voldemort takes control of Hogwarts & the Ministry (with Fudge in charge that's a given), our heroes can't even legally cast magic outside of school, no tent, no Hermione saves everyone all the time.

Actually, I'm writing a Fem!Harry story where Quirrel instead of the stone goes after the diadem and starts to gather back all the Horcruxes to try and understand what caused his death in the first place. This puts him in contact with Malfoy at the end of the first year and causes him to halt the plot of Chamber of secrets.

Might not be the most logical progression of the plot but it diverges from the Halloween of the first book.

Then don't devote hundreds of thousands of words to them. If 90% of the first two years are the same as canon, don't show them.

*** Harry isn't behind most of the big plot points His own actions do basically nothing in PS, except maybe stop quirrelmort, but there's a good chance that Dumbledore's protections would hold until he returned, at which point Voldemort is probably forced out of his body (he's just not strong enough to take Dumbledore on in that form, he'd likely try as he has nothing to lose, but fail and flee as a wraith). CoS would be mostly the same, though he might not reveal he's a parcelmouth, or perhaps he would mention the voices, he might not take the Diary from Myrtle, which could mean either Ginny just goes back for it, or someone else gets it, the big divergence is that if he doesn't go down to the chamber Ginny (or whoever else finds that diary) dies, Voldemort returns and Hogwarts probably closes. That would be a pretty huge divergence from then on, what alternate schooling would happen, how would diarymort act now he's alive etc.? PoA would be 90% the same (assuming either the diary is never refound, or Harry does go to the chamber and save the day) though if Harry isn't Ron's friend he might not be there when Ron's snatched, so Sirius kills Petigrew, never has a way to prove his innocence and either escapes the country never to return or gets caught and kissed. GoF wouldn't be much affected by Harry's actions at all (oh he might handle a task differently, have a different Yule ball date, but he's still stuck in the tourney and the graveyard happens), though if PoA diverged then it could be a peaceful year, since no pettigrew means no kidknapped Bertha so the Voldemort never learns of the tournament, Barty Jr. still escapes and probably goes looking for his master, he'll find him, and without Bertha likely come up with a completely different plot to return (even if Bary somehow heard about it from his Father Voldemort wouldn't be able to spare Barty as a mole since someone has to milk Nagini if he's to return). OotP is somewhat more different Harry might be better at Occlumency or simply not trust his visions, so no battle of the ministry, he also might not start the DoA which means we'd have to find something else.

** I would like to see kids acting like kids or at least not like walking stereotypes. Just like Gryffindors don't go around doing reckless and brave deeds all the time, Ravenclaws aren't all bookworms (hello, Luna and Cho!), and Hufflepuffs aren't all nice (outside of Malfoy and his croonies, Zacharias Smith seemes to be the biggest jerk in Harry's year). Slytherin politicking can be fun if it's kept age-appropriate, after all kids can be conniving little shits, only most fics write it as SERIOUS BUSINESS, and it becomes tiring to read after a while.

I also don't like it when all Slytherin students bully Harry when he is sorted there. Sure, some tension with DE children is inevitable, but would all those cunning and ambitious really turn against a clueless rich celebrity? I feel that plenty of people would want to be his friend, even if for entirely wrong reasons.

I would really like to read a fic where Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw not because he likes to read and wants to excel in his studies (or was raised by goblins), but because he is his canon self who is a little more interested in magic and world around him, or is creative but not studious (I always felt that Harry from Harry the Hufflepuff is a textbook Ravenclaw), or is interested in a certain subject and wants to learn everything about it. Or maybe he was raised by Rita Skeeter and keeps his own extortion and blackmail folder on everybody, because knowledge is power.

For some reason, even though Hufflepuff Harry is the rarest and all the other Houses seem more exciting, almost all of the best alternative sorting fics I've read have him sorted with the badgers.

While I totally could see it happening, it would be a very short and unsatisfying fic )

What I mean is that regardless of what Voldemort sympathizers think or do, there have to be plenty of other kids in Slytherin willing to befriend (and/or benefit from) Harry.

Also Malfoy didn't have the guts to carry out a murder at 16, much less at 11. At that age, he would probably shittalk, try some minor hexes, and bring up his Daddy a lot. And his Daddy has a comfortable life and the last thing he wants is to change the status quo. After all, Draco did try to befriend Harry. Insincerely or not, but I doubt he did it to kill Harry in his sleep later. And Crabbe and Goyle would do anything Malfoy said them to do.

See, the problem with this is, they don't need to be in the same house for poison to work.

Switching spells are a thing, and it's something that second years learn. There's more than one ff that has some shitty prank or the other done using switching spells - if people wanted to kill HP that badly, they could do it no matter which house he's in. Same goes for invisibility cloaks - the Malfoys are certainly rich enough to afford one, and waiting outside the Fat Lady's portrait, sneaking inside and planting something on HP's bed can be done rather easily.

If you say that the presence of the teachers will deter it, well, if someone is going to go with murder, then why not cast the Imperius curse on X, have X shoot a blasting curse at HP's head, then blast himself once that's done? It could be done by any sixth or seventh year, if they want to kill HP that badly. You don't need to be in the same house to do either of those things.

** With these fics I enjoy the idea of Harry himself changing as a result of being close friends with people other than Hermione and Ron. IMO Harry in canon is influenced (as is natural) by R&H pretty significantly in his personality and general outlooks. I think it would be interesting to see how different he could turn out with completely different influences.

For example, what if instead in his house he becomes best friends with two muggleborns? Would he find certain things more difficult without Ron's background knowledge of the wizarding world? And how would his adventures (and academics) go without the brightest witch of his age at his side? What if one of his friends has/had a difficult home-life and this influences how Harry deals with the Dursleys (ie them noticing signs of abuse in Harry, or Harry actually dealing with his abuse since he actually has a peer he can talk to about it who would understand). Could that result in a change in custody? Maybe it would be an aide to have two friends with similarly no knowledge of the wizarding world for Harry to relate to.

There's the possibility he'd become close to another family like he did the Weasleys in canon. What if they're muggle, or are very influential towards him? What about a Harry without that familial relationship at all? If one of his new friends is especially talented at a specific subject (and is less intense/intimidating than Hermione), would Harry become talented at it?

With these kinds of fics mostly I like the idea of the author having given the consequences a large amount of thought. I don't mind the major events of canon staying the same (I'd prefer it, I think. When ppl go completely off the rails re canon it's often like you said, a super op or political Harry that breaks any illusion of realism), but I like the idea of Harry going about them differently as a consequence of his different environment.

Does he not find fluffy? Do his new friends convince him to try and befriend fluffy? Does he go to a teacher other than McGonagall and is he believed? Does he write in the diary? Unlikely he'd find it at all if he doesn't ever visit that bathroom. Would his enmity with Malfoy be so intense without his Gryffindor brashness encouraging the feud? Would he even go into the chamber if he doesn't know where it is? Without scabbers & Ron, would the POA confrontation go differently? What if the delay meant it wasn't a full moon and pettigrew is captured and Sirius freed? What if his uninvolvement means Voldemort returns in 1st/2nd year?

There are so many possibilities re changes that could go in amazing directions big or small, and I love seeing an author who's aware of that and not afraid to go for it!

  So what would you want to see more of in stories where Harry is not in Gryffindor?
#+end_quote

The interesting stuff for me about this kind of story is the "what if?". So I wouldn't just arbitrarily stick Harry in a different House, I'd want Harry to be different. So maybe he secretly made some extra cash through hard work or met a neighborhood kid that stuck with him through thick and thin (or somehow became pen-pals with Hermione, be still my shipping heart), which made him value work and loyalty more.

*For me* it's not so interesting to describe what it would be like if Harry befriended Hufflepuffs or how their common room looks like, but rather it should be about how a more Hufflepuffed Harry would approach problems. Though obviously this can easily get quite canon-rehashy.

If Harry's in Hufflepuff, I want to see Justin try to get his father to do what I described, or Ernie take Harry on a guys' day to Diagon Alley (I'm not going for the obvious one because that realistically can't be done until book 3 at the absolute earliest)

** Seeing him be friends outside of: Hermione, Ron and Draco. Those tend to be the most common people he's friends with outside of being sorted into a different house.

I'd like to see him interact with his dorm mates more, maybe even interact with characters we don't see him interact with that much, compared to in canon.

I'd like to see him not be so interested in Quidditch; a lot of stories, when he's friends with either Ron or Draco still have him end up being interested in Quidditch; it'd just be nice to seeing him interested in other things outside of that.

Seeing him try harder at certain subjects, more than he did in canon. It seemed like he only ever had motivation when he needed too. With the only real subject he did best in was Defence.

If he's sorted in Ravenclaw, maybe get him more interested in the Wizarding World and their culture in general. Again much like his subjects he seemed not to get too involved/interested in the Wizarding World and their culture unless a plot point was involved in it. And even then it was mostly Ron or Hermione or x person here explaining stuff.

Maybe go differently from canon at some point. Get Sirius out of Azkaban sooner, maybe Riddle is able to take over in Harry's second year, and Ginny dies or something. Something just a bit different from just re telling the canon, just with Harry sorted in a different house with different friends. Like Harry doesn't accuse Malfoy or Snape after every single horrible thing that happens, Harry doesn't use the Polyjuice potion, et cetra. Just something different.

Like, the Hat /wants/ to put him in Slytherin, and it implies that he could go to Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff'll take anyone, that's kinda the point, so it's not as if his canon sorting was some profound inevitability.
