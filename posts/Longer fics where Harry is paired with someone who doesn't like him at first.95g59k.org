*** Could be. Another thread recently recommended linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) which seems pretty well on the mark for the OP.

My only real complaint with it is resentment and mistrust doesn't really fit with the amount of sex. Not angry sex, either, but "I'm just having a good time" - which IMO wouldn't really work for Daphne unless there was a level of trust and caring that she wasn't admitting to - at which point it isn't really just casual sex anymore.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore!

  Growing up on London's streets and having nobody to rely on has led to a different from canon Harry Potter start his first year at Hogwarts. Add an ancient and mysterious pendant, pureblood pricks, a scheming headmaster and a goddess as his mother-figure in the mix and you have a genuine Alternate Universe. Grey, asshole Harry.

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.
