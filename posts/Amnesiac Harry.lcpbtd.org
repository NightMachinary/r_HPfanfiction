Hi, so like the title implies, I really like the premise of an Amnesiac PoV. Preferably Harry, but I'm not super picky. I've read a couple, the Problem of Potions, which I really liked, and another, which I don't remember the name of, but I didn't enjoy since Harry was so antagonistic with little to no character development. Anyway, hit me!


** Amnesia is a plot line in third fic of the Like None Other series, but it takes a long time before the plot gets there.

Here's a link to the series if you're interested: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]]

** 'You're my Density' by RobSt on fanfiction.net

It isn't so much amnesia though because Harry's memory loss is caused by something else.

** linkao3(Swung by Serafim by Flamethrower) is really good, especially with how they build and develop the world. Harry ends up being way smarter and more logical. I really enjoyed it!

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

  (COMPLETE) One day, everything changes. All it takes is for Harry to bump into an unexpected person from his past... who tells him all the lies his friends and lover have been keeping from him. What then does Harry do but live life as best he can?

** linkffn(The Shock of it All by Fairywm).

And, I haven't read this one yet, but the blurb makes it sound as though it fits: linkffn(The Persistence of Memory by neutral).

If you'll accept memory loss by obliviation, rather than "pure" amnesia, I have a couple of others besides You're My Density.

  A freak potion accident renders our hero without memory of who he is. Watch as the new Harry takes Hogwarts by storm. No one is going to tell him what to do. AU 4th year. Super!Unfettered!Cussing!Harry. Some bashing, but not stupidly so. Not a crossover, but with a lot of Sci-fi references. Harry's a bit of an ass.
