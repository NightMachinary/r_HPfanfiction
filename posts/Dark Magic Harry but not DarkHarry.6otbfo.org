I've recently linkffn(Becoming By: SensiblyTainted) and it made me want a Harry that uses dark magic but isn't... dark, evil, whatever you prefer. I really liked the idea that dark magic was addictive in the story and how it was portrayed. I suppose that it makes a neat little balance. My first thought for how Harry could have gotten into the dark arts was by him having naturally (unnaturally) darker magic due to Moldy's horcrux but that was just my first thought.

So, is there any dark arts, but good (or morally gray at least) Harry Potter fanfiction?


** Sacrifices Ark --- major themes of the story are about Harry trying to resist the temptations of the “dark magic”, Harry trying to not turn into a “dark wizard” \ sociopath, the antagonists being afraid he'll turn “dark”, /and/ almost all antagonists trying to constantly annoy him to the point where he'll snap and turn, in fact, into a “dark” lord. Seriously, there are many good things to say about that story, but it can be very hard to not give up on it because of all those repetitive aggravating [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall][drama balls]] that the author seems to be very fond of, for some reason.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** I really like "The sum of their parts" by holdmybeer (unsure how to do the link thing) if yo havent already read it. Id place it in a definite morally gray area, although is does get towards the dark/evil area.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  How much of what you are depends on your environment? If everything changed, who would you become? Harry Potter is about to find out. If it would save everything he loved, could he become a Dark Lord?

**** Lol, I love when abandoned fics start out really good and interesting and then slowly get bad or lose the plot. It makes it easier to stomach them not being finished.

** Have you tried gray!Harry community? From my understanding that sounds like what you are talking about... Harry that uses dark magic but still is against "the bad guys" and most make a point that dark is not evil.
