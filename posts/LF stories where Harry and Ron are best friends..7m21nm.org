I'm a little tired of Ron always being delegated to a less important figure in Harry's life, or outright bashed, in fanfics. So what I want here are fics where Ron, NOT Hermione, NOT anyone else, is Harry's best friend and closest confidante. I want stories where Harry and Ron who work together, and hang out together because they genuinely enjoy each other's company. You know, like in the books.

A few more criteria:

- Just to be clear: No stories where Ron is just paid lip service and mentioned as "Harry's best friend" in the beginning of the fic, but then only appears in a handful of scenes. Ron has to be a major character along with Harry.\\
- Hermione can be in the story, even play a major part, but any story that even HINTS of a Harry/Hermione romance will be immediately discarded. Canon pairings are okay, but I'd rather read fics that focus on the friendship between Harry and Ron than about their romances.\\
- I prefer longer stories. Short stories are fine, but I like multi-chapter fics. They don't have to be finished; I'm fine with ongoing, or even hiatused or abandoned.\\
- Canon-compliant or total AU, either is fine... but go easy on character-bashing, and especially go easy on OP!Harry.


** Ron is the main Character in my story. Mind you, he's only Ron in name only.

  "So let me get this straight," I said slowly. "for causing a scene, humiliating your housemate, and nearly getting yourself killed, Snape didn't give you a detention, but instead made you seeker of the Quidditch team?" "Basically," replied Harry. Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux recursive fanfiction, Self Insert.

***** No I'm sorry. What I mean is I've never read a fanfic like yours where it's a fanfic of a fanfic. So I read Accidental horcrux in order to read it but when I was done with it I didn't even want to read the sequel let alone another fanfic in the same universe. Maybe I should try it again now that I had time to mull it over.

** The first fics I ever read were The Refiners Fire & sequel Time of Destiny. AU after OOTP and fairly OP Harry but I can keep going back and reading time and time again. To me this set the standard for the friendship of harry and Ron and I've never found a fic I've enjoyed more - possibly nostalgia for me rather than anything else. On mobile so can't link - merry Christmas!

The first volume is finished, and my current update schedule for the second one is at least once a week. It's an AU, has a bunch of politics and world building, and has multiple points of view.

****** I totally get you. Those feelings are very OC compared to the original HP series, which is not an issu since we're talking fanfic, but it's really overblown in Divided. Also in Patron, which I have started reading a few weeks ago but struggle to continue for this reason, and also the fact that Hermione is way too smart for her age/year (she's creating/modifying advanced spells in fourth year like it's no big deal)

**** Well, it was JKR who had to bring in serious topics such as genocide, mass torture, and death camps. Their victims had every right to be ANGRY. Starfox5 obviously modeled the Hermione in “Divided” heavily after [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wake][Nancy Wake]], a key resistance leader during WW2 in Nazi occupied France.

JKR, in her zeal to preserve the innocence of her protagonists, introduced a whole bunch of Deux Ex Machina, author fiats, and significant dumbing down of the main villain. I just don't like this approach. You don't fight Nazis with stun guns and ISIS with Tasers.

I want to read fics written by authors who clearly exhibit good understanding in politics, history, and military matters. I want to read protagonists who are actively going after enemies instead of only reacting. On the other hand, I also want to read villains who do not suddenly engage in stupid behaviors so the good guys could get out of trouble.

“Divided”, IMO, delivers in all these aspects. Of course, it's a very militaristic and political fic consisting of 640k words, so I understand it's not suitable for many.

***** *Nancy Wake*

Nancy Grace Augusta Wake, (30 August 1912 -- 7 August 2011) was a secret agent during the later part of the Second World War. She became a leading figure in the maquis groups of the French Resistance and was one of the Allies' most decorated servicewomen. After the fall of France in 1940, she became a courier for the French Resistance and later joined the escape network of Captain Ian Garrow. By 1943, Wake was the Gestapo's most wanted person with a 5-million-franc price on her head.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time.
