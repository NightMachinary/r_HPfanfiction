God, this request feels weird and it takes narcissism to a whole new level but for some reason this ensnared me.

I've read “Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived” by Agnostic Puppets and “Equal and Opposite” and was wondering if there are any more stories like them out there.


** Well I wouldn't judge you just for this because there are even HarryxHedwig fics or HarryxNagini fics out there.

  Mirrors are funny things. They show us what we are, what we were, and what we could have been. When Harry and Haley Potter look into the mirror and see each other, a connection is forged that will see their destinies intertwined.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
