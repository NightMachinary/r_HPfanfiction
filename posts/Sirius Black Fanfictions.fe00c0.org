I'm a big fan of Sirius Black and I love reading Sirius Black/OC fics but I'm so picky because I can't get into them unless they have an engaging plot and good grammar.... any recommendations?


** I highly recommend the Promises series by Robin4 on fanfiction.net.

It's a really good series with Sirius as one of the mains. There's 4 parts, all complete.

** I would definitely Skinny Dipping With A Mermaid by KMBell92 - it's on Wattpad, but it's probably one of my favourites. Its completed with two sequels published.

She has loads of others too with so so so many different characters, and I've never read one I don't like. My favourites are Tightly Knit (Fred Weasley), and Imagine Dragons (Charlie Weasley).
