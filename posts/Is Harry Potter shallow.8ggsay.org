** /gasp/ A shallow teenager? Novel thing, ain't it? :)

But really, most romance starts because you were physically attracted to someone. Can't really fault Harry for something so common and innocuous (besides which, I'm pretty sure in OoTP he says he doesn't think Hermione is ugly at all, but I suppose that isn't exactly "You're hot".)

*** He described her as 'pretty' after she put hours of work into her appearance. He then describes Parvati as 'very pretty' from what I remember. I doubt he thought she looked stunning on a regular day, honestly though her personality could have been off putting for him to. He frequently describes her as 'shrill' and complains about her nagging. They're friends but Harry is just really not interested in her. A useful friend but not someone he'd want to spend the rest of his life with.

**** In GoF, I'm pretty sure he calls Hermione "very pretty indeed". He calls her shrill? Hah.

** Yep. Actually this fits the 'emotionally abused' angle pretty well, though I doubt Rowling did it on purpose. He's being lead into relationships along his nose by his hormones, but lacks a lot of emotional empathy and insight that people at his age should have. His body/desires is way ahead of his development and he doesn't really want anything out of a relationship besides someone pretty and "fun".

Look at how Cho's understandable troubles and emotional distress (her boyfriend was murdered) are just a bother for Harry. Prospective partners are truly only an object for his desires and barely persons with their own desires and wishes.

I'm always quite disappointed when Hogwarts era H/Hr fics don't address this. Hermione is very emotionally mature for her age:

#+begin_quote
  “Well, obviously, she's feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect she's feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can't work out who she likes best. Then she'll be feeling guilty, thinking it's an insult to Cedric's memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she'll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can't work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that's all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she's afraid she's going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she's been flying so badly.”

Just putting Harry and Hermione together in fifth or sixth year without any kind of meaningful development for Harry is like pairing a 18 year old girl with a 12 year old boy (emotionally).

*** Any fifth or sixth year stories you'd recommend that do what you suggest? I'm always on the lookout for some decent H/Hr. :-)

**** Sorry nothing comes to mind. They usually just gloss over Harry and replace him with a wholly better version of him, skipping over any growth. The best you're going to get is some kind of internal griping "Oh, why did I never realize that she was a girl?" and that's it.

It's just a pet peeve of mine, since I think H/Hr critics have a point when they say "Harry/Hermione aren't exactly perfect for each other on paper". But these fics are almost always some type of wish fulfillment, just like Rowling with Ron/Hermione, so potential problems are always ignored.

***** Aw, that's too bad, it sounds like it could be a really nice story to read.

Even though I like the ship, it's true they're not perfect for each other. But then, that's a hard thing to write unless the characters are incredibly shallow.

Edit: Actually, I think I /have/ read such a story set in sixth year . It did wank Harry's power too much near the end, but I recall liking their development better than pretty much any other H/Hr since it wasn't a sudden jump (although the impetus for the change may have been a bit forced).

** So you're mad that Harry didn't go for your favorite character and are dissing other characters for it?
