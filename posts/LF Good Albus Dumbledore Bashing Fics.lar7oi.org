  One tiny change makes all the difference in the world. When Harry discovers a small box in his vault during his first visit to Gringotts, he is hoping for a memento of his parents. Instead, his discovery starts him down a path of intrigue and suspicion. Not sure who he can trust, Harry will have to learn to rely on himself. Book 1 of The Cry of Freedom. Updates every Tuesday.
