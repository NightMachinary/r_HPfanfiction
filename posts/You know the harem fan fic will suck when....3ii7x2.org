** There are no or almost no social or personal issues resulting from the multiple pairing. The girls are made to be bisexual sluts that can't get enough of Harry's dick and argue over who gets to eat his cum. None of them, and rarely anyone else, seems to have any problem with polygamy.

Harems can definitely be done well, especially when you have a character as famous and potentially sought after as Harry, but the people looking to write good fics and those wanting to write harem stories rarely coincidence.

**** I would say that often, a character is interesting, up and until she gets added to a harem, at which point she becomes "member no. 5" or so, and loses her individuality. That's sometimes caused or worsened by the portrayal of Harry as perfectly fair and unpartial, and giving every girl the same amont of love and attention. Apart from the question of how realistic that is, it often means that there's simply not enough room for the different girls to stay as actual characters in the story, as long as the story has a plot outside the harem. At best they become different tools Harry picks to deal with situations.

****** There's actually a number of such Chinese dramas set in different eras, though the "Empress of China" is the most gorgeous in terms of costumes. The rank, family background, the emperor's favour and children factors into the interactions between the women, and is rather intriguing to watch. The relationships between the emperor and women are always uneven though, since he's the emperor.

By being in the harem though, the woman help their family(father, brother(s)) get sometimes advanced in their careers. On the other hand, if the woman's family gets disgraced(eg.rebellion), she also gets affected by losing the emperor's favour and banished to a distant palace.

The relationships in HP harem fanfics are written more fluid and equal, though I really twitch sometimes at , in some fics, how quickly the women fall in love with each other in addition to Harry. (usually handwaved by magic and/or soulbonds)

I think the best written HP harem fanfiction I've read so far is probably the Firebird trilogy, with the worldbuilding, the plot and the relationships.

*** "Harem" in anime usually means a story with a male protagonist chased by multiple girls, and he's either oblivious to their attention, or doesn't want to hurt anyone of them by picking one, or indecisive, or chasing after the one girl who doesn't want him (or is captured/dead from the start). The important point is that, outside adult-rated stuff, the "Harem Anime" generally doesn't have anyone getting any sex, much less an actual harem, since the competing girls or plain bad luck sabotage any effort to seduce the main character - if there actually are such efforts, and the whole thing is not just some obvious fondness or lust, that never gets far.

Edit: There are some animes where the protagnist may have an actual harem, a collection of lovers, but those would be the exception, not the rule. With Harem fics I think the opposite is true - actual harem/lovers is the norm, bunch of girls chasing fruitlessly after one guy the rare exception.

*** What do you mean? I don't read harem fics but I have read mfm multi fics (LupinxHermionexSirius, or DracoxHermionexTheo). Do you mean Hermione with a ton of guys or...?

***** I didn't know those existed... I'm also not sure how well that would work. I like the multi fics I've read because the focus on what Hermione likes about the personality of both men, from what I've heard of harem fics everyone but the main character tends to become a bland personality.

**** It's not 100% certainty, but there's a strong tendency for them to have Harry as a real character and everyone in the harem as interchangeable save for hair color -- or maybe one or two personality traits on top of "Harry's devoted helper and sex kitten".
