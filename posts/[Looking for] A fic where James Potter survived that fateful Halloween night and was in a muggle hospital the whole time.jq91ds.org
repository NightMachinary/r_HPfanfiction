:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember the title of a fic that I may have read on AO3 where James is still alive. It is multi-chaptered and complete.

After he wakes up from his coma, he goes back to the Wizarding World under another name and finds out that YEARS have passed. I think Harry is already beyond 5th year here because I remember Sirius being dead, but it could be that he died earlier. Anyway, James ends up getting the position as Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. For some weird reason, he doesn't tell Harry or anyone else that he is James, opting to observe stuff first and learning about his son's history from other people.

I'm not too sure if Harry was a Slytherin here. I am sure that there was a part where James watched a Quidditch match where Harry pulled various death defying stunts on his broom, which had James on the edge of his seat the whole time, concerned for his son's safety but also very proud of the boy.

I also remember that James and Snape actually worked quite well together as teachers and against Voldemort, with Snape even considering the new professor as a sort of friend, although he was flabbergasted when in the end it was revealed who James really was.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

*** What's up with this style of fic titles? I keep seeing it around and it looks cringe enough to put me off reading them, although this prompt is just too interesting to pass up.

**** I don't know what this style is called but for some reason, I associate fics with titles like these with AO3 and Tumblr. Ffn doesn't usually have these, or maybe I'm just not really looking hard enough.

The author "dirgewithoutmusic" is notorious for giving their fics titles like these. Their summaries are pretty bad, too, in the sense they aren't really summaries but the first paragraph of the fic.

**** idk i actually like these sort of titles, but i hang around ao3 so i guess i used to them

but like usually these sort of titles indicate something good

Also definitely recommend all of EclipseWing's Works,

tho they're slash if ur not into that*

and like second for dirge- like love their hp fics

also people really need to go on ao3 more- i guess it's the slash that people may not be use to

*edit; and mild blood but also distressing themes -*Heed Content Warnings!!* -like if ur underaged please consider what u're willing to read :/

***** I don't think it's the slash that people avoid on AO3. I'm not really worried due to living in a shitty third world country, but somewhere like America a site with search tags like "Underage Sexual Content", "Molestation" and "Explicit Gangrape" screams "you'll be put on a watchlist". I don't mind simply avoiding those parts of the site, but I can absolutely see why people avoid AO3. Still wouldn't ever post anything there, or suggest fics there to an IRL friend.

****** I get that those tags would ring bells- in general those are tags i'd avoid- but that's kinda the point, it's so it can raise serious red flags and you can filter out fics like that

- you can filter fics out generally though ao3's rating system (gen, teen up, mature, explicit, creator chose no to warn) and i think it that content like that "Molestation" and "Explicit Gangrape" are rare in individual fandoms- 'cuz adding them all up would amount to something (idk i don't check those tags)*

-yeah i think that just gives ao3 a bad rep, just because content like that isn't prevented doesn't make the site as a whole rotten, literally the most popular tags in hp on ao3 are Romance, Fluff, Angst, AU, Humour & in general in fandoms in some varying order (and also depending on the fandom, whuch might have specific fandom tropes like in bnha one of the most popular tags is "Bakugou Katsuki Swears a lot)

-Literal if you don't want t see it you can filter it and if you do want something you can search for that tag. that's the point of a tagging system.

*reference for these warnings - they're all as they sound, tho 'creater chose not to use warnings' should be treaded carefully since afterall /creator chose Not to use warnings/ tho u'd be safe from things like, idk, "explicit gangrape" because creators /tend/ to be responsible about what they put out
