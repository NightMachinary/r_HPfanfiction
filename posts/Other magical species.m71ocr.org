Canon portrays the 'Wizarding World' as synonymous with the 'Magical World'. However, there are many other magical races who do not seem to be represented in or beholden to the 'wizarding' ministries, so presumably they have societies of their own. Examples of these explicitly from the books include Veela, Goblins, Merpeople, Centaurs, Giants, Dwarfs and Hags. These are only the ones that Harry comes across, so there are probably many more around the world such as Naga or the Japanese traditional spirits, or even local but just never mentioned, like maybe the Leprechauns.

A quick Wikipedia check suggests that an agreed minimum size for a long-term stable population is in the order of a few thousand. Even if you justify population pressures that keep the numbers low (easy for Giants, maybe less so for Merpeople) and ignore JKRs attempts at maths and bulk up the wizarding community, then you still have societies that are comparable in size, and so plausibly sophistication and importance to the wizarding one.

How are the ways this can work. Do these communities interact with each other but ignore the wizarding world, for example mixed settlements of goblins and dwarfs? Are they all pretty much self contained with the wizarding world acting as a central connecter with each other and the muggle world? Is it just a peculiarity of Britain that there are few magical races in society, but elsewhere everyone mixes together? How do the different races live, and does that affect any of this?


** I think they mostly hide or remain in seclusion wherever possible. Wizards are, by and large, terrible people. Even the 'good guys' are prone to moderate ignorance and mild racism (the Weasley Accountant cousin), so honestly the rest of the 'Magical World' that isn't human probably stays isolated for their own good.
