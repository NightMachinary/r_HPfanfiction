Come on, surprise me. I know there are pretty weird things up there, like that thing where Harry arrives at King's Cross after dying, meets Dumbledore and then suddenly decides to eat Voldemort's gross fetus-like body.

It can be a phrase, a scene or just a set of words you never imagined to see next to each other. It's valid if it comes from a crack, but I guess it's more shocking when you get the surprise on a seriously written fic.


** Sex related things aside, probably the one where Bellatrix tortures and breaks Tonk's mental state to the point where she thinks she's a completely different person and willingly slits her father's throat and eventually murders Lupin

** Any kind of unnecessary prolonged torture of physical, emotional or especially horrifying sexual nature.

There must be some kind of limit to those things. I understand when some stories are dark and torture happens, but whole chapters and continuing?

I read a story about Harry setting up Snape to blow his cover in front of Voldemort and causing Snape to be tortured for 2 weeks. Endless unsettling chapters of the worst possible torture of all kinds. I couldn't eat or drink or sleep for 2 days.

One (too) long chapter of Voldemort sexually gratifying Bellatrix with Snake and a young 6th year girl with a rat.

I understand creativity of writers, but some things border on distasteful personal fantasies that are detached from characters themselves. When writing is too personal, it shows, and it should not show in case of that kind of HP fanfiction.

** I think its a continuation of cannon. Where the story proceeds to attempt to close up the whole Hermione Alters her parents memories. The whole plot is Hermione goes to Australia and finds her parents. restores their memories. One parent attempts her yell at her. but the other proceeds to shut him/her up. And then she/he says but if Hermione thinks she know best for us what if she does it again. So they end up living in fear of their daughter for the rest of their lives. They end up wanting a divorce but Hermione says thats terrible so they choose to stay together because they are afraid that their daughter will make them love each other 'Because it's best for them'. So when ever she's around they pretend to love each other but once she's gone they live in separate rooms and never speak.

It's fucked up because this is exactly how real people would behave. They were never told about anything that went down. And then they were told that there was a war and Hermione hadd to fight it but they would not understand because they were 'Just Muggles'

Seriously, it isn't unusual for me to find an author's story I like, and then read everything else they have. I'm pretty sure that's what happened here, because I really, really like some of the author's other stories. This one, not so much.

Honestly, the story didn't give an indication of how bad it was. It's not like today where they warn about everything in specific detail, from skinned knees to decapitation, and tell people to "be aware of your triggers" and "keep yourself safe" while reading.

** Spoilers ahead, and I'm not linking anything.

I did read fic where Harry's integrated vampire/werewolf group performed Blood Wings on Lockhart for physically abusing his young daughter (who's been turned into a werewolf)---except they ripped out his heart instead of his lungs. The Leader by Debs the SlytherinSnapeFan.

The scene where Harry removes Snape's eye in The Art of Self-Fashioning by Lomonaaeren is very disturbing to me. Probably just because it's eyes.

This one is sexual, but that's not the point of it: it's the psychological torture. There are two stories I've read where Snape allows Harry to remember the sexual abuse he's being subjected to, just to see the expression on his face, before making him forget again so he can experience that satisfaction over and over. In one of these he's pimping Harry out to Death Eaters, using potions to control Harry, and in the other it's just himself and Obliviates. Can't actually give any details on those: one was on a private site that's defunct and I didn't save the other.

And does anybody else remember And Just Plain Wrong, by Amenuensis? That whole thing was disturbing, although that was the entire point.

Are you not familiar with the meme? It comes from an early episode of Arrested Development. The guy finds a bag in the refrigerator labeled "Dead dove, do not eat." He looks in the bag, which presumably contains exactly what the label said, then says, "I don't know what I expected."

" I was still treating her as a professional dragon tamer would treat an abused wyvern - cautiously, calmly, no sudden movements."

"Open your mouth wider, you Slavic man-whore!"

"I suspect Hermione will kill me for saying even that... if she hadn't been killed by Harry Potter as she fought with her Lycan compatriots against government oppression."

"Most witches, in a duel, tied their hair back. Instead, as if to show her utter contempt for her opponent, Hermione shook her hair out, casting a spell to return it from a delicate coiffure to its normal wild self. A few muttered spells later, it was flowing back as if in a wind, sparks crackling as they emitted excess magic. An imposing sight that she would perfect in future battles, leading to one of her many titles - the Mudblood Medusa."

"He occasionally touched his cheek as if to verify that his homework whore had really slapped him."

"A thin brown rope appeared from the bottom of Moron's trousers and kept growing."

"The winner is Hermione Jane Granger. And as a member of the International Duelling Council, I nominate Hermione Jane Granger for a Class Three Green Belt, for innovation."

"Madame Maxime loudly offered Hermione a position at Beauxbatons with a full scholarship, on condition that she teach the penis enlarging spell to her new fellow-students."

(Apparently, The Shawshank Redemption is good, but I haven't seen it.) And yes, King is a legend. I'm excited for his next book that's coming out this August.

But I read once a timetravel fic where Harry starts tormenting the Dursleys. And goes on and on and on for chapters. They stayed at his "slaves" because Harry needed the blood protection and didn't let them go. At some point Petunia is literally in tears and Dudley is afraid from leaving his room. The fic still went on like Harry was in the right here - it wasn't even declared as dark!Harry fanfic. It was written as if Harry was entitled to torment them because of what their future selfes did. That's were stopped reading. I never thought I would take pity on the Dursleys but this fic took it too far.

There's also a whole culture of sex slaves, all female of course, and Dumbledore is planning to sell just about everyone Harry knows into sex slavery so they won't be able to help him, or something. It was heading for a harem, so I stopped reading - that's not my jazz, but no offense to anyone who does read them.

*** I think that's the harem wars (or similar) I honestly found it really weird and then it got super boring as well so I stopped. Nobody needs a three page description of how Harry scheduled his day around 70 something women.

Other the other hand I've read one where this wizard terrorist grp makes a potion to transfigure wizards into magical beasts and it always almost ends with the poor person transforming into the magical animal through an intensely painful process and dying, it's animal corpse horribly mutilated

** There's one where Dumbledore writes Vernon with instructions to break Harry's spirits and authorizing him to use the boy carnally (as Vernon had asked for quite often). It's the starkness and matter of factness that makes it more shocking.

** New fucked up sex thing I found today: Umbridge declaring a mandatory orgy for all staff and all students 5th year-and-up (4th years allowed voluntarily as heterosexual couples, or in one case dragged in by Umbridge and given to a geoup of boys to rape her), with everyone given fertility potions beforehand (Snape and McG sabotage them) and girls informed that any of them still a virgin at the end of the event will be expelled.

It's a "soulbond" harem story.

** The weirdest ship I've ever read was definitely Hogwarts x The Giant Squid... the second weirdest was Harry x Moaning Myrtle, which was actually an interesting (though disturbing) insight into post-life sex life. I also read a rather scarring fic whose plot could be summarized to "everybody rapes everybody and Dementor-slime saves the day (by torturing them to death)." It started out dark and then got weirder and weirder.

** There was a fic that was mostly normal. And then it you found out that when people got the Kiss, they didn't die. They basically became fully conscious vegetables trapped inside their bodies. Their bodies were then put under preservation charms and “cared for” by an overseer, who basically used all the kissed people as human sex dolls/fleshlights. Absolutely horrifying, especially since that part was all written from the POV of a person (Draco? Lucius???) who had been kissed and knew they had to deal with this for the ret of eternity.

Also the few times I came across the neceophilia I noped right out.

** So, it was a fic I came across back when I very first started getting into fanfiction; I can't remember the name of it and I think it may have been deleted at some point (people can grow a conscience I guess haha).

All I remember, because really that's all it was, was in regards to first year Hermione, the troll incident, except Harry and Ron I think don't go to look for her? Anyway the troll ends up doing gross things with Hermione and I had to nope out of the story real fast because I hadn't realized what I was getting into. /shudders/ I'd pay someone to obliviate me to escape the memory of that story ever even existing.

** A Dumbledore and Snape bash wherein Snape wants to r*** and murder Harry, and Dumbledore understands but won't allow it because it would attract too much attention. Snape has instead done this to other children. I stopped reading shortly thereafter. I don't like Snape, but that was a bit too much for me.

** A Harry and Daphine time travel fic. Daph starts going cannibal and convinces Harry to try it and she also as a FIRST year manipulates a FIRST year Tracy into seeing her as a mother figure but is also being sexually abused by her at the same time. I don't really remember much but I remember some sort of scene in a bath with daph and Tracy that really disturbed me.
