Looking for a good long fic that starts at the very end of the series,just after the final battle


** There are two authors that write really good "canon-compliant" fics about life after the battle ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]). I would definitely recommend them. The story "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]]" by little0bird is probably one of my favorite stories of all time. It's really good, and it details the characters struggling to pick up where they left off.

I would give you my story, but I've only got a few chapters finished...so you probably don't want to wait around for a WIP. Maybe some day!

**** I really appreciate it! It was my NaNoWriMo project this past year, and even though I only had several pieces totaling 30,000 words (stupid finals), I really wanted to turn it into something concrete. I have four complete chapters written and only 2 posted.

** +1 on The First Day. There is a timeline on her Bio so you can read the fics in order. Out of the main 3 fics, only The First Day is done. The sequel More Than Words and Questions and Answers (NextGen, post epilogue) are updated concurrently, along with the side stories.
