With "The Dark Lord Never Died" now complete, I started a new story. This story is inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games. It does not use characters from those games, or their backgrund.

It is set post-Hogwarts in an alternate Universe. A number of canon events didn't happen or happened differently. The society of Wizarding Britain is a bit different and a number of characters will act differently as well.

** Interesting first chapter, and the fact that it's a Trio pairing fic makes it even better!

** Honestly I've no idea how one ghost 'girl?' could get the entire Bismarck running again.

*** It's not the entire Bismarck that's running again. It's the spirit of her given a body. And the souls of her crew fuel it. All of it the work of the soul or soul fragment of a very powerful Dark Wizard.

**** Voldie again? Or someone else? It seems Voldie is still active in your current story.

***** They never found his last horcrux, and so they sealed his "shade" up after his latest defeat. (He did the oft-mentioned "smart thing" of turning an ordinary rock into a Horcrux and throwing it into the ocean. Good luck trying to find that soul anchor.)

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
