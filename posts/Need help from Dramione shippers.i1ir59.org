** So, this is where I come in, and i don't really know how this fanfiction bot thing works, but I'll love if someone could help.

Here are some of my favorites!

-Isolation by Bex-Chan

-Apple Pies and other amends by ToEatAPeach

-Wanderlust by MrsRen

-Red String of Fate by MrsRen

-Silhouettes by Bex-chan

-Clean by OlivieBlake (as well as part two, Marked)

You can find all of these on Fanfiction.net, those by MrsRen are also on Ao3. As far as I know, these all are pretty well known, but i love them, and these are my all-time favourites in my two and a half years of dramione fanfiction. Hope this helped!

** I second Isolation! It's where I started and it got me hooked! I'd also like to add "Broken" by inadaze22 and "Cruel and Beautiful World" by lenaphoria (its archived somewhere). There are a couple of other classics but I can't remember the authors off hand and I know my fellow Dramione shippers will throw them up in no time! Personally, I feel the best dramiones are slow burn and usually start pretty dark and rocky since that's where we know the characters. A good Draco redemption is brilliant! Happy hunting and I hope the ship does you well! ðŸ¦¡ðŸ¦¡

*** Also dislike Dramione but love Dark/Slytherin!Hermione, can second the Green Girl recommendation. It's a bit light on Hermione facing the actual canon bigotry she would face in Slytherin (They basically adopt her as ('their' muggleborn) but it is bad assed Hermione taking absolutely no crap from Dumbledore, the Order or Voldemort.

** Here's a couple that I think are good - linkffn(7711642) and Ilinkffn(6673670) Mind you, I'm an old lady that's more partial to Draco's father. heh.

  Astoria was never a fan of Hermione Granger, but pretty soon, she would be gone, and Draco was going to need all the help he could get. Rated M for future chapters.

** So ill warn you that a lot of the top level fics aren't really /great/ per say. In the same way the top Harmony fics are frequently cringy power wanks. However there are some amazing ones.

My favorite hidden gem is linkffn(Dancing with Draco) for a whole story rework. Its only 5 chapters but has a finished sequel that is pretty amazing and works on a redemption arc for Draco during the school years.

Linkffn(universal truths by Scullymurphy) is an excellent post war fic which has the two of them growing close in a remake of pride and prejudice.

Waif and strays is my FAVORITE. A heart breakingly cute story where Dracos animagus form accidentally ends up as Hermiones new familar when Crookshanks doesn't return from the war.

  5 chapter Dramione story. Hermione Granger needs a dance tutor before she embarrasses her partner, Viktor Krum, and herself at the Yule Ball. Draco Malfoy needs a good deed to make amends for hexing her teeth. Both of them need to keep everyone else for finding out they're going from enemies to something else. GoF retelling.
