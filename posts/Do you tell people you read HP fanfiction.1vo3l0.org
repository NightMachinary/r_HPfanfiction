What do you say when you're exchanging small-talk with someone and they ask you what your favorite thing to read is? Do you say, "I love Harry Potter fanfiction"? Or do you come up with something else and hope they don't dig too deep? I don't have a lot of free time to read and so I haven't read anything but HP fics in literally over a year, but it's kind of a closet passion for me and I don't know that I want to tell casual aquantances about it.


** I tell people I read fantasy. If they ask for details, I admit a lot of it is "set in the Harry Potter universe" which usually gets a better response than "Harry Potter fanfiction". "Fanfiction" generally = instant dismissal as childish, "set in ____ universe" generally = what? Then I get to explain that Rowling created an /awesome/ set of universe rules/ideas and is kind enough to allow anyone to play in her sandbox! I drop a few common themes amongst what I read (time-travel, wandless magic, integration of magic & muggle technology) and people usually respond well. I fielded this question a /lot/ in college, since I liked to read fanfic while I ate breakfast and the people trying to talk to me often asked "what are you reading?"

If you read nothing but Dramione and Snarry, I'm not sure it would go over as well, though :P

*** The "set in the Harry Potter universe" phrase is pure gold. Though I'm afraid I've been a Snape/Hermione girl from day one. I had a roomate that was big into fanfiction and she went off on a rant one evening about how terrible that ship was. I read some to see what the hubub was all about, and have been hooked ever since.

** I kept it a dark, dark secret for 4 years. Then when I went to university to study creative writing and got to know my course mates better, someone started talking about it and it snowballed. A few of them opened up to having written it and how it made them want to take up a career in writing. I also opened up and now I feel a lot better about it. I still don't talk about it directly, but if the subject is raised I'll contribute. It's something still very personal to me, as online fandom got me through a lot. I'm still not sure how I feel about it becoming more "mainstream" for lack of a better word. But I'm sure that's just me.

***** Yeah I was going to suggest Tumblr. If you haven't seen the latest episodes of Sherlock then I would suggest watching the first few minutes of the first episode. When Moffat "explains" one possibility to how Sherlock faked his death he has Sherlock and Moriarty almost kiss, and basically turns to fandom and says "I see what you're doing..." Lots more celebrities/bands/actors/whatever are becoming more aware of it, because of Tumblr/Twitter/Other social media. I'm not sure if I like it. Perhaps I just need to let go?

*** It is easier when I can say "I've actually written a 570k word story, probably closer to a million words total. But it was fanfiction, I'd like to write something original eventually but it hasn't come to me yet."

Make what you've written an accomplishment you are proud of, but not a big deal since "you know" it is kindof silly and just a hobby.

and before anyone asks: link for the lazy [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eginnymylove][http://www.fanfiction.net/~ginnymylove]]

I kindof specialize in smut with plot, so if that isn't your thing then don't bother.

** Sure. People laugh, and then I get to tell them that the fanfiction seems to have matured significantly with the fans (which is the case for my taste, so I only read solidly written stuff as opposed to the drivel we all pumped out when we were 12). Usually around this point, they admit to reading some sort of fanfiction as well.

I don't tell everyone that I write it, though. I wrote a 100k word Draco/Harry, Harry/Ginny novel over the summer in about a month, and I just told people at work I was working on a book about human trafficking. I mean, that was the basic premise for my fic, so...

** I generally don't mention it. My closest friends know that I do, and I'm happy to let them think that all I read are fluffy happy stories or awesome adventure stories, rather than dark, smutty slash fics. I just say I'm a big fan of Harry Potter, which is totally true, and that I like reading and writing my own stories. If they ask if they can rea my stories I just say no, it's kind of a personal hobby and I don't want anyone to read them (besides the potentially hundreds or thousands of strangers online who do so :D ).

I'm not just a one trick pony, but I'm also not afraid to admit it. There are some seriously good stories out there in fanfiction. Just because it cannot be commercialized doesn't mean it isn't as good as a novel you could buy at the store. Why be ashamed?

Now...I don't tell them my favorites are Harem and Smut...

** Nope. I've read Fanfiction for ages and have dabbled in writing to help me improve my grammar and just writing in general.

Mentioned it to my cousins. Got made fun of. Later I mentioned that I enjoy AltHistory novels and stories. Got made fun of and was told I liked "Historical Fanfiction" and that did I enjoy reading about what would happen if Lincoln was an Alien?

After that I just never told anyone anything about my reading preferences. I will say this though. Alien Lincoln would be freaking awesome.

** For a long time it never came up because I was alone in my room when I did it, but now that I have a kindle and take it literally everywhere people started asking what I'm reading to start a conversation. So I flash them the page of foreign-language text (I'm German) and say it's a free eBook by some unpublished author on the internet. If they ask any more direct questions I explain exactly what I am reading, but mostly there is no need. And my closest friends all know and don't care (I am odd enough as it is and most are more put out by the amount I read rather then /what/. Also the adventure and humour things i read are innocent enough, I don't have any explicit het stories and the slash stuff never enters the kindle ^^)

** When I start to read it in 2007 I would only read at home and never have to bring it on conversations. But after I start to read it at the college some friends would ask "What are you reading?" And I just say that it was fanfictions, after they made fun off me I stop answering. Now I just say that I am reading storys that other people put on the internet.

Even worse than saying that you are reading HP fanfics, is saying that you are reading an Anime/Manga fanfics, I also read Naruto fanfics, and even for my friends that enjoy anime/manga and live in the "fantasy world" it is something childish :/ But since I can't see myself ever stoping reading fanfics, I prefer to keep it as quit as possible.

I would judge someone more if they read bodice-rippers than if they read LV/HP. If I want to be professional or something, the topic just doesn't really come up.

** I had hid the fact that I read HP fanfiction and additionally was a HHr fan for years. But after I was caught by a friend prepping a fanfic of my own with obvious mentions of Harry Potter, it was kinda hard to continue hiding it. So I gave it to them straight; I enjoy fanfics, especially Harry Potter, and I am an avid HHr fan. The first two points went down really well considering that my friend also loves fanfiction, much to my joy. It was the third point however which cause the "shit to hit the fan". As it turns out my friend was a devout follower of canon pairings.

** Not people I don't know well. When people ask what I'm reading, I say "something" most of the time and if pressed, I'm very vague ("well, a story. It has words"). Due to being a bit of a completely sarcastic ass, it's in-character enough for people not to press for info.

Honestly, as a somewhat bigger dude (6'2") who already has a couple of "girly" habits that I get mocked for (I shriek like a little girl whenever I trip, for example- it's the only time I can get my voice to go above its normal low pitch) I just don't think that it's worth adding too much material for people to harass me over- even if its good-natured.

It isn't the only thing I read. I found out that a lot of my friends are interested in fic from other fandoms and HP. I've met a lot of friends through it, as well. I was in theatre in high school, so pretty much all of us read and wrote fic all the time, for musicals, HP, TV shows, etc. I guess I'm lucky!
