Hey, do you guys know any fics where Voldemort survives the final battles but loses his magic or something? Fics where he's exiled to the Muggle world and must learn to live/make peace with his non-magical self?

(Honestly, Voldemort's such an interesting character and I don't know many good Voldemort-centric/development fics out there.)


** Well, let's see... There is a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045112/1/Oswald-the-Ottoman][Voldemort as furniture,]] just to start...

** In the R trilogy by Greengecko Voldemort is killed before the horcruxes are destroyed. The death eaters sort of ressurect him in Lockhart's body later, but he's not like his previous self. Harry finally destroys Voldehart's magic with in the final confrontation, turning him into a muggle basically. Afterwards he's placed in a french prison.

  Hermione Granger has a lot on her plate. She has to finish up Hogwarts, figure out what to do with her life, and deal with Draco Malfoy's dysfunctional family. Also, her neighbor might be Lord Voldemort.
