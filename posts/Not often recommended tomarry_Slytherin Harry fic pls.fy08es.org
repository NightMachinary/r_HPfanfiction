I've been through so many threads trying to find something I've yet to read and somehow still remain unsuccessful. So, I'm asking for a tomarry and/or slytherin Harry fic. Preferably over 50k words. Tysm.


** I know of quite a few Slytherin!Harry time travel HP/TMR fics, but since you've searched through past threads I assume that you've seen most of those already. Here are a few I've enjoyed that haven't been recommended on this sub:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18316175/][Son of Magic]] - (102k+ words; frequently updated) MoD!Harry travels back to Tom's Hogwarts years, once again hoping against hope that he might be able to change the future for the better. I enjoy this fic because it's an interesting reversal of the typical relationship dynamics between the two in the majority of time travel HP/TMR fics.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4891909/][Hem of Your Garment]] - (123k+ words; last updated in July of last year) Harry is catapulted back in time without his memories and slowly gets to know a Tom Riddle who is deeply flawed. I enjoy this one because the author has a unique take on Tom's personality, backstory, and what motivates him.

*** With Son of Magic, when you say it's a reversal of the usual dynamic, what do you mean? I am not familiar with the usual dynamic in these kind of fics because I haven't been brave enough to read any so far.

**** Most fics of this kind start with Harry being intensely angry at Riddle but trying (poorly) to hide the truth about his time travel origins from him. Inevitably, Harry does something that makes Tom get suspicious and obsessive, and then there's a slow seduction of Harry falling in love with Tom without meaning to. Usually Tom is portrayed as a skilled manipulator, so he holds most of the power in the relationship while Harry struggles against his own feelings.

In contrast, in this fic Harry is the one in a position of power and Tom is the one struggling with what he feels.

  After decades of war, the world is on the brink of destruction, with no hope for survival. The only way to go on is to travel back in time and change everything that's gone wrong, starting with Tom Riddle. That's how Harry Potter found himself in 1941, a time he had hoped never to find himself in again. Why 1941? Death has a pretty messed up sense of humour, that's why.
