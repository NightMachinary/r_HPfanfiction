Hi,

Been reading fanfics for years and I've read the majority of the famous ones. I haven't read any new fics in the last two to three years so I'm looking for -

Well written fics published in the last two to three years.

OR

Just well written fics in general that focus on magic. I don't understand why people circlejerk the "muggles are awesome" BS when you have fucking MAGIC to explore. Think of fics like "The Mind Arts" by Wu Gang or oneshots like "Concentric Wavelengths"

OR

Romance fics that are well written.

OR

I have yet to read a single decent Harry/ HR fic so if someone has any recommendations that'd be great. All the H/Hr fics I've ever tried out end up being a Muggle!Power Circlejerk.

My only real negative regarding these fics is *no slash* please. Also no harems cuz no one can actually write one properly. At least not in this fandom.

I'd also love any recs you have on male OC's or SI's since I've never really read any of those before. [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] or spacebattles or AO3 or sufficient velocity or questionable questing or any other website is fine with me.

Thanks so much!


** Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7

Beyond the Curtain by Bobika (definitely recommend this one because although it's a WIP, it's amazingly well-written)

Whiskey Time Travel by Sapper One

Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon

Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19

Blindness by AngelaStarCat (if you haven't read it yet, READ)

Also, since you've been reading fics for years too, can I get a list of fics you would recommend along the same lines as your request?

*** So this is my favorites list - been reading for almost 10 yeasrs now, so I haven't curated this. Some of the fics on here are ones I no longer enjoy, but the majority of them are relatively well written. If some aren't it's probably because I read them as a teenager when my standards for fanfics were fairly low.\\
[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2988362/?cid=224&s=4&a=fs#end]]\\
For instance, I wouldn't enjoy Harry Potter and the PoS these days. Some additional fics that won't show up at the top - The Lesser Sadness, The Lie I've lived by jbern, The Denarian Trilogy - the last two recs haven't aged very well, but are worth a read. You might end up enjoying them.

**** I noticed you have a Marvel x HP crossover on your favourite list. Since I wasn't sure whether you were interested in crossovers before, I recommend reading

Prometheus Bound by AnarchicMuse

It's the best M x HP crossover to ever exist, in my opinion.

I didn't like the Denarian Trilogy but loved The Lie I've Lived!

*** Ok so going over this it might be easier for you to sort by last updated. some things that came to mind -

Stuff by lady salazar

Concentric wavelengths

The Mind Arts by Wu Gang

Read "Whispers" and its sequel here - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/1/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots]]

Prince of the Dark kingdom is one of the best AU's in this fandom

Cauterized is pretty famous too

stuff by silens cursor, taure, vlad the inhaler, voice of the nephilim, shezza, perspicacity

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is the only WBWL fic worth reading

Don't read anything by Athey - i know I have a few fics by her in my favourites list - but just dont. She has some really good ideas about magic and her writing is decent and what not but she then throws in Harry and Voldy shagging like rabbits 20 chapters later.

If I remember correctly - anything by Megamatt09 is just badly written smut.

Some of the fics in this community are pretty good - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-PortkeyOrg-C2/84507/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]

Hope this helps narrow down my favorites list. A good few fics on it are ones that I'd never read if they were recc'd to me now, so sorry about that. But curating that list is a giant pain.

** Aw, one of my favourite fics to rec is slash- but the romance is really secondary to the plot and only shows up about halfway through the story.\\
Linkao3(the second string)

Some others I have-

Linkffn(the unforgiving minute)

Linkao3(in the bleak midwinter)

Linkao3(unfogging the future)

I second Blindness by AngelaStarCat

If you don't mind crossovers-

Linkffn(the green games) -crossover with Hunger Games

Linkffn(revenge of the wizard) -crossover with Star Wars

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  HG xover. When Harry was 13, he took a group of people against Voldemort and failed. As punishment, Voldemort made the Green Games and forced Harry and his friends to fight against each other. Five years later, it's still happening and Hermione ends up as a tribute. Draco is acting suspiciously un-Slytherin and she's not sure she can trust him, but she doesn't have a choice.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Harry/Hermione fic where Harry is an auror hunting death eaters and a group of especially clever thieves and Hermione does politics and on the side she breaks into the homes of her political enemies. The broom chase scene through London is one of my favorite scenes ever.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
