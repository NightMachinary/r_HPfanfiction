I was looking around her Tumblr(not a regular user so maybe I'm just dumb) and people were talking about a pride and prejudice AU. I couldn't find it anywhere does anyone know what/where this is? On a second note is she going to write again, her stuff was amazing!


** She posted a couple of one-shots a few weeks back. But she hasn't updated the Pride and Prejudice AU since November, so we'll see...

  It's a truth universally acknowledged that a rising Dark Lord in want of a good country must also be in want of... well, everything.or,Harrie James Potter has no need of a city-boy with deep pockets or a lord who thinks he's more charming than he actually is.

** She's also started to post Ichor on Wordpress and looks like she's continuing it. Have to ask permission to see it but she's pretty good at allowing access to it. Very happy that she has decided to return to it as it was one of my favourite stories. [[https://nocturnememory.home.blog/]]
