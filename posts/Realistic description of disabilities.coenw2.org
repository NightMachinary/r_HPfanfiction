** There is linkao3(A Different Fate) which i think you may have read if you've been trying to find fics like this.

I agree with what you say, very few are realistic in any way.

  Rumplestiltskin is the Dark One, but Fiona knows that his fate was meant to be different. When she learns what has become of her son, she grows determined to restore the destiny she cut away---whether he wants her to or not. When Belle makes a deal to become the Dark One's maid, she never expects to find his mother encouraging her growing relationship with Rumplestiltskin.

  Death is omnipotent. As such, it should be of no surprise that they're able to retain the memories of various universes, or multiple timelines and lives lived. Because of this, everything is different, and yet very much the same. Death will only allow one mortal to Lord over them. It just so happens that this universe's Harry Potter needs a more...hands on approach. ----aka that AU where Death becomes a parental figure for a young mute Harry.

  They have Shepard's pie for dinner. Ron and Hermione watch Harry fill up his plate and only start serving themselves when he picks up his fork and starts eating. Neville laughs into his wine glass.“How are you dealing with their mothering, Harry?” he asks.Ron opens and closes his mouth for a minute, groping for an excuse. Eventually, Ron says, “He's just so small, Nev.”“Hey,” Harry says. “I'm seventeen. I'm an adult.”Ron shakes his head at Neville. “My best friend is an infant.” A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione. Based off this tumblr post.

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.Sorry, this isn't a great summary. And I know this sounds really depressing, but just go with me, alright?

*** Life would probably be easier in the magical world with a physical disability but not for anything else. Considering how Harry never got counselling after the fourth book, they most likely have very little mental health care. With how medieval they can be at times, the wizarding world might even have some pretty backwards views on psychological issues.
