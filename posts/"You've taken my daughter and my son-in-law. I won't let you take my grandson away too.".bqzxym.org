***** I can see it happening, sort of. A character in grief could seek to blame their loss on someone else. Andromeda could blame Remus or Tonks for going off by themselves, or blame Dumbledore for inducting Tonks into the Order, but they're all dead. The next person that she'd likely blame is Harry, who is alive and the poster boy for the war.

Honestly, I prefer Andromeda not blaming Harry for what happened, but I can see how an author might frame OP's request.

****** I don't think making Andromeda seriously blame the 17 years old orphan for the death of her daughter is a good narrative, especially since she's supposed to be capable of proper discernement if her disavowal of her bigot family is any indication.

A better way to play this would be Andromeda having proper complaints about Harry, such as his age or maybe emotional instability after the war due to trauma, and not wanting what she perceive as a bad influence on her grandson.

******* The thing is that Andromeda really only had one scene in the books, so that leaves a lot of room for interpretation as far as her characterisation goes. I like to think that she's tough as nails and wouldn't allow her grief to cloud her judgement. But at the same time, losing her husband and her only daughter in the span of months, leaving her with little Teddy, basically the only family she has left, is... insanely difficult, to say the least. Becoming overprotective and potentially letting her surely overwhelming emotions influence her judgement is quite plausible, imo.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
