How is it possible for non magicals with just primitive weapons make magicals , who has some thing more than them go into secrecy? Very Confusing.


** Quantity has a quality all of its own. Enough people with enough torches and pitchforks in a mob can accomplish a lot of stuff. All it takes is one lucky shot to break a magical's wand or knock them out and they're useless. It's quite common in more 'urban fantasy' like settings.

I think in canon, the Statute was a response to two aspects of the Witch Hunts. One, that most of the people caught that actually died were untrained young people and people killing children/teenagers tends to make you want to get away from those people. Two, the adults that survived with their apparition and flame-freezing charms or whatever it was just got annoyed with having to move house and change identities all the time and started the statute in the same way someone might put up a fence to keep kids off their nice green lawn.

** It could be less danger and more general annoyance. "Oh great, those fools are burning witches again... Want to give it a try again, Wendelin? Not today? We better pack up and move to another town, then, or they'll never leave us be."

** perhaps they were more concerned with all the muggles being murdered in retaliation.

It's a hidden statue that nobody sees. For obvious reasons we don't know what it looks like. There is disagreement whether it's been disillusioned or is placed in an inaccessible place.

Or did you mean statu*t*e? That's something completely different.

** According to pottermore (I think) it was part in response to the witch hunts and part in response to muggle governments refusing to guarantee the same rights as muggles to wizards yet demanding wizards help with problems. In the end it was just easier to make muggles forget than it was to constantly refuse demands and move houses when the hunters came.

*** I think that was in Prisoner of Azkaban. Maybe a couple of other places too.
