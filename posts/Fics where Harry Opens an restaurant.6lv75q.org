** Heroes Assemble! It's a post-canon, non-epilogue-compliant fic that crosses over with the MCU. At the start of the story, Harry's been traveling the world for several years, playing tourist after getting sick of the UK in the wake of Voldemort's defeat.

He decides to settle down in New York City and open a cafe but quickly ends up tangled up in the local superhero scene.

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

#+begin_quote
  The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."
