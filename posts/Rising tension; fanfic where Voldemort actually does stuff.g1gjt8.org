I love me some good villains, and I'm often disappointed by Voldemort. Even in the books, Voldemort gets resuscitated at the end of Harry's 4th year. During all of 5th year he is this looming threat in the background. We know he is back, the ministry doesn't believe it until the end of the 5th year. So he's out in the open during Harry's 6th year, what does he do? He kills Amelia Bones and we hear about Demenor attacks, off screen. What does he do during 7th year? He takes over the ministry and Hogwarts, in a silent coup. And spends the rest of the year hunting the Elder Wand.

This is mostly because the books are told from Harry's perspective. We learn about things when Harry learns about them. We don't see al the stuff Voldemort actually does. I would have loved to see T the ministry scrambling up some defences and countermeasures against Voldemort, only for Voldemort to slowly and systematically destroy them for some slow rise in tension. To see Voldemort simply waltz into the ministry after Dumbledore's death, knowing that there is nobody left who can defeat him, take out a platoon of aurors and proceed to take over the ministry.

We are constantly told that Voldemort is the most terrifying Dark Lord. So horrible that even muggleborns 10 year after his 'death' are to afraid to say his name. But we see so little of that in action that the fandom dislikes Umbridge more, simply because we truly got to know how terrible she is. I don't want to hear about Voldemort killing Amelia Bones off screen. I want to see it happen.

It doesn't have to be a lot. I'm satisfied with a few examples showcasing how much of a monster he is. An example of this is linkffn(Wind Shear) where we see some of Voldemorts actions in action.


** I've been searching for a similar fic as well for a while. But honestly I think Voldemort is tough to write while keeping him canon compliant because, in my mind, - and Dumbledore points that out in book 6 - he wanted to be like Slughorn and create a network of prominent wizards and witches around him. Maybe he was more proactive when situation called for it but for the most part of the story he is more like a godly/legendary figure. Even after he takes over Magical England, he doesn't put himself in a position of power and it feels like for the most part he lets the Death Eaters run it. He craves magical knowledge for himself and power in the sense that he could topple governments as he likes it but, just like Slughorn, unless directly interested in an objective, he prefers to take the backseat.

Edit: as an after thought... hell he doesn't even have a house and is probably way poorer than many of his followers. He is like the Jesus of Dark Arts.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][Last Mage Of Krypton]] series ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Book 2]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][Book 3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][Book 4]]), Voldie becomes more active with each return, aided by the fact that he's taking over a living person each time and using their shredded soul to "fill in" the gaps of his own soul before transfiguring his new body to suit his preferences.\\
Book 1, he goes after the stone (pretty close to canon, but...).\\
Book 2, Lockhart-Voldie rescues his followers from Azkaban and kidnaps Harry.\\
Book 3, Bagnold-Voldie teams up with Grindlewald (in a scene inspired by Terry Pratchett's Hogfather) and they go on a road trip around America (not kidding...), collecting Obscurials in order to attack Hogwarts.\\
Book 4, Umbridge-Voldie and Returned!Nott-Grindlewald seek UNLIMITED POWAH! via a blood-ritual that lets them take down a force of SWAT-Aurors, Werewolves and Vampires with ease. They also conclude that Harry is the last Atlantian based on the results of a scrying ritual. Harry goes along with that bit as it's less problematic than the truth.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** In my story "Patron", Voldemort is far more ruthless and subtle than in canon. For example, the entire "Harry forced into the tournament" plot is just a diversion to keep Dumbledore busy so he can't interfere with the actual resurrection because he needs to protect Harry against sabotage attempts. If Harry happens to die due to aforementioned sabotage, that's a bonus. And even if the boy-who-lived survives, Dumbledore's reputation will suffer because of the incidents at his school. So, as Harry has to dodge traps and attacks, Crouch prepares Voldemort's revival. And then the real struggle begins, as both sides recruit and prepare and move against each other in Britain and the rest of Europe.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

*** That's a good 700.000 words longer than the entirety of the Harry Potter series. And the author wrote it in less than two years. I'm kind of intimidated by the size of the fic. I'll probably keep it aside till I'm bored someday. Thanks for the recommendation either way!

**** It's actually kind of interesting. I've found that I can skim some parts, like the author has some really repetitive phrases, so some parts I can easily skim. And after a while, you can skim some plot-details (because there are SO MANY PLOTS) , and still keep up with the story. :D So that makes it less long, I think.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
