** A pure blood with a muggleborn equals half blood

Muggleborn- 0 magical grandparents

Half blood- 1-3 magical grandparents

Pure blood- 4 magical grandparents

Then there are the fully pure bloods that go back but you're technically counted a pure blood of you have 4 magical grandparents

** The difference between a Half Blood and a Pureblood is not very clear and Rowling never clearly stated the rules (in the books at least). But one thing we know for sure is that Harry is a Half Blood, which means that having 2 magical parents is not enough to make someone a Pureblood.

Between the interviews and Pottermore, Rowling explained a bit more the concept, and from what I remember, there are 2 sets of rule depending of who is judging you :

- For most people, a witch of a wizard need to have at least 3 generations of magical ancestor before being considered a "PureBlood". In we take the Potters as an example, Harry is a Half Blood, the children he got with Ginny are also Half Blood, but if one of his children marry a Pureblood (or a Half Blood in the same situation), then his grandchildren would be considered Pure Blood.
- For the worst Blood Purist, like the Malfoy, some is considered a Half Blood "As long as he can trace back his lineage to a Muggle". Of course, this rule sound stupid since some family could keep the record of a Muggle Ancestor from 500 years ago while some others could "forget" about their grandfather, but this is the kind of hypocrisy that goes well with Blood Purism.

** Definition of pureblood is complete mess, and never properly visited by JKR. It ranges from what you said (child of two magicals is a pureblood) to basically the definition of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred][Thoroughbred]], which means that ALL your ancestors must be magicals until some shared commonly agreed stopgap and ANY Muggle in your genealogy disqualifies you. There is just no good answer without JKR involvement.

** You have to have 2 generations of Wizards. Think of it like this.

*Harry(2 Magical Parents + 2 Magical Grandparents) = Half-Blood*

*Albus Potter(2 Magical Parents + 4 Magical Grandparents) = Pureblood*

**** It's about Grandparents.

To be Pure-Blooded then you must have 4 magical grandparents and 2 Magical Parents.

If Dumbledore is Half-Blooded(I never really looked into his blood status) then that means one of his parents must have been a Half-Blood or Muggle-Born which would make one(or more) of his grandparents, Muggle.

Or maybe one of his grandparents was a Squib because I think the 4 magical grandparents and the 2 magical parents must have magical ability not just be of magic blood(so no squibs)

** Blood Status is more of a social construct than a strict taxonomic nomenclature. The defining characteristic of being a Pureblood in the books/movies seems to basically be if you care about being a Pureblood or not.

So, yeah. You can be fully magical-heritage and be a Pureblood just fine, but if you marry a couple muggles along the way and cross 'em off the family tree before anyone notices, you seem to be able to keep up appearances.

** I think it goes like this:

No known magical ancestors = Muggleborn

known magical and muggle ancestors = Halfblood

No known Muggle ancestors = Pureblood
