I'm not necessarily talking about an older woman, just someone who is fiercely protective of Harry.

I guess I'm really tired of the "RAWWRR get away from my woman" cliche and appreciate the role reversal. Doesn't mean that Harry should be weak, but he has a lot of stuff that he could be protected from by a strong girlfriend. I'm kinda disappointed that most of FanFiction seems so conventional in regards to gender roles, especially when Magic is such a strong equalizer. I guess most writers probably just want their hero to spring into action and do heroic things; rescuing his SO is an obvious choice for that.

No Slash please.

** linffn(11388837)

This is a crack-fic, so don't expect many of the characters to stay true to canon or for there to be any cogent overarching plot to tie everything together.

It's hilarious in parts, though, and considering that the author wrote a chapter a day for a month straight... that's fairly remarkable.

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. --- (Eventual Harry/Hermione) Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.

  This will have witches and wizards of my choosing venting at Dumbledore for whatever dumb decision the old wizard has made concerning Harry. Like in HBG I will only have brainy girls in this, but I will be adding guys in a non-romantic fashion. So no Ginny at all. Only warning in these are for language being used. So you've been warned ahead of time on that.
