  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.Originally posted on ffnet, now also updating here.

** Shezza's Denarian trilogy. It's technically a crossover with the Dresden files but everything you need to know is explained. The climax fight of the second book is some of the best action in a fanfic ever. linkffn(3473224) is the first book.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land]] It's really long and it has an unfinished sequel (you can read the first one and just pretend it ends there cause it has a good ending) but the combat scenes are the best I've ever read, and there are a lot of them. Extremely long fic, but also really well written

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  The saying "opposites attract" is proven true when two very different people come together, despite their own (token) protests. Long-ish one-shot, heavy AU. Super!Harry, kinda (it's not really relevant, it's just kinda there). Basically my answer to Harry/Draco shipping: Harry/Draco's more worthwhile twin sister. Footnotes! Terrible summary, but such is life, yes?

** There's not that much actual combat but if your looking for the gruesome, dark and consiquences of war the linkao3(Manacled) is really very dark and twisted.

A Handmaids Tale-esque story. The beginning is sly and corrupted and dark. The middle is the war with a big focus on the hospital wing along with fights and strategy. The ending is the ending.

The characters are very ooc in my opinion but in a good way. In a way that fits the world and story crafted aroud it better than if they were in character.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.
