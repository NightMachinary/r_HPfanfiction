Looking for a next generation fic that isn't super popular. All of the requests I've seen have the same fics recommended, so I'm looking for one that maybe needs a little love. It can be completed or not, with a bunch of OCs or without. Preferably one that has nothing to do with CC (I don't have problem with CC, but I've got more than enough fics about it to read). Well written if possible. Any plot is fine, doesn't have to be canon-compliant, slash is okay. Thanks!

(Edit) The most commonly recommended fics I see are Hogwarts Houses Divided, How To Charm A Witch, Albus Potter Series, Clash, The Escapes of Teddy Lupin, and Whispers of the Dead Lords. I don't have problem with any of these, I just already know that they're out there. Fics that further explore the HP world, maybe introducing new sorts of magic or something like that, are what I particularly enjoy, but I'm not very picky.


** I'd probably be a good idea to list a few of the ones you've already read and consider super popular! People might not know what is commonly recommended, especially if they don't read much of that request. I enjoyed Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time by frombluetored linkffn(12096051). It is CC compliant, but I liked it regardless. Doesn't have much to do with CC at all. A nice look at the Potter and Weasley families. It has a sequel that is currently updating.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  Extra! Extra! Clemence Fitzgerald here, reporting for Witchy Business. You're in for a treat, dear reader: Hogwarts bachelor ALBUS POTTER has acquired a girlfriend---identity unknown. Let the witch hunt begin. (an Albus/OC romance-satire set in a Hogwarts beleaguered by celebrity worship, shipping wars, and too many teen queens; Dobby Winner: Best OC, Dialogue, Description)

** Lessons Learned by loveadubdub linkffn(4260581) What I like about this one is that all the teenagers are teenagerish and realistic.

It's not just about Rose and Scorpius as the characters listed suggests, it's about the main five.

  My shrink says I repress feelings and emotions. She told me once that I have trouble “admitting reality” to myself. Now, I don't know if that's true. After all, I don't have the fancy Psychological Healing degree, do I?

  "But after all these years of chasing after you, I finally caught up to you in the end, didn't I?" she asked. "No," he replied. "Because the one doing the chasing has always been me, and the one being chased has always been you." Half a decade after leaving, he unexpectedly returns and completely shakes up her world in the way he always has: soft, but strong---like Lithium.

  Everything went black. Albus didn't know anymore where he was - who he was. And in this darkness, where only throbbed the bite in his chest, a green and golden eye was looking at him. (His fourth year at Hogwarts is easy, happy, no troubles. Albus Potter never asked to be special. But, well, he IS. And things won't ever be the same...)

  They were happy. They were whole. They should have known it was too good to be true. It began with a murder of one, and it culminated in the rise of one of the most notorious serial killers to walk the streets of England since Jack the Ripper was at large. To think, though, that it all began with a bitter heart, a bottle of bourbon, and a very, very sharp knife. [Murder Mystery]
