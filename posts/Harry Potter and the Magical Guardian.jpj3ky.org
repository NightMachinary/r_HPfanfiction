TL;DR: Good!Dursley's, Manipulative!Dumbledore.

Recently I've recommended this fic in a lot of posts so I wanted to make a post about it. I'll try to avoid spoilers.

Basically it's a Good!Dursleys fic, where Lily and Petunia reconcile while Lily was still early in school and maintained a good relationship with each other. When Lily and James die, Harry is taken to the Dursleys and instead of neglecting or abusing him they treat him like an actual nephew/cousin. Harry gets the chance at a good childhood, one where he's loved, has friends, and isn't hated for being wizard, not even by Vernon.

That last one is of most importance because it allows Harry to know about the Wizarding World, magic, and his own status as The Boy Who Lived. This further leads to Harry being prepared for Hogwarts by learning some basics from what Lily left behind and from Petunia, who happens to work with Potions, leading to a Smart!Powerful!Harry. Harry also happens to befriend a snake (early Parseltongue reveal) which turns into his familiar later on.

Another feature about this fic is an early Hermione introduction/friendship, who instantly recognizes Harry. Together they learn all they can about the Wizarding World and magic, leading them to be much stronger than those their own age and are regarded as prodigies. Also, Petunia is revealed to be somewhat of a big deal in the Wizarding World.

This fic is also heavy on Dumbledore bashing, where he's all manipulative and secretive, all for The Greater Good. There's also some Ron bashing and Molly bashing early on.

There are some tropes that some may find off-putting, however. One would be muggle wanking (I'm not sure if I'm using the term correctly), where everyone is awestruck by how ingenious Muggles are and highlight how the Muggle World is so much better in comparison to the gilded dystopia that is Magical Britain. Another would be Gringotts/Goblins fixing everything and blocking Dumbledore on all his manipulations and trickeries.

Other tropes include: early Sirius release/Peter capture, Slytherin politics, Pure-Blood culture, Lordships and much more.

I could go on but I don't want to spoil anything. I though it was a good read. Link in the comments.

  What if Lily and Petunia had been able to reconcile while Lily was still early in school? If the two remained close until Lily was forced to go into hiding? What if Harry knew a lot about his mother, and wanted to be like her rather than his famous father? What impact would that have on a certain headmaster's plan to have a young Harry enter the magical world hoping for an escape?
