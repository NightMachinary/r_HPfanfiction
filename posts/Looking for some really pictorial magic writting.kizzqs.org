Hello, Does anyone of you know a fic or author with a detailed description of magic. In the sense of when you read it you can really imagine a grand picture.


** Flamethrower.

linkao3(Of a Linear Circle Part 3 by Flamethrower)

All of the story is brilliant. Their writing is brilliant and amazing and so detailed. Part 3 of this story (you don't need the preceding books though they are also brilliant and I reccommend then!) Is a time travel story where Harry goes to Founders Era and learns magic from them. They go into Wood Lore, why different wood makes different wands. Harry learns languages and the way magic works in different languages. There's masteries in various subjects. There's a history of the languages of Britain. There's politics. Theres potions. It's just so detailed. All of the story is I cannot hype it enough.

  Harry Potter's fifteenth birthday starts off just like all the others...for the first few seconds, at least. The gift he receives changes his entire life.
