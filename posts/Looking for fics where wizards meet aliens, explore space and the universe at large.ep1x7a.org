Hello people.

I just finished reading the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818][Wizards in space]] series and I'm left wanting for more as it stops before things get really good.

Do you know of any fic that deal with similar themes? Wizards who find or build a spaceship and start exploring the universe. Encounter aliens, work out problems of technologies, language, discovery,...

Cross-overs are not a problem but I'd like to avoid fics with Harry Sue who become the smartest and most knowledgeable person in the universe, fixing everything in a few moments and break every rules of physics.


** Linkffn(invincible) does a rather good job of building a spaceship and some good worldbuilding. I personally wasnt a favorite of some of the later parts, - not bad writing, just me not agreeing with the way the author took the fic.

That pretty much incapsulates my feeling on most of Darth Marrs' work. The author is really good, but last I read, his endings... left much to be desired.

** There's Linkffn(the voyage of the starship hedwig), which has some pretty amazing concepts (non-humanoid aliens with different psychology, An interstellar drive that uses stars as floo points, internally expanded sphere of metal as the starship, among many others). If you can get over the fact that most people are massively out of character (at least half of everyone are assholes, and the writing /really/ emphasizes this) and the strange fixation by the author on character death (seriously, he describes how a bunch of people powered their stardrive to lethal levels of exhaustion, including a pregnant woman, when it's not really clear /why/ they went that far. Just seemed like it was manufacturing morbid desperation.)

Linkao3(Make a Wish) is the first part of a looong slight crossover where they apparently eventually go into space. pretty good, actually, but I've not finished it yet.

I think the best you're going to get are crossovers, especially with Stargate. For instance, I really enjoyed Linkffn(Isis' bane), which has Harry get kidnapped by goa'uld and appropriating their ship, and eventually spirals into an enjoyable ride further down the line. I wish the author hadn't stuck to Harry's age, though, because he's like nine when the story starts and 15 when it ends. Just not really all that logical.

  "Stiles wished he could fix this, wished so badly that he could make it up to Scott and somehow give him his life back. But Scott's old life was gone and it was Stiles' fault." Or the one where Stiles accidentally sparks a wish, Derek has a breakdown and then deals with his man-pain, and no one can get through breakfast without breaking something.Also being a werewolf is more than just having fangs and claws. Grr. I wanted to explore what that might mean, and the different ways humans and werewolves would read the same situations. Surprisingly Derek had a lot to say on the subject.

** I'm planning to write one. I got the magical spaceships worked out pretty well using established spells, but I'm having a hard time creating antagonists. Traditionalist anti space politicians are a possibility in the early parts. Coming up with an entirely new alien race is way above the scope of the project. I'm guessing I'll have to make it a crossover and use existing aliens from somewhere, but no idea which one I should use. Maybe Protomolecule, it's like Bacteria evolved to be sentient and capable of using magic.

*** If you're familiar with Stargate, it's a universe that lends itself quite readily to HP canon, in a manner of speaking.

There's 5-6 major (and I mean MAJOR) antagonists, all of which would be very interesting to collide with Magic. Spoilers, by the way, for anyone who wants to watch the show blind. You really should.

For example, there's the Goa'uld, a parasitic, snake-like race (could you communicate with them in parseltongue?) that takes over people as hosts (would occlumency work against this?) and pose as gods to most of the galaxy. They don't have any powers, and use scavenged technology from other races which they've destroyed and subjugated.

The Replicators are spider-like machines (does the basilisk-induced fear work on them, and how does their mechanical nature play with magic?) built from hyper-advanced tiny little blocks of machinery. They consume all metal and make more of themselves, and eventually manage to make their blocks small enough to mimick the cells of a human and assume a form like them.

If you crossover to SG-Atlantis, there's the Wraith, a human-insect hybrid race that uses completely organic technology and can suck the life from someone with their hands, making them age rapidly (could the Elixir of Life cure this?)

In the later seasons, it is unveiled that if a species evolves far enough, they can eventually learn to shed their physicality and become pure energy. (how would this work with magic?) One of the major antagonists, Anubis, is a Goa'uld who was helped along this process by someone who was already ascended. He tricked them, but the other ascended intervened and tried to cast him out. This only worked partially, so now he's formless, but bound to the physical plane and unable to use any of the understanding he gained on the higher planes. He takes the form of a black energy that can possess people like a goa'uld, or like Voldemort's wraith. (would a patronus charm work against him?)

The Ori are another such species, but with no qualms about not interfering like the ascended we already know do. They pose as gods in another galaxy, and gain power from being worshipped as such.

In addition to that, there's a couple more interesting things:

There was an ancient precursor race which invented most of the advanced tech in the galaxy. They eventually ascended out of the physical world, but before that, they had powers that are very similar to the magic we've read about in the books. These ancients lived among humans for a while after their civilisation was destroyed or ascended, and thus modern humans share some of their blood in the form of specific genes. This could be where wizards come from.

There's a material called Naquadah, which is a room-temperature superconductor, and the base for most tech in the galaxy. Perhaps a good wand core once crystallized? In addition to that, the aforementioned Goa'uld cause the blood of their hosts to become infused with this material, even after they're extracted, which allows the ex-host to use technology specifically keyed to Goa'uld, like [[https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Kara_kesh][this thing]].

**** I'm a big Stargate fan but I'm not sure it's that easily compatible with HP magic, since both fictional universes have completely different histories that contradict each other. There can't be two seperate merlins, one being a wizard with actual magic and one an ancient with very advanced technology. And the entire Goauld using technology to pretend to be gods wouldn't work in a society used to having wizards. Also the established physics and magic I'm using for magical tech don't work the same way as wormhole physics from Stargate. HP universe time travel doesn't split timelines, Stargate time travel does, and since time travel is an aspect I'm trying to make as close to the source material as possible introducing a Stargate crossover would cause way too many inconsistencies. Self replicating alien machines are something I considered, although closer to nanobots than Replicators.

***** That's true, and I've been thinking on the histories.

I've gotten as far as this:

The ancients come to Earth sometime in the distant past, I believe the show said something about 10.000 years ago, after atlantis sinks? Anyway, they all either die, ascend, or mix into the nascent human population.

Thus, wizards, and magic. The ancients' teachings are eventually lost, and the newly formed wizards and witches begin researching their abilities and limitations not through the lens of technology, like the ancients had done, but mysticism. Rituals, ceremonies, the like.

They truck along, mingling with muggles for a while, until the Goa'uld come. They invade under Ra, take hosts and slaves. Ra is eventually driven off by the muggles and wizards in their revolt, and the stargate is sealed. However, the Goa'uld begin thinking about the concept of a Hok'tar. Their palaces and pyramids are sealed with the darkest curses known to those sorcerers, perhaps in an attempt to stop them from ever coming back, seeing as their ships used to land there.

From then on, HP canon begins, with none the wiser. the Goa'uld pass into legends, the tombs are open to be curse-broken into, and magic continues to be researched.

I'm not sure what to do about wizard slaves, but they most likely managed to escape being taken as hosts. Though Jaffa are another story.

In any case, it would be pretty interesting to write of magical enclaves on goa'uld worlds, or the different kinds of magic they've discovered there.

Moros eventually descends to take the form of Merlin, both to work on his weapon against the Ori and to study this neat thing they've noticed their descendants have begun doing. He fashions himself into a wizard, and studies with the best of the best, combining ancient knowledge on technology and magic to forge great magics like Apparition, based on wormhole mechanics; Portkeys, based on the science behind ring transporters; The Fidelius Charm, mimicking an Alteran Cloaking device.

He's in stasis, and mortal form, and thus not ascended enough to benefit from the name-worship by wizards and become corrupted by power.

From then on, HP canon happens as well as SG canon. At this point, you can work to merge the two. I would recommend an older, post-Hogwarts Harry for this, even though you'll most likely have to shuffle the timelines a little bit. It'll make the story more readible, especially if you don't make him an asshole or a pervert or something.

Please don't make him an edgy asshole or a pervert.

********* Ah, that's not what I meant when I brought up Stargate! It would simply provide the setting, not throw a bunch of stuff in the characters' laps. Honestly, most crossover fics don't do the advanced races in SG canon justice and have them all do the one thing that's the core of their philosophy. Very strange.

There's tons of interesting ways to achieve spaceflight on their own capabilities, maybe even using some more creative solutions other than "warp drive" or "hyperdrive". Things like using Stars as floopoints, for example, or having their spaceship be a 10 meter sphere/dodecahedron that's internally expanded and flies with the same charm brooms do.

Just giving them tech is dumb and boring, the fun part of crossovers is when both systems are meshed in a creative way.
