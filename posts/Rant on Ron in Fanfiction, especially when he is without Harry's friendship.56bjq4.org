Few days ago, I suggested someone A Shadowed Soul when s/he asked about a Harry/Tonks story. I read the story long ago & enjoyed back to then. Since then my taste in stories definitely has been changed. I can't say whether it's towards good or bad. However, I decided to re-read the story. And I can't say I enjoy the story as I did in the past.

In most fanfictions, especially stories where Ron is without Harry's friendship, Ron tends to a bigoted character like Draco in cannon. Come on, man, have a common sense. Why has Ron to be bashed to hell? To look Draco Malfoy looking better? To Harry being with Hermione? To show how incompetent light families are?

I freely admit, I don't like Ron character in canon too much. In the past, I did like Ron bashing. But nowadays, I can't stand to them. And when I suggest a story which has Ron bashing, I kinda feel guilty.

Just normally thinking, before Harry came to Weasley family: Bill became an excellent role-model to his brother & a warder and curse-breaker. Charlie was a fantastic Quidditch player & became a Dragon specialist. And suppose, at this point, Harry didn't come to Wesley family. Percy would still be an excellent career in ministry. The twins would still have a career as a business man. And why Ron wouldn't have a better career if his all other five brothers can have? Perhaps, he would have been a great wizard chess master if Harry didn't become his friend. Or Perhaps a Quidditch manager. But would he be a bigoted character like A Shadowed Soul or Again and Again represented? Never. If Harry wasn't his friend, he would have followed his brothers' footsteps rather than being a bigoted character. Because he was never brought up that way like Draco Malfoy was.

Edit: Perhaps, Ron would have been close minded at the beginning, say up to second year or third year. But he definitely would grow up while in 7th year or out of Hogwarts. For example, from what we know, James Potter was close minded enough early his Hogwarts days but he did grow up before leaving Hogwarts.


** It depends on how you look at him. You're right in that he has good role models in Bill and Charlie. But the question is would he use that as something to aspire to be or would be be resentful and fearful that he's lost in the shuffle. Percy was on his way to be a prefect, and eventually became Head Boy too. It can go either way and I can see nearly or evil Ron or Super motivated Ron. It just depends on how he uses those things.

**** Really? I'd argue it's his laziness, which is also the main reason i dislike him. I mean, he's in a magic school...literally a school for /magic/ and all he does is complain about homework and try to rope unsuspecting firsties into chess games.

This is also the reason that I support Ron bashing when he isn't friends with Harry. I highly doubt he would ever have befriended Hermione and therefore would have had no one to occasionally kick his ass and force him to actually do something productive with his life.

***** I see your point, and am also really pissed of when characters in HP don't actively try to learn more about magic but to Ron magic is normal, he grew up around it. While this is no excuse seeing as a child isn't allowed to practise magic until eleven and should at least be super excited when they finally get the chance, I would cut him slack cause of the magic-is-normal-for-me thing.

***** His laziness stems from his jealousy and from the fact that no matter what he'd do there isn't really anything he could achieve with his own power that hasn't already been achieved by one of his older brothers. And even if he were to distance himself from all that, even if he were to do something extraordinary at Hogwarts, nobody would care because Harry Potter is nearby and to others that /obviously/ more important than whatever Ron manages to do.

Think of what he saw in the Mirror of Erised, and focus not on the “he has everything” part but rather on the “people are congratulating him” part. Think about the fact that for him, all the magic you are so interested in is just a mundane thing, like normal school stuff for you. Think about how much he shied away when playing Quidditch, just because he was in the spotlight, and look at it through the lens of someone who'd thought himself doomed to never actually amount to anything anyone would any longer care about.

Without Harry around he would have been his own person rather than just an attachment. Sure, he'd still be jealous, and sure, he'd not be the best person ever, but he very likely would be more pleasant to be around of. Maybe not in the first year, or in the second, but given that room to grow that he hasn't with Harry around he really would have been in later years.

The exact story of the founding of their business has never been told, so it wouldn't be that far a stretch to say they wouldn't be able to afford anything with their current money (at that time), and that Harry's money let them make it. Basically what i'm saying, is without Harry they might not have had the money to start it, skills or not.

******* Yes, we do know how much they bet. It's thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, and three Knuts, plus some toy wand or whatever. Point is, while it's undoubtedly not enough to buy a building to use as a store, it's enough money for them to actually get their own supplies to use for creating things, and the kind of stuff they'd managed to make and show people at Hogwarts would be enough of an advertisement for them that they could have simply gotten normal jobs for a year or so whilst selling their products via mail order.

And how is getting money for a project any different from getting money for a bet if it's their own money to begin with? If they earned if or otherwise managed to acquire it for one thing, they would have managed the same for another thing; in fact, had their bet not been with Bagman who was a dirty cheat they would have won and gotten even more money and they made the bet pretty much for the purpose of getting funds for their joke things. Think about it, they had a two-digit Galleon count as fifth (soon to be sixth) years at Hogwarts, barely past their OWLs, and considering how little money the Weasley family in general has it is certain they managed to get that money on their own. They'd only earn more in the future because with them being older they'd have more opportunities.

Really? Arthur's stance towards muggles is at best patronizing and sometimes pretty condescending. I don't see the Weasleys as particularly enlightened in that area. Add to that the blatant bigotry towards anything that has to do with Slytherin and Ron freely admitting to hexing a muggle driving instructor in order to get his licence. Honestly, the whole idea doesn't seem too far off. Purebloods in general don't seem to show even a little bit of motivation to shirk their self-incurred minority.

Bigotry comes in all kinds of forms... this doesn't mean that he'd become "Ron the Death Eater", but he shows many tendencies towards bigoted behavior and even with the positive influence of Hermione and Harry can't seem to shake these traits entirely.

Could I see Ron as a cruel bully towards anyone that doesn't conform to his worldview in school? Absolutely.

That's completely beside the point. I'm not sure about the legalities (the whole wizarding world is insane, so maybe it's legal), but it is certainly extremely unethical. It shows a total lack of regard towards the driving instructor as a *person*... but hey, it's just a muggle right?

As I said, Ron doesn't have a deficiency in driving he just has a different tool set to achieve the same thing.

If you want to talk about the ethics of using magic on muggles, fine, but that has nothing to do with Ron being a bigot. Using magic on muggles is a reality of the wizarding world of Harry Potter. I wonder do you have such strong objections to the Men in Black, or does your objection stem from your clear hatred of Ron Weasley?

It is the reality of the world that sometimes you can't tell people the truth but you need them to act or behave a certain way. You've never lied because you couldn't tell the truth? Because the is essence of what Ron did.

I just re-read the epilogue, because I wasn't sure what he said. Just so that we are both on the same page, his excuse is the super-sensory charm: So I'm supposed to believe, that a person who is too lazy to look in the mirror will suddenly remember to apply a supersensory charm every time he drives (and then understand where he needs to direct his superior sense of awareness)? It's obviously just a rationalization to make him seem less irresponsible (drunk drivers come up with the same kind of shit... "I'll just drive slow and extra special careful!")... not to mention that I'm not so confident when he says that he only failed because of the mirrors. How reliable is a person that would lie to his wife about something like his driving test?

Using the same logic none of the people living in Nazi Germany were bigots, because it was a reality to behave that way towards the jews? Sorry for the Godwin, but you can't be serious. That muggles have a different legal status than wizards is obviously bigoted - and yes, it's something that affects the whole wizarding world (which is why I despise it and the epilogues "All was well").

#+begin_quote

Yes. Messing with people's memories is extremely unethical. You won't be able to trip me up there, sorry. I have huge problems with the obliviate spell and everything else related to the secrecy act - it's way too easy to abuse. IMHO the Obliviation+Confundus combination isn't that far removed from the imperius, and that is supposedly "unforgivable" (at least an Imperius victim still remembers what they were forced to do). Where exactly is the difference if Ron had used an imperius on the instructor to give him his licence? In both cases he violated the free-will of that person. .

Ron basically attacked an innocent person (A confundus sounds like just a less violent way to achieve the effect of bludgeoning someone over the head) who was just doing their job, then went back to his family and friends and chuckled over the whole thing like he didn't just violate another human being.

If we are going to get into the ethics of magic use, then it should be a given that magic should be treated the same as touching. Do you touch people without their consent or knowledge? No, because that is wrong. So why is it okay to mess with their heads? The Muggle not being aware of what happened makes it worse. Is it okay to touch people while they are asleep or otherwise unaware because 'what they don't know can't hurt them'?

To be fair, though, him doing that when practising /might have been/ the reason for him forgetting to look in the mirror, as if that was the case then he would have been used to not having to look in the mirror as the charm would have given him the information he'd get from that. Oh, sure, it might as well have been that he simply forgot because he was lazy or whatever and wasn't planning on using the charm and only came up with it as an excuse, but we don't know for sure.

Heck, we know he would have gotten failed because he did not look in the mirror, but we do not know whether or not that was because something had been there and he did not see or because he actually did have the charm up and as the examiner did not know about that they'd thought that Ron wasn't paying attention and was a danger on the road. It could go both ways, and whilst I am aware that there is some ground for saying that what Ron did there was bad (because he should not have confounded the examiner, at the very least), I will point out that you are really stretching out that line of thought that is basically a /possibility/; maybe he is a bad driver, maybe he is actually a good one but relies on magic, we don't know.

Even during the fight with Harry in GoF, Ron never stopped caring for Harry even though he was angry because otherwise he wouldn't have went down to the common room when Harry didn't return the dormitory.

  I try to ignore shipping because it doesn't really appeal to me. That being said, I think that the Ron/Hermione paring isn't as bad as you people think, at least not in the books. In the books, Hermione isn't perfect. She's smart, knowledgeable and clever, but she's also antisocial, dry and not entirely emotionally stable. She's a deep and well rounded character. Her brilliance is tempered by flaws.

  Remember that time, after Dumbledore's funeral, when Hermione brags about being right about the Half Blood Prince? Harry is busy grieving for Dumbledore, yet Hermione couldn't help but say "I told you so," as though Dumbledore's murder somehow now justifies her petty jealousy over Harry getting better results in potions. I mean, Jesus, being a know-it-all in class isn't a big deal, but Hermione doesn't know how to turn it off. Naturally, that moment is excluded from the films. What the films also ignore are Hermione's anxiety over exams, her panicking under pressure, her bossiness, her self-righteousness, her closed-mindedness and everything else that makes her less than perfect. In the films, Hermione is not a bushy-haired, bucktoothed easily agitated worrywort. No, in the films, Hermione is just fucking perfect. Film Hermione is stunningly beautiful. She never panics. She never gets scared. She never makes mistakes. When Book-Hermione is trapped underground in Gringotts, with goblins closing in on all sides, she panics. Luckily, Harry has the clever idea of escaping on the dragon, and the day is saved. When Film-Hermione is trapped in Gringotts, she doesn't panic, because Film-Hermione is perfect. Film-Hermione has the clever idea of escaping on the dragon. Of course, Film-Hermione isn't scared while riding the dragon, 'cause, unlike Book-Hermione, Film-Hermione isn't scared of heights. Film-Hermione is perfect. When Book-Hermione is trapped in the Devils Snare, with vines closing in on all sides, she panics. Luckily, Book-Ron keeps a clear head and guides her to a solution. When Film-Hermione is trapped in the Devils Snare, she doesn't panic. Film-Hermione handles being under pressure just fine, because Film-Hermione is perfect. Film-Ron is, of course, screaming hysterically like a coward, and it's up to our hero Film-Hermione to save him. This trend continues through the movies. None of Book-Hermione's flaws exist in Film-Hermione, while none of Book-Ron's positives exist in Film-Ron. Nobody is good enough for Film-Hermione, especially not a useless soggy napkin like Film-Ron.

  In the books, all of Hermione's weakness are complimented by Ron's strengths. Hermione can't handle stress, while Ron rarely gets stressed by anything (outside of Quidditch). Hermione is often dull to socialize with, while Ron is always joking around. Hermione is close-minded, while Ron is open-minded. When Hermione disregards Luna as a crackpot, Ron is there to remind her that Luna isn't too bad. When Hermione is overwrought with worry while waiting for her exam results, Ron is there reminding her that she's so brilliant that she'll certainly get Outstanding in every subject. When Hermione is on misguided moral crusade trying to forcefully free House Elves against their will, Ron is the one that sees the big picture and tells her that the elves love working at Hogwarts. Book-Ron and Book-Hermione compliment each other perfectly. They compensate for each other's flaws. To say that they "complete each other" might be a cliche, but I think that's what Rowling was going for. Film-Ron and Film-Hermione don't work together because Film-Hermione has no flaws and Film-Ron has no strengths.

  Also, I don't think Harry and Hermione would make a great couple. Unlike Ron, Harry rarely challenges Hermione on anything. Harry tries too hard to avoid conflict and doesn't call her out when she's doing something silly. Harry is annoyed by Hermione's complaining and worrying, so he pretends to go along with whatever she says even when his internal monologue shows he disagrees with it. Remember when Harry avoided telling Hermione about Umbridge's detention because he didn't want to deal with how she'd react? Or when he avoided confronting her about Crookshanks supposedly killing Scabbers, even though he secretly agreed with Ron? Unlike Harry, Ron doesn't shy away from Hermione's bossy side. I suspect that he and her actually enjoy debating each other. Evidence of this is in OotP; Harry is moody and yells at Ron and Hermione to stop "bickering," but Ron and Hermione are simply surprised that Harry thought they were actually arguing. Another reason I don't think they'd be good together romantically is that Harry doesn't really have fun while alone with Hermione, relatively speaking. When Hermione and Ron are fighting in HBP Harry spends time with each of them. When he's alone with Hermione they just mope in the library while Harry secretly wishes that Ron was there. When Ron leaves in DH, Harry and Hermione are left depressed in each others company; they barely even speak to each other. Remember, that dance scene is only in the movie. In the books, they spend their entire time together moping and crying. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Harry doesn't enjoy Hermione's company. They (platonically) love each other. They're amazingly close friends. They care about each other, they appreciate each other and they'd die for each other. However, you have to admit, they don't exactly hit it off as couple. I doubt Harry or Hermione would be happy if they were together romantically.

  Ron and Hermione work together well. To be perfectly honest, I suspect that some of the Harry/Hermione shippers are guilty of self-inserting. Just because you would love to marry Hermione (or Harry) doesn't mean that they would want to be with each other.

  Ron tends to a bigoted character like Draco in cannon. Come on, man, have a common sense.
#+end_quote

In canon, our heroes are not golden children of light and cheer. They're worryingly violent to others -- petrifying a fellow student for arguing, punching Malfoy, a permanent disfiguring curse for betraying a student club, using Unforgiveables on people. They don't try to reach out to make friendships. They don't deescalate. They don't try to understand others' points of views. They view things in black and white, and the only time anyone backed down was when Hermione put SPEW on the back burner.

(And they have plenty of good times. But then, if we followed Draco's point of view, we'd see him chatting in the common room with Pansy Parkinson and and playing chess with Theodore Nott and having easygoing fun.)

Now take Ron out of that group. Why does he leave? Jealousy? A lack of courage? Either way, he's likely to resent the others. Layer that resentment on top of the base personality, and you've got something dangerous.

Meanwhile, you've got Harry and Hermione together. Hermione has been at the helm of a lot of their violence. Both she and Harry have strong connections to muggle mores, and without Ron around, they have less of a connection to magical ways of life.

How I see this going is: Ron's drifting directionless for a bit and waxing in anger. Hermione and Harry pick a fight with the whole of magical Britain. Ron moves to retaliate. He wouldn't ally himself with known Death Eaters, but if it weren't obvious, he could keep himself from acknowledging it consciously.

*** None of this shows Ron being bigoted though.

You're right in that they're violent to others, but all of the examples that you've given are either Harry or Hermione (though Ron may have punched Malfoy at some point). The jinxed parchment was all Hermione; she didn't tell the boys what it would do, just "it'll make Eloise Midgen's acne look like a couple of cute freckles," and Harry only used the unforgivables under extreme circumstances. If we're talking about Ron, how about when he tries to curse Malfoy by making him vomit slugs, or when he yells at Hermione for going to the Yule Ball with another boy. Most of the time though, he just sulks and/or runs away from the problem; He's the most non-combative of the trio.

And we do get a glimpse of Draco in the Slytherin common room when Harry and Ron take the polyjuice potion in CoS. He makes fun of the Weasleys and Dumbledore for liking muggleborns, unprompted by Harry and Ron.

This war isn't just Harry and Hermione's war, they have Dumbledore and the Order on their side as well. This concerns the whole Wizarding World, especially all the muggleborns.

Ron doesn't want to work for the Ministry, he doesn't have the ambition that Percy has that would cause him to betray his family. The rest of his family fight with the Order, and despite hating being poor, Ron is extremely loyal to his family and would fight with them, even if he isn't friends with Harry or Hermione.

I see it being more of a Sirius and Snape situation, where Harry and Ron dislike each other (probably wouldn't go as far as hate), but they would still fight on the same side.

One thing I've picked up on in subsequent readings is that it's really Ron and Hagrid that put the idea that "all Slytherins are evil" into Harry's head. That's bigoted, or at the least alarmingly judgmental. After that, almost all of Harry's interpretations of Slytherins are pretty much instantly negative.

***** True, but there is a difference between bigotry and prejudice. JKR purposely wrote Ron to be prejudiced and to not question the world he grew up in. However, it is shown that once confronted with examples that contradict his world view, he reevaluates his opinions.

An example is his views of House-elves. Once he sees how the Malfoys, Blacks, and Crouches treat Dobby, Kreacher, and Winky respectively, he realizes that changes must be made, to the point where he suggests evacuating them during the Battle of Hogwarts.

Ron grows up in an exclusively Gryffindor family, and thus has negative prejudices due to the House rivalry and recent wars. During the series, Ron is not confronted with any examples of Slytherins that contradict his views. All he sees is the likes of Malfoy and Parkinson, which are likely a vocal extremist minority. This is a flaw in the portrayal of Slytherins in the series - a whole other argument - rather than a flaw in Ron's character.

****** It can be a flaw in Ron't character as well as a flaw in the portrayal of Slytherins. You know that you can pretty much swap the names and have the same circumstances for Draco Malfoy who (I am only assuming) you probably think is bigoted? Draco's got a serious case of father worship going on and it's clear that a lot of what he says is just him parroting what he's heard at home. This theory is supported by his behavior in books 6 and 7, when he starts to grow up a little and actually sees the clusterfuck of a mess he's stuck in the middle of.

The stories never focused on that character development, but it's there. I just never got the impression that Ron developed that much as a character, despite having a lot more screen time.

Buuut this is all being said fully acknowledging that I may have a bit of bias, as I just don't like Ron as a character that much. He's pretty much built on a lot of traits I dislike in RL (jealousy, pettiness...) So I'm sure my interpretation is a bit skewed.

******* You're right in that Draco is very similar to Ron at the beginning. Both purebloods raised with a certain set of prejudices brought about by their parents. Draco never had any Gryffindor friends to dispel his prejudices; the closest thing was Harry rescuing him in the Room of Requirement.

Draco has a harder time questioning his parents' views than Ron. He must have seen how his family treated Dobby and any other Malfoy House-elves. Did he never question the cruelty? Hermione was consistently referred to as the top of her class; would that not have challenged his views that 'mudbloods' were inferior? Maybe not at first, but Draco had seven years to figure this out.

Draco was happy to join the death eaters, but couldn't do what they asked and yes, he was in the middle of a clusterfuck through no fault of his own. But was it ever established that his views were changing, or just that he couldn't stomach what they were having him do? Premeditated murder isn't easy for most people.

As for me, it's hard to see any eleven-year-old as a bigot, but he was parroting his parents' bigoted views, which doesn't help an outsider's view of your House. I admit I am biased as well, though I like Draco as a character. Probably wouldn't get along with him IRL, but I like jerk characters for, if nothing else, the conflict they provide and the potential for a redemption arc.

***** Saying Ron and Draco are the same is just wrong and hateful. Draco was more hateful and arrogant towards people who he thinks are beneath him than Ron ever was. Yes, Ron was prejudiced against Slytherin but that is because the Slytherins are mostly bigots and despises people based on their blood status. Also the house rivalry is something that happens across the board between all houses. I am really amused about how Ron could influence Harry in his Slytherin prejudice considering how stubborn and independent Harry is shown to be a person. The biggest difference though like others have already said is that Ron is much more open and receptive to other people's ideas as long as they can convince him e.g. the house-elves issue, which is something Draco never learned to do.

He knows the Ministry is controlled by Voldemort, so even if they weren't obvious, he'd have to acknowledge who he's working for.

All the kids at Hogwarts know that he's Harry's best friend, so the second he steps foot in the Ministry or Hogwarts, he would be interrogated for any information.

I could see him being neutral and probably fleeing the country - maybe stay with Charlie? He just decides he's done with it all, and maybe he'll come back after the war's over.

I always sort of imagined it as a child parroting the stuff they heard as a kid. Kids stick to those ideas pretty strongly until they have their own experiences to base things off.

Also: He has great role models like Bill (smart, handsome, with a great and probably well paying job), Charlie (good on a damned boom, seeker for Gryfindoor, gift for handling dangerous animals etc.) and even Percy (Prefect, Headboy and working directly for the ministry (and even the minister!) after finishing school) but he doesn't seem willing to put in the work (come on his dreams in the Mirror of Erised are telling and he doesn't work on any of them!

I always thought that they'd be that horrible couple who clearly should have divorced ages ago, but won't do it because they're both too busy trying to "win" the argument. They're a horribly mismatched pair. Granted, I also would hate Hermione with Harry as well. I think her character would have to mature and grow into a reasonable human being before I could guess who she'd be compatible with. But that's another discussion altogether.

  Well, it's because Ron in canon hasn't much going for him:
#+end_quote

I'd say being willing to die for one's friend is a lot.

#+begin_quote
  There's his friendship with Harry (and Hermione), his prefects badge (which should have either gone to Harry (as he's clearly the male Gryffindor in their year) or Neville because he wasn't all that involved in rule breaking!)
#+end_quote

Harry wasn't suitable for prefect in OotP because he was moody and Neville wasn't because the younger students would have steamrolled him. Is that clear?

#+begin_quote
  and his skill at chess (which sadly doesn't seem to carry over to planing, tactics and logical thinking) Like when he lead the Trio in the Horcrux hunt in DH?

  It's a wounder Hermione is even interested in him IMHO (Hell we have WOG that it was kind of Rowling making her own wish come true, she even said that Hermione/Harry makes more sense over all!)...
#+end_quote

Lol I just kept getting more confirmation that Ron hate is actually fanon Hermione shippers in disguise. Yeah, feelings don't have to be completely logical and certainly she doesn't care what outsiders think. Anyway, maybe the reason is that Ron is the only boy who cared about her personal life at all? Also Rowling only said that “in some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit” not overall; trying reading the interview again.

  Also: He has great role models like Bill (smart, handsome, with a great and probably well paying job), Charlie (good on a damned boom, seeker for Gryfindoor, gift for handling dangerous animals etc.) and even Percy (Prefect, Headboy and working directly for the ministry (and even the minister!) after finishing school) but he doesn't seem willing to put in the work (come on his dreams in the Mirror of Erised are telling and he doesn't work on any of them! He'd rather play chess than do homework or learn etc.)
#+end_quote

Considering how hard Ron actually worked to keep his place on the Quidditch and actually helped the Gryffindor team to win the Cup in OotP by overcoming his nerves and by how hard he actually studied for his OWLs I have no idea where this actually came from. Not everyone can study as hard as Hermione.

At least you acknowledged that Hermione isn't perfect either, good on you for that. Yes, I agree with you here and you just showed how Ron can make Hermione relax and enjoy life a bit more as shown in the books.

Lol are you seriously using that interview to support your argument? If you actually read the interview the question asked was “where you'd like your character to be off to” and NOT how you think the character will end up in their future so it's an entirely subjective question. The interviewer even said in the introduction that they “joked about the characters' future, which goes into dark territory for Ron and Co”. Grint's jokes here actually contradicts the fact Ron is a very extrovert person and he was working in a joke-shop with George. Finally, even if Grint did think the Weasley marriage is a failure without any back-up evidence it doesn't make him right especially considering the overwhelming evidence against this scenario. What makes him any different from any other fan other than the fact he is an actor in a series of random and utterly inconsistent film adoptions that butchered Ron as a character?

Neville would have got his act together (the badge would have shown him that someone is confident that he can handle the responsibility) and Harry is only moody because they treat him like a fucking 3 year old when it's his life that's in danger, so he has a RIGHT to certain information (the prophecy for starters and information the order has - horcruxes etc., too)! Sorry, but in his case I'd have told them to piss of and I would have refused to fight Voldemort!

They are the worst pairing ever IMHO!

3 times? Yeah right, they constantly argued - sure larger "I will not talk to you until you say that you are sorry" kind of fights might not happen every day, but they do happen often enough IMHO :(

He only overcame his nerves at Quidditch because Harry made him see that he was good (the Felix Felicis trick...he later told him he didn't give him the potion) and without Hermione's "help" (I'd call it cheating!)

Yeah and none of this changes the fact that Ron AT THAT TIME was a more suitable candidate than either Harry or Neville and this isn't the last straw man in your post. Neville still didn't show any leadership abilities even a book later in HBP when he already bravely fought in the Department of Mysteries and he was still ostracised by most of his peers. It doesn't matter why Harry was moody, the point is he was moody and he couldn't take prefect responsibility at that time.

Yeah he didn't ask her about her pre-Hogwarts life perhaps because we didn't see their alone time together because of the book's limited POV. I'll post a list of times where Ron cared about Hermione in another post as otherwise this post will be too long.

#+begin_quote

It's called arguing which happens all the time between couples. Are you seriously suggesting couples can never argue or disagree? Oh dear. By the way, Ron and Hermione actually agree on things more than Harry and Hermione as an indicator. Finally just want to point out they had far less arguments with one another in second half of HBP and DH than before, which shows a clear change for the better.

You used a straw man because I was just saying Ron does put lots of efforts into things unlike your impression. Also remember the Quidditch final against Ravenclaw in OotP? Who helped him there? Otherwise I already addressed these point in my other post. I wouldn't do it again.

Well what has this to do with what I said about Ron helping to inject humour into Hermione's life? I guess this is just another straw man. I agree with you here that Hermione is still very far away from Dumbledore or Tom Riddle's cleverness even though the fact that Hermione solved the Basilisk riddle in CoS before Dumbledore took any action cast some doubts on it. Well I agree the Marauders are very clever but maybe Hermione is just too much of a little miss prim and proper to take on the illegal project of becoming an Animagus?

Nope this doesn't have anything to do with the point the movie person is different from book Ron and Grint's random joke shouldn't be taken seriously. Try not to use another straw man. Also Hermione already explained Ron's behaviour in the Triwizard tournament showing he does actually believe the story deep down in his heart but he let his emotion got the better of him and I have already shown in another post even when Ron was angry he never stopped caring. I wouldn't repeat myself again here.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, I agree Harry was a rather ineffective leader at that time and you rebutted your own point about Ron. Too bad Harry could only blame others and not take a long hard look at himself right? It also means it's not really Ron's fault. He left because he was angry at Harry but because of fear. There's a clear difference there which you can't see.

EDIT: It's been 2 months and you have no reply at all to what I said. I am not surprised you have no rational arguments considering it's coming from a delusional militant and hypocritical Ron hater.

******** Let me list the times when Ron showed interest in Hermione's personal life or noticed something about her before Harry did. Here is the list of things and aspects of her life that Ron showed an interest in or worried about:

-Her timetable where she outlined Lockhart's lessons with little hearts

-The reason she took up Muggle studies being a Muggle-born in PoA and her reason for dropping it at the end of the year

-Her overloaded class timetable in PoA (in chapter 6 and 12) which Harry could not be bothered to think about at all

-What classes she already had on first day of school in PoA at lunchtime

-The fact she was missing when she was right behind them after the Potions class in which Hermione helped Neville to brew a shrinking potion and when Ron was angry at Snape on Hermione's behalf (chapter 7 PoA)

-What classes she was having during a day and whether they matched up with her textbooks (chapter 7 PoA)

-The fact she was missing when she was right behind him and Harry when they were going to Charms after Hermione slapped Malfoy for insulting Hagrid

-Her overloaded exam timetable in PoA

-Concern that Malfoy got revenge on her in PoA after she slapped him

-Her reason for going on hunger strike and then eating again in GoF

-Her reason for eating as quickly as possible and whether it is something to do with the house-elf rights campaign in GoF

-Her reason for going to the library even when she received no homework from class in GoF

-Her shrunken teeth in GoF

-Her SPEW badges in GoF

-Who is her Yule Ball date in GoF

-Concern that her enmity with Rita Skeeter will backfire on her

-Her planned skiing trip in OotP

-Her reason for knitting house-elf hats and for putting garbage on top of the hats in OotP

-Her reason for staring pensively out the window in a deserted classroom after learning of Sirius' support for DA and news from Angelina Quidditch is back on(chapter 18 OotP)

-Who she was writing an overlong letter on the last day of school before Christmas in OotP

-To whom she was giving Christmas presents to (Kreacher) in OotP

-His insistence that she should be eat a decent meal before the OWL exams

-How she performed in the Ancient Runes exam OWL

-Interest in Hermione's date with McLaggen in HBP

-Concern that her name appeared on the list of Muggle-borns who did not turn up at Voldemort's Ministry in DH

As a child, we all are close minded enough towards something but most of us also analyze our belief towards it as we grow up. For example, myself. I brought up in a conservative environment. I was told(implicitly) every person who doesn't follow my religion isn't worth to be friends as a child. And now many of my friends, including my idols, are from other religions.

Yeah, this confirmed your biased and delusional hatred of Ron but no surprises here. First of all nobody deserved to be publically insulted in front of the whole school but your clearly have a set of double standards here as you were complaining about far more trivial actions from Ron than this. Lol Cormac should got the spot? What evidence is there to say that Ron wouldn't have made the Qudditich team in HBP if Hermione didn't help him? Even if McLaggen saved that fifth penalty (which is not 100% guaranteed to happen even if Hermione didn't confound him), he and Ron would have saved an equal number of penalties and they would have TIED. Do you understand the meaning of this word? It meant Ron performed at least as equally well as McLaggen and when you see how badly the team performed when McLaggen was playing you should see that Ron deserves to be on the team just because he works much better in the team environment.
