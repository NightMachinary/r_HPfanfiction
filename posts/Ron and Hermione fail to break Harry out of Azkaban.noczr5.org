I dont know where i read this story. Basically Ginny dies in the chamber and Malfoy Senior pulls some strings to throw Harry in Azkaban. Ron and Hermione try to break Harry out but he has already escaped with Sirius. Harry meets up with them and they craft Harry an alternate identity with the help of Dumbledore as Rons cousin from America. Main Villain was Lockhart who was possesed by Diary Riddle. Had Hermione/Ron and Harry/Luna as final pairing i think but am not sure.
