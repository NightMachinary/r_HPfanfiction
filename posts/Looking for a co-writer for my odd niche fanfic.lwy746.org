** Orphanages are inherently abusive and haven't been a thing in Britain for decades. They definitely weren't a thing in 1991. If Harry entered care, he would have been fostered in the first instance. If fostering wasn't possible, he might be placed in a small children's home. That would have at most 10 kids in it. There's no dormitories or sharing bedrooms. The manager of the home (not director) would be someone who trained as a social worker. They wouldn't be a psychologist. It's definitely not a job you do after retirement.

Speaking of retirement, WW2 ended in 1945. VE day was in 1944. If this person worked in the war, they're probably in their 70s or 80s. You can't have an 80 year old running a children's home.

Harry hearing every thought of every person around him would drive him insane. It's not a power, it's a curse.

As another point, to become a psychiatrist in Britain, you don't become a psychologist first. You go to university to study medicine and then specialise in psychiatry.

Likewise, you're not "licenced" as a psychologist in the uk. You might be registered with the governing body, but that's a different thing altogether.

*** +The author may use+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_Children's_Villages_UK][+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_Children's_Villages_UK+]] +instead of the orphanage. It is not truly institutionalized care, but you would get group of orphans together.+ Whoops, there are no SOS Villages in UK. Sorry, about that.

**** No, we wouldn't have anything like that in the uk. It wouldn't meet regulations.

***** It works in many countries of EU (including my Czechia, the organization is originally from Switzerland), it is not like it is done by savages in the Darkest America.

****** It's just not done here. Children in care are placed with foster parents. If that's inappropriate, they'll be placed in a small children's home that's integrated into the community.

It's still institutional care, which isn't good for children.

******* i can't find the paper but i'm pretty sure there Was a state boarding school program for ‘troubled' and/or orphaned children and it was very traumatizing, the paper i read was on the prevalence of emotional abuse and people who developed mental issues as a result of trauma from this program. these schools were usually for ‘troubled' teens. also pretty sure c of e halfway houses existed in the 90s.

question for people in the UK, do ‘boys ranches' and ‘group homes for boys' exist in the UK, bc in america it is somewhat common for instead of juvenile hall (children's prison), boys who have committed a crime but not a major one are sent away to work on a farm.

******** No. There are small group homes, but they're not ranches or anything like that.

There are also specialist homes specifically for girls who are victims of sexual slavery and grooming gangs. They're typically out in the countryside and kept very secret. They're not a punishment, they're therapeutic and secret so that the girl's abusers can't find them.

There are also secure children's homes, but they're usually for children who run away or are victims of a county lines gang. They're not so much a punishment as an unfortunate necessity to keep the kids safe.

Halfway houses are semi independent flats etc for care leavers. There's access to support on site, but the aim is to teach the kids how to be independent.

** orphanages don't exist, as mentioned earlier, and it is quite difficult to remove children from someone's care.

also, where does harry go to school, is he somehow ‘homeschooled' by this psychiatry professor, this man is probably very old considering he was in special forced 50 years before harry came into his care, so he's probably retired. there is an age limit (at least in the US) on how old people can be to foster/adopt a child. so it might be better that this guy is just like... a neighbor of the dursley's and harry spends a lot of time with him.
