It would be preferable for his younger self to know that he's him. Man, that's a mouth full.


** "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus" Is mostly about AU Fem!'Harry' and the sheer absurdity that is her life, but she regularly has tea with "Uncle Death" (who may or may not be Canon!Harry). Warning: This fic is the inception of a fabulous series of AUs and AUs of AUs. If you fall into this black hole, you may never climb out.

"And On" is just a drabble, but it's kind of fun.

I haven't actually read "The Most Powerful Weapon", but it looks promising. AU Harry takes up the DADA post at Hogwarts.

** I've been contemplating for a long time writing a fic where Harry loses so many of his friends that he comes up with this idea to go back in time and pretend to be James on that Halloween night after the real James is killed. He wants to change how time happened and change the war and raises young him like his son and completely takes on the James persona. He would raise little Harry to be independent, smart, cunning, and prepared for what he had to deal with growing up. He would raise Harry not to be so stubborn and set in his ways and would raise him to be a more neutral person. Remus Lupin would help him in the beginning of the story learn as much as he can about his father (because in this AU Lupin is still alive but not many others are). This would happen before the time jump. Harry would wear contacts to hide his eye color (or maybe some type of magic, not sure yet)

I've got cool ideas for it. Writing it on the other hand... that I am struggling with.

*** Writing is fun. The hard part is starting, and even then, that's not as difficult as you'd think.

How would you mask Harry's unfamiliarity with his Father's life? Perhaps Remus as a co-conspirator, who gives Harry the memories of his school days so he can see what James did and can react according to that?

What about the Animagus Form? His patronus is a stag, so no issue there, but Remus in particular probably still runs with his friends even after their school days, and if Harry's animagus form isn't a stag, that's gonna cause issues.

If you plan on having Harry-James "survive" I hope you won't keep to canon like a tick but shake things up a little - don't have Sirius in Jail for instance.

Additionally, how would Harry fake an emotional reaction? James would obviously be extremely distraught and need time to come to terms with it, but Harry's known about and made peace with his parents' deaths for a while. Maybe have him attempt to battle Voldemort, get injured and make Voldemort use a spell other than the Killing Curse and have Lily die in his arms?

**** My thought was to have Remus and Harry pour over Remus's memories of James and all the knowledge they can find for Harry to do this. Driving force for Remus is that Tonks and Teddy were killed by Voldemort and Harry is convinced that he can change everything. Remus is driven by the desperation of wanting family back. The one piece I'm unsure about is does Harry let Remus know once he's gone back in time. Remus might smell the difference and I could write it that way, but I'm still mulling over that. Having past Remus in the know could help Harry immensely.

Animagus form is a tricky one. I don't know a whole lot on them and would probably need to do some digging in that category.

Yeah, I've thought about Sirius a lot. Tricking Sirius would be difficult because James and Sirius are so close. I'm thinking maybe the lie of guilt could trick Sirius for a while and then Harry one day snaps and just tells Sirius that that Halloween night changed him and he's not going to be the same as he was before.

I was thinking that having Harry show up, see the actual James get killed by the killing curse would traumatize him a bit. But knowing Harry, he wouldn't be able to sit still so he would charge in there blindly, even though it wasn't the plan. He would barge in as Voldemort was on way to kill his mother. Then once he's there Voldemort would duel him, “kill” him (aka kill the horcrux) and then turn to kill Lily and the attempt to baby Harry. And then by the time Harry wakes up Lily is dead and he momentarily forgets why he was there and is sobbing over Lily because he's never seen her in person and he stupidly thought maybe he could save her in a blind fit of rage. I think that would be enough to really make people think he is James and he could state grief and magical exhaustion on anything else.

These are great questions! Helps me think through it more!

***** You'd need some canon refactoring, then - James was 20 by the time he died, and the second war ended when Harry was 17. Not a very big difference, but close friends would be able to tell if their friend is younger than they remember him being. I'd say 19 is the bare minimum, but 21 or 22 would give you a little bit more room to play around with canon.

In this version of events, the horcrux hunt obviously has to either fail or not begin at all, I think the best point for this would be if the gringotts heist went wrong and ended with either Ron or Hermione's death/maiming at the hands of the goblins.

This, then causes issues, and with all three missing from the battle of Hogwarts it is soundly lost to the Death Eaters, or doesn't happen at all - Voldemort was only there because of Harry, after all.

In any case, Voldemort fully entrenches the Ministry and begins hunting down the Order of the Phoenix, and the dark ministry is in charge of exterminating muggleborns, half-bloods and muggles.

A good setup would be something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Remus and Harry stand in an abandoned safehouse. Every compatriot of theirs disappeared, gone into hiding or dead. Lord Voldemort has all but won, and even now swarms of dark wizards are scouring the countryside for remants of resistance.

  Both swear a solemn vow to avenge their friends, to make things right.

  The Headmaster's pensieve, pilfered during a raid that cost many their lives, allows Remus to extract and alter the memories of his school days, making them appear from Jame's point of view instead of his own. Harry views and internalizes them.

  Remus uses a transfiguration trick invented by James, which makes a transfiguration resistant to reversal unless one knows the counter, to make Harry's face into that of his dead friend. Harry's eyes have darkened as of late, an eerie red leaking through the horcrux mingling with his native green and turning them into James' brown. (This is mostly poetic justice, Red and Green are complementary colors that mix into brown; Tom Riddle's red with Harry's green)

  They recovered a spell from the Headmaster's private library, in a secret compartment and containing a letter from Dumbledore, addressing himself, attempting to talk his future self out of what he knows he will want to do. The spell draws upon a blood connection of the caster, and tears them through time and space toward the instant their life ended. (you can guess why dumbledore had the spell and didn't destroy it - Ariana) Essentially, it's a trapped situation like the resurrection stone, an attempt at true revival, but it failed spectacularily. Death cannot be reversed, and the spell places you at the instant the light left their eyes, forever stranded there. Another problem of the spell is its power requirement - it would weaken you so much that you would likely die on arrival, or be reduced into a coma.

  (At this point, you could exposition a bit about Voldemort's cunning plan to wipe out the muggles via turning their atom bombs upon one another, and installing enchantments upon major wizarding areas to ward off radiation, heat and fallout, and then repopulate a cleansed earth, and have one of the two heroes have the epiphany of using one of these detonations as a power source. would make for a cool scene)
