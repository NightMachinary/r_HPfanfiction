Hi all. Does anyone know of any stories in which strangers designate Harry as guardian of their kid(s) in their will? And then die....and then Harry, who is preferably an adult (but beggars can't be choosers!), actually agrees to be guardian to the child(ren)? Thanks!


** I remember a story in which Vernon and Petunia conceived a child that was due when Harry was a 6th or 7th year. Petunia dies from labor complications and Harry is there, realized its a magical baby, and takes the child to raise her as his own.

Personally never finished it since it felt really dated but I think I'll go back and give it another shot. Really in the mood for any father Harry fics these days.

  A Christmas visit to Harry's relatives set in motion a number of changes in his life... fatherhood being the largest. Eventually Harry and Daphne Greengrass.

** I actually had a story EXACTLY like that. Sixteen year old Harry is the legal guardian of a first year Gryffindor. I don't think I ever posted it and fairly sure it got Wasted when my desktop got shot.

Edit: I also have a plotfetus of Harry opening an orphanage after the war and a majority of them were the children of Death Eaters who hated him.

** Can't remember the name, but read a short story once where Harry was a guardian of a first year girl while he was at 7th year after defeating Voldemort. There probably was some raw among Harry, Hermione & Ron. Hermione & Ginny started rumor about Harry having a relation with the first-year not knowing that Harry's her guardian. It was probably Harry/one of Patil sisters & published before DH.

** Haha oh man this was one of the first fanfics I ever read... Birthday Surprises by LollyPhoenix: Linkffn(1515678)- have at it! Harry receives triplets for his b-day from the headmaster with no real explanation except to please take care of them. Where are they from and why should he be their caretaker? Pro: it's complete!

  Harry receives a rather unusual 17th birthday present from the Headmaster. A present that changes anything and everything.
