Looking for fanfics where after Harry and Cedric touch the Triwizard Cup, they end up in another world or travel through time, rather than the Graveyard. I've read a few OK ones, does anyone have any they think are good they could link? Edit: As long as they both survive and make it to another world, and they don't return to Hogwarts until they've spent some time in this world really

** Wow okay, I too will be interested in this subject. What would the premise be though? That Crouch Jr is addled from long-term Azkaban + Imperious and screwed it up?

*** I'd imagine that the Portkey Dumbledore put on the cup, to bring it back to the judges' table, didn't interact well with Barty's portkey to take it to the Little Hangleton Graveyard.

** I'll add some later, I've read two good ones, one where Fem Harry is in Essos with Cedric and attracts the attention of Viserys Targaryen, and a Middle Earth one where Cedric becomes a Muggle as Harry kinda absorbs his magic into himself.

  "We'll take it together." The Triwizard cup pulled them away from Hogwarts, and they fell through a hole in time and space. In which Harry and Cedric are lost in Pentos, pretending to be siblings. Harry pokes a sleeping dragon, and Cedric despairs over his 'little sister' playing with fire. Fem!Harry/Viserys. [Because I made the mistake of reading Tsume Yuki's wishlist.]

  Escaping from the graveyard with Cedric's body proved more difficult than Harry would have thought. Because of mysterious circumstances, Harry and an ALIVE Cedric Diggory are now trapped in Middle-Earth until they can find magics strong enough to send them back. The true question though: When they return, will things still be the same between them and the Wizarding World at large?
