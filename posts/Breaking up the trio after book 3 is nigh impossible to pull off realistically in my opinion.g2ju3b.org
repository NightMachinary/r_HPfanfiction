Emotionally speaking, i find it difficult to make a realistic break between these characters. I'm not really speaking of physical barriers like moving to a new school or one of them dying. I've read stories where Harry breaks from Ron and Hermione and it's usually pretty bad. A Harry who breaks ties with Ron or Hermione only ever makes him look callous. I've seen many writers treat this friendship like the average school friendship and it is *really* not that. They have risked life and limb for each other and none of the stories I've read, in which they are no longer friends, have ever given that proper weight.


** I respectfully disagree, it's exactly AFTER the three first books that it becomes far easier to pull it off. /Especially/ the fourth book, there's a reason many fics use that as a starting point.

In the first three years, apart from the whole fiasco with the Heir of Slytherin, their friendship wasn't really challenged other than through external pressure(they both knew it wasn't Harry).

On 4th year we /canonically/ have Ron shunning and ignoring Harry and not believing him despite repeated evidence that he doesn't care for fame, doesn't need money and had no opportunity to enter himself.

Yes, people overplay Ron being jealous, disrespectful and petty, but canonically there's a basis for that.

And then /canonically/ it gets worse, to the point many think Rowling went a bit OOC with her characters, we have Hermione being envious in 6th year, Ron abandoning them in DH and many minor occurrences were they both are less than stellar friends, I also fail to remember a time when it was /Harry/ who shunned or abandoned any of them in the books.

Honestly, emotionally speaking, yes, they were friends, but the dynamics were always weird, with Harry being the mediator between the other two, and the only reason he did not expand was that he was emotionally stunted and didn't know how. Had he made an effort, he could probably get more than a few true friends, some of which wouldn't give a rat's ass about the limitations imposed in 5th year, and perhaps would have explained stuff better for Harry.

And lastly, if anyone looks callous in that trio, it's not Harry, I don't think I would have blamed him for cutting off things with Ron in 4th year after the boy practically turned on him over a school version of death game. Hermione butting over everything, many times disregarding other's opinions and then getting mad because Harry was doing better than her is not good too.

So no, the "Golden Trio" is /far,far/ from being unbreakable, /especially/ after third year.

That's why I like Slytherin!Harry story, it opens up opportunities canon simply doesn't have.

*** The Golden Trio were all emotionally stunted. Harry, for his upbringing. Hermione, for how she was treated in school. Ron? Uhhhhhh.... Being the last male child of a poor family? Wow, that sounds infinitely more petty now that I'm typing it out.

Hell, Harry wasn't emotionally stunted /enough/. Seriously, between being shoved under stairs, the harry hunting, emotional abuse, and being worked like a slave? He should be an Obscurial /at the least/, and.... Is there such a thing as an ascended Obscurial?

**** I don't think Ron was emotionally stunted, that was just his personality, he could socialize, he just didn't care to. Yes, he wasn't a social butterfly, but he had no problems fitting in.

Harry was clueless on how to make friends, and Hermione was almost as bad. You can see that many of Harry's relationships are because of other people's connections.

IIRC Hermione only marginally talked with the other girls in the school, she didn't have any other close friends.

***** In my opinion, Harry and Hermione were better as a duo, rather than having the trio. If you remember, in fourth year she canonically continued to help him with the tasks. Throughout the series she is much more of a friend then Ron was many times over. Now I'm not praising her for being perfect- I know she had some obvious character flaws. However, it just seems skipped over that Ron indirectly placed Hermione in mortal danger in first year, because if Harry didn't insist they had to help while just wanted to get authority, its very possible she could've died before help arrived. This is, in my opinion, extremely pivotal because both Rowling and the characters treat it as an accident, that Ron and Harry saved her. However, is it really the pair saving her? Or was it just Harry's insistence that saved Hermione, which was indirectly caused by Ron's insensitivity? This is why I think perhaps Harry and Hermione would've been better with someone else, or just a duo. Also coincidentally, after reading Blindness by AngelaStarCat, I need more Harry/ Hermione. Recommendations very much appreciated.

Ok Time to defend Ron's character.

In this scene, Ron made an insensible, though true, comment to Harry : " /It's no wonder no one can stand her, she's a nightmare, honestly/ ". And Hermione happened to hear this comment, which made her cry all day in the bathroom.Seriously, school start in September 1st and this scene happened on October 31, Hermione knew that she had no friend and probably heard comment like this quite a lot (expecially considering how annoying she could be, like commenting on Ron's attempts and his pronunciation even though he didn't ask to be helped and didn't want to).I also want to point that Harry's only comment when Hermione passed them was "/I think she heard you/". He didn't try to defend Hermione because he agred with Ron.If Ron is responsible for "putting Hermione's into danger", then so are all the kids who said the same comments, the teacher who didn't look after her when she was missing, oh and Voldemort for letting a troll loose in the school.

​

#+begin_quote
  because if Harry didn't insist they had to help while just wanted to get authority
#+end_quote

. . . here's the scene :

/Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm."I've just thought -- Hermione.""What about her?""She doesn't know about the troll."Ron bit his lip."Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us."/

So ok you can give one cookie point to Harry (or the scenario) for thinking about Hermione. But Ron didn't need any convincing once he understood what Harry said, and especially didn't want to go to authorities. It's probably also important to point that either Harry or Ron going alone would have probably ended up with 2 dead students so yeah they *both* saved Hermione.

​

Finally, I will just say that all the heroes had falling out at one moment or another (both Ron and Harry were crossed with Hermione in PoA and while the case of Harry could be argued since the broom was sent by Sirius Black, Ron was 100% justified in his anger and "the Ran was an Animagus" does not justify how Hermione acted with Scabbers), Harry and Ron always had to pay for their mistakes (saying they are sorry and everything) while Hermione just cry a little and it's also Harry and Ron who have to say they are sorry.And for the "duo", not only do I think about at least 5 instances where Harry would have died if not for Ron, but in GoF, Harry does say that hanging out with Hermione is a little boring since it mean library, library and . . . library.

And man do I wish people mentionned more Ron's good moment to analyse his character, like following spiders with Harry in the Forbidden Forest until a den of Acromantulas even though his worst fear, or standing with a broken leg in front of a thought Death Eater saying he would have to kill him first to hurt Harry.

******* Here's the thing though: even if everything you said is true (which I don't think it is, but I won't argue about it) Ron's moments were mediocre at best before book 4, but he had no good moments after book 3. He didnt grow, he just got eternally stuck as a jealous petty lazy asshole who caused more issues than helped and gets handed things on a silver platter.

Seriously, the way the Durselys treated him? Unless what happened to Adriana Dumbledore was a continuous thing, her experience would be a cakewalk. "Oh no, the muggles bullied and attacked me ONCE! Woe is me!"

Meanwhile, Harry is continuously hunted down and beat up, starved, shoved in a cupboard, punished whenever the stuff happens and called a freak.

There's no way Europe would have survived.

Yeah, a lot of it isn't that great, but I want to talk about this thing and explain what I mean in more detail. Feel free to just ignore me.

Also, thanks for the rec, much appreaciated.

The Obscurial, and by extension the Obscurus, were introduced in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

Wiki link [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Obscurial][here]].

An Obscurial is a wizard that actively represses their magic, usually because their alienated or hated because of their magic. When Newt Scamander explains it he mentions the Witch Trials.

#+begin_quote
  "/Before wizards went underground, when we were still being hunted by muggles, young wizards and witches sometimes tried to suppress their magic to avoid persecution. So instead of learning to harness or to control their powers, they developed what was called an Obscurus./"
#+end_quote

The [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Obscurus][Obscurus]] itself is what I'm interested in, at least in this discussion.

Quote:

#+begin_quote
  ...an Obscurus is created when the child in question consciously attempts to repress their magical abilities or were forced to do so through physical or psychological abuse. This energy can manifest itself as a separate entity that can erupt in violent, destructive fury.
#+end_quote

A word that comes up a few times in these posts is "Parasitic". This, combined with the line "can manifest itself as a separate entity" leads my mind to create a fic wherein Harry, when he attempts to be "Normal" and suppress his "Freakishness", creates an Obscurus. The Obscurus, in turn, is a totally separate entity that can grant Harry considerable power ("Destructive Fury"), but he has to learn to co-exist with the thing to do that.

To my understanding, it was heavily implied that she was raped, so that seems like enough of a reason. Even if that didn't happen, it was indicated that what they did to her was far worse than bullying.

******* It was stated "boys" which ranges from her age to teenagers. Would a group of teenagers do that to a six/seven year old? Singular person, maybe. But a group? Way back then, finding a group willing to do that would be almost impossible to find outside of cities. I'm not saying that's not what JKR wrote, but I'm looking at it realistically. This was what, 1892? Yeah, population density alone makes it highly unlikely.

I always chalked Daddy Dumbledore attacking them out of a form of racism/rage. Now that Obscurials are a thing, that could be the reason too.

Edit: After some googling, I could be wrong. The statistics are for cities though, so I don't know. But I do know in those fringe villages people would be hanged for stuff like that. The "group" part sticks out to me.

However, he was never raped, and was never beaten to the point of nearly dying.

My point is to not compare abuse.

If anything it's a byproduct of his lack of friends and the interactions that come with them. It was his isolation coming to the forefront. And even though Ron missed Harry, that's not justification for his previous actions. Sure Harry forgave him, but he was in no way obligated to.

And if you're gonna use past action as justification, everyone has to be held to the same standard. Harry saved Ginny in the chamber and was the reason Arthur survived being attack by Nagini. Yet Ron still left in fourth year and during the horcrux hunt. Why does Harry have to be beholden for help in the past when Ron so obviously isn't?

Hermione is a trickier subject, but you're also glossing over the fact that in the fanfics you're talking about, it's not just her actions in the cannon. Authors use them as a base, sure, but they also radicalize her character and make her a control freak and a terrible friend in her own right. Friendships have breaking points and people shouldn't blindly put up with abuse or poor treatment because it wasn't there before or because they put up with it in the past. Thinking in that direction, you could say Harry would be callous not to accept the Dursleys in his life, which obviously isn't true.

Ron and Harry had a falling out, almost every teenager has falling out with their friends over something stupid that they get over eventually. And don't forget that Ron was dealing with massive insecurity issues due to being the youngest boy with several successful older brothers, and he was best friends to a celebrity. They had a little argument, they were both too stubborn to try and work it through, it was only after almost seeing Harry die that Ron realised what a prat he was being and made the first move to fix their friendship.

And the Horcrux hunt, the Horcrux literally is described as bringing all your negative emotions and feelings to the surface. Ron was under the influence of dark magic that amplified the frustration he was feeling and brought out latent feeling of jealousy and insecurity that he had most likely worked through. And don't forget, Ron says that immediately after he left and was away from the Horcruxes influences he wanted to return immediately, the only reason he couldn't was that he immediately ran into Snatchers, and by the time he got away and tried to return, Harry and Hermione had already moved on.

In the horcrux hunt, Ron instantly felt bad, and he may have been pushed by the horcrux into leaving, but he still left. That was his choice, even despite the influences. Hermione didn't leave. Harry had to keep going. And they were dealing with the same problems Ron was. Can it be forgiven? Sure it can.

Yet Ron still left in fourth year and during the horcrux hunt. *Why does Harry have to be beholden for help in the past when Ron so obviously isn't?*
#+end_quote

Harry is not obligated, or beholden as you say, to do anything for Ron. That's what makes this friendship so special. They never use past failures or sacrifices against each other. They are there because they want to be there.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is a trickier subject, but you're also glossing over the fact that in the fanfics you're talking about, it's not just her actions in the cannon. Authors use them as a base, sure, but they also radicalize her character and make her a control freak and a terrible friend in her own right. Friendships have breaking points and people shouldn't blindly put up with abuse or poor treatment because it wasn't there before or because they put up with it in the past. Thinking in that direction, you could say Harry would be callous not to accept the Dursleys in his life, which obviously isn't true.
#+end_quote

For your point about Hermione being radicalized, that's why I said "realistically" in the OP. Without it the main character, usually Harry, looks sociopathic. To your point about the Dursley's, it's not even in the same ballpark. Ron and Hermione are great friends and the Dursley's never did a minuscule as much for Harry as they did.

****** For all you're saying, you've twisted the argument from "Harry's callous if he lets a friendship go" to "the friendships are special because he stuck with them anyways". They're not even close to being the same thing. I'm not going to get into a debate about the value of their friendships and how "special" they are. That's all opinion and I'm more than happy to let you have yours. But Harry giving up friends who abandon him first, or friends who abuse the friendship, is not callous. That was your argument when this started and it's just plain wrong. You might not like it, as is your right, but don't let that cloud your objective judgement.

And if your problem is the characters being warped into something different than the cannon, blame the author for deviating too much or the fiction for not being something you enjoy. But don't use that as an excuse to make a blanket statement about a character that is responding to the different situations in a given fic.

And again for Hermione, past action doesn't automatically make up for future abuse or mistreatment. You're letting your opinion about how special the friendship is, your reliance on cannon material, as well as your beholden argument (that you acknowledged was wrong for Ron, but then went and used for Hermione anyways), to justify it. Mistreatment is mistreatment. That's just a fact, and that mistreatment makes it's completely fair to compare her actions in some fics to the Dursleys. From there, you yourself acknowledge people aren't obligated to forgive abuse because of passed action, which means it's up to Harry whether or not he forgives her and it doesn't necessarily mean he's being callous if he let's the friendship die.

Edit: And I will clarify that you're right at times. A lot of fics make harry callous for abandoning his friends over something minor. But using those examples to judge him every time it happens is no bueno. Every fic has to be looked at individually and taken as it is, not just what you want it to be because of cannon. That's the entire point of fanfiction after all, taking a great story and adding your own twists to make something new. Like what you want, but don't assume the fic or what's in it is bad just because it's not what you prefer.

  And lastly, if anyone looks callous in that trio, it's not Harry, I don't think I would have blamed him for cutting off things with Ron in 4th year after the boy practically turned on him over a school version of death game.

From a fanfic perspective, if the trio breaks up, it's /usually/ due to Harry being an asshole.

That's not the only way to do it, but the shortcut most people take makes Harry /definitely/ the callous one, either through overreacting or through making a caricature of the others.

I can definitely see one where the friendship ends, but it is not exactly easy to do in a way that feels good & natural after book 3. The easiest point to change it would obviously be book 1, before they even really start being friends.

**** It depends on the portrayal of the trio, what I see mostly is Harry getting fed up with Ron ignoring and shunning him and branching out, finding other friends, sometimes friends that don't mix well with Ron, it ends up with Harry not feeling the need to reconnecting(since he was the injured party) and when/if Ron comes back they end up not being as close. I find that realistic given the situation.

> That's not the only way to do it, but the shortcut most people take makes Harry /definitely/ the callous one, either through overreacting or through making a caricature of the others.

We must be reading different fics, for me it's either Harry just finding friends he ends up being closer to while Ron ignores him, or Ron and/or Hermione doing something especially bad and Harry just cutting relations.

I don't see how people put that much stock about their friendship, it only stayed that way because Harry and Hermione where incapable of branching out due to having poor social skills and because Ron wasn't that able to form strong connections to anyone else.

> I can definitely see one where the friendship ends, but it is not exactly easy to do in a way that feels good & natural after book 3. The easiest point to change it would obviously be book 1, before they even really start being friends.

I don't see a friendship end feeling good, it could actually be quite sad.

I agree the easiest point being before it began, since they met purely by circumstance(unless you are in one of those AU where Dumbledore calculated everything so the Weasleys would meet Harry and Ron was directed towards him, where everything could be ruined if Draco wasn't a little asshole by 11 and actually befriended Harry properly making Ron the asshole in Harry's eyes)

As a side note, I find it quite funny the work Rowling put in the first book to absolutely prejudice Harry against Slytherin. Without any of it, it's reasonable to assume canon Harry would have chosen Slytherin merely by the Hat's suggestion.

And his mother could be an easy way to stop that dead in the tracks with her canon actions. Especially considering that she told Harry that she was worried about him to the point where she considered getting him away from the Dursleys (not checking up on him, removing him). And after that, she does nothing more than send some token food rather than inform the authorities about the blatant child abuse taking place under her nose. It would be very easy to have that destroy the relationship between Harry and the Weasleys if you would depict the effects the Dursleys had on him more realistically. Giving false hope to an abused child is a quick way to be burned.

Not to mention her utterly braindead attitude towards Harry's involvement with the Order at the Start of OotP. Other than Dumbledore, Harry has to be the one who has faced Voldemort the most out of everyone alive. He just went through a gladiatorial tournament which ended in the murder of an acquaintance. And she, with no combat experience under her belt (she was not in the Order the first time around), goes around with her condescending, reality-denying attitude and starts to insult Harry's last bit of family.

Perhaps there were a few periods when Petunia was nicer to little Harry, only to become mean again. So now, intellectually Harry knows Ron's his friend - he almost got adopted in his family. He knows that that Ron regrets what he did. Nevertheless, Harry could very well have this irrational fear that Ron will shun him again the next time something comes up - just like Petunia's niceness didn't last. He would constantly be waiting for the other shoe to drop and break his friendship again.

******* [[https://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=97181][This essay]] does a good job of dispelling quite a few of the notions about the fight that have been spread for years. It was not an "abandonment" by Ron, it was a simple fight between best friends.

** I've seen some examples people mentioned so I'll avoid those but they're also just teenagers. A complete break may be hard but I don't think it's impossible to see some distancing that comes close to breaking apart. I think Rowling does well not letting age do that in the books but I think their age could do that in a fanfic if written right.

** Its extremely easy to separate harry from ron in book 4. And book 7, for that matter.

Likewise it would be easy to do so for both ron and hermione at the beginning of book 5. Hey I know let's completely ignore our supposed best friend immediately after he was traumatized by seeing another friend be murdered right before his eyes, with the man who murdered his parents and has repeatedly tried to murder him regaining a body immediately afterwards. That sounds like a good idea, right? It must be, because Dumbledore said so!

Honestly, I get the part with the Dursleys is because of the plot, but THIS one specifically lends credence to all those Evil!Dumbledore stories, I would certainly be mad enough to tell him to deal with Voldemort alone and fuck off to Beauxbatons or something.

** Disagree.

Exactly because of what they went through they became close, as such they haven't had to improve themselves as people, they've grown through age but not much else. What I mean by this is Hermione never stops being the unlikeable, insufferable know-it-all from the first book. Harry and Ron just accept that after the troll. Through the books there are plenty of times Hermione is a horrid person but she's their friend so it doesn't matter. Old tensions/issues haven't gone away they're just less important. A good author could easily play to that and separate off Hermione especially after third year. They aren't really forced to face the consequences of their actions and say wow I'm a bit of a dick, best work on that.

Ron is the normal person in the trio. Harry is a hero/icon/whatever you want to call him. Hermione is very clever and intense, Ron is just a boy who looks out for his friend and doesn't really know what he wants from life. If you play up to Harry the hero, have him accept the mantle of the boy-who-lived. In the books he largely rejects what it means to others but you could easily see him not wanting to disappoint them and as shit gets more serious so does he. The more Harry moves away from being a person and more towards an idea, the less space for Ron in his life. In a lot of ways Ron keeps Harry sane and human. There is scope for Harry to try to be better than that, he must be, he's the boy-who-lived, people need him to be better.

** I agree with you. The trio has been through a lot of life and death situations together, and it seems unreasonable for Harry especially to give up on their friendships.

People who disagree with this I feel have assigned fanon feelings to the canon actions of characters over time.

Ron is a good person and a good friend, and every time he makes a big mistake (Goblet of Fire, Deathly Hallows) there are extenuating circumstances and more importantly, *he immediately regrets his actions*. In the case of Goblet of Fire, he's too jealous and stubborn to make up, but still indirectly helps Harry. In Deathly Hallows, he was in a high stress situation while wearing a piece of Voldemort, and a minute after taking it off would have come back if not for the Snatchers.

Hermione's two big things that make people on this sub make her out to be “the worst” are her actions in book three and book six. Book six can generally be excluded from these kind of discussions as nearly every character in the book acts OOC or just plain stupid. For the sake of argument, her jealousy and annoyance with the HBP's potion textbook stems not from Harry doing better than her - just look at how she treats him doing better in DADA, she doesn't care that he does better there. She's annoyed because Harry is getting better marks and pretending that it's because he's good at potions, rather than because he's got the HBP's notes. She views it as dishonest, and instead of working to understand the theory of /why/ potions work, he's just piggybacking off the HBP's work. Did she overreact? Sure. But she's not a bad person over it.

Book three is a lot more complicated, in that she kept making choices that would affect her friends without taking their views and feelings into account. She let Crookshanks wander the common room - like it is implied that all other pets did - even when he kept going after Wormtail. This was a thoughtless thing to do and out of character for her, and I feel was only done to facilitate Wormtail faking his own death (again). The Firebolt fiasco had fault on both sides: on the one hand, Hermione absolutely should have at the very least told Harry that she was going to tell McGonagall about it. On the other hand, Ron and Harry were absolute twats about Hermione /literally trying to make sure he doesn't get cursed/. At that point they thought Sirius was trying to kill Harry and had successfully broken into the castle at least once.

I kind of got of track, but anyway if the divergent point for your fic is fourth year, it doesn't make sense for Harry to willingly say “well fuck you, first and best friends I've ever had”. You'd have to make Ron and Hermione less involved in Harry's adventures much earlier or it just seems silly and/or OOC.

*** I've never even suspected that Hermione was blamed (by readers) for a cat/rat accident until I got on Reddit. For god's sake, Crookshanks is a cat! A predator! If Ron was so worried, it was him who should have put Scabbers into a cage or used some spells to protect him. Coming from someone who had two cats and a rat. That's how animals work - you put a fish in a tank, hamster/mouse/rat/parrot in a cage to keep them from harm, not monitor your cat/dog/ferret every minute of a day. It's clear that all familiars roam Hogwarts freely. Plus the fact that cats are actually allowed as pets and rats aren't. Was Hermione insensitive about Scabbers' ‘death'? Yes, she was. Was she in any way guilty in it? No.

But agree that with Firebolt issue they were all faulty. And agree that HBP made everyone so unpleasant and unlikeable, that it's better to exclude it from discussions like this.

I didn't get this before I was on Reddit either, but it does make sense. It's just the fact that the movies hate Ron that makes it confusing. Yeah, they were a rat and a cat, and if Crookshanks was a normal cat and Scabbers was a normal rat, he probably would have eaten him. Hermione's fault was not the eating bit, it was the fact that she refused to apologise. If someone came with their dog and ate my cat, which sure, I didn't like that much and then refused to apologise, I would be pissed. Like what the fuck! It's happened, but you can't even take responsibility for it! That's the part that was bad. And then JKR made it so RON went crawling back to Hermione when the Buckbeak appeal was happening. That just conteracts the whole point! Stop me before I go on a rant about her writing...

** I can see the trio breaking up relatively easy, but think Harry would always remain friends with both. Harry doesn't have it in him to hold a grudge. He even asked Voldemort to think and try for remorse, essentially giving him one last chance after all the shit he had done.

So I don't think a breaking up of the trio would end in the trio hating eachother. But he could have easily made other friends during 4th and 6th year.

** I mostly agree that having the friendship break up post book 3 is difficult to realistically portray in fiction, though it is doable.

To me, the deeper line in the sand is post book 5. To have Harry shun his friends after they sacrifice life and limb to help him rescue Sirius against adults with superior skills, and in the process both become seriously injured, is just not realistic. I've read several stories that try this, and unless they go full Weasley bashing, Harry comes off like a whiny edge lord.

As a side note, it always amuses me the people that latch onto what Ron did in GoF as some Judas-like act. It was a 14 year old kid jealous of his buddy, who lashed out for a short time. Not saying he was in the right, but come on man, I'm still young enough to remember high school, and the amount of terrible decisions kids at that age make, with hormones pumping through their body and with brains not fully developed, is truly mind blowing.

** For it's easy to see them broken up post third book. As people have mentioned Ron was jealous about Harry entering the tournament. If Harry branches out to new friends then you can have him grow away from Ron even if Ron apologies. If you want to when Ron and Harry argue and Harry brings up why he(Harry) had to be the one who saved Ginny? He could mention how come any of the Wesley brothers noticed something was wrong? I believe the twins thought she was only home sick. You basically make the initial argument stronger. Now would be the time to expand his friend circle both inside Gryffindor and out. Initially Hufflepuff is out do the supporting Cedric but after warning him Hufflepuff students could start to be friendly with him. Let's say Cedric and Cho become friends with him if in this story they dated before Yule ball. Maybe make friends with his years Hufflepuff students.(potentially changes Arthur for Amelia) if you're following cannon for the dementor attack. Seeing Harry spread out his friends would Ron feel marginalized by Harry? Instead of being Harry's best friend he's just another friend. Is it cannon for Ron feeling marginalized by being a sixth son and not seemingly as driven as any of his brothers or a girl like his sister? Ifcso would that change his choice of how to apologize and if he would? Have Ron's jealousy get the better of him.

For Hermione during the spat between Ron and Harry would she know how to handle it? Would she see helping the one as the betrayal of the other? She may think it'll blow over and just keeping her head down. Her not supporting either side could lead to both sides being angry at her. How will things look if it took Ron longer to apologize? Just have Hermione overthink it and delay making a choice tell it's to late. Who actually would Hermione side with and would she be fine not going back to the way things were?

That's just trying to stay in cannon. Since it's a fanfic you could have someone mention that Harry's can't was a life or rich. Basically you though they only left you a trust vault? Hermione wouldn't have known and the Weasley family and Sirius could have assumed Dumbledore told him.(Dumbledore could just wanted Harry save at the Dursleys and not wanting the Dursleys able to take Harry's money to moustache twirling evil) Have someone in the new friend group about the first meeting with the Wesley's. Have Harry question if it was the Weasleys being the Weasley family or a setup. Have them question why nothing happened publicly about the first 3 years except for the convenient thing about Snape lying to the minister as Dumbledore would have known what happened when they where at school. Basically have Dumbledore playing things to close to his chest backfire. It's a good story point good Dumbledore or bad.(might be interesting if it's all just Dumbledore not being able to get things through the political system)
