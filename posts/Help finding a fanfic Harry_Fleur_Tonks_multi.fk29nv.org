Looking for a fanfic similar to the description below. thnx.

Story: Harry is doing potions homework when he stumbles upon a medical potions textbook which has a chapter title similar to the potion he is working on. What catches his attention though is a potion mentioned within which is designed to reverse the stunted growth, poor eye-sight or bone deformities caused by malnutrition.

Now that he reads through the description of this potion and sees what it could potentially do he's suddenly all for making up any lost stature thanks to the Dursley's preference for keeping him on a starvation-diet when growing up and withholding food as a punishment.

It's complicated enough that it will take him a whole month to go through all the steps and stages but simple enough in that almost all the ingredients are in his potions kit and what isn't he could Owl-order with the galleons he's got. However Harry had planned on having Christmas at Hogwarts to finish it and is caught flat-footed by his vision of Arthur being attack by Nagini.

Fortunately the potion is in its final stage, bottle for a whole week while he waits for it to change colour before he can add the last ingredients. Stashed in his potions kit in his trunk it is brought to Grimmauld Place by the Hogwarts elves and after a couple of days he's able to get away and set up his cauldron in an secluded place where the potion can simmer for the last 8 hours. The place he chooses is the attic, formerly the residence of Buckbeak but who has now been relocated to a French reserve thanks to Fleur's connections.

While Harry has left his potion unattended Fleur and Tonks, who've become fast friends in the last couple of months, arrive and start to 'duel'. Side by side with cleaning charms they take on the mess, filth and smell of unwashed Hippogryff musk. Their jokes and laughter come to a stop when they discover the potions set-up and while Tonks wonders if it is Sirius' work Fleur more darkly suggests it must be the work of those Twin Gingers. Unprepared and inexperienced with their antics she's been on the receiving end of a number of their pranks and traps about the house.

Tonks asks if Fleur wants to sabotage it, a bit of Hippogryff dung perhaps? Fleur points out if it turns the potion dangerous and it gets used on someone then it'll be their fault. Instead they'll take a little of it to see if they can figure out what it is, then prank the Twins back. Without taking proper precautions however Fleur and Tonks inadvertently contaminate the potion... with themselves. Hair of a Veela and hair of a metamorphmagus fall into the concoction and are assimilated into the magic.

When Harry later returns he finds the potion ever so slightly off-colour from the description given in the books, a slight silver tint amongst the fluid rather than egg white. Faced with starting over Harry decides that its not enough of a difference to be worried, bottles it and takes it to his room where after a shower he drinks it and goes to bed.

He awakes a little later than usual the next morning feeling light-headed, woozy and ravenous. Fleur has prepared a French breakfast and fortunately Ron hasn't eaten it all but Harry finishes the rest easily and is still hungry. Fortunately Christmas is the time for all-day grazing and Harry eats and eats and eats. Christmas cheer with Fred and George's fun pranks and stunts, Ginny helping Harry decorate the tree and mantle, Sirius with the Wireless, Tonks stumbling in, Fleur circling around topping up eggnog.

Harry becomes increasingly randy, catching himself repeatedly staring at Ginny, Fleur and Tonks. Also being caught by all three as he stares at the others. Teasing and flirting, Sirius taunting Harry and before long Harry has to go and relieve himself - something that Tonks' and Fleur's noses pick up on him afterwards. The two older witches are themselves starting to get a bit randy and their thoughts repeatedly turning to Harry.
