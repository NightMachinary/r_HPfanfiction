To clarify, I'm not looking for Super!Dark!Harry. just fics where he's normal Harry, but he doesn't have any magic until an entity of some fashion makes him a deal. preferably light hearted or crack, but I realize this is a very specific ask, so if you have anything even remotely similar, I'll take it.


** ...but why. I have a few stories I could dredge up that have Harry in communication with a higher power. The Denarian Renegade comes to mind, but finding a story where Harry is magicless only to get magic from a higher entity seems like a bit of a loop really. I get it's fanfiction, and anything can happen, but I doubt there is much, if any, of what you're looking for. Good luck to you anyway, and shoot me a message if you'll accept Harry in contact with a higher entity that helps him with magic in some ways.

*** Mostly because I imagine shenanigans will ensue when whatever he made a deal with tries to get him to pay up. If you have anything even vaguely similar I'll take it!

**** Just search for stories with Harry making deals with demons/angels/eldritch horror/celestial being/etc... that request might turn up some stuff.

**** Like the other comment said, Denarian renegade is probably the closest thing to this. It is the first story in a trilogy with some of the best action I've ever read. There's also a fic where Harry makes deals with Skyrim's Hermaus Mora... I don't remember the name
