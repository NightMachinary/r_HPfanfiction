I am interested in any etory that has Harry Potter or an OC as an obscurial. I am also looking for any stories that use the new plotline


** You know, Dumbledore really is lucky that Harry didn't become an obscurial.

**** I don't know it doesn't really fit with my own head-cannon but it may work for people who believe Dumbledore was more manipulative than I believe. It seems less likely due to the uncontrollable nature of the power. This means that Harry would be equally as likely to kill innocents as he would to kill Voldemort.

***** i wasn't being serious, I actually hate dumbledore bashing. But if someone were to assume that Dumbledore planned for harry to be abused (and not that it was a consequence of something that dumbledore had no alternative for) that would be actually the only valid reason I could think of. And about the killing innocent people thing. At least Grindelwald thought that its possible for a obscurial to learn controlling his powers and Dumbledore could have found a way in the past decades

****** Perhaps. I would like to see a writer jump on this but I just am too busy most of the time to write anything more than a 900-1000 word one shot. I'll ask any of the writers I am friends with if they could do this but it seems highly unlikely.

** I made a thread asking for the same thing a few weeks ago.

It seems as if what few Fantastic Beasts stories are out there are either extremely shit, or little better quality than My Immortal grammatically.

*** Oh well. The only good one I have found is linkffn(12296472). And it is almost at the most interesting plot point. I am anxiously waiting the next update.

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.

***** Note that while this fic has really good characterizations of Newt and Harry and does a good job portraying their relationship, there's a bit of subtle racism woven in. Africa is treated as one country early in the fic (although it improves slightly later on), all Chinese people eat dogs and magical creatures, eugenics with the Brits being naturally superior to all other countries when it comes to combat (with Harry being able to take on hundreds of magical and muggle soldiers at once), pretty much all non-white people portrayed as inept and/or magically weak cardboard villains (until the latest villain who has some backstory). At the same time, the author does briefly mention how badly colonialism screwed over the African continent. And supposedly the people of each country has something it excels at better than other countries (athough the skills so far seem to be innate and not because each country has a rich teaching tradition). It doesn't bash you over the head with the racism, but it's there throughout nonetheless.

****** I have noticed. It could be laziness from the writer about research of locations but it has always bugged me whenever I read it.

******* Yes, and it's such a shame because there are precious few Harry/Newt fics, and of those fewer that portray their relationship really well.

**** I'm re-reading two stories at once right now, Again and Again and Rise of a Dark Lord. I'll read this in a few days hopefully. Sounds pretty good from the summary.

EDIT - Who gives a fuck. Reading this now. Thanks for the rec.
