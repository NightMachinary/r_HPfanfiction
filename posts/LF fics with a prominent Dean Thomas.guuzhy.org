Most fics seem to have him as a generic Gryffindor side character or Ginny's starter boyfriend. I'd like to see a fic where he plays a larger part of the story. Dean doesn't need to be the MC, but I'd like him to be a central character in the fic. Any ship, any length, preferably well-written. Bonus points if it's a fic about his time on the run in 7th year, but any time period is fine.

Thanks in advance!

edit: Thank you, [[/u/blandge][u/blandge]], for my very first silver! :)

  Once a week, every week, Dean Thomas allowed himself to pretend nothing had ever happened.

  Dean Thomas doesn't know his old dorm mate very well at all.

If Dean was a bit more of a prominent character, it'd would've been. But the premise was interesting enough and the writing good enough that I finished what you've written so far and am eagerly awaiting the next installment. So your ploy for self-promotion worked, lol :)

Genuine question tho: in what year does the fic take place? Because neither Xbox nor Call of Duty was around in 1997, so I'm curious as to roughly when these events are occurring.

**** Aww thanks :). Re the xbox/games. Yup there are a few continuity errors like that. I wrote that bit of fic ages ago and only picked it up again because of Covid. I probably need to tweak it. Thank you for your eagle eyes. Dean is back in the bit I'm writing now and will feature heavily in the sequel I am now planning to write heh. Check back in a few months lol.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)
