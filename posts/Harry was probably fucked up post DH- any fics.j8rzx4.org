His godfather, his mentor(s), died- half the people in his life, really when you think about it. In addition seven years of constant neglect, near-death experiences, torture, an entire damn prophecy about him, and basically no time to process /any/ of that properly. Plus that saving people thing? Probably made it a billion times worse after he found out how many people died in the war. Does anybody have any fics that have this as a major plot point ( and do it /well)/ cause damn I would love that shit.
