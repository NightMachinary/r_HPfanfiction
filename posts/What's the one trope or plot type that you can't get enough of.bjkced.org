***** Yeah, Blindness is great. Patron by Starfox5 also has Hermione inventing stuff like aerodynamic shield charms for broom racing, but it doesn't really explain the magic system that well.

Divided and Entwined also had Hermione creating a few inventions for the war effort but instead of magic spells it was enchanted rifles, anti-ward bombs and homemade napalm....

Methods of Rationality also has a smartass Harry inventing rocket assisted brooms and similar madness but it's controversial, you like it or you hate it. I liked it.

So, How Can We Weaponize This? also had completely insane creations without really explaining the magic system but it's ridiculously funny.

Harry gets Motivated also had some ridiculous overpowered inventions.

** "Walk a mile in their shoes"-type scenarios, where one character who has either been dismissive, insulting, or just ignorant about how another (usually the main character) has to live through a typical day or event in their lives, and comes out of it floored with how much the second character has to deal with and how they handle it.

Like, imagine Malfoy going through the events at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban in Harry's place, and then having Ron be like "Yeah, that was pretty scary, but it wasn't as bad as the Chamber last year," then Hermione follows up with "Well, I suppose it wasn't as dangerous as the troll from first year. Or the Devil's Snare and the murderous chess set from the third floor corridor," while Malfoy is looking at them incredulously.

** Mildly fucked up forbidden romance.

!linkffn(Living Dangerously) is a good example, as Daphne is actually the daughter of a death eater and subscribes to pureblood ideology, but still ends up involved with Harry.

!linkffn(Power is Control) is another one, with a female Voldemort being obsessed with Harry, but still Voldemort, hell-bent on ruling the world. Between this and The Advantages of Being Sane, I may also have a weakness for Harry/fem!Voldemort.

*** I agree. I like canon Hermione a bit (I mean my perception of her was flawed as a kid), but as an adult I see her very real flaws. She is abrasive and has very little regards for feelings. Let's go year by year

Year one, while Ron calling her out on her friends is a bit much, she was being the person who helps without prompting, showing off their knowledge. Frankly it's annoying and I don't blame Ron in this book. Not that I hold it against Hermione either as a character as a whole, she's young and I'm setting a trend.

Year three, she tattles about Harry's firebolt to McGonagall (who is a shitty administrator). While her heart is in the right place, she should have discussed it with Harry first.

Year five, where to start. She essentially puts down Ron when he gets the prefect badge instead of Harry. She also insults Luna and her father directly to her face. She also pretty much manipulates Harry into teaching defense against the dark arts to everyone. In an OWL year. When Harry is getting persecuted by a "professor". Who should not have had that power, and any sort of coverage could have gotten rid of her. I mean Dumbledore is aloof, but McGonagall as the person directly responsible for Harry was a useless sack of shit.

Year six, where to begin. She essentially dismisses Malfoy being a death eater immediately, despite Voldemort killing at the same age. She also nags Harry about the Half-blood prince book, a book with useful annotations, deriding it as cheating. She then cheats so Ron can be on the Quidditch team by confunding his main competition. And when Ron is with his girlfriend, she assaults him with birds. When Harry gets into a scrape with Malfoy, she harps about the book being dangerous, rather than Malfoy attempting the cruciatus. She also does an I-was-right, about the book after Dumbledore dies.

Book seven, frankly she was somewhat useless when it came to horcruxes and hallows, being close-minded and dismissive of the only person alive with an understanding of the thoughts of Voldemort, but really the big sin is that she wiped her parents memories and sent them where /for the greater good/ essentially. If someone else like Dean did it, how would hermione act?

I view her as a fundamentally good character, but an arrogant one. She never struck me as a truly intelligent person, but rather one who enploys rote memorization and regurgitation of facts. Frankly, she should have been taken to task for quite a few of these. That's why I enjoy a good fic with a smarter, more powerful Harry (essentially as talented as a teen Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or Voldemort) that is not a Harry/Hermione fic, because Hermione seems defensive when it comes to intelligence. I could see conflict over better grades, ease of magic, and her attempted mothering. She never really gets over her social issues, which is why I could only see her becoming minister by abusing Harry's popularity.

That being said, I love starfox5's Hermione because revolutionary Hermione would be a much better extension of her character. Canon Hermione is also somewhat palatable despite these flaws, but fanon Hermione in any Hermione centric story is just annoying.
