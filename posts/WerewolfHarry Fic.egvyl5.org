:END:
I've been looking for this fic for a few months now, and haven't been able to find it. I posted about it a while back but no one knew what it was, so I figured I'd try again. I read it a while ago on AO3 and I guess I forgot to bookmark it. Lily and James were still alive but had a very strained relationship with Harry. Especially James, because Harry is a werewolf and he's super prejudiced. Harry really can't stand either of them. He's a loner with the exception of Hermione, and he's not overly close to her. She was (blood?)adopted by an alive Regulus Black because she is a muggle-born. She is known as Hermione Black. I'm pretty sure Harry and Hermione are both in Slytherin. The main plot of the story is that Harry is trying to do some power enhancing (I think) ritual and manages to fuck it up. He somehow bonds himself to Tom Riddle, who is some high up politician. He figures it out and starts trying to hide from Riddle, while Riddle tries to pursue Harry. Eventually they kinda get together, but I don't think any sex has happened yet. Harry finds out that Voldemort did some ritual that made him basically immortal, and he is part fae, part basilisk, and part something I don't remember. Also, at some point Regulus talks to Harry and teaches him some magic. Does anyone know this fic???
