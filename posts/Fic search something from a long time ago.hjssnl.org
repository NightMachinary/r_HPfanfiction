:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic after I read HPMOR, no idea if it actually came out during the same time as the fic was finished (with a statement that a sequel was coming)\\
Author talked about being from a Muslim community (not sure it was the whole country) and mentioned harems a lot in the author notes though none of that was actually in the fic. There was a lot of Harry and Hermione stuff though no actual shipping.\\
The things I remember about it are harry getting dobby to sell the gold he was making with the philosophers stone he stole early on.\\
Harry eventually using the stone to bring Hermione back to life after a pretty brutal scene that ended the fic (where I was at least) note this destroys the stone.\\
Harry practicing apperation and wandless magic at the dursleys because the trace was on his wand.\\
Harry being really serious about studying magic.\\
A really dramatic scene where he tries to reject the goblet of fire's decision to make him a champion.

I guess thanks in advance for your help, I have been trying to remember what the fic was called or who wrote it for weeks, it doesn't seem to be saved in my [[https://fanfic.net][fanfic.net]] account and I just can't find it.
