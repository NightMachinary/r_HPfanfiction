Hello, I'm looking for any Adult/Grownup Harry fics where he is powerful. Would prefer if there is no pairing right at the start but i can live with reading one where he is married etc.

By powerful i mean being able to take care of whatever problem he is facing whether it be a fight or just helping someone.

No dark harry fics. and please no edgy or angst.

Thanks.


** You'll love linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon)

Give it a try, even if you never watched Firefly. It's a really good story.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

****** Interesting, I saw it very differently.

#+begin_quote
  throughout the story the only persons thoughts or actions that are treated as valid is sleezebag Harry
#+end_quote

I actually felt like Harry gave the Greengrass parents too much consideration. These are people who voluntarily signed their daughter away to be property, they call people like his mother the wizarding version of 'nigger' /to his face/, and they compared him to Death Eaters. Certainly he was less sleezey than them, including Daphne. Yet their words shook him. Ron and Neville call him out on being a dick - he keeps on going, but it seemed clear to me that it did in fact bother him.

#+begin_quote
  the heavily implied "you should be grateful for this", the ending.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure where you saw this at all? Who 'should' be grateful, Daphne?

#+begin_quote
  The whole time reading it, ask yourself if you would want to be friends with someone who treats their wife this way.
#+end_quote

Daphne wasn't his wife. She was a complete stranger and a ruthless social shark. If Daphne found herself in Harry's situation, do you think she would hesitate for even a second to milk it for all its worth? For the good of the Greengrass family? Not only would she not hesitate, I also rather doubt she'd be nearly as lenient as Harry was. The guy did, after all, let her completely off the hook for the low price of 5 dates. Hell, she was /happy/ when she found out his reasons for using her, because she thinks that's a valid and good move for someone to make.

I'm not all that sympathetic. If I ever met this Daphne, she would consider me to be disgusting slime unworthy of touching the sole of her shoes. She'd also happily cast any magic on me or my family/friends that she felt convenient, so long as she thought she could get away with it. Tbh, I was a little disturbed that Harry was falling for such a person.

#+begin_quote
  Reading about Harry turning into a mustache twirling machiavellian politician is depressing.
#+end_quote

I'd hardly call him /mustache twirling/. Other than what Harry did to Daphne, all we've got is her uncertain speculation on how heavily involved he was with the DMLE Director's downfall. Remember, she's a person who thinks Harry considers all of his friends to be nothing but boot-lickers and pawns.

I can understand not enjoying a political & manipulative Harry, but I thought that aspect of it was very refreshing. A Harry that has an ambition and proactively pursues it.
