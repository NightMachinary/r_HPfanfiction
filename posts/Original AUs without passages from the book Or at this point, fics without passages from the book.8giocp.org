Hey guys, lately I've been trying to read some AU HP fanfics but the problem is that soo so many of them are literally just rehashes. Like there'll be an interesting premise but then when I go to read the fic, there'll be so many passages lifted straight from the book. Like say Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw... nothing really changes. They will literally give some random Ravenclaw OC Ron and Hermione's lines lifted STRAIGHT FROM THE BOOK. Like Ravenclaw Harry will do everything the OG Harry did; nothing changed save for his house.

So are there any AUs out there that completely rehash the story? I don't mind if it doesn't start from year 1, in fact I'd prefer it. I don't want something that follows along the school years really diligently like the book. I want something different. Bonus points if it's written well.

Please don't recommend HPMOR.

Thanks in advance.


** That's my jam!

Harry goes to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]])

Harry's upbringing affects him a bit more than in canon. Diverges slowly but surely (leaving Hogwarts behind at some point)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Series-1-The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs]])

This one gets recced quite a lot around here, but deservedly so. It has very little to do with canon events, because the main characters stumble into a parallel universe:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/7/Stages-of-Hope]])

An alternate take on the end of the war. Writing started before DH came out, so it's AU by default:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

Huge AU, similarities to canon are tenuous at best. Though it features a lot of tropes and cliches (Soul Bond, Ritual Magic, Lord Potter, bashing, etc). Definitely no canon rehashing:

[[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/]]

Harry goes back to the past and doesn't fuck around:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]])

Some canon events are revisited but they play out quite differently in:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]])

This one is all over the place, but certainly not at all a canon-rehash:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path]])

Probably my favorite AU and WBWL fic. That world is truly (but wonderfully) fucked up in so many ways:

** Callidus Prince Series by ContraryToEverything is definitely something you might like to look at. The author's writing style is brilliant and original. She does not simple rehash the books, but makes it unique while keeping the tone of JK Rowling's HP World. Seriously, the main plot points of each story is completely original and deviates greatly from the books.

However, it's more of a de-aged story rather than a time travel story. Since the principles are similar though, I'll recommend it anyways. So far the author is on year 3.

The basic run down of the story is Severus Snape somehow got de-aged to 11 years old with only memories at that age. So he does not remember anything pass 11. He is aware that something is not right and he is in the wrong body.

Also, the first chapter of the series is a prologue from an OC's point of view. That is the only time that the story is from that character's POV, after that, it sticks to Severus' POV.

** Hm, would you be interested in something that starts a few years before Hogwarts and works its way there? I've been writing an AU story and I'm definitely not lifting passages or lines from canon because it just wouldn't fit, and since the world is fairly different it won't be a canon rehash... well, some modified version so of years 2 and 4 will occur i guess, but I hope it will be done rather differently once I'm there.

That said, it's ongoing and only a few chapters in, might be a deal-breaker for some:

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

** [[https://www.quotev.com/story/10314057/Harry-Potter-The-Fight-For-Rights/1]]

My most passionate, best and ongoing fanfic counts as this entirely, and for the same reasons you want it to be. I was sick of reading Hogwarts children Voldemort fics, and I wanted to write a story about adults, so I started writing this. It's an AU that starts after my female Harry has graduated from Hogwarts, and goes forward with her life and adventures around the world. There's absolutely no lines or plots copied from canon. There is zero rehashing of anything. It is entirely original. And I plan to have it go through my female Harry's adult life up until she's in her forties.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** I find it difficult to believe that no one has recommended A Second Chance At Life by Miranda Flairgold yeah it's an old pic but it is pretty epic and it's aged fairly well granted the third book was never completed but honestly the first 2 stand alone fairly well. It definitely meet your requirements of being AU not rehashing cannon.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
