I'm searching for a very specific HP time travel fic.

Voldemort finds Harry and takes him back in time to the night Voldemort kills his parents. He makes a deal that he won't kill Harry's parents if Harry will help him. Harry stops the killing of his parents. Time then fast-forwards again but Harry's parents are alive and he has a sister. Voldemort is in power and muggles are not allowed at Hogwarts. Harry is in Slytherin and friends with Draco (I think, not entirely certain on that). He ends up trying to find Hermione who is now a famous cellist in the muggle world. I think there may have also been something about a lost sister of Ron's but I'm not sure.

I read this a long time ago but I can't seem to find it anywhere. Does anyone know the name of this fic or who wrote it? I've been trying to track this down for months. :( It was quite good and I want to read it again.


** I've saved this 'cos i want to read this too now.

good luck in finding it- try to remember specific or better unique? characters and specific lines from the fic and use google for your search if you haven't already done so. My two cents on the matter, even though I live in England. :)

** The fic you're looking for is "Harry Potter and the time of good intentions" by Barb. It's the second fic in the psychic serpent trilogy and IMO the best one. linkffn(699701) I'm not sure how well the fic has aged but it sure got me through the long wait between GoF and OOTP.
