I just finished reading Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince and Not From Others and they were both so excellent...

I'm looking for fics similar to those, from other characters POV, for any of the books. A “missing moments” from basically anyone, if you will. Hogwarts/DH era. Any length. Canon compliant


** Also, Shifts and Shades by Fernwithy. They focus on Remus and Tonks during OotP/HBP respectively. It focuses on their relationship as well as their work for the order.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/504579][Holding the Fort]] linkao3(504579) is DH from Neville's POV.

Also, instead of reading Year of Darkness, please check out the [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120114061932/http://wiki.fandomwank.com/index.php/Victoria_Bitter][FandomWank article]] on its author, Thanfiction. It's really something.

** Glad you enjoyed my fic!

I really wouldn't recommend Year of Darkness. It's really bad and has issues with racism, sexism and glorification of child soldiers.

I liked linkffn(A Call to Arms)

** Most of the little missing moment fics I have are from an adult from canon's POV.

*Lupin:*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125][Calibration]] Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12042771][Let it Choke]] Remus attempts to give Susan Bones detention. But writing lines isn't the lesson she needs to learn. (This one isn't a missing moment per say, but I thought it was plausable that it could have happened in canon.)

*Sirius:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11088406/1/Tea-and-Empathy][Tea and Empathy]] Takes place the night of Voldemort's return.

*Scrimgeour:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11357101/1/][The Lion's Pride]] Rufus' POV of the conversation with Harry at Dumbledore's funeral.

*Dumbledore:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2763133/1/][Schools of Thought]] A conversation with Karkaroff that I think is plausable may have happened.

*Luna:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5574922/1/Christmas-Moonbeam][Christmas Moonbeam]] Luna during her time at Malfoy Manor.

*Peter:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2021951/1/Voices][Voices]] Small moment with Scabbers in POA.

*Various POVs:*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/760227][Missing Scenes]] A series of canon-compliant missing scenes from all seven books and various perspectives.

​

I also have an unfinished (and sadly discontinued) fic that is written from various Slytherin POVs, if I remember correctly. It's been awhile since I read it, so I'm not exactly sure how well it conforms to canon - but it does cover DH and I thought it was an interesting perspective when I read it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6593210/1/On-The-Other-Side][On the Other Side]]
