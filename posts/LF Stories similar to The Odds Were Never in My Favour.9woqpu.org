I recently came by TOWNMF and loved it. It's not very well written. It has a lot of purple prose, the MC femHarry is a Mary Sue, and there's a sort of Dumbledore bashing that rides the line between reasonable and not.

But I still loved it because it has a lot of neat concepts, locations, and lore. There are several original villains that are well developed and even frightening.

Are there any stories similar to this? With dragons and goblins playing a role beyond throwaway world building; with factions outside the main canon ones that are on par or even beyond Voldemort and Dumbledore?

I appreciate any recs ^{^}

oh and the link to TOWNMF: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/1/The-odds-were-never-in-my-favour]]

** Not dragons, but Elemental Genesis involves a different type of magic, and gods plotting against each other. Even a good Tom Riddle. The sequel is unfinished though.
