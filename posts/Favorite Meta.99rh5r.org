The recent shipping thread we had reminded me how much I love reading essays about possible relationships -- why they may be plausible, what would make you interested in them, etc. To some extent, I think I often enjoy reading this sort of ship defense better than I do reading actual /fics/ about the ship.

Then there are also, of course, things like whitehound's tour-de-force reconstruction of Hogwart's architecture based on evidence in the books such as the angle of the sun; and the classic "ever so slightly longer but not quite as thick", which analyzes fanfiction portrayals of Harry and Draco's dicks; and a really wonderful essay I read a few years ago which delved into the differences in personality between Fred and George Weasley.

So -- what are your favorite pieces of meta, if you read meta at all? I'd love to hear them!


** I enjoy [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=gringotts&st=hglovered][this essay]] on Harry and Ginny.

I'm pretty sure I read the Fred and George one as well. It was really good. I always see George as the inventor and Fred as the funny man that came up with the ideas. I see Ron as filling this role after Fred's death when working in the joke shop.

Edit: Pretty sure [[https://hp-companion.com/essays/fredgeorge/][this]] is it, it's a great analysis

I honestly tried, but it doesn't matter if in support of a ship I like ( Harry/Hermione) or one I dislike (Ron/Hermione), I don't find them very enjoyable to read. Usually the author makes one or two good points but then goes off the deep end and pulls out some absurd argumentation which reflects badly on the whole thing. Usually that point revolves around bashing someone instead of just calmly laying out the facts.

It's even worse in the A song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones fandom, where every blade of grass is used as base for absurd theories like time traveling unborn children.

Don't get me wrong, I like a good discussion about any work, but those ten page long walls of text aren't really my thing. I prefer a discussion centered approach like in this sub.

** I want to see new things in fanfics. I'm not all that familiar with canon.
