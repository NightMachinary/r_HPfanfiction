** Regardless of the legality of corporal punishment, using a blood quill against students would not have been recieved kindly by any parent. Amelia Bones would have been in a position to challenge Fudge on his decision to allow Umbridge to use a dark item on students, and she seems shrewd enough to encourage public outrage from parents by spreading the news around because this would help her cause in banning them.

On the subject of whether a blood quill is dark magic or not: it left a permanent scar, which is indicative of dark magic so the argument can easily be made in favour. If it isn't classified as a dark object, it is still being used for the soul purpose of causing pain in this instance. So Bones would demand banning it due to it being an instrument of torture. Students with attentive families would not be able to hide their detention scars forever. People would find out. I'm so drunk rn so I dont know if any of this makes sense but what I'm trying to say is Bones could cause public outrage at the permanent mutilation of students by a member of the Minitry specifically chosen to "oversee the wellbeing of Hogwarts Students", and Fudge would take a hit for actively overseeing her placement at Hogwarts and allowing- nay, endorsing- her behaviour while not consulting other powerful members of the ministry like Bones.

  "The Dursleys," Harry said to Amelia Bones, finally opening up about his childhood, "they kept me in a cupboard."

  Amelia nodded. "Well, it's good to hear the Muggles at least know something about how to properly raise a wizard. Did they also expose you to danger?"

  Harry blinked. "Well, they let my cousin beat me up all the time... so long as he could catch me, that was."

  "No, no, that won't do at all," Amelia said, and Harry felt like he was finally getting somewhere. His feeling was short-lived. "I'll have to have a discussion with your guardians. They should have at least been throwing you out of the window on a fairly regular basis. How's a child's magic supposed to manifest if you don't expose them to proper danger? Honestly, these Muggles know nothing. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Harry. Don't worry, I'll make sure to take the appropriate action."

  /------Some time later, after Amelia has removed Harry from the Dursleys to ensure he gets a proper wizarding upbringing------/

  "Magic is like a muscle, Harry!" Algernon said cheerfully as he dangled Harry out of a window. "We'll turn you into a great wizard, mark my words!"

***** Nah, they just sent them to a school with a deadly forest nearby, lived in a house with a rickety staircase, moving staircases that'll kill you if you fall off, and where the main sport is one that involves flying at high speed where players hit heavy, fast moving iron balls at each other. They even allowed the kids to play quidditch and fly before going to hogwarts. The Weasley's aren't exactly your average magical family anyway.

That, and the lack of a reaction to Longbottom's situation suggests that the wizarding world is far less security anxious when it comes to children. Do I really think wizards encourage parents to toss their children out of windows? No, though I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of them did. I do believe that they let children run around and place themselves in an amount of danger unthinkable to actual parents these days.

And why wouldn't they? Mundane injuries are not as dangerous to wizards, and can be healed with a flick of a wand. Look at how Harry gets his skull cracked open and falls from the sky and not only survives, but is up and running around a few days later. A muggle would be dead.

The notion that a car accident could kill a wizard or witch is laughable. Venomous mundane creatures pose no threat to those with magic.

Corporal punishment that left scars was once routine.

It's pretty clear that wizards are pretty laissez faire when it comes to kids. It might not be right, but it is what happens.

It wouldn't take ten minutes to find something she pulled in the process of climbing the ladder at the Ministry that would get her dismissed, given the things we *know* she did put her in Azkaban for life. There's probably a whole herd of minor officials ready and willing to screw her over because of the damage she did to their careers in getting and protecting her spot.

Crouch Jr. spent an entire year planning specifically how Harry would die. Dumbledore's whole plan hinged on Harry being willing to let himself be killed. Trelawney gave the prophecy, and spent every year predicting his death.

In any event, I think you may be looking for an explanation for something that doesn't require one. Umbridge was used to achieving her goals through decrees; it's natural and makes sense for her to continue doing so even where she has the choice to use alternative means.

If you /really/ need an explanation beyond "human nature", there's also the fact that the Headmaster is subject to the Board of Governors, whereas the High Inquisitor appears to be able to bypass the board.

Prior to Dumbledore banning corporal punishment, the permanent physical scarring of students was normal punishment for e.g. breaking curfew. It was legal. Dumbledore using his authority as Headmaster to make it against Hogwarts rules would not have impacted on its legality. So far as we know, it remains legal and simply against Dumbledore's policy.

As for dark magic, it's entirely fanon that dark magic is illegal or even generally looked down upon. Jinxes, which we know are dark magic, are largely viewed as relatively innocent or even funny. And in OotP, in one of Umbridge's classes, Hermione enthusiastically defends the use of dark magic in a defensive context. It's only especially serious forms of dark magic which are viewed as innately bad.
