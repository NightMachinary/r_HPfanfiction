I've tried a few different google searches and Ao3 searches... getting a bit scared that the author might have taken it down, but! I remember:

It's pretty long, and the prologue wasn't super great, which kept me from starting it for a while, but the rest of the story really got to me.

Lily dates Caradoc Dearborn before James

Alice is a workaholic/one year behind Frank and very jealous of his joining the Aurors

Mary dyes her hair blond

Remus and Sirius don't have a very happy story, they hook up but the feelings aren't equal on both sides

Almost everybody smokes cigarettes and it was murder to read when I was trying to quit

James and Lily start as a friends with benefits sitch but eventually move past it

It gets really dark - there are several scenes where the author tells you what gruesome death eventually awaits those characters and it's bleak.

I think I read it in 2015 but it might have been posted before that.

Any help would be amazing!


** I stumbled on this while I was for what I think is the same fic - I think it's The Life and Times if you're still looking for it! It's very similar to what you described, but Lily dates Sam Dearborn, who is related to Caradoc in the story, an OC dyes her hair blonde, Marlene chops her (blonde) hair short, Frank cheats on Alice, it's all very angsty...
