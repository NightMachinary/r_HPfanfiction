This is pretty dark subject matter, but the first thing that jumped out at me when I read about the Imperius Curse in canon is sex slavery, and I'm a little surprised I've never read about Death Eaters grabbing Pureblood men/women they'd never have a chance with otherwise and using them as Pureblood breeding stock. Reproductive control of desired ethnicities and mass rape are typical weapons of ethnic warfare- Hitler's Germany even ran homes for unmarried pregnant women who were sufficiently Aryan looking to encourage them not to abort their hypothetically pure children.

I can't see Voldemort's brand of purity-obsessed followers going after half bloods or muggleborns for breeding heirs, but I'm surprised to have never come across a fanfic that explored Pureblood breeding programs besides that Lucius Malfoy POV fic. Suggestions?


** Imperius is kind of overkill for the situation. Immobilizing a person or using a love potion would be easier and less likely to result in time in Azkaban. Which isn't to say that Imperius sex never happens, but it would be more about what the caster gets off on than for any pragmatic reason.

** Obliviate works well to cover up such crimes. I assume a lot of rape went on during the wars, because that's usually what happens when people who think their enemies are subhumans get the chance and have the perfect tools.

*** True- I think I heard of a fic where a presumed-Muggleborn turned out to have a Death Eater father with an Obliviated mother, but I can't recall what character it was.

** Pretty sure you are mixing up fanon and canon with regards to the lolz evil being committed.

Besides Imperius would be the worst way to go about for any form of forced impregnation, seeing as the long term examples of it in action result in the spells control on them being broken - Both Crouches Jnr & Snr.

An induced coma of some sort would be best or depending on how stupidly rabid you want to flanderize the DE just extract the egg to implant in a line of unimportant muggle girls.

*** I don't think JKR wanted to go there, obviously, but the pureblood/muggleborn divide does remind me of wars based on ethnic purity.

In Hero Harry, he liberates a sex slave / breeding camp. Brutal Harry is mostly good. Hero Harry gets a bit weird.

*** Ah, yes, I've read that. A bit weird might be understating it but I did think that part was interesting.
