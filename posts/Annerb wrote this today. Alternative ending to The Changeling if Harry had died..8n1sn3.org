** Ugh, she wrecked me with this one. So sad but so beautifully written, I continue to love every HP fic that she writes. As much as I like canon Ginny, the Changeling Ginny is a more intriguing character.

** I've never read the original fic so forgive me if this is a dumb question, but it starts in Ginny's first year, right? Does it really affect events so little in all that time that the final battle plays out exactly the same as it did in canon? That seems like it'd be super frustrating to read.

*** It does start on Ginny's first year, yes. However, canon isn't really mentioned much since Ginny really isn't in the thick of it. She has her own plot and her own adventures to go on while Harry, Ron, and Hermione more or less follow the books (there are some minor differences when they all interact)

*** Major canon events are still largely the same, but Ginny's story is significantly different. Imo, keeping the overall story the same allows the author to look more at the characters, which is something that Annerb does incredibly well. Well worth the read imho.

** My love/hate relationship with this author just intensifies every time.

Can't she just stick to the fluff? I'm never prepared for the feels

** So if that one was merely tragic, what did Annerb envision for the wildly tragic version?
