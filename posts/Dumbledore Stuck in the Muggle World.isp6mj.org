Hello! hope everyone is managing well in this crisis. I've been coping (not particularly healthily) by enjoying a variety of fics as I'm sure many of you are as well.

I was reading Harry is a Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth, a wonderful story that if you've skipped over for seeming too silly or strange I would recommend reconsidering.

Anyway, this story has a wonderful characterization of Dumbledore at his most befuddlingest. It really reminds me of how the books first present him,

* "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?‚Äù

  :END:
(no idea why the letters are so big, sorry)

The prompt part of this is that I would love to see this character, so apologetically wizardly and magical waking up in a world without the wizarding world. How would he interact with a world without any other magical beings? How would the world react to him? I see him smiling and being delighted at anything and everything, confusing everyone who encounters him and subtly awing and or scaring them when he lets slip that he can do more.


** He'd be a natural for those Department store Father Christmas jobs each year.

*** I can see him doing that but instead of standing there with the bell He would walk around. Or you hear the bell stop ringing behind you and start ringing in front of you and you see him around the corner after you've already passed him

** Would Dumbledore still be a wizard (the only wizard) in this prompt, or does he only keeps his memories of the Magical World?

If it's the former, I would really see him as a teacher (yes, pretty unexpected), but a teacher for the really difficult case. Like, a school has a "special" class full of difficult students, and just when the principal is ready to give up on them, Dumbledore appear with just the right qualifications and start to teach the class. Nothing the students try to make him leave work and in the end, Dumbledore help each and everyone of them to deal with their problem and put them back on the right path.

Or else, an orphanage/ school director. In a little British village, a building appeared almost overnight. It seems to be an orphanage handled by an old gentleman, it seems strange, but that man was able to show authority all the right autorizations and documents so they let it go.\\
With time, the orphanage is filled with children, all stranger than the other. People are convinced that only one person would not be able to manage them all, but somehow, that man is able to do it, almost effortlessly.

*** I kinda like the poetry of him operating an orphanage, though the whole teacher comes and rallies/saves a struggling class is tried and true.

I was thinking that he would still be a wizard but I imagine he could still hide that. Maybe his wand didn't cross over.
