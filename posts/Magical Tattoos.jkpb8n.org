How do you guys feel about magical tattoos?

I have read a few fics where characters have tattoos that move or can breathe fire and such, and personally I think thst's a really cool feature and idea, but I was wondering what everyone else though about it ?

** I think there's some different versions that are really cool. Esp if they're useful.

** I like the idea, and I think it fits with the magic system in HP. I wouldn't be surprised if you could charm them like a portrait as well. Imagine a little guard dog that slithers up to your ear to bark when you're in danger.

I don't think a tattoo that breathes actual fire would be good for the world-building though. At that point, why wouldn't everyone have one?
