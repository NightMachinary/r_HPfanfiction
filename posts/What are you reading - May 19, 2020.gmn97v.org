** Title: The Serpent and her Lion

Pairing: Harry/Daphne

linkffn(The Serpent and Her Lion)

Comments: The only problems with this fic are that the OC's are overdone and there is severe Ron Bashing. Also, bully Krum. If you can ignore these, or are okay with it, I woul definitely recommend it. It is complete, and Sequel is WIP.

  Harry's friends laughed in his face when he said he didn't put his name in the Goblet. Now he has to go through the whole tournament on his own...or does he? Harry/Daphne and eventually Hermione/OC. The OC will be featured quite a bit. Rated Mature for language and violence. Part 1 in The Serpent and Her Lion Trilogy

** Title: Escape

Author: SingularOddities

Rating: T

Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/]]

Comments:

A marriage-law story with a twist, the difference being that the two protagonists don't go through with it like mindless automata but take action to avoid having one of them marry someone they'd really rather not. I'm two-thirds of the way through this one and whilst it's not an A-grade story it's still pretty good.

The good:

There are some well-thought-out elements to the story. The various ways in which secret messages are sent and objects transferred shows considerable effort and seems pretty original.

It's a great example of how to write a ship without the relationship being the only thing that actually happens. We join the main relationship /in media res/ so there's no tedious getting the two together, and then while it's the prime motivation for what happens in the story, the narrative doesn't remain stuck on it thereafter.

Dialogue is well-written, with each character having a reasonably unique voice.

The bad:

So far everything has happened almost too well for our heroes and their allies. It's all set up to be a big challenge and then, admittedly through careful planning, everything goes without a hitch. McGonagall would doubtless be aware of Burns' claim that "The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft a-gley", but here they just don't.

Part of the reason for the faultless execution of their plans it that the other side seem utterly clueless. Dumbledore in particular seems to have been hit with several idiot balls.

The allies all get along almost too well given their backgrounds in canon. Certainly adds to the lack-of-a-challenge thing.

Conclusion:

Although the narrative gets a bit caught up in its own cleverness at times, there's still enough here to make for an engaging story with interesting characters. It remains to be seen whether it ends with a bang or whether the lack of challenge means it fizzles out.

** Title: Yesterday is Tomorrow (Everything is Connected)

Author: Kneazle

Rating: T

Pairing: Hermione/James P

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12830596/1/Yesterday-is-Tomorrow-Everything-is-Connected]]

I am a big fan of being surprised. I love it when a plot you thought would hate, ends up thoroughly impressing you. If it's not obvious, this is one of those times.

Time travel and Hermione, generally don't mix. When they do. It's usually YA teen fantasy with bashing, written by an amateur. Not a good combination. YiT has all of the warning signs, but instead of bland and uninspiring. You get characters that feel real and actual character growth.

Do not be off put by the pairing. It is not love at first sight. Nor is it "slow burn". A term used to indicate a 300k word story, that is abandoned, with zero romance (a pet peeve). Their relationship develops naturally, through interactions that move the plot along. Rather than vice versa.

If anyone is interested in reading a story, that they wouldn't usually touch. Might I recommend. Yesterday is Tomorrow (Everything is Connected). Enjoy.

** Title: LEGACY: Marauder's Era by CatchthePetals Rating: T

Summary: The culminating moment in which Harry Potter defeated Lord Voldemort was only made possible by the legacy left behind by the generation before. The unspoken heroes of the First Wizarding War, all the way from their awkward beginnings at Hogwarts to the very end til' death do us part. From OC perspective (Raylynx Kingsley). Covers both generations, but focuses on Marauder's era.

Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10211776/1/LEGACY-Marauder-s-Era]] It's real good it focuses on the marauders era, but it's starting to go into the next gen. I love how the author includes Raylynx into the canon story!

linkffn(The Green Girl by Colubrina)

I'm not usually a huge fan of Dramione because it always seems to be way WAY OOC to me, but I thought that since this one began before they actually met, not after years of hatred between them it had a lot of potential. It definitley feels like it's doing a lot of timeskipping early on, but is starting to (I'm on Ch 7/22, start of 4th year) slow down and diverge more from canon.
