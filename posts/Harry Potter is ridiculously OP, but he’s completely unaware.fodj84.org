** It's been /ages/ since I read it (it finished in 2005!), but that's a pretty big plot point in linkffn(2163835).

Basically plot happens to harry and his magic gets much more refined, and he doesn't realize what it actually means for him, so he's able to do all sorts of shit that he really shouldn't be able to do (like melting down galleons without explicitly breaking the protections the goblins put on it first)

******* See, I would argue against the brick wall metaphor. While the games are notoriously difficult, they're still fair to the player.

The closest thing I could compare them to would be a rhythm game. You find the pace for each boss and enemy and roll with it.

It's an incredibly rewarding experience with phenomenally tight animation direction and carefully planned levels and enemies, and beating an area you may have been having trouble with is such a great feeling.

It's only a brick wall if you choose to see it that way, and it's totally fine to not enjoy the genre. Everyone has their own tastes. I'm just saying not to miss out on a top notch title based on one mishap.

******** Oh, I don't deny they're fair. They are. Scrupulously so. You do everything perfect and get the right 'code' of attacks and dodges and you win. You make a mistake, and you die. It's the same way most games are, just turned up to eleven. And yes, the Animations and Level Design were both gorgeous. The way the first section interlinked with itself and hid passages and such was a delight to see.

I never really found it terribly rewarding though. It was just "Move, dodge, move, die three seconds into the fight, return after death, move, dodge, move, dodge, die four seconds into the fight, return after death, move, dodge, move, dodge, attack, dodge, die six seconds into the fight" over and over. And that was every fight that was more than one or two of the human townspeople.

That's what I meant about a brick wall. You're essentially doing what some hackers do to get passwords - brute-forcing patterns of combinations until you get the answer that lets you through. Thus, slamming your head against the wall (ie. doing the same thing over and over and getting hurt for it) until it breaks (ie. Victory!).

I enjoyed every bit of the story and world I saw, even the enemies were cool and interesting to see and wonder about, but that mechanical repetition code-cracking was quite dull. I saw it as a "I just have to do this fight for thirty minutes and die twelve times and then I can see more of the game" block, I suppose. The fights were a block to experiencing the game, the game wasn't a reward for the fights.

And I totally agree. It's perfectly fine to enjoy the genre as much as it is not to. My opinion neither modifies nor supercedes yours and vice versa. I do apologise if I come off that way - tone is hard to connote over the internet and all - but i am just genuinely curious.

********** Good to know. I've always been slightly leery of that being an issue after my current friendship group kept getting anxious over my using full-stops and wondering what they'd done to annoy me. I was so baffled to find out 'k.' was supposedly irritated where 'k' wasn't. Punctuation Slang is weird. :D

It's a fair point. I imagine most people hear about the 'get gud scrub' culture of Dark Souls and paint Bloodborne with the same brush and many of those who don't try it would probably enjoy Bloodborne where they wouldn't enjoy the (in my view) far more malicious Dark Souls.

Given your quite sincere enjoyment and views, it does seem that I'm missing something perceptively here - mulling over my experience, my opinion was definitely coloured slightly by the circumstances in which I played the game (I usually spend a lot of time out of the house, so enforced quarantine and mild cabin-fever does not make for an overly sound/objective mindset for me), so I'll likely try again once this whole thing is over and I'm feeling a little more prepared. If I can make it through Board Policy Meetings, I can make it through anything. :D

EDIT - As a quick aside: I didn't see your tag until now, and I just wanted to say I absolutely adore your fic. You're an excellent storyteller, to the point where I reread the whole of your fic every so often over a couple of sittings. :)

*********** Hahaha. Yeah, the English language - especially typed slang - is just so incredibly fucking strange.

Oh, there's definitely a lot of that 'git gud' mentality and I won't argue against having some of it myself, but Bloodborne is probably the most accessible title within the genre due to sheer entertainment value.

Don't push yourself to enjoy it if you don't feel like you can, but I've noticed that a lot of players tend to just go at the game with the wrong mindset in hand.

A major part of the series /is/ dying. You learn from your mistakes and discover the patterns of the enemies, level, and bosses, until you figure out a way to crack the code or come back more powerful than before and stomp all over that big bad bastard. Honestly, there's no shame in watching a tutorial or playthrough just to get a sense of what people familiar with the genre play it like. I know that's what made me realize that I was playing the series incorrectly, and while what I was doing was effective, it wasn't /fun./

Thank you! I'm happy to hear you enjoy the story. While I really, really don't like how it started I'm pretty happy with how the story has turned out as I've developed as a writer.

Exactly. I'm quite willing to accept that I might've been wrong about it - psychologists have known that the time of day can have obnoxiously strong effects on people for ages now. Could just have been in a bad mood that day. Could also have been accurate - but there's no shame or issue in trying again. I'd hate missing out on a good thing more than I'd care about being wrong, so eh. :)

Do you have a playthrough or tutorial you'd recommend? No biggie if you don't, I'm just curious.

And oh really? That's quite interesting - I really liked what you did with the Goblins and the big distaff reveal. It's pretty rare to see a Helpful Goblins Time Travel fic where the traveller gets accused of something by Goblins and ends up spilling a lot of details. And quirky Death is always fun. Might I ask what you didn't like about it yourself?

************* This is a fantastic no-commentary playthrough from a very experienced player, where they basically trash on all the bosses apart from a select few that are difficult regardless of your level of experience: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJyc-sD1DiY]]

Honestly, it's mostly the shitty tropes and foundation that I used to prop up the fic in the beginning. There's a lot of strange plots that I had that don't really go anywhere because I still didn't know how I wanted to get from point A to B, so I just made it up as I went along - and it shows.

It's just largely incoherent for almost the entire first half of the story, and I strongly dislike it because of that.

But, I am quite happy to see the story where it is now even if 99% of the readers have no idea why the fuck I'm making the decisions I am with the story, but I know exactly where it's going now and how to get there (hint hint, only four more chapters).

************** Hi - apologies for the immense delay in response. Life shit unfortunately piled up and I had to put a lot of hobby stuff on the back burner to get it all done.

I did, however, get to watch some of that walkthrough and replay the game (up until I beat the first boss - the 'Cleric Beast') and it definitely helped. I admit, I still feel a little like it's deliberately fighting me to stop me progressing, but that feeling is reducing as I get a feel for things. I even beat the executioner guy hiding behind the barrels right after the first lever-gate thingy.

And ah, okay. Well, there's gotta be some consolation in that - despite your shitty tropes, people stuck around and found the story a great read. You may be using something bad, but you made something pretty good out of it. :)

And I hear you're writing a new one as well, so you can take those mistakes and use the new story as a second chance to do things better. (Heh). Really looking forward to reading that once I find the time to get a little further into Bloodborne proper, since I've seen from comments by yourself and others that it's pretty linked in to the game proper. :)
