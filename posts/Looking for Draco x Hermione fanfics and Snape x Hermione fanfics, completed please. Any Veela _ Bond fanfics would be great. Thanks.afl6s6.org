I was hoping to get some recommendations for Snape x Hermione fanfics, completed please. I gave read some veela / bonding ones and enjoy that route but couldn't find more than a handful or 2 but enjoy other fanfics with them as the main pair. If anyone has any Draco x Hermione ones that would be appreciated too. Thank you


** SS/HG:

linkffn{11053807) - The beginning/middle is probably my favorite writing ever although it started to get a bit dull for me towards the end.

linkffn(8455295) - time travel

linkffn(7413926; 6578435) Both some of my favorite fics as a whole although they include some character bashing.

linkffn(5441799) - Completed, but the ending is mostly left for the imagination. It could go two ways.

** I don't know of any Snape/Hermione Veela stories, but for a huge trove of fics dedicated to the pairing try ashwinder. There are a lot of classics there.

For Hermione/Draco Veela stories:

Linkao3(Push by SeptimaBode) They are hitwizards and are working on a case involving a terrorist of sorts. Just completed.

Linkao3(Predestined by diemdoll) Hermione is a healer and engaged to Ron, on her hen night she is informed by a seerer that she is predestined for another... You know where this is going. It's very enjoyable, and still updating.

Linkao3(Dangerous by sunalso) Hermione has an encounter with an unknown Veela. Just finished updating.

Linkao3(Beautiful Disaster by ashleyfanfic) Draco comes into his Veela inheritance in his final year. Still updating. It's pretty good, though sometimes a bit too angsty for my liking.

Linkao3(Love and Other Misfortunes by SenLinYu) I really enjoyed this one for it's pacing, plot, and believability. SenLinYu is a fun and moving writer. Complete.

Linkao3(Changing Scenery by aethling) Hermione gets involved in one last case as the head of the regulation of magical creatures which involves the abduction of a veela. This is still updating and is Draco/Hermione/Harry.

Enjoy!

#+begin_quote
  Following the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione Granger has devoted her career to the rights of magical beings, while working reluctantly with the sardonic ministry lobbyist, Draco Malfoy. But, unbeknownst to her, there is ancient magic at work in the aftermath of the War and its consequence will be severe if she fails to look up from her legislation and notice it. “Because I don't want to be saved by you just because you feel like you have to.” He was properly furious now. “I'm in love with you." Hermione stared at him. She knew but somehow hearing him say it made the air shimmer with magic. "I'm in love with you,” he said again, despairingly. “And that means I want you to be as happy as you possibly can. And you won't be, not with me.”

  Seven years have passed since the war ended. Hermione has everything she's always wanted, but she still isn't satisfied. When she mentions she's bored to Harry, she didn't think that her boredom would be alleviated quite this way. And she definitely didn't expect to see Draco Malfoy again after all these years, and not like that. Well, she certainly wasn't bored anymore.
