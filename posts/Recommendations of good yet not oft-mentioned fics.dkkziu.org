-interested.

I've just finished this: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722/chapters/471501]] - it says HP/TR but there's no slash yet, if anything so far it seems Prince of the Dark Kingdom style relationship so far. Really well written but I haven't seen it recommended anywhere. WIP.


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11453335/1/The-All-New-Adventures-Of-Hermione-Granger-In-The-Chance-Of-A-Lifetime]])

This features a SuperHermione getting sent back to her younger self. It still manages to have her personality issues cause more problems than they do in canon, and there are a lot of fun world building ideas that could fit right in with canon and cause actually interesting problems.

#+begin_quote
  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry
