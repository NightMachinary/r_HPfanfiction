Hi everyone, im looking for ANY no slash well written novel length fics where Harry isnt portrayed as this doormat who keeps apologizing and forgiving everyone around him. I get that Rowling gave him these flaws so as to give him depth, but it gets frustrating after a while. An example i can give is numerous Harry goes to Azkaban stories where he gets out and just immediately forgives everyone, just makes him sound kinda pathetic. Thanks for taking the time to read, hopefully you guys can find some good ones for me.


** It's controversial on here and certainly has its issues, but Harry is decidedly not a doormat in linkffn(Prince of Slytherin)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** Currently roughly the length of In Search of Lost Time, the official record holder for longest novel, so just barely

** Harry certainly is not a doormat in Nightmares of Futures Past, and I really enjoy how he's trying to be a better friend the second time around, supporting Hermione and encouraging Neville and helping Ron to appreciate how great his family is. But he certainly tolerates no nonsense from anyone in his way. Unfortunately it's incomplete and only updates about once every three years. The most complete version is the eBook/PDF, at [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/latest]]

linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) is an interesting example; Harry is quite mellow and relaxed about most things, but since he's a dragon, no-one is in a position to walk over him. Dudley's attempts at bullying don't particularly upset him, but they do bounce off. Draco challenging him to a duel doesn't get him all worked up, but as he's practically immune to spellfire, Draco comes off worse. Eventually he wins over most people who would have been his enemies in canon, simply because trying to rile him up is futile. (Which isn't to say he's actually harmless; he could be ridiculously dangerous if he were so inclined. He just has no need to throw his weight around.) The author has long experience, and his prose quality is solid, with lots of clever in-jokes.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
