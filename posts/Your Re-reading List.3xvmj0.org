**** Okay, I've seen this recommended here all the time. I finally started it yesterday and read five very poor chapters. Does this significantly (and do I mean significantly) improve? What's the reason this fic is so beloved here?

***** If you don't like the first five chapters, you're probably not going to like the rest of it. I can't really pinpoint the reasons I love it so much. I really like the characterizations of Lily, Remus, Sirius, and Severus. I love how we never get to see anything from the perspectives of Harry/Hermione/Neville/Luna. It's well written, has enough detail to make it interesting, without including so much that important things get lost (both major problems fanfic writers tend to have). I find the interactions between the characters from the two different worlds to be poignant and funny, and I appreciate the author's ability to show both. I enjoy getting to know the new versions of well known characters through the eyes of people who don't know them at all.

TL;DR: I love the plot, perspective choices and characterizations and the writing is good enough to keep me engaged.
