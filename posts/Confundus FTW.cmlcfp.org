:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A fic that was inspired by Magical Contracts by Kalen Darkmoon, I think it was time travel but I could be wrong. The fic was mulit chaptered and featured Harry absuing Magical Contracts, using the Confundus Charm on them to get them to work for other people.


** Have you tried looking under that author's favorites? Sometimes when a fic is inspired by another fic, the original author will like or follow whoever made the new fic.
