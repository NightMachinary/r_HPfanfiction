I have read many, /many/ fics that portray Dumbledore as evil or manipulative. I don't entirely understand the reasons for this--he's easily one of the most demonized characters in the entire fandom. Does anyone know why most FF writers seem to hate him?


** In the broadest sense, when you've read through the novels a few times, you eventually notice the apparent dissonance between Dumbledore's character (clever, powerful, virtuous) and his actions (the absurdly easy defenses guarding the Stone, his failure to recognize Moody as an impostor, his seeming reliance on 'Harry + ancient magic + prophesy = victory' instead of more practical solutions, etc.)

You come out of that in two ways: first, you can give JKR a pass for the first two books because you realize that they were straight-up children's lit, and children's lit has different rules, and then you cast Dumbledore in the rest of the series as a flawed, decent person who made some tough choices and understood the nature of Riddle better than anyone else.

Or, you cast him in a negative light: either a deluded old fool whose naive reliance on storybook tropes are the first signs of creeping dementia, or as a straight-up villain bent on controlling the wizarding world to some (usually vaguely outlined) utopian end, with a master plan so intricate and so involved in Harry's life that he sets up Harry's friends and House allegiances before he even steps through the barrier onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.

** His absolute failure to ensure that Sirius got a trial, with a few offhand remarks at a party he could have got the ball rolling. His placement of Harry at the Dursleys where he never once checked up on him, or rather what he said in HBP "I knew I was condemning you...." The whole chamber of secrets fiasco. In Order of the Phoenix where he basically ignored Harry, and allowed his PTSD to worsen (Though wizards are dumb they might not have known), still he never once helped Harry at all. In HPB he did a poor job of preparing Harry. And then in DH when he left them with basically nothing. Also keeping Snape as a teacher.

Now, I dont truly hate him those reasons I listed can be used for bashing him or humanizing him. His mistakes in judgement are often VERY magnified because of the importance that all of Wizarding Britain and the main characters give him, so when he messes up its a big deal. He could be really manipulative. I tend to believe that he is truly dedicated to the cause of the "light", but he is too willing to achieve his own ends, and his attitude tends to overrule others rather than take them into account.

Without using any knowledge that Dumbledore did not possess at the time, can you honestly think of an alternative?

He believed Voldemort might be legilimizing/possessing/etc Harry. If he said "sorry Harry I gotta ignore you this year but dont worry ily," Voldemort might've heard that too and it would ruin everything.

For me, its this sort of issue that actually takes center stage on my list of reasons I think Dumbledore is... complicated. He's a terrible Headmaster during Harry's time there because his focus is on other things. Important things, but not things that a Headmaster of a school should be doing. I think that people are on Dumbledore's case a lot because we see him primarily in his capacity of the job he kinda lets fall by the way side in his preparations for the coming war.

** The obvious explanation is that a lot of writers are teenagers to whom the idea of angsty rebellion appeals.

More generally, people fail to give due weight to Dumbledore's reasons. E.g. placing Harry with the Dursleys. Yes, Harry was not happy there. But Dumbledore tells us in OotP that it was essentially a choice between Dursleys and death. Dumbledore believed that the blood protection was the only magic that could effectively defend Harry.

Dumbledore bashers choose to simply ignore that explanation with incredulity. I've never felt incredulity to be much of an argument. Dumbledore knows far more about the workings of magic and the 1981 political situation than any reader. If, in his judgement, Harry was likely to die in any other situation, it seems like we must accept that.

It's much the same for all the other accusations people chuck at Dumbledore. Explanations exist, the bashers simply choose to ignore them. As for why they do so? See above: teenage rebellion.

*** Someone once posted in a topic like this to point out how old Dumbledore was. Basically they said that when he grew up, the Dursley's treatment of Harry wasn't abuse. I thought that was insightful. Times change and so does child raising.

I also think fanfiction writers inflate the abuse Harry receives. He is abused, I'm not denying that. But he is not beaten, raped, and screamed at every day. The Dursley's neglect him, confine him, give him work a child would have nowadays, hit him with a frying pan once, verbally abusive, etc. FF doesn't think that's bad enough for some reason (!) so they escalate it and then Dumbledore might be a monster for leaving him to it.

*** I think another part of the issue is that, well, the Dursleys do /not/ fit the common picture of an abusive household. They're quite good at hiding it, and Harry is resilient and unwilling to show weakness by nature. As much as angsty teenagers would not like to believe it, there ARE people that slip through the cracks, even when circumstances are conducive to it going the other way. These are people that /need/ someone to blame because they aren't ready to accept that.

On top of that, the issue of Petunia and Harry really could have gone two different ways. Petunia's hatred of magic wasn't what it appeared-- it was /jealousy/. How common is it that parents, unable to live the lives they wanted to live, live vicariously through their children when they find that they have better circumstances and abilities than they had? Especially when Petunia was so obviously doting and spoiling towards her Dudley-- I wouldn't peg a doormat like her as a potential child abuser, especially if I came from a time period where children were seen and not heard.

It might be hard to see, as someone that has read through the books and has seen what she is capable of, but if you put yourself in Dumbledore's position... She really hadn't demonstrated that yet at all. Sure, she hated her sister, but that's (unfortunately) relatively common, and not really a red flag. Hell, had Dumbledore even interacted with or heard from Petunia at /all/ since her letters asking to attend Hogwarts? Lily doesn't seem like the kind of person to badmouth her sister. Maybe to James or Severus in her worse moments, but not Dumbledore.

**** You make a very good argument for why Harry fell through the cracks as a young child, but what about after he came to Hogwarts.

Shouldn't the signs of neglect & abuse been picked up by Pomphrey in one of the times that Harry was in her care? Or by any of the other professors at the school that interact with Harry on at least a weekly basis?

Why doesn't anything come of Fred, George, and Ron telling their parents that they had to pull bars off Harry's window and that his door was locked from the outside? Weren't those same locks still on the door when the Order shows up to take Harry to Grimmauld Place?

There were definitely opportunities for someone to release what was actually going on at Privet Drive. And after OotP, it should have been clear to Harry that he was not really protected there from outside influences unless he was physically in the house.

While you have a point, that's still not a justification - Harry Potter was /literally/ a victim of child abuse. If Dumbledore noticed that, he /could/ have done something to make the Dursleys less abusive, without destroying the blood wards. Like sending the Dursleys to therapy.

People who abuse their significant others tend not to respond to therapy well. They might improve temporarily, but it almost never lasts. I don't see why child abuse would be any different. Vernon would likely be sufficiently angered by having to go to a magical therapist, or by any therapist at all, that he would have turned to even more potent abuse.

Dumbledore could alternatively have assigned a house elf to care for and protect Harry, and told it to remain unseen when possible. Prevent the symptoms rather than trying to cure the cause.

While Dumbledore probably was very busy, he could easily have checked in every year or two (in the guise of a business associate of Vernon's or a friend of Mrs Figg's if necessary, he must be able to alter his appearance and dress to be more Muggle) on how they were treating Harry. He could come over for a cup of tea, chat to Harry about his schoolwork, use Legilemency to see how Harry's treated. If anything worrying comes up, he has a private word with Petunia etc; the whole affair would take an hour at most and could have prevented a lot of stuff, like Harry's being /locked in a cupboard./ I've always thought Harry was stunningly well-adjusted for being a victim of the stuff described in PS.

Given that Dumbledore also believed the prophecy to be true as long as those it affected acted on it, it should have been a choice between Harry being abused by the Dursleys and Harry being abducted and maybe tortured or something if he stayed in the wizarding world. You know, if you consider the whole "either MUST die at the hand of the other" business. If Dumbledore wanted to, he could have raised Harry himself to make sure that nobody did him any harm. I don't like stories that bash Dumbledore, I understand that he presumably wanted Harry to grow up away from fame and among muggles to make sure Harry knew them to be real human beings as well, but if Dumbledore wanted to he could have taken a different approach. I agree with Lane_Anasazi that when it comes to the first few books, or, in my opinion the books in general, we also have to take into consideration that JKR was writing a children's book/adventure book and had to make choices that kept things interesting.

If Voldemort had returned in secret when Harry was 5 his normal life at the Dursleys would have been over too though. Voldemort knew the muggle world, it shouldn't be a problem for him to snatch Harry away from school. Or did the blood protection protect him from that too? (I honestly wonder how it worked. Was it just the house or was it more that Harry was undetectable for Voldemort and his followers as long as he lived there?

********** All these arguments about how great the blood wards were... Harry suffered there. He was protected there. Which was the objective and which was a side effect?

The end of fourth year tells us the truth of the matter. Voldemort was resurrected using harry's blood, the very thing that supposedly powered the protection. Where before he had burned on contact, proving that the protection was active, afterwards he could touch him with impunity. Clear proof that the protection was rendered useless. And yet Harry was forced to go back.

Obviously the primary reason for him being there was to suffer and be put down, any protection (If there even was any) was merely a side effect. Else why send him back after it is proven that the so called protections are useless?

And no, the protection's weren't "Still keeping him hidden", after all, Umbridge did manage to get two dementors to attack him in the area, obviously both her and the dementors meant him harm, so it may as well have just been a bunch of death eaters popping in for all the difference it makes. Even if we give dumbles the benefit of the doubt that he didn't realize, he SHOULD have after the summer, and found a better place for him after 5th year.

Assuming he was a good guy trying to do the best to protect harry, and not just make him suicidal. If protection was truly the goal, he should have moved harry somewhere else. Grimmauld place would have been great. Wards, fidelius, Sirius, friends... so much safer and happier then an abusive household with useless wards and a single guard (some of whom aren't even trustworthy.)

Seriously, what was Tonks, Remus, or heaven forbid Dungwhathisname going to do if a couple death eaters dropped in on the front lawn at 1am, and cast fiendfire on the house?

** Look at Albus's final plan:

- Drive Harry to suicide-by-dark-lord.
- Hope that a quirk of magic gives him the option of returning to life.
- Hope that this person who just committed suicide chooses to return to life.
- Hope that he then manages to kill the Dark Lord.

So, to make Harry suicidal, he had him abused as a child, kept him away from any possible loving family and pseudo-family (Remus, Sirius), and repeatedly exposed him to harm -- oh, wait, that's evil Dumbledore. We were saying a /good/, skilful Dumbledore. Sorry, I'm all out of those.

A somewhat different version of the books would have permitted a good Dumbledore much more easily:

- Dumbledore shows Harry the ring horcrux. He tells him that it's unfortunate, but the ring and stone will probably be destroyed when they destroy the horcrux; only a spell from a horcrux's creator can cleanse it without damaging it.
- Harry plans the final battle around his own temporary death. Multiple people carry fake wands. Harry signals them; they swap wands; Harry baits a killing curse out of Voldemort.
- Harry dies.
- Everyone surrenders.
- Harry comes back a few minutes later. He casts a piercing hex at Voldemort's head.
- Everyone on his side with a wand left summons their allies' wands and distributes them while the Death Eaters are distracted by Harry's return.
- Battle resumes. Voldemort is mortal.

For earlier in the series, you can get a good Dumbledore with only a few lapses if (a) you eliminate the child abuse, (b) you assume he was following Harry around during the most dangerous bits using a time turner and invisibility cloak, (c) Alastor Moody wasn't his acquaintance, or at least not his friend, and (d) the Philosopher's Stone was a fake. This still leaves Sirius's lack of trial as the worst offense, with a handful of others.

** A lot of the responses here explain how stupid dumbels plan was, and relied so heavily on luck. A lot of defenses to that seem to be that "It worked".

It only worked because the light had the power of plot on their side, causing protagonists to have bouts of plot induced luck, and bad guys to have bouts of plot induced stupidity. (If voldie had been trying, he could have easily killed harry in the summer after 4th or 5th year).

To give an example, if a terrorist is fleeing through a crowded area, and I decide the best way to kill him is the liberally spray the general area with automatic fire... Even if by some insane amount of luck, I manage to kill ONLY the terrorist, and nobody else, I will still be fucking insane, and maybe even 'evil' since I apparently don't care about potential collateral damage.

Rally, evil dumbles is the lower end of dumbles bashing anyway. Him wanting to let harry die, and then finish the fight himself for greater glory... no, it works with some fics i guess, but it's about as reasonable as fudge thinking dumbles is after his position. If he really wanted that much power, he could have simply claimed he killed voldie himself to begin with.

Much better for the category, is more along the lines of "Old and maybe senile puppet master". He's been guiding the world for a really long time, and is used to people following his lead, used to having to plan everything himself. He has this plan, that has no chance of working at all unless a higher power (such as the author) forces it to work. But he's absolutely determined that it's the only way, failing to realize it's insane. Whether that's caused by senility, confundus, misplaced trust in divination, or something else... And he fights tooth and nail and will go to extremes to make sure that it is followed out to the letter. And if anyone involved notices how insane the plan is, or takes offense to their role in it... well tough luck.

** Everyone else has gone over the main points. I'd like to add that Dumbledore had 3 positions of power and did not have the time to dedicate to any of them AND he also took on defeating Voldemort because he was Obviously the only one able to do so.

He was a crappy headmaster, a crappy Mugwump and a crappy Chief Warlock because each of those should have been a 40 hour a week job at the least.

The only conclusion I can come to after reading all of the books, is that he has a superiority complex and all of society seems to enable him. He had a grand plan and he stuck to it no matter what might have worked better and no matter the glaring holes in his plot...

Much like JKR actually

#+end_quote

The whole Elder Wand thing is slightly off, iirc Dumbledore wanted Snape killing him voluntarily because that way the line of the Elfer Wand would break and it would belong to no one at all, thus making it unusable. That Malfoy disarmed him before getting beaten by Harry was pure chance and not at all Dumbledore's plan.

Which of course makes me wonder how Dumbledore had imagined Harry would defeat Voldemort. After all it only worked becuase of Voldemort's own Avada Kedavra... How should Harry have kileld him without that, with Expelliarmus? (Seriously, that boy lacks any kind of offensive spells to kill... Which might have been JKRs point but was still highly stupid when fighting a war... [although of course one can kill with Incendio, Diffindo or Confringo but I guess Voldemort would deflect these spells easily... And Harry might not have thought of that.])

**** I certainly wouldn't argue as I really don't know what was going on :P but yeah my thought was that Voldemort only /just/ managed not to kill any/all Minvera, Slughorn, and Shackelbolt(?) because of love protection /and/ because he hadn't mastered the wand AND the same for Harry; so if Voldemort did master it - Game Over Man. I suppose if Dumbledore planned everything else I would think he would want to at least make sure the wand had no chance of falling into Voldemorts hands (ie destroyed or hidden better or set it up so Harry was master...somehow).

** Dumbledore is setting Harry up to fail. First he sends him to the Dursleys, who abuses him for ten years. Yes, they abuse him. Abuse doesn't need to be violent or even physical.

Knowing that Harry /must/ confront Voldemort, Dumbledore then trains up Harry ... no, he doesn't. Harry receives most of his DADA training from a /Death Eater/! Two Death Eaters, actually.

And it all culminates with Harry having to sacrifice himself. It's a Rube Goldberg setup with a million possibilities of going wrong.

I see Dumbledore as an overly optimistic chess master playing with everyone as his pawns.

#+end_quote

What would be the point of that? Harry is not as talented at learning and doing general magic as Tom Riddle [1], nor as ruthless about applying it. Even if he were, Voldemort has several decades' head start. Clearly, Harry is not going to overcome Voldemort with force. A hypothetical Harry raised and trained to be a killing machine would face Voldemort in a pitched battle and lose.

However, Harry has the Power That [Voldemort] Knows Not, the power that had protected him the first time around, stopping an unstoppable curse: self-sacrificing love. That's not something that can be "trained up". It can only be /cultivated/ through friendships, relationships, teamwork, play, shared experiences, and all the other things that Harry actually does while at Hogwarts. Intensive training in violence would take away from all these things, so it would, in fact, /cripple/ his capacity to defeat Voldemort.

Harry's ultimate survival was, indeed, very much a Hail Mary pass. However, and especially with no better options, it's perfectly rational to make Hail Mary passes in a universe which has an actual, empirically verifiable St. Mary who has unambiguously interceded on your behalf in the past. (With apologies to any Catholics reading this.)

[1] Before anyone mentions Dursleys as crippling Harry's potential, remember that Riddle grew up in a British orphanage in the 30s: far from the most stimulating or nurturing of environments.

That doesn't sound right. Voldemort could have ignored the prophecy, but he chose to act on it and therefore gave it power over himself. However, he wasn't "relying" on it or "banking" on it in any meaningful way: Harry was just another obstacle that he had learned about and set out to eliminate. It wouldn't be his first, and it wouldn't be his last. Hypothetically, even if the prophecy had been a complete fiction, and if sacrificial protection weren't in effect, it would have caused him to waste an evening, not utterly destroy his plans.

Once the prophecy was in effect, however, /of course/ it was in Dumbledore's and Harry's interest to make Voldemort run up against it again and again and again.

Ah, but the pony exists, and it just trampled the scariest wizard alive like he was nothing. Be nice to the pony.

I've outlined above why I think that giving Harry extra combat training wouldn't have helped him against Voldemort. And, even a modest amount of it would have imposed a sort of a militaristic mindset that would have turned off the proverbial pony, because it would be implicitly accepting Voldemort's rules and moral framework (i.e., "There is no good or evil, only power and those too weak to seek it." [1]).

I think the problem with this argument is that Dumbledore's plan was heavily relying on various things happening that very well could have gone wrong. And in that case, everything would have been for naught.

Dumbledore was basically gambling with Harry's life. Yes, it did work as intended, giving Harry a Happy End. But Dumbledore could not have known that, thus he relied heavily on chance. Just like buying a lottery ticket. Of course, if you don't wind the lottery you have only lost a bit money. If Dumbledore's plan had failed, there would have been many deaths and Harry could have died so many times...

I think that's the main problem with the "but it worked" argument. It was a /huge/ risk and no one could have known beforehand that it would work...

But I think a lot of readers (and thus fanfiction writers?) want to identify with Harry and can't... in this particular aspect anyway. This is a kid who's been raised to die, and goes willingly to his death. Since (we?) don't have that same level of resigned acceptance that Harry does, we tend to lash out at the man who would be willing to put us in this situation. If I ever accidentally SI'd, the first thing I'd do is cross my fingers and check a mirror... hoping that I'm not Harry, but if I was, I'd spend as much time as I could trying to muck the whole bloody deck.

Granted, I'm not entirely convinced the British wizarding world didn't deserve what they would have gotten if Harry walked away...

******** Hang on... come back... I had something when I made my comment last week... I just somehow forgot about this debate until just now...

The biggest thing that I think got left to chance was that Harry turned out to be a good person. This isn't even necessarily predicated on his reacting badly to the abuse at home and going off the dark end...

- After all, he was raised by the same people who gave us Dudley... what if Harry turned out just like Dudley, or more likely Dudley's lieutenant in delinquency due to relative size. Snape would happily inform you that the Potter genes make this all too likely.

- Harry's solution to most problems in his early life was to run away from Dudley. Standing up for himself and fighting for whats right was no where in his early childhood curriculum. How/Why Harry went from that to solving mysteries and confronting Dark Lords is anyone's guess. Perhaps it was Gryffindor's reputation rubbing off on him?

- IIRC: Harry /chose/ Gryffindor to avoid Malfoy, I'm not sure we can say that was something Dumbledore had anything to do with that. If Malfoy had simply done nothing... Harry might have been wearing green and the whole ballgame changes. (or not, depending on the author)
