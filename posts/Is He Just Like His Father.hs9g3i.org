The abuse Severa Snape suffered at the hands of the Marauders was... different than her male counterpart. Much of it ignored or brushed aside by staff, in some cases due to her tormentors blood status, leaving her embarassed and ashamed to come forward to anyone else. She was grateful she was able to walk away from it all with some shred of her dignity (as they wouldn't sully themselves with a Dark Witch, and had some level of humanity to not take things too far), but the things they did would always JUST skirt the line of...

Regardless, when Lily began showing interest in James (the chief of her attackers) she was heartbroken and enraged. Inadvertently escalating the destruction of their friendship as she was unable to articulate WHY she felt so betrayed. Thus, Lily Potter died never knowing...

Upon seeing Harry in the Great Hall all those years later, she was met with conflicting emotions. She was quick to write him off as a clone of his father and treated him as such, though she kept a much closer eye on him to ensure he didn't pull anything.

Unfortunately that lead to conflicting feelings. As he had not only Lily's eyes, but he acted as she did down to mannerisms. Her dearest, truest friend in the body of her worst enemy.

Her desire to keep the last remnant of Lily alive, her mission to defend the BWL in the shadows whilst openly antagonising him and her closeted desire to make James Potter feel as powerless and weak as she once did... these thoughts fought within her whenever her eyes set on the boy she wished had just died all those years ago, if only to not continue to torment her.

Just like his father...

However, when she was able to screw her head on straight and think clearly, Harry was openly (if shyly) displaying an interest in 4th year Cho Chang. Severa did what she could to drag the little twerp aside to explain the do's and do nots of the fairer sex. A stern, no nonsense figure who was (contradictory) softer in those private moments, when she dragged him off to detention, than at any point otherwise.

Inadvertently she revealed much of her own experiences (though Harry was far too young to understand what exactly she'd let slip) and he didn't mean to highlight the lack of love and immense pain and humiliation he'd endured at the Dursley's. The final nail in the coffin for Snape's desire...

He'd suffered enough.

*(The only Harry/Snape fic I'd ever considered writing)*


** Harry/Snape freaks me out...but an interesting concept of Snape relating to Harry.

I will say there's nothing to indicate the Marauders were at all rapey---actually, Snape's crowd is more implied to be so when Lily mentions Severus and Nott and Mary---and JK said the animosity between James and Snape was largely based on his thing for Lily. I'm not sure it would ever go beyond some sniping, like there was on the train, if Snape was a girl.

*** Yeah I was being purposefully vague but I wasn't trying to imply outright rape, but sexual harassment of a different sort.

**** I can sort of see that if it was mild--especially because sadly sexual harassment was downright common back in the 70s and even in the world of HP JK frankly writes several beloved characters as borderline harassers. Not just that... I'm a woman and I think Hermione's behavior towards Ron when he's with Lavender is frankly creepy even if they were supposed to be 16 year olds.

I do think a female Severus would be interesting also in a way because someone once said Severus and James were basically in a dumb, dick swinging contest in addition to James bullying him and that James checked out of eventually during his seventh year but Severus never did and in some ways that led to him being his worst self. I'm not blaming James's bullying at all for Severus joining the Death Eaters---that was a terrible choice and on him and I dislike when the fandom makes excuses for him basically joining a magical hate group..esp. since he wasn't indoctrinated from birth like Draco & knew there were decent muggles (Lily's parents). BUT I do think a Severus who wasn't obsessively in love with Lily, who didn't have this burning resentment towards James over Lily, and who wanted to feel power after being bullied at home and school...might not have joined the Death Eaters. He clearly disliked muggles to a certain extent (Lily calling him out for using the word mudblood in the flashback at other ppl besides her, his attitude towards Petunia when they first met) but I don't know if he would have been so drawn to power. Also, were women even recruited as heavily as men were?

Severus as a girl could have had a totally different future.

*TBH not to get overly SJW, but James and Severus both in a way were big examples of male privilege. James felt the ability to pressure Lily publicly for dates despite her turning him down all the time and ignores her telling him no and can't accept that she's friends with Severus (I think he does cut it out in the 6th year if I remember correctly, but still yikes)....Severus ignores Lily telling him that Nott's actions towards Mary were "creepy" (which I always thought implied some sort of rapey scenario) & never accepts that she made her own choices or why she made her own choices (e.g. he blames her for cutting their friendship off because of Potter, and not the fact that he was using slurs and already in with dark magic...and keeps referring to her as "Evans" nd even tears a photo of her with Harry to keep just the image of Lily like he was erasing her choice to have a child and a family.)
