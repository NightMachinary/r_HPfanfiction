Petunia Evans tries to get into new-age stuff in college to fill the gap left by her lack of magic. Meditation turns out to really help with her deep-seated psychological issues, and she ends up embracing the whole peace and love thing. Flash forward to the early 1980s, when Dumbledore leaves Harry on her doorstep in the middle of the night. How would things turn out if Harry Potter was raised by a burnt-out former flower child?


** !remindme 2d

A bit of this is in “Reboot by Kallanit” linkffn(9552519), where Petunia turns to be a painter.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
