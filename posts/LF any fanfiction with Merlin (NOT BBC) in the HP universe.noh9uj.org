Hello! I need some fanfictions with Merlin in HP universe - my only condition is that it's NOT the BBC Merlin. I adore all cliche stories with Harry being the heir of founders and Merlin or Merlin teaching Harry magic. But, like I said, I accept everything as long as it's... Well, long. Which is minimum 20k.


** Well how about Harry teaching Merlin?

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

**** There's linkao3(Only A Boy by RiddellLee), which I've not read for ages but I think is part of a series now. I remember linkao3(Harry Potter and the Return of Merlin by luminare91) being a good read too.

Also not a HP fic but a fantastic read is linkao3(The Student Prince by FayJay).

  Plot: Merlin had fulfilled his destiny. Albion was alive and beautiful, and magic was no longer feared in the land. But nothing ever lasts, does it? Memories gone, and in his ten-year-old form once more, he's traveled over a thousand years in the future. Now, he has a new destiny: He has to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, hide the fact that he's Merlin, and defeat a Dark Lord that's messing with magic he knows nothing about.Pairings: Not determined but probably not canon [secondary to plot]Rating: Teen [some swearing]Disclaimer: I own nothing except my original characters and ideas.

  ** Incomplete and discontinued for revision. New Version to be posted ** The moment Voldemort regained his body, the Old Religion cried out. For the first time in more than a thousand years, Merlin is called from the forward to right the balance once more. Disguised as a fifth year student, he must fight to stop Voldemort when it is not his destiny to do so.

It's not that I can't spell, or that I'm perversely writing him out of character - I incorporated other characters from Arthurian legend (Kay, Gawain etc) into my story, and lacking prophetic abilities, my versions naturally don't mesh with the versions subsequently introduced into the show.::
