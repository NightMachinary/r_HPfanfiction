I enjoy H/Hr but am open to reading just about any pairing. I love when the main character (can be anyone, really) goes back to their younger body with knowledge of the future. There are a lot of poorly written ones, though, so I'm hoping for some long, well written suggestions!! Thanks!


** If you mean efficiently 'fixing' things up, then:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]*, linkffn(10871795): A great story showing how 'Hermione traveling back to Marauder Era should have worked'. Instead of physically traveling back, Hermione sends her memories and powers to her 2 year old body, or 42 days before the Halloween event. Hilarity ensued, but also heart-breaking moments.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]]*, linkffn(4740107): This is the only completed 'Ginny went back alone' fic. She got rid of Voldemort quite efficiently, but had more trouble with her own love life.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]]*, linkffn(4655545): the brutal war turned Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan into very disturbed people. When Hermione found a way to send their memories and powers back 20 years, they unleashed hell upon their enemies. Lots of dark humors.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]]*, linkffn(10687059): is mostly from Hermione's POV on a time-traveling Harry, and how she came to terms with what Harry did. It's a very nice H/Hr romance, too.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]]*, linkffn(7405516): to be honest, that story is not very well written as it contains quite a few typos and grammar errors, but is one of my 'guilty pleasure' fics. I just love the way the Trio and a 5 day old Rose handled their unexpected time travel back to 1991. They finished off Voldemort in almost record time (only one fic had it done quicker), without any angst and all those 'must keep timeline' nonsense.

*** The claim that only one fic has finished off Voldy quicker is just factually incorrect. I assume the other you have noted is The Unforgiving Minute, but then linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal) and linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) both kill him off in a shorter time span and I assume there are many more.

** linkffn(The Hogwarts Strike Team). The premise and first half is great. However it's probably abandoned and gets angsty right where it cuts off. It's H/Hr, Post-DH (minus the epilogue), and very focused on defeating Voldemort. And Occlumency is very well portrayed---it had more of an effect on the user than just throwing up a shield.

I like time travel fics but it's always a bit disappointing when they start revealing their secrets. It's much more fun to watch everyone else's amazement at their unexplained knowledge. The social dance dies when the secrets come out.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  In the station between Life and Death Harry makes a different choice. Now he is eleven again, nothing is going the same as before, and people are starting to ask questions, especially the Malfoys, the Hogwarts professors and, most worryingly, Mad-Eye Moody. Harry is beginning to suspect that he might not be up to this Master of Death business and everything that goes along with it.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

**** It hasn't updated since before the first time I read it back in 2014. But yes, I believe the most recent chapters are pretty good. This story, and A Long Journey Home, are the two stories that I would love to be able to push a magic button and have completed. But, I realize that life happens, and sometimes a writer's muse leaves for a while, and I am happy with what has been posted thus far.
