Hello! I'm here asking for fanfictions where the laws of time are similar to those in /The Debt of Time/ by ShayaLonnie, and I've really wanted to read another time travel fic like this.

The main character has to be Hermione please!

Most time travel ffs I've read or seen, Hermione goes to the past and changes the timeline and stays in the new timeline.

I'd like to see something where she's thrown back and maybe tries to change things, but they happen anyways because it turns out her meddling is what caused the thing to happen. Something where Hermione eventually finds her way home, and then finds out that the people from the Marauder's Era knew it was her but had to wait until she came back to the present to talk about it?

I like the way Hermione comes back to the present timeline and how Sirius and Remus knew her the entire time and couldn't tell her.

Coming back to the present is a must!

I like how ShayaLonnie did it where the present day had a whole part after Hermione comes back. Something where /at least/ 25% of it takes place in present time. So this is a must.

Id like a story where Hermione falls in love with a character from the Marauder's Era, and they figured out it it was /their/ Hermione in the present day?

I've read /Pride of Time/, but Hermione doesn't go back to her own timeline, she just exists and hides as little Hermione grows up. I don't want something like that.

Characters I'd prefer to read paired with Mione:

Sirius Severus Lucius Remus

I really can't find any time travel fics like this, so I figured I'd post here!

I'd prefer a romance, but a cute story where they become best friends is also acceptable. :p

Also, please have have some adventure or something other than romance in there please; I /lovvee/ plot.

Has to be a long fic, with the whole time travel thing I'd expect it to be longer. Preferably 100k+ words. Minimum is 30k!

Thank you!


** Hermione is one of the MC's (she and Harry travel back in time) linkao3(4340120) One of my absolute favorites, pairing Remus/Hermione and Sirius/Harry. They travel back to the future eventually and (Spoiler: Future!Sirius is already dead at that point but Remus isn't)

  Broken and angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with some all too familiar faces. Will the time with lost loved ones heal Harry or end up doing more damage?

** The Way Home by Miss Grace O'Malley

Lots of stuff clearly borrowed from DoT/Shaya but still a decent read. It covers everything you've asked for: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12021318/1/]]

I can't remember what proportion of it happens in the future but unless I'm mixing it up with something else, there's quite a few chapters.

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  Blake's new neighbor is beautiful, gregarious, and definitely NOT interested in someone as boring as herself - no matter how much her imagination loves to think otherwise. Yang's new neighbor is gorgeous, reserved, and shy enough that she worries about being too forward...so she finds another way for them to get to know each other.
