Im in the mood for fics where Harry doesn't put up with the greasy bastards bullying and smacks him down. Verbal or spellvise, gets him fired/defanged, boycotts his class, kills Snape in amusing ways etc. As long as Harry Bashes snape in all the best ways possible :)


** Almost anything by robst, probably.

*** If you want one that's slightly less /shit/ the Denarian Renegade has a chuckle inducing one. There's something entertaining about this trope being shamelessly taken to it's logical conclusion.

i.e It's all right Snape, I do accept genuflection. You don't even need to be catholic to appreciate that.

#+begin_quote
  The Founders found a way of putting powerful safeguards into their bloodlines. Now, as Harry faces off against the shade of Tom Riddle and the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, the Sorting Hat causes one of those safeguards to activate. The result means Harry Potter is now Salazar Slytherin and the most misunderstood Founder is the Boy-Who-Lived.
