I found a couple on TV Tropes where Harry accidentally bonded with Ginny to save her life in the chamber and I really liked the way their relationship developed as they learned to cope with the bond. I was wondering if there were any others like them


** There's quite a few.

It'd help if you listed which ones you read. The only soulbond I can think of that's listed on TV Tropes is Bonds of Blood but I can't link that one (Rule 8).

For now, my recommendation would be linkffn(9818387) The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond, which is basically a more cracky and SFW version of Bonds of Blood - though sadly, it's been abandoned.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

** Bunch. Some well thought out. Though sometimes they get too sexual, too soon.
