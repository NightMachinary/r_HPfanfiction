So, in a lot of fanfiction, we can see the heros using some kind of ritual to "clean" an Horcruxe while preversing the initial enchantments of the founders. Some other times, the heros use the killing curse, killing the soul while preserving the item.

Yet, canon say that Horcruxes are the opposite of souls, not only meaning that the item carrying it /needs/ to be destroyed, but also (implying) that the killing curse (that seems to target the soul while not touching the body) would not work. So, in canon, Dark Wizard use a lot of enchantments to protect their Horcruxes, forcing the heros to use very destructive substances and spells (like basilisk venom) to destroy the Horcruxes despite their protections.

â€‹

So my questions is : /What would happen if a Curse Breaker took down the protection?/

Let's say a curse breaker find Tom Riddle diary, and decide to slowly take down every protection cast on it before throwing it into a mundame fire. Would the diary be repairable with a simple Reparo once the Horcruxe destroyed? Or would the Horcruxe "corrupt" the item making it effectively cursed and unreparaible? And in the case the item can later be repaired, would the initial enchantment (like on Ravenclaw's diadem) still be present?


** Depends on what the plot needs.

** It was my understanding that the indestructibility was inherent to /being/ a Horcrux to begin with.

That said, I believe they had a scene in Bungle in the Jungle that had this premise, where Bill Weasley undid the protections on a horcrux that was a crystal ball, and they just rolled it off a cliff.

*** With all the fic I read, I'm not even sure if this is canon or not, but from what I remember, Horcruxe does not offer any additional protection to an item and this is the wizard responsability to prepare a suitable receptacle, resistant enough for it.

Like, for example, Voldemort's Horcruxe may have been Basilisk venon resistant if he had found enough Phoenix's tears when he created them.

**** That doesn't really mesh with the lore, which is that all Horcruxes are similarly invulnerable. If it were the wizard's own responsibility, there would certainly be those whose protections were more mediocre.

** I'm pretty sure it doesn't actually matter. Hermione says something when laying it all out about how horcruxes need to be destroyed "beyond magical repair," so it's not about the fact that the objects that house the soul fragments are indestructible, but rather that destroying the object with anything less than basilisk venom or fiendfyre or whatever all else would work in canon that wasn't explicitly mentioned is a waste of time.
