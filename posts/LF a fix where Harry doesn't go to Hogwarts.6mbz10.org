Bonus points if he's a time traveller or from another universe.

Because, honestly, why would he want to go to school again.

Edit: fml... first post to [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] and my title gets autocorrected to fix instead of fics.


** In Dimensional or Time Travels, Harry had generally gone to Hogwarts in his home dimension or original time line. Some fics have him going to Hogwarts in later years. The following fics however, feature Harry who had NEVER gone to Hogwarts:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Extreme AU. A more cunning and sinister Lucius Malfoy managed to kick out Dumbledore after Halloween 1981, and had ruled magical Britain for the next 18 years. Dumbledore would however make his return after the next generation graduated from Beauxbaton. He and Sirius prepared Harry extensively for the eventual showdown with Malfoy and Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Another extreme AU, even in Muggle world. James and Lily got in a lucky shot on Voldemort and ran off with Harry to the Continent. Harry never went to Hogwarts and made his career in the Muggle military. When Spain attacked Gibraltar in 2008, he saw his opportunity arriving... It's a 660k words long epic full of strategies, tactics, politics, and intrigues.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): After Voldemort's defeat, Harry hired Ginny to accompany him on some adventures.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** This one is an AU where Harry is blinded by Voldemort's curse. It causes some interesting side effects. to say the least. Harry (and Hermione after first year) never attends Hogwarts. linkffn(10937871)

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** linkffn(The Ilvermorny Champion) Harry goes to Ilvermorny, only comes back to Britian for the Twiwizard Tournament.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.
