Looking for any story where harry can fly under his own power. No suits. No brooms. Just a natural(or unnatural) part of him. Also no crossovers with dc or marvel in the sense i won't mind a crossover with superman, but not justice league. If it is a crossover of any singular superhero story like flash, superman, iron man etc... I want the story itself to be in it's own bubble.


** In linkffn(Rise of Wizards; Abraxas) I think he can fly but i dont remember

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** I don't understand why flying was so big of a thing in canon, Rowling always added these arbitrary limits to magic. Can't Conjure Food, but you can duplicate it. I honestly don't understand why people didn't just create 'wing' spells that allowed you to have wings for a short time and fly with them. We've also seen several telekinetic and levitation feats in the story itself, saying that no other wizard, other than Voldemort, was capable of such a thing, is laughable.

*** If Voldemort was the only example, I can see why it would be difficult. From all accounts, he flew on a smokey dark cloak sort of deal. What that looks like to me, is him continuously transfiguring himself into a gaseous state and controlling him motion that way.

*** In the book only voldermort could and in the movies i wouldn't consider that true flight. From the looks of it i would say they could only do it in short bursts. For about ten minutes i would put it.

I want harry to be able to sleep while flying. For it to be so natural that he doesn't have to think about it.

***** Yes. Snape was the only one capable of flight in the books apart from voldermort.

P.S. JKR said in a twitter post that wizards didn't actually truly need brooms for flight or wands for magic if they had enough talent or worked hard enough. She said there more like tools to make things easier so technically every witch/wizard is capable of true flight.

****** Indeed. Also I am ignoring the later movies' shenanigans with the smokey-Death-Eaters, because the designers obviously confused Apparation with flight and represented both the same way, but /Philosopher's Stone/ shows Quirrel flying briefly during the final confrontation, and I actually think it's a pretty good, plausible addition. Quirrel was Voldemort's only resort and the one whose body he was inhabiting, so it makes sense Voldemort would /want/ to teach him, and Quirrel is described as having been "a brilliant student" so I wouldn't put it past his capabiltiies.
