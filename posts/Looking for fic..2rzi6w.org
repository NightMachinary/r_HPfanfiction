It's an AU where Grindalwalt is THE dark lord and Voldemort is his apprentice. And at that one fatal halloween it was Grindalwalt who "died" to Neville, makeing him The-Boy-Who-Lived. Tom Riddle (No horcruxes and still looking good) then became a teacher at Hogwarts (Dumbles still headmaster). And I seem to remember some fem!harry mixed in but with Older Cannon Harrys experience and knowledge. Oh and Dumbles is dark, or well he uses dark means for The Greater Good. Also it wasn't finished when I read it.
