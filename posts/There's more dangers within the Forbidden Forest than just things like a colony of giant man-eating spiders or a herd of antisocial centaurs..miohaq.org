On quiet, windless nights it can be heard, almost beyond the edge of hearing, the faintest of whispers on otherwise still air. Sometimes, the very trees themselves seem to shift about. And in the very heart of the forest stands something unlike everything else surrounding it; a tree in the vague shape of a man, looking for all the world as if it's in the deepest of slumbers.


** "Thanks for helping me prepare tomorrow's class, Harry. It will be just a moment, an' if we get- quiet!" Hagrid said abruptly, his arm stopping Harry in his tracks. Harry widened his eyes and tried to catch whatever sound had startled Hagrid so badly. He couldn't hear anything strange. He quickly realized that he couldn't hear anything at all.

The forbidden forest stood completely silent. Not a single bird sang, no flies buzzed and the wind died completely, like the trees themselves were holding their breath. And then, after what seemed like hours, it was over. A bird sang in the distance, and the forest came back to life.

"Hagrid, what was that?" Harry nervously asked. Hagrid answered him in a whisper.

"There are things sleeping in the heart of the forbidden forest, Harry. Terrible things, beyond anything we understand. Whenever they toss and turn in their sleep, the entire forest quiets down, because no one wants to know what happens when they wake up..."

** The bonfire crackled merrily away in the pitch dark forest. A thick blanket of ash lying beside the fire stirred and disintegrated, revealing a young man with red hair coughing and trying to stand up. "Bloody hell." An ash-covered Ron Weasley wheezed out between coughs as he struggled to clear his eyes. "Those inferi are something else."

After finally getting his eyesight back, Ron looked around him. "Wait a sec. This is where I took a break yesterday. The hell?" He shook his head "Harry and Hermione must have dragged me here after I passed out. Yeah, that's it, that's it... But where are they?" He asked himself as he looked around. He took his wand out and bathed the clearing in light, hoping to see what was going on. "Okay, this isn't funny anymore guys!" He shouted. "Come out!"

A growl answered him as a massive sabre tooth with bat wings descended into the clearing. Ron had a horrible feeling of familiarity as he saw the hulking feline turn to look right at him. "Wait, didn't we kill you already?" He asked, noticing the scar on its flank where Harry'd nailed it with a cutting curse.

The sabre tooth roared at him. "Okay, that's fair-whoa!" Ron shouted as he rolled out of the way of the tiger's laser eye attack. "Not this time Tigger!" Ron shouted as he threw a /confringo/ at it.

The sabre tooth didn't like that one bit.

Tough, Ron thought. He had no interest in dying today.

** The Forbidden Forest is named that JUST to block the fae's access so close to the school. However, the forest wants the Wild Hunt to return, so it keeps sneaking new unnamed forest in the middle of named areas. One of Hagrid's duties is to patrol the forest and locate and name any new space.
