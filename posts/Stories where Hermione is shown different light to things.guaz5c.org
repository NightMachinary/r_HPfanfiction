Note: I do not hate Hermione, I really love her character. But she can be rather over zealous with certain things, and narrow minded on other things, trying to put logic to the magical world. Though she isn't all about authority, cares about her friends, does and will break rules, if it fits her purpose, which I do appreciate, that she has different side of things. But it'd be nice to see certain things be brought up.

For instance: The House Elves liking being able to serve someone.

Not every Professor liking that she does extra credit. She doesn't have to stop doing extra credit, but her asking her Professors, if they'd appreciate it, would be nice.

Instead of assuming she's right about things, talk to others about different ideas. Like the whole deal with the Potions book, it to me, wasn't cheating, though it was still heavily dangerous, because of certain spells, but if Harry had offered to make copies of the book to other people with the better instructions in the Potion Book, Hermione couldn't argue the cheating aspect.

And other similar things. I love that she cares about creatures like House Elves, but it always made me tilt my head wondering why she didn't strive for better equality to Werewolves, instead. It'd be difficult; maybe just as difficult, but considering she knew Remus Lupin, it just always made me go: Huh?

No Weasley Bashing, No Dumbledore Bashing. People getting upset for a character thing is okay, but not when it's: Weasley's are using Harry's fame and fortune against him. no Ron abusing Hermione, et cetra.

No Perfect Hermione or Perfect characters in general. Realistic or somewhat believable is preferred . For pairings (if any): Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Et Cetra)

Anyone can be the main character, can be oneshots/drabbles/multichapters, can be old or new, can be on any site.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not.


** Harry gets her to relax a lot in Nightmares of Futures Past. FFN took it down, but there's a PDF version on [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/latest/][GitHub]]. Very rarely updated (about every three years) but a really excellent read if you enjoy friendship-building.

** Stories where Hermione gets misconceptions explained to her?

Try linkffn(Life Debts by arekay). Harry explains to Hermione /why/ she was his friend.

Also, linkffn(Scorched Linen by wujy). Dobby explains things to Hermione.

linkffn(Emma's Plan by losthpfanficwriter). Hermione's mother clears Hermione's misconception about who she loves. Cracky.

linkffn(HJG: The Smartest Witch of Her Age? by HarnGin). Hermione's interview with the Unspeakables.

  Different Ending to HBP. Harry's leaving school but doesn't want Ron and Hermione to come with him. Find out why. Rating it T just to be safe. Will probably be a oneshot. Not a Ha/Hr. Slight amount of what might be considered bashing.

  If Harry and Ron never had the heart to tell Hermione that Dobby was taking all of her S.P.E.W. hats, then why did she stop making them? An honest, but heartfelt, encounter late at night in the Gryffindor common room.

  Hermione attends a very one-sided, yet eye-opening, job interview. Some non-canon content; not for Hermione fanatics.
