I've been saying for years that the books would have been radically different if Snape had just gone to a therapist and sorted out his bullshit instead of taking it out on children.

Since this can't be an original idea, I'm looking for a fic someone actually wrote this scenario playing out.

** Honestly they all need therapy. (Love all these characters).

Hermione and her pushiness, her need to be overbearing and self righteous behavior,.

Ron and his jealousy.

Harry and his brooding

Sirius and his messed up family really messed with his morals and right and wrong. Leading to rebellion and doing dangerous stuff to himself and friends but also enemies/people he doesn't like.

Remus and his self hatred.

*** They all do, yeah, but Snape was in such an influential position the whole time.

Remus + Therapy might be interesting, but I don't know how the effects would ripple out.

**** Snape, Remus and Sirius all three need to work out their BS. It was fine as teenagers (even then that's pushing it) but as adults they should know better. And this coming from someone who loves all three characters.

*** Ginny!!!

And yes, there is linkffn(7460529), but I would love to have something more. And I am still angry with JKR, because she completely dropped her ball on the best line in whole heptalogy, ‘“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.', but even better Summer of 1993 stories would be welcome.

  What happened between Ginny and her curse-breaker brother when the Weasleys visited Bill after CoS? Because I never bought the idea that after a mug of hot chocolate, "Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again."

*** Hermione could probably use some help post DH, but the things you mentioned...are just her personality characteristics and immaturity, in my opinion. Life can be her teacher; there's nothing clinically wrong with being a know-it-all.

  Suppose the Marauders torture hadn't driven Snape to Voldemort and he had been the better man. What would the future have looked like? Warning: may now contain DH spoilers.

I don't like canon Snape, I dislike most fandom Snape

I think he's a petty, pathetic character who gets off on abusing children to make himself feel big.

OP asked for fics where Snape got therapy, in this he kinda does or at least counciling

** Snape goes and gets therapy in Shedding Skin, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20589701]])

He seems to start acting pretty differently relatively quick, but maybe it's just me. Still an interesting read tho

  With the Dark Lord comes whispers, and perhaps the most frightening ones of all are those about Severus Snape. Severus Snape who has made men nothing more than blood and bones in duels, but prefers to make his kills from a distance. His potions, shriek the newspapers, can break your mind, shred your soul, and just leave you dead.The Wizarding World roars in triumph when he is captured, but are shocked when he is not imprisoned. Rather than lock away this dark and mysterious power, the Ministry have made the decision to use his capabilities for their own gain. Snape's reputation does not shake. Put to work with the Aurors, he cannot escape what he has done, and does not want to. He delves into spells and potions most wizards could barely comprehend, thankful that at least he is being mentally stretched. But as Dumbledore says, perhaps all the Half Blood Prince needs is love - and he is soon to find it in the unlikeliest of people.   Or: I was frustrated that nobody properly exploited Snape's potential in canon, and then it turned into a whole idea. Updated weekly.
