  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** Well, that kind of happened in DH, when Dumbledore told Harry that he could still come back, therefore facilitating Harry's rise from the dead. Does that count?

(Sorry, couldn't resist.)

--------------

Actually, now that I think about it, that /could/ be a plot point: Harry dies, but becomes a shade due to Voldemort serving as his horcrux, and it's up to his friends to raise him from the dead to fulfill the Prophecy (or just because they'd rather he be alive).

Well that just merged with Shaun of the Dead in my head, where Ron and Hermione keep zombie!Harry in the broom shed outside the Burrow. Ron keeps him around for quidditch pick up games obviously.

Nah, just cast a Confundus on him to make him /think/ that it's a brain. (The opposing team might object to you repainting the equipment.)

  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.
