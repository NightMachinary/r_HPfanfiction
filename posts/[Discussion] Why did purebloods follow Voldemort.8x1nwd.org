In the books it's given, because Rowling needed some representation of evil and blood purists were a good one for a children book (and they are very easy to be associated with Nazis).

But it we look closely at the Magical World we see that all political power is in the hands of purebloods. Muggleborns are just a little fraction of the magical community and as we see with Hermione they are starting to cut their ties with muggle world during Hogwarts years.

Even Light pureblood families prefer to stay away from non-magical relatives:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Are all your family wizards?' asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. ‘Er -- yes, I think so,' said Ron. ‘I think Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.'

  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, chapter 6
#+end_quote

Riddle's anti-muggleborn agenda doesn't make any sense to purebloods, because they already have all the power. In that case Voldemort is a direct threat to them first of all. They don't have any reasons to submit to him, but all reasons to hunt him down as soon as possible.

In fanfiction it often goes to extremes. In order to create more drama authors give even more power to pureblood families. There was a story where muggleborns were like slaves to their pureblood masters by law and Voldemort's agenda still took place and the history was repeated.

Therefore my suggestion of the topic to discuss is "what are the real reasons of purebloods joining Voldemort?"

[Edit]: I started to think that the sentence "joined Voldemort" is too light. The mentioned purebloods didn't join some political group Riddle founded, they knowingly became his slaves by taking his personal mark.


** Why do any bigots bigot?

Because there's always the disenfranchised amongst them who need a minority to blame. Because they might have power on a covert level (Lucius Malfoy's influence over Fudge) but that doesn't mean they don't want it on an overt level. Because /any/ consequences for them are too many consequences. Because the minority having /any/ rights mean they've got too many. Because they project their hatred of the minority on to the minority and expect that if the minority took power they would use the same oppression against their former oppressors so really it's just self defence. Because they don't see minorities as fully human. Because the minorities are /clearly/ less intelligent/capable and thus they should be kept under strict control for their own good.

That and we don't actually have much historical context for the start of Voldemort's rise to power to compare the rights that minorities had then with what we see in the books.

This is something often exaggerated by fanon. Lucius doesn't really step up his Fudge game until GoF, because as of the start of GoF, Lucius has yet to introduce Fudge to Narcissa - they'd never met, before the Quidditch World Cup.

#+begin_quote
  They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

The Death Eaters are, much like modern political parties in the majority of countries in the world, using an idealistic cause/wedge issue/talking point to justify their actions (we are cleansing the impurities from the wizarding world). Many people flock to banners such as this in order justify other things they want done.

Whether the death eaters truly believe what they are espousing is, in the end, irrelevant. Voldemort is more powerful and can force them to obey through a variety of means. From their perspective, they would rather be one of the people in power than not. This is a common thing among organizations looking for and succeeding in regime change.

Voldemort would have gathered people to him like flies to honey. He would have gained their trust and respect. Gradually, he would have tied them closer to him, a process that I imagine took years and eventually culminating in the dark mark. Then, the children of those people -- like Lucius and, later, Draco -- would have already been born into a culture of subservience, fear and awe of their leader; their choices whether to follow him or now would have been severely limited at birth.

I disagree entirely; I think it's excellent worldbuilding: the shock of a Muggleborn Minister for Magic caused the more extreme corners of society to resort to increasingly violent and desperate means to enforce their bigotry.

I think perhaps the dissonance is coming from the idea that Voldemort's regime had popular support. It didn't. Most of magical society is anti-blood supremacy like most of Muggle society is anti-racism, though many people likely retain unconscious biases. We see this in a variety of ways:

1. In the election of a Muggleborn Minister for Magic.

2. In the fact that Malfoy's use of the word "mudblood" was shocking and is intended as a clear parallel to the "N-word" IRL.

3. The fact that in GoF it is noted that Lucius Malfoy would not dare speak anti-Muggleborn views in front of Fudge, even though Fudge himself is noted to have a predisposition to look favourably upon those of "pure blood" (just as it would be political suicide to say "I hate black people" in the Trump administration, even though Trump's inner circle is composed entirely of white people).

4. The fact that the moment Voldemort falls in 1981, his entire movement collapses with him.

5. The fact that Slughorn and the Slytherins rally a good portion of the wizarding population to return with them to Hogwarts and fight the Death Eaters/Vichy Ministry off.

Basically, the Death Eaters are successful largely because of Voldemort's personal power. They are very much trying to enforce policies which go against the views of the vast majority of the populace, and the moment Voldemort is removed from the equation, the "liberal" status quo is restored. The actual number of Death Eaters is, what, 30-40? Even with the smallest figures for the magical population, that's a tiny minority. Everyone else is just a scared person who cares more about keeping themselves and their family safe than standing up for a principle.

Somewhat baffled by this comment, I have to say. The point I presented was that preferring to associate with people of a certain social group (as Fudge prefers to associate with "pure bloods") does not mean that you are going to tolerate or be comfortable with open bigotry against other groups.

Thus why Lucius doesn't dare say anything anti-Muggleborn in Fudge's presence, even though Fudge himself prefers to associate with pure-bloods. The Trump comparison -- where Trump's administration is compared to Fudge's administration -- was to show that this is a realistic situation.

Somehow you have got from this that I was drawing a comparison between Trump's administration and the Death Eaters.

I think this is the wrong way to think about things on a few levels:

1. Dumbledore very much did not work for the Ministry. He was doing his own thing.

2. "Having Dumbledore" only counts for anything if you can engage with Voldemort in a direct confrontation. But it seems clear that neither the Ministry nor Dumbledore were able to pierce the spells which kept Voldemort hidden.

3. As far as we know, OotP was the first time Dumbledore and Voldemort had ever duelled, as they had avoided each other until that point. And that duel was even enough that I would not be confident in putting all my eggs in the "we have Dumbledore" basket. Indeed, if anything I would say Voldemort had the edge in that duel, given that Dumbledore needed to be rescued by a third party (Fawkes) to avoid taking a Killing Curse.

As the article you linked explicitly notes, the "Sacred Twenty-Eight" was a vanity project of an individual wizard and essentially reflects his personal favourite families.

The Weasleys are very poor though, and that at least is partially due to having so many kids, which is unusual for British wizarding families (notice how most only have one kid, two at most).

You are confused. That wizards can teleport doesn't mean they can do any magic without repercussions. Apparition cannot be tracked, but spells can. Wands keep track of the spells used with them, so unless you disguise yourself and make a perfect getaway, you can't just go around throwing Unforgivables unless you've got an ace in the hole to deflect the heat, it's stupid. Remember, it was the backing of Voldemort that let the Death Eaters operate that way, not just being a wizard.

Welcome to the charms of asymmetrical warfare against terrorists. Death Eaters names were largely unknown, their bases were unknown, and with magic, they could transport instantaneously and untraceably.

On the other hand Ministry people, Aurors, Hit Wizards, the media. Those were all public figures. So for eleven years Voldemort tried to either recruit or eliminate all talented wizards. So for eleven years, he used the fear-inducing tactics. Killing the families of those who spoke against him, so they would find them all dead when returning home.

He knew where to strike, who to strike. Ministry didn't. And the potential targets were too many to sufficiently protect them all, not even taking Voldemort's power into account.

** I actually wrote a text about this for use in review some time ago.

The rise of beliefs in blood superiority in canon has its reasons. The division between wizarding world and the muggle one existed before ISOS as proven by things like Wizard's Council rules on playing Quidditch afar from Muggles (Quidditch Through Ages), The Tales of Beedle the Bard being written in runes in XV century (DH), the various cases of Muggles not knowing that people living near them are Wizards (ex. Pottermore: Potter Family, Pottermore: Hogwart's Ghosts). In Early Modern Europe, came the waves of witch hunts, which created hostility to Muggles. The Wizard and the Hopping Pot had new, anti-muggle version created (The Tales of Beedle the Bard). In the end "the widespread persecution of wizarding children by Muggles", "escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to perform magic for muggle ends", "escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to teach them magic", "increasing numbers of witch-burnings", "increasing numbers of Muggles being burned in mistake for witches" and "failure of (...) delegation to muggle King and Queen (William and Mary) begging for protection under muggle law" (W.O.M.B.A.T.) led to creation of International Statutes of Secrecy in which British side played significant role (W.O.M.B.A.T.).

"The International Statute of Secrecy became effective in 1692, when the magical community went into voluntary hiding following persecution by Muggles. This was a traumatic time for witches and wizards, and marriages with Muggles dropped to their lowest level ever known, mainly because of fears that intermarriage would lead inevitably to discovery, and, consequently, to a serious infraction of wizarding law.

Under such conditions of uncertainty, fear and resentment, the pure-blood doctrine began to gain followers. As a general rule, those who adopted it were also those who had most strenuously opposed the International Statute of Secrecy, advocating instead outright war on the Muggles. Increasing numbers of wizards now preached that marriage with a Muggle did not merely risk a possible breach of the new Statute, but that it was shameful, unnatural and would lead to 'contamination' of magical blood.

As Muggle/wizard marriage had been common for centuries, those now self-describing as pure-bloods were unlikely to have any higher proportion of wizarding ancestors than those who did not. To call oneself a pure-blood was more accurately a declaration of political or social intent ('I will not marry a Muggle and I consider Muggle/wizard marriage reprehensible') than a statement of biological fact.

Several works of dubious scholarship, published around the early eighteenth century and drawing partly on the writings of Salazar Slytherin himself, make reference to supposed indicators of pure-blood status, aside from the family tree. (...)

Successive studies produced by the Department of Mysteries have proven that these supposed hallmarks of pure-blood status have no basis in fact. Nevertheless, many pure-bloods continue to cite them as evidence of their own higher status within the wizarding community.

In the early 1930s, a 'Pure-Blood Directory' was published anonymously in Britain, which listed the twenty-eight truly, pure-blood families, as judged by the unknown authority who had written the book, with 'the aim of helping such families maintain the purity of their bloodlines'." (lazy quote from Pottermore: Pure-Blood)

This provides certain background for the existence of Muggle-hating (and by proxy muggleborn-hating) part of society, but what led to the support Voldemort got for his rebellion?

Let's look at the political situation

"Ignatius Tuft 1959 - 1962 Son of the above. A hard-liner who capitalised on his mother's popularity to gain election. Promised to institute a controversial and dangerous Dementor breeding program and was forced from office.

Nobby Leach 1962 - 1968 First Muggle-born Minister for Magic, his appointment caused consternation among the old (pure-blood) guard, many of whom resigned government posts in protest. Has always denied having anything to do with England's 1966 World Cup Win. Left office after contracting mysterious illness (conspiracy theories abound).

Eugenia Jenkins 1968 - 1975 Jenkins dealt competently with pure-blood riots during Squib Rights marches in the late sixties, but was soon confronted with the first rise of Lord Voldemort. Jenkins was soon ousted from office as inadequate to the challenge." (Pottermore: Ministers for Magic)

First, we had two Ministers that resigned before getting full seven years. One was generally controversial and was forced officially, the second one was controversial among pure-blood faction which may have had something to do with his resignation. Then we had Squib Rights marches, which were met with rioting and are another indicator of the general social mood being against opinions supported by pure-blood faction.

So we have pure-bloods for whom the world is falling apart. Muggleborns get elected, squibs demand rights. And here arrives Voldemort with promises of making Britain pure again. He perfectly capitalised on the feelings of then marginalised group and used them as his followers. The moods and events in the timeframe of original books are just a follow-up to the first rebellion, so the sides are already clearly marked.

Also, there is the "immigrant" part in the books which I forgot to mention. Draco says in PS "I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families".

I also think that more muggleborns started being born (due to the rise of the muggle population) in addition to cheap muggle goods.

During this time you have muggles seriously automate and advance at this time. Just like in real life, many small independent crafters and business went out of business due to cheap goods. I can't imagine it didn't flood the Wizarding world as well. Why spend a crap load of money on Wizarding made items when you can get cheap muggle items and modify them with spells? Only magical items were unaffected.

I compare the rise of voldemort to the rise of fascism in the west. Many Trump supporters would allow themselves to be marked as Trump can do no wrong.

The better comparison would be that if after Obama Sanders would have won, and dealt harshly with conservatives protesting against some liberal changes. And then someone would appear who would be powerful and promised that he can fix everything.

** To say that there is no reason for purebloods to join Voldemort's movement, you would have to assume several things:

(1) Blood supremacists have enough political power to institute the laws and reforms that they want

(2) Actions or laws passed from blood supremacists would not garner protest from a generally pro-muggleborn and pro-muggle public

(3) Voldemort is incapable or unwilling to persuade key pureblood activists/politicians that his Death Eater movement is good or beneficial to purebloods

I think that purebloods having all, or most political power is unlikely because Wizarding Britain, in the 20th century was generally moving away from pureblood ideology. This shown by:

(1) The election of a Muggleborn Minister in the 1960s

(2) The rejection of a bill by Araminta Melifula that would make muggle-hunting legal

(3) The use of "mudblood" being taboo in Wizarding culture

(4) The "death" of Voldemort causes the status quo to return

As [[/u/Taure]] mentioned, Voldemort is the only one who is holding the Death Eaters together. He is the only one of the Death Eaters capable of really standing up against Dumbeldore. Once he is gone, the Death Eaters lose morale and the movement ultimately collapses from a lack of heavy hitters. Voldemort is the guiding hand of the organization. This is shown in GoF. During the Quidditch Cup, the Death Eaters attack. However, they are attacking for amusement, rather than any real purpose.

Blood supremacists join Voldemort because they view themselves as the disenfranchised, the ones without power. Their way of life is being eroded. They join Voldemort to regain power and to establish blood supremacy. They don't have the influence to do what they want in the legislature, and can't influence ministerial elections to get their candidate to the top. They submit to Voldemort because they believe in their cause.

** I asked myself the same question several times. I mean apart from simple story writing reasons I don't see it.

What I could come up with is mainly stuff like: Boredom, yearning for more power, hating the others. It's easy to hate others if they are made the "other". If they are portrayed as evil, uncultured etc.

But for the life of me - I cant figure out Voldemort. He is wasted potential. Both in the story and in the world itself. His motivation is unfounded, he was basically handed everything he couldve wanted without the need to make him cartoonishly evil. There is no reason for him to hate muggleborns or "the light" (I hate the term "light and dark"). Even moreso, his decision to name his followers the Death eaters? And the whole SchutzStaffel-outfit they seem to go for? Makes no sense. They are not only evil, they also look that way.

I wish Voldemort couldve been more subversive, more morally acceptable.

** I'll come back to this later, and someone might have mentioned this earlier, but there was a muggle-born Minister for Magic in the 60's. You also have Dumbledore at the peak of his powers and influence. It's not unreasonable to suggest that there was an increasing tendency for greater respect and tolerance. And on top of that, you might also have more muggle-born students with the baby-boomer generation coming to Hogwarts from the muggle world.

In that light, the Death Eaters are the cultural counter-revolution that always happens in every society when it begins to undergo significant change and power begins to disperse. Just as in the real world we are seeing the rise of authoritarian, nationalist politics that opposes liberalism and human rights, you get portions of the pureblood establishment dismayed and stressed about their self-conceived loosening of power. Remmber, Dumbledore himself is a half-blood by their definition, and even combined they'd struggle to get anywhere near him, magically or intellectually.

Then you have this extremely charismatic, influential, still good-looking wizard who's maybe just as powerful as Dumbledore, and he's got the ancestral bloodline to boot - and remember, he didn't go after the Wizengamot members. Besides the ones who were with him from the beginning, he got them young - Bellatrix, Regulus etc.. Voldemort could be extremely captivating when he wanted to be, and here's a whole section of his society just calling for something to get behind - a cause for young people raised with the notion that they're just better than other people because they're pureblooded. It's one of the more interesting facets of the books that doesn't get enough attention - how Voldemort hoodwinks an entire generation of Slytherin purebloods, and how he effectively steals the stuffy old pureblood establishment's children from right under their noses.

Demographic statistic doesn't support this statement. In 79-80 years the birth count was ~730-740K and we know about only 2 muggleborns in Harry's year: Hermione and Justin Finch-Fletchley

Even if you take the max number of birth (~1KK) in some years, it increases the number of muggleborns on 2-3 people at most.

If such minority without proper relations in the Magical World can take over Old Power... I would say that such purebloods didn't have any power at all.

** A lot of people have discussed the crumbling of the pureblood ideology in the mid-20th century as a motivation for the Death Eaters, which is a valid point, but I say you don't even have to go that far.

During the period when the KKK was at its peak in the American South, blacks were 10% of the U.S. population (similar to the implied population of muggle-borns), and segregation was the law of the land. Whites had nearly all the power, and yet people still joined the Klan.

Many if not most genocides were perpetrated by a majority against a minority. They would almost have to be, to be successful.

People don't need to be under threat to join a hate group. They just need a charismatic leader to manufacture a /perceived/ threat, or to whip up historical prejudice, or any number of other things, and Voldemort was that leader to the old pureblood guard.

I don't this is fleshed out in any way and we can only speculate, but there could be many small things that Purebloods felt like encroaching on their territory. "Now Muggleborn are even allowed to have their own vault in Gringotts?! Wha'ts next? Will they take all of our jobs and ursurp the government?!".

I don't think Voldemort's followers would look at it like this. More like a - in their eyes - natural hierarchy of follow the leader. Probably a bit of a Darwinistic outlook as well: Voldemort has proven himself as their superior, he's merely taking his rightful place.

**** We only know two /for sure/ (which is already 5%). JKR's Original 40 list named 5 muggle-borns out of the 22 names on the left half of the notes we saw. Even though 3 of those have been retconned, it definitely shows her early intent to make muggle-borns more common than that.

The difference between the groups doesn't need to be physical either. It can be cultural. Muggle-borns will be pretty obvious at school from the way they talk, even if they fully adopt wizard manners of dress and other trappings, and this is a small community where everyone knows each other, so the people who cared would remember that.

And why do there need to be plausible threats for a hate group or genocide to happen? The "stealing magic" line the Death Eaters come out with in /Deathly Hallows/ has no justification at all and is the very definition of "manufacturing a perceived threat." Ditto for the Nazi-knockoff propaganda pamphlets.

Finally, besides the election of Nobby Leach, we know there were also squib rights marches around the same time, which together imply a larger cultural shift that would including a higher standing for muggle-borns. Most of what we can say about this is speculation, but a political threat is one of the most likely ways to provoke a violent reaction. It's plausible that increased rates of intermarriage were another part of that shift, for example, something the Death Eaters specifically regard as a threat.

** I think the main point was that while (some) purebloodd had the money and establishment they were few. The number of purebloodd was either sinking constantly or took a steep dive during Grindelwald. The, had a muggleborn minister, they had Dumbledore, and a ever growing half blood/muggleborn population. They were scarred to loose that power as well.

In addition I think you see the post voldemort as pre voldemort population. Voldemort clear ly targeted rich and influential non putebloods firstly, even if we know more of his purebloodd victims(more relatives left over). So we can assume the purebloods had in the end a better balance and could fill the ranks.

And lastly I think you overestimate the purebloods influence. I think it was the only lucius with any influence, all the non imprisoned death eaters had no real positions of power. If they had all that much power, why would they need to pressure and threaten the wizengamot. That the purebloods ruled the gamo is a fanfiction thing.

I always thought about the Wizard racism like I view the modern American racism. More like an underclass and uneducated people thing with a few honchos riding on those, but with no real backing in the broad society. And maybe some subconscious bias.

There weren't many indicators of the opposite. The first war was about 10 years long. While government admitted it was devastating, still it allowed known Death Eaters escape any investigation and the corresponding imprisonment.

If those DEs filled the void and raised during the war, as you're saying, it's an even bigger reason to investigate them more carefully.

Still we know that Malfoys and Notts were influential even before Riddle.

** I have read your question and some of your comments.

Its important to first establish purebloods power in society at the start of Tom's rise. At that point the social and economic situation of the wizarding world has been subject to major change. The rise and fall of Grindewald must have changed the views of of society as major events are bound to do. There was more openness in the ruling class towards half bloods and muggleborns. Not to much for sure but still a little.

On the other hand pure bloods aren't a homogenus group some are rich and powerfull some poor. Those without most wealth and power will have hated the rise of muggleborns and half bloods. While the richer will have seen in Tom a chance to close the ranks of power off for new comers while having their own power grow (however misguided that view may prove to be).

The establishment in other words while still mostly pure blood will have had enemies. A normal situation after a major change. Being part of the "ruling" group doesnt mean much if you are not part of the part that actually does the ruling.

Tom's path to power began in school. Seen by all as powerfull inteligent and charismatic. No torture and slavery there yet. He makes "friends" followers. But only after he returns back from abroad more powerfull he starts to really built the Death Eaters. Which is not a political group by any means. It is a terrorist group annex cult built around Tom himself. And as with any terrorism group and cult there is a bait and switch team going on. There are big promises to draw you in but in the end you are the one making the sacrifices. People get indocterinated and blackmailed into following.

You have asked i believe why the pureblood parents let their children join? Well how many pureblood parents are around? All the DE's are young those who knew Voldemort in school seem to have been killed off. So there is not much to stop them it seems.

Why take the mark? You seem to think they view it as a mark of slavery. They view it as a mark of power they are Voldemorts elite and the mark allows them to speak with his voice.

Any other questions i have missed?

*** It's a good question why we don't see almost no one from the older generation despite the statement that wizards and witches live a lot longer than mundane people.

Somewhere on Pottermore it's stated that majority of magical population are half bloods for a long time, therefore I don't see a lot of hate towards them from pure-bloods. Arrogance -- yes, hate -- no. Even Malfoy Jr. was ready to befriend Harry Potter who is half-blood.

Also we see that Riddle's inner circle contains influential people, for example Malfoy, Lestrange, Nott -- people who had what to lose becoming Riddle's slaves.

Mark -- is some magical artifact that is permanently printed on your body and allows the Master to cause your pain. It can accept that they were brainwashed, but still...

Or do they believe that they have something to gain by joining a cult/terrorist group? That is the question on the level of parents of the people you describe.

My guess is that their parents saw a way to gain influance and were in to deep for their kids to make any other choice than to join up.

The mark is not only an artifact to cause pain but also an artifact that inspires fear and give power. I don't think its likely that the pain causing effect was that well known nor used a lot especially at the start of the movement.
