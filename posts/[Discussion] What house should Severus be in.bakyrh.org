** The notion that Snape would /ever/ get into Hufflepuff is, frankly, preposterous. He is violently antisocial in temper, and cannot conceive of anything more loathsome to do with his time than help those less capable than him. He might have a certain ethics of his /own/ hard work, I'll grant you, and he can be staunchly loyal in his own way --- but even then, it is only ever to single individuals or single ideas, not to a community. Snape doesn't do teamwork, not even remotely, and for this reason he doesn't work as a Hufflepuff.

I could see plausibly him in Gryffindor or in Ravenclaw.

** Taken out of Slytherin, Snape is like the ultimate Ravenclaw (or the parody version of one). Brilliant, studious, a bit too interested in knowledge, and extremely antisocial.

** I think it would depend, first of all, how OOC he would be. Otherwise, I agree with [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]] that Hufflepuff wouldn't work.

I could definitely see Snape in Ravenclaw. I think that outside of Slytherin, it's probably the best fit. I think a key difference would be how he seeks to use his knowledge. In my mind Ravenclaw Snape would be a little more innocent (maybe not the best description? ) and more interested in knowledge/potions just for the sake of knowing.

** How would James and Sirius convince him into Gryffindor? And why would they want to do so, if he's a year younger than them?

The Snape as we see him during his childhood does not value any of the qualities of Gryffindor - he has next to no sense of justice, lacking in morals and is quite keen on deception. Those are virtually the opposite traits of Gryffindor.

Hufflepuff is just as improbable. While Snape does value hardwork, things like loyalty, camaraderie, team-play - these are qualities he's allergic to.

Ravenclaw is really the only real alternative to Slytherin as far as Snape's sorting choice goes, because he does prize knowledge and is considerably witty and creative.

** It all depends on how much is different with everything else. Is he still friends with Lily, despite being a year younger, did he still grow up in poverty and an abusive household?

He could potentially go to Gryffindor because he would have more time to think about it to be with Lily. However, Lily would not be friends with James in their first year.

All in all, I do not think he would go elsewhere. I think his heart was set on Slytherin, which is why he asked Lily to go to Slytherin with him.

** This is how I'd rank his House placement before taking personal choices into account: Slytherin > Ravenclaw > Gryffindor > Hufflepuff

Severus isn't even remotely close to being a Hufflepuff. Also, even near the end of his life, he isn't noble (no matter what Dumbledore claims) -- he has bravery, but his other traits are more pronounced, and his view of "end justifies the means" as a spy is a Slytherin view more than anything. He doesn't have the ambition he had being 11 years old, but his traits still lean mostly towards Slytherin.

If he were to undergo a re-do, I think he'd end up in Ravenclaw -- he would reject Slytherin since he'd never want to undergo /that/ experience again, but he is neither a Gryffindor or a Hufflepuff. But I can't see him outside Slytherin otherwise.

In fact, if he was born a year later, I think it'd /strengthen/ his will towards Slytherin -- it would mean a year's absence from the one positive influence on his life, whose compassion to some extent lessens his ambition to raise above his Muggle father and seeking revenge (I've always had the view that if he never met Lily, he'd ultimately become as amoral as Voldemort).
