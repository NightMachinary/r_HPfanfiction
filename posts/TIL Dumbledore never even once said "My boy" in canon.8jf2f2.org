I used the ebooks and searched them for it. Here are the results:

[[https://i.imgur.com/BY4sr5S.png][Chamber of Secrets]]

[[https://i.imgur.com/dCIT05T.png][Prisoner of Azkaban]] - the second result is spoken by Trelawny *

[[https://i.imgur.com/VhmQMHr.png][Goblet of Fire]] - spoken by Hagrid **

[[https://i.imgur.com/kM2beQh.png][Half-Blood Prince]] - spoken by Slughorn ***

[[https://i.imgur.com/8V9CfWZ.png][Deathly Hallows]]

So as you can see, the popular "My Boy" is not once said by Dumbledore. I didn't search for similar phrases though.

  “Indeed!” whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees. “My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer. ... Does the hippogriff appear to ... have its head?”

  Hagrid's miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile. “Tha's my boy ... you show 'em, Harry, you show 'em. Beat 'em all.” Lying to Hagrid wasn't quite like lying to anyone else.

#+begin_quote
  “Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,” said Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harry's cauldron. “Euphoria, I take it? And what's that I smell? Mmmm ... you've added just a sprig of peppermint, haven't you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking. ... I really don't know where you get these brain waves, my boy ... unless ---” Harry pushed the Half-Blood Prince's book deeper into his bag with his foot.

Edit: I just searched for it, Dumbledore says it three times to Harry, all of these are in Chapter 35 and 36 of Deathly Hallows, twice by Dead Dumbledore and once by his Portrait.

However, +he says it to Tom Riddle in the memory in CoS+, and to Draco after Draco disarmed him.

My real pet peeve is terrible vague titles like "his musings" or "righting wrongs" or "realizations". We need to teach them not to use pronouns in titles and to make them refer to what the plot is about, not the character's chapter one internal shift to realize that the Weasleys are awful, Dumbledore is garbage, and Hermione is heaven in heels.

I've only seen Mia in one time travel fic. However, it actually makes the most sense to me - kids will often refuse to use a long name, and will find shorts, even if it's only used part of the time. Timothy, Jonathan, Elizabeth...Givevra, Percival. If I knew a Hermione, I'd definitely use a short a lot. And any other contraction is a bit weird. Hermy? Ugh.

"Dumbledore" also uses it in death, in the scene at King's Cross: "It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards". You can debate whether that's actually him or Harry's mind processing what he knows.

**** I think it rather implies that in her opinion Lily is a freak because Lily got more attention from their parents.

When she directs the name calling at Harry she just calls him as strange and abnormal as Harry without actually calling him freak.

**** Dudley does, at least. Vernon only does twice in PS where it's very obviously a stylistic choice:

#+begin_quote
  “Get the post, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.

  “Make Harry get it.”

  “Get the post, Harry.”
#+end_quote

Obviously going for symmetry in style there. The only other time he uses it is when he gives Harry Dudley's second bedroom, where he's obviously doing his best to be nice. Every other time, he uses "boy". Petunia never directly addresses Harry by any name, and uses "(the) boy" when talking about him, with the sole exception being confirming his name to Vernon in the very first chapter of PS.

*** "Boy" I may agree with, but the other one is more complicated. Now, I can't say that I'm well-versed with titles and how you properly address people in the British culture, but in my understanding using a first name is not necessarily a sign of disrespect, even if it is one-sided.

In my understanding formalities are mostly for protection of both sides to show that no disrespect is meant with anything said. They are a layer of protection that makes insulting harder, by making it more distanced.

By doing away with some of them, Dumbledore makes Harry more familiar and thus gives him the benefit of doubt that Harry will try and understand what Dumbledore says, and neither take it as an insult nor deliberately insult Dumbledore. He basically gets as informal as he can get away with in his role as headmaster, without insulting the /other/ students.

You could also constitute that Dumbledore has less respect for Harry than any eleven year old at Hogwarts, but come on.

**** Having served time in a boarding school, I can assure you that the form of address is Mr or Ms, and Professor, Headmaster, or Mr. or Ms/Mrs for any of the other professionals employed, be it the school nurse, the grounds keepers etc.

The mentality behind it was that we (the students) were shown respect by being addressed by our proper names, and we were expected to return that respect by addressing the adults by their titles or in kind. To be fair, while the school did produce its share of spoiled, unpleasant adults, all of them had ingrained manners, although some made the choice not to continue to use them.
