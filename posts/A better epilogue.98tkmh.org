This in my opinion is a much better epilogue than the one in deathly hallows.

** 4/10 last word is not 'scar'.

I don't love the epilogue in canon, but I don't think I could write a better one either. I would have liked the books to have ended after the final battle, and leave the 'after' to fanfiction.

By deciding not to write one you are already better. As you said, it's not like the books need to have an epilogue, yet JKR wrote what she wrote and actually thought it would be a good idea to print it instead of a colossal mistake that is a detriment to the entire series.

***** The same way "The Matrix" would be better if it was the only movie in that series or how Star Wars would be better if they just stopped touching it after the original Trilogy. It's not that hard to make things worse by adding onto it. Not every genuine effort results in a net positive.

****** Agreed with the Matrix, not so sure about the Epilogue -- it's just 7 pages that you can, like many fanfic authors do, choose to ignore.

But in defence of the prequel trilogy, they've spawned a rich backstory for the originals and so much ground for exploration in the EU. My favourite characters in Star Wars are Anakin and Ahsoka, and if you look at Star Wars fanfiction, Anakin is the most popular character to write about.

I /really/ hate what Disney have done with the new trilogy though. The Thrawn/Mara/Jacen Solo future was way more interesting than what they've made, and I'm worried that relegating them to /Legends/ will decrease the interest in both reading and writing for that future.

See, that's exactly my point about the epilogue in HP. Couldn't agree more. Yet, you said:

Which isn't really true. You can't unmake the Epilogue. It is inherently intertwined with the world of HP. It is bad for the book series, but it is catastrophic for the lore and fanfiction, because it stifles creativity. The Epilogue immediately split the community into Epilogue-compliant and EWE stories... it reduced the interest in reading and writing stories for that future where Harry becomes a healer or a teacher, because they were relegated to /EWE/ fics (who are only of interest for cynical assholes)

** Yeah it always seemed obvious to me that Harry should have been a teacher... and the period of disappearing for a few years also makes a lot of sense to me. If there's one guy who would need some time off to see the world and discover himself it would be Harry.

I have to admit I only skimmed the fic. It seems a bit wordy for what it is.

I've always had a thing for epilogue replacement fics. I really enjoy this one by Stanrick but it's really snarky and sorta crack:

I also like

but that's probably because my weak spot for HHr.

"One Big Happy Weasley Family" actually has one of my favorite Luna quotes in all of fanfiction:

#+begin_quote
  "That's actually a great idea. If we go on like that, we could have Hogwarts full of a single, one big happy Weasley family one day," said Luna full of excitement. "Or even the whole wizarding world. Wouldn't that be cool? There would only be muggles and Weasleys!"

  19 years after Hogwarts, the world is perfect. The only selfish, power-crazed person that ever existed was defeated, all the deaths the whole affair brought about quickly forgotten and the happy, naturally developed couples were eager to get started on making babies and giving them awful names. And of course it all worked out exactly like that, duh! What an epilogue!
