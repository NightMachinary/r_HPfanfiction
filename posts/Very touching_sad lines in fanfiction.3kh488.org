Just as the title states. Can you remember a line or paragraph in a fanfic that made you really emotional or possibly even brought a tear to your eye?

  Harry had been sobbing in earnest for over half an hour, but he hadn't made a sound, other than the occasional rasping breath. Molly didn't like to speak ill of people, but she tried to imagine what kind of childhood Harry had that would make him learn to cry like this. All her children were noisy criers. Especially the boys.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

** The last line of Thirty-Five Owls. I can't quote it because it would spoil the fic, but the ending hits you hard.

[[http://www.letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]: /(Thirty Five Owls) being a correspondence between Albus P.W.B. Dumbledore, Grand Sorcerer, etc., and the prisoner Gellert Grindelwald, of some decades in length./

I also remember a few emotional scenes towards the end of linkffn(Backward with Purpose) that hit me hard, but I can't think of any individual line that stands out. And then there's the tragic story of Dahlia and Volarius in linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent). Her entire story is one emotional roller-coaster, but there's a sentence at the end that's especially heart-breaking.

EDIT: I will put in that no single fanfiction writer has come close to writing heartwrenching scenes of Sanction's quality. This is another scene of /The Phoenix and the serpent/, where Dumbledore learns of Harry's disappearance and possible death:

#+begin_quote
  As soon as they stepped onto the moving staircase, they heard a tremendous crash from somewhere above them. Ginny looked around in alarm. No one said anything as they drew wands, their eyes wide and white in the gloom.

  The door to Dumbledore's office was unlocked. Ron nudged it open and they crept in single file. To their surprise, they found the headmaster sitting at his chair as usual. There were no intruders, no signs of forced entry. Some incredible force, however, had shattered the headmaster's beautiful ornate desk in two. Scattered papers lay smoldering on the floor, and two of the chairs in front of the desk lay on their backs several feet away.

  Dumbledore sat very still on his high-backed chair, his head bowed so low they could not see his eyes beneath his cap. One hand held a letter, the other was curled into a tight, smoking fist. Fawkes perched on the backrest, caressing the old man's face with his wing, as if to comfort him.

  "Professor Dumbledore?" Hermione called tentatively. She received no answer.

  Without a word, Ron strode across the room towards him. Ginny and Hermione watched in alarm, then broke into a run to catch up. Ron ignored the papers on the floor, walking right up to stand before the headmaster.

  This time, Dumbledore looked up. His face looked wan and stony, but his eyes carried only grief. He faced Ron without saying a word. Ron's mouth was working, a sight Ginny knew meant that he was trying to find the right thing to say and failing at it.

  "Is he dead?" he finally blurted out.

  Ginny heard Hermione gasp beside her, but her gaze stayed on the old man's face.

  His whispered response was the one thing she never expected, never wanted to hear from Professor Dumbledore.

  "I don't know."
#+end_quote

This is a master of his craft at work here. The mental image of Albus Dumbledore, normally calm and in-control, sitting in his office, unsure and grief-stricken, still clutching the letter that brought him news of Harry's disappearance, his desk broken in two halves in a fit of temper and misery, unable to summon up enough hope to console Harry's friends: there is nothing that could have sold the moment better than this.

** Oh, and the letter from James Harry gets in the second chapter of Blood Magic! It is time sent to him long after James' death to explain to him something very important... Harry's true parentage. I love the letter. It is so full of longing for the chance to know his child, so funny, and so sweet. It makes me tear up.

Loved the beginning:

“First, let me tell you that I love you very much. I hope this is unnecessary sentimentality, and that I lived long enough for you to know that, heart and soul, but the assurance arm of Gringotts has doubtless made clear to you the propensity of Potters to die in messy glory at a young age.”

And this line:

“Don't indulge yourself in the joy of retaliation. It's not worth it.”

And also the last paragraph of the letter:

"I wish I could say everything I want to say. The longer I work on this, the more certain I am I will die, and soon. I want you to know me. I want you to know I love you. I want you to know how I walked with you and sang to you when you could not sleep. I want you to be mine, but it hurts me to have stolen you from him. My stolen child. Be his, as well, if you can.

Your loving home-father,

James Potter”

I seriously love this fic so much.

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.

** "Because, for time out of mind, there have been witches in Pendle.”

The very last line from one of my all-time favorite fan fictions, A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro. It's not sad out of context, but I bawled my eyes out over the last chapter and the last line has always stuck with me.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  The Boy-Who-Lived is not a child anymore, and 'Lived' is an overstatement. Only when Harry's at the hands of Voldemort does Severus Snape realize that. Not Slash. Complete.

** Well, I'm not sure about sad, but I have this quite touching (in my opinion) line:

#+begin_quote
  When Harry met Ron on the Hogwarts Express, Ron told him he had five older brothers and Harry said, “I have one.”
#+end_quote

And not just that one line. There's more of those in this story: [[http://ink-splotch.tumblr.com/post/106737310659/what-if-when-petunia-dursley-found-a-little-boy]]
