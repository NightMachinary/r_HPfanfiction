Hey guys.

I'm looking for a series (that was on Ao3) where Harry recognizes that Draco is being abused by Lucius and he literally drags Draco away to get help.

It's a series, starts in COS and goes from there, features a lesbian Narcissa, protective and openly kind Snape and BAMF and motherly McGonnagal. Also, the Gryffindors and Slytherins are all friends.


** I'm pretty sure it's this

  So this is based on a tumblr prompt by Mauraders4evr (https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/marauders4evr)"Harry Potter AU where Harry is hiding in the cabinet in Borgin and Burkes. And he sees Lucius grab Draco with his cane. And he hears the hiss, ‚ÄúWhat did I tell you?‚Äù And he hears the quiver in the blonde boy's voice, ‚ÄúDon't touch anything.‚ÄùAnd Harry knows.Because he's used the voice that Draco uses for the past twelve years.He knows.Because now that he's lived with the Weasleys for over a month, he knows that that's not the way that a father's voice should be.He knows..."And it wouldn't leave me alone so...

*** It is, thank you!

It's been awhile since I've read it, so I figured I'd start over.
