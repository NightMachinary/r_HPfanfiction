** This sounds suspiciously like Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. Except he goes back in time to become "Lord Slytherin," and a lot of people falsely assume he is Voldemort, including Voldemort at one point (or at least his horcrux).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
