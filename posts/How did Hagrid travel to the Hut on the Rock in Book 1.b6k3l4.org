For that matter how did he and Harry go from there to London the morning after?


** Yeah, he flew the Flying Motorbike to the island, then they left taking the boat (for anyone wondering where the Motorbike went in all this after Hagrid landed, I'm tempted to think he had it in his pocket).

*** Fly on what though? The only ones who can fly unaided are Voldemort and (possibly) Snape, Hagrid is noted as being too big to use a broom or ride any flying creature, and if he used the motorbike I'm fairly sure it would've been mentioned, as it was his character was first introduced. I'm kinda working on a Me-as-Harry SI fic starting the moment Hagrid shows up at the hut, and I'm almost tempted to retcon the motorbike as being there the whole time to fill in that potential plot-hole.

**** "How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.

"Flew" said Hagrid.

"Flew?"

"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh.

Essentially: He used his pink umbrella to fly like Mary Poppins!

** He flew, tells Harry not to mention it because he used magic to do so and he's not supposed to be using magic. I know it says specifics other than that, I just re read the first book a week ago so it's still fresh in my mind.

I don't think it would have been the bike though, otherwise they could have just taken that back, but they ended up taking the boat back. How the Dursley's got back that's the real question lol

** Maybe a flying carpet? That would qualify as "flew" and since they are banned in Britain, Hagrid couldn't have Harry know that he had one, so they had to go back by boat.

But seriously, Dumbledore probably created a portkey for him.
