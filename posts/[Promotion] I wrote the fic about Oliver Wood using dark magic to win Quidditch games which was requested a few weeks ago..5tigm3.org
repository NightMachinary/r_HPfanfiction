  Oliver has one last shot at winning the Quidditch Cup before he leaves Hogwarts, and he's willing to do anything to make sure he does. No, really, anything. Absolutely anything. Oh dear...

...Aaand, I approve! I do like how you got into the worldbuilding with the potion/rings/ritual/etc and how they affected things afterwards.

** This was brilliant. Loved Mrs Wood.

Since Angelina went on to become slightly maniacal, and Harry....well, Harry is a special case, I just came up with a theory that the Gryffindor Captaincy is cursed.

*** Wasn't James Potter Gryffindor captain too...if so it proves there's a curse because at least two captains died at the hands of Voldemort (Albeit Harry was only sent to Limbo)

** A couple of nitpicks - the Battle of Hogwarts was in 1998, not 1997, plus I get the feeling you don't wear glasses (we're not exactly ignorant of how well normal-sighted people can see, that's what glasses are for).

But hilarious all the same.

*** Not if you have the wrong prescription glasses. It's not very hard to believe the Dursleys just gave Harry a pair of shoddy glasses and never bothered to take him to the eye doctor as he got older. Since your eyesight can deteriorate with age, Harry could have been wearing glasses not suited for him.

**** Exactly this. I grew up when no one (I mean pupils and teachers alike) bothered much with eyesight as long you were able to read from the blackboard.\\
Imagine my surprise when I got my first glasses (-1,5 for both eyes or so and something for astigmatism correction) and saw 'full HD' for the first time (that I remembered)... I had really problems getting back home with the glasses on - almost walked into a lamppost (honestly) and kept walking very slowly because the pavement was so close...

*** Thank you for both points - I've changed the date and slightly amended the bit with Harry's glasses (I am a glasses wearer and as you say it needs the amendment from the comment below yours to be made clear for it to make sense!)

** Great story, I loved it. My only nit-pique is that when Fred and George are talking about Oliver doing something they refer to it as third year. It was Harry's third year, it was the Twin's 5th I think
