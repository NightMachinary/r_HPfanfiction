** The fic deserves a better summary. I'd move the "Winner..." to the end of summary, move the "Thanks..." to author's notes, then write an actual summary instead of that excerpt sentence that doesn't mean anything out of context.

*** I very much agree. This is a great oneshot but I wish the summary was more indicative of what the story was about.

***** It's a character-driven story which delves into the mind of an autistic except she isn't, really Daphne Greengrass.

*** I agree! Things have been very busy for me this week, buy I wanted to get out posted asap. I went with a lazy half-assed summary. I'll update it at some point soon. Glad you enjoyed it!
