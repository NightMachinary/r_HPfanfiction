During Harry's sortng, he's elected Headmaster, replacing Albus. iirc it was a lengthy one-shot, not 100% sure though.

Thank you.

** Wait, Harry became headmaster as an 11 year old? I don't care if Dumbledore is eating the hearts of babies on the weekend, he's still a better choice than an 11 year old.
