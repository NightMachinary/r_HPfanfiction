He is my favourite character. Marauders friendship focus or Jily focus are both fine. I'm also very fond of well done AUs. :)


** I always rec these two for Marauder Era. Unfortunately, nothing that I know for him post Hogwarts/First War.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

** The lost generation, linkao3(1110486), is my favorite fanfic at the moment and it's about the marauder's time at Hogwarts. The jily aspect in the story has a realistic growth. Right now the fic is on their 6th year. Some canon parts go into more detail while some parts are tweaked. But in the end, it works and makes sense.

Turning tables, linkffn(8585611), and it's sequel is good. Both about jily.

Where is the air is rarefied, linkffn(11530029), is a cute oneshot of jily.
