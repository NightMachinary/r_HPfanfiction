Some people speculate that he sees himself in a mirror, as he truly is, and that is existentially terrifying for him. What do you think he saw?


** Dementors make you remember your most traumatic and despair causing memories.

He might remember the scare he got on his eleventh birthday with the Boa Constrictor. Or having grown a pig tail or his tongue elongating.

** I always thought that, since he had a pretty spoiled life, he experienced the torment he put his victims through. I know that's not how dementors really work but for some reason that's what I thought

*** You can make dementors work that way, if you want. It would work like this;

He recalls all of the times he's beat up someone smaller than him. He sees the fear, the pain, the /loathing/ he caused and inspired in his victims. For some reason, this revolts him, and he finds it terrifying that he is capable of this. Isn't it the Freak's job to scare people, to make people hate him? Isn't it?

** Supposedly, himself as he really is, and that's what made him realize he needed to change himself. The idea being he's been so pampered he has no bad memories... if course that's not how dementors work and... well everybody else is pointing it out.

...

Personally, I've always liked the idea that it's Harry's 11th birthday. Not because of Hagrid or the pig tail or the trauma of having to sleep on the floor in a random house on a random rock.... but because it's the night it gets shoved in Dudley's face that HE isn't the Special One.

And then, eventually, that thought snowballs and... well, it was never really about spoiling Dudley, was it? It was more about making sure Harry knew how much he wasn't wanted while maintaining the appearance of doting parents. Dudley never had any rules or boundaries, never got punished.... every rule in the Dursley house revolved around Harry and "his secret." And Petunia and Vernon might come up with excuses for all the letters they get from school about Dudley's behavior, but then they turn around and pin whatever will stick on Harry and paint him as the delinquent.

In the end, everything Dudley thought he knew about his childhood basically gets turned on his head. And instead of his parents throwing everything into loving him, they'd been throwing everything into hating Harry and... well, Dudley was just sort of a tool in their crusade.

And maybe Harry will understand.

Or something along those lines, hopefully this makes sense - its 1am

  Superhans: What was duldeys worst memory?

  J.K. Rowling: I think that when Dudley was attacked by the Dementors he saw himself, for the first time, as he really was. This was an extremely painful, but ultimately salutory lesson, and began the transformation in him.

Or I think she formulated it later that he saw his life from the point of view those whom he bullied.

*** That is not how Dementors are supposed to work. Did she change the dynamics of Dementor to make them show what you fear the most like boggarts?

**** I think the idea was that Dudley led such a ridiculously spoiled and pampered life that he didn't actually /have/ any bad memories, so he got forced to confront some uncomfortable truths instead. Like, the worst thing I can remember happening to him prior to that point is the boa constrictor scaring him at the zoo. There's just not a lot for a Dementor to work with there.

I suppose in general terms you could say that Dementors force you to think about negative things, which for most people would simply be bad memories but for a select few people would be the sudden, crushing realization of "I'm an asshole." IDK, I just made that up on the spot, but it vaguely fits? If you squint?

***** The Boa Constrictor incident is pretty traumatic. If something like that happened to me or I suspect to the most of the people it will cause nightmares. And for it to happen to an 11 year old would leave one traumatized for life. Like Ron and his Arachnophobia.

***** It fits. It's really the only thing that fits. Or perhaps, memories that were only negative in hindsight? Like maybe seeing the fear in his victims' eyes as he beats them up; going along with the "I'm an asshole" realization theme, he looks back and notices the joy/pride on his own face at what he's doing? I mean, unless you are truly evil, it can be painful to look in a mirror like that. Remember how Harry felt watching James hex Snape? The idol he (Harry and Dudley) had placed on a pedestal was torn down. Harry saw his dad as he was at that time (a bullying arse), and Dudley saw himself as he truly was (a bullying arse and a total creep).

** Probably the boa constrictor or the pig's tail thing.

On a more humourous note, it could also be the one where Dudley had to eat grapefruit for an entire summer.
