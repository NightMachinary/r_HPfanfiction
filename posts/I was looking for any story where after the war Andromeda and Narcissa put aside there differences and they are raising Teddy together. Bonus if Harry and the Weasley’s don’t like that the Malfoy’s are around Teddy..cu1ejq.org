  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

** Not exactly what you're looking for but similar. Andromeda has to check into rehab, and Narcissa helps her every now and then with Teddy. It's an AU sequel to a story where she's married to Snape but they're minor characters so it's not that important. But Harry constantly judged Andromeda after she gets out of rehab, thinking she might abuse Teddy. So he does everything in his power to take custody away from her. It's an amazing, powerful moving story and I highly recommend it.

  Andromeda Tonks is involuntarily committed to a rehab facility after her 5-yr-old grandson begs the Minister for Magic for help. Kingsley arrives to find her passed out, drunk and high. She needs to finally face her demons, for Teddy's sake... but what if she thinks he'd be better off without her? What if she'd rather remain an addict? RATED M for MATURE CONTENT
