I feel like fanfiction is a big circle and all of us here in this sub are in varying stages of evolution. Maybe we'll get to the point where Harrymort slash gets voted to the top every time.

When I first got into HP fanfic years ago, I was into the whole Indy!Harry wankfest. Harry grows a pair after Sirius dies, goes to the bank, demands his key back, yells at Dumbledore, trains his magical powers instead of waiting for Dumbledore to share 30 minutes' worth of Pensieve memories without telling him the full story, and doesn't listen to Ron who just wants to sit in the Gryffindor common room and procrastinate on homework. After some time, I realized how similar and self-indulgent these fics were, and after refreshing myself on canon, saw how much they made everyone OOC in bashfics. I began to internalize them as low quality shitfics that were unworthy of my enlightened eyes, and mentally, I started to resemble one of those edgy people who bashes HPMOR.

Now, I have completed the circle and enjoy Indy!Harry fics, the tropier the better. I live for the tropiest tropes, unironically turned up to eleven.

- 5k words of Gringotts inheritance tests.

- Long rants where 11 y.o. Harry tells Dumbledore and Snape they suck in a long-winded speech full of swear words. Bonus if this 11 year old Harry sues them in the Wizengamot and is emancipated.

- Harry going by another name and turning Dark, suddenly okay with subjugating muggleborns and calling his mother a Mudblood who perpetrated Line Theft in seducing his pureblood father.

- Ron shovelling mashed potatoes in his mouth, spraying peas three seats around him, while Ginny keeps trying to make Harry drink his roofied pumpkin juice, and Hermione screeches everyone's full name ("RONALD BILIUS WEASLEY!") in an effort to make them listen to her speech about donating Hogwarts to the house elves in reparations for centuries of slavery and suffering.

I still skip over the Diagon Alley shopping scenes, though.


** Idk about my tastes but my desire to read ff certainly cycles. I'll go for like a year without reading anything (except updates in my favorites list) and then for a few months I'll go on a hunt for new stuff and spend long hours reading. Inevitably I'll grow bored again and repeat the cycle.

****** That's why it's considered self-indulgent, bad writing. And leads to wish-fulfillment Mary Sue protagonists instead of well-rounded human beings.

The writer writes what they /like/, instead of what is useful to the story. They describe thousands of words of Harry ordering custom Acromantula silk robes, dragon skin shoes, nutrient potions to cure his malnutrition, a custom Basilisk skin arm holster for his wand, but it's all window dressing.

It's similar to extended clothing descriptions that appeal to the /author,/ but not the reader.

**** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage) is a pretty good one, although it becomes increasingly dense as the story progresses.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is excellent for about ten to twenty chapters before it gets too dense to continue as light reading.

linkffn(The Katarn Side) is a very well-done crossover that has had a good bit of thought put into it, and it never really becomes too dense.

linkffn (Little Guy by Clell65619) is light and fun, but gets into the farcical fairly quickly.

linkffn (Raised By GLaDOS) is one of the few first-person stories I've been able to get through the first chapter of.

I don't think my tastes have really changed, though I've become pickier. Fic with Ron-bashing no longer appeals to me, the unhealthy relationship dynamics that pop up in a lot of fic because they're written predominantly by teenagers bothers me more now that I'm not a teenager myself, and if someone calls Hermione Mya/Mia/any variation thereof I instantly close the tab.

I can understand if teenagers are into those kinds of stories because they have a naive or underdeveloped view of what healthy relationships should be, but it isn't for me. I also hugely respect the authors who write those fics, are aware of what they're writing, and add big disclaimers on their work to declare that they know they're writing terrible stuff, but it's a kink they like to work through in fiction and they don't recommend it for IRL.

Self-awareness gets big points, even if the work itself isn't to my taste. And that's exactly why Perfect Lionheart, Sinyk, and Noodlehammer fics are so unpalatable to me.

It's also a matter of writing quality, too. If you're reading My Immortal level fics, of course the OC's will be wish fulfillment Mary Sues, and the SI's will be self-indulgent fix-its who steamroll all the canon characters with their prior knowledge. But the better written will fics avoid that.

Since the early-2000s, songfics are also considered plagiarism or against T&C. I know that fic-hosting sites like Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity will delete songfics if they have more than a handful of lyric lines.

** Does reading WIP progress fic count? When I started reading in about 2004, I read everything, on every site. Then I wised up after being burned too many times and ONLY read complete fics except for my favorite authors who I could trust to keep posting.

But now a dearth of completed fic that I have not read (or that appeals to me in ANY way) has lead me to reading WIP fic again for the first time in years.

Also, I was a Harry/Ginny fanboy when I started (thus my author name GinnyMyLove) but then quickly turned to Harry/Hermione...and on to basically every other under 30 female in canon...plus Harems. I love harems.

But now I've come back around to getting a warm fuzzy from a decent canon compliant H/G fic full of fluff.

Mostly because there are no good harems completed since the last time I checked my list. Even okay harems are hard to find, let alone GOOD ones...and I've read most of the bad ones too just to round myself out.

#+end_quote

Exactly the reason why I wasn't too into those fics. The "cartoonishness", or lack of depth or motivation other than "cleanse the mudbloods!" or "gibs me all da power!" is what late stage Voldemort suffered from in the books, and also doesn't really work for me in fanfic. Especially as many Voldemort do-over fics delete all his flaws (pride, arrogance, paranoia, ego) and pass it off as character development.

It makes him indistinguishable to a late stage Dark!Harry. I also strongly prefer Voldemort that write him as a person, not a plot device or Gary Stu.

***** Voldemort has no giant, overarching motivation but his own self-aggrandizement. He doesn't want to purify the wizarding world to protect pureblood pagan culture. He doesn't care about werewolf rights or dismantling a corrupt Ministry. He doesn't want to overhaul the Hogwarts curriculum and remove all of Dumbledore's Light-biased agenda. He doesn't care about politics at all.

#+begin_quote
  "I confidently expect you to rise to Minister for Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple. I have excellent contacts at the Ministry."

  Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. "I don't know that politics would suit me, sir," he said when the laughter had died away.
#+end_quote

He's a selfish control freak who wants to be the most powerful person, and be acknowledged as the most powerful person, to feed his enormous ego and sense of entitlement.

Voldemort having a political agenda is not OOC, but Voldemort /believing/ in a political cause is. If he had one, it would only be as a tool or charade to gather power and supporters. This is how he comes off as so hypocritical about hating muggles and muggleborns, while being a halfblood himself, and inviting non-humans and muggleborns into his camp. To him, there's no such thing as right or wrong, only power, and those to weak too seek it.

In fanfic, Voldemort can support pretty much any agenda without being OOC, whether it's centaur rights, muggle equality, and educational reform, but it has to be a disguise to conceal his true selfish motivations. He's not altruistic and has no long-term vision for the wizarding world.

Dunno if you want recs or not, but that's what I consider a Voldemort whose motivations are in-character. But unless the story itself is written from his PoV and we see inside his head, none of that is shown, and therefore he will come off as a flat and one-dimensional cartoon villain. The problem is when fics are told from his PoV, and he's still a one-dimensional bad guy. Then that's just bad writing.

I skipped Diagon Alley shopping and Gringotts stuff back then, I still do it today.

** For the most part no, the stuff I hated early on (bashing, edgy and angstyHarry, slash, etc) I still hate. Good writing is the thing I care about the most and I'll read almost anything if the writing is good.

Also if an another feels the need to write their own Halloween 1981 chapter to introduce their story you better believe I am skimming it at most.

** Not exactly, I've found that fics that were super trope-y that I used to enjoy are just eye-rolling cringe fests now. I've sparingly looked for fics with a realistically super-powered Harry that are long enough to justify how strong he gets with enemies that are also on his level because I still enjoy an epic fight scene but I've read(well I feel like I've read) everything good in that regard. So now I just go back every so often and re-read my old favorites. I really wish Miranda Flairgold would have finished her series though :/.

** Thankfully not, as I used to read a lot of Weasley bashing H/Hr and have no desire to go back. It's like an embarrassing phase I'd rather forget.

** Not really but that's mostly because I've never been one to really have a "type" of fanfic I enjoy most.

The list of things I WON'T read is a lot shorter than the list of stuff I will. One of my few hard limits is slash. I don't like it and absolutely will not read it. Aside from a single fic which is currently in a weird limbo state of death at the moment. I

** Well, power-fantasies (Harry beating a trained terrorist in a straight up fight isn't all that realistic and him standing up to Voldemort if he doesn't spend his school-years training in private for years and having the element of surprise (as Voldemort doesn't know Harry trained) isn't realistic either and neither is him fighting Dumbledore without a hefty leg up, like a surprise disarming charm which gives him the unbeatable elder wand (as long as the user is aware and doesn't want to the elder wand, if its loyalty has been won, will probably help them face even stronger/better trained people without being easily overwhelmed!)) are fun to read (some might call them a "guilty pleasure, but I kind of enjoy them without any guilt, so they are just a pleasure for me :) )

​

Otherwise I've not switched back! I was into Harry/Fangirl (Ginny) at first, but now I tend to avoid that pairing especially since that character is such a non-entity in canon (we don't even know how she does in class or who her friends are other than "Loony" (seriously, she needs therapy, but nobody is telling her that! Especially the other damaged character, Harry!)) and also linked to the Weasleys which I stopped liking (Molly is a bad mother who had too many kids to really love them all equally (Ron got the short end of the stick here!) and it also impoverished her family, especially since she doesn't even start working once all kids have left for Hogwarts! Selfish woman!)

** I still read powerful/clever Harry fics (I want a Harry that could end up Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Voldemort powerful). I generally try to avoid pairings. I'm less of a fan of Hermione than I used to be. She's never really criticized in Canon, which she honestly deserves. Ron, if you can ignore the stupidity of wearing a Horcrux, I like as more loyal. I feel like making him the Snape could have gone interestingly. Ginny is fine so long as she grows as a character. No seer Luna. Avoiding intentional Dumbledore bashing.
