I was wondering whether there are any fics where performing magic is more complicated than shooting a spell out of your wand. For instance you might need to sacrifice a human for a spell, or do a silly dance while chanting something in silly words, or give your blood, or all magic coming at a cost and incredibly nasty curses would not only affect your victim but yourself as well. If you know any stories that have that please let me know. Thank you in advance!


** linkffn(Victoria Potter)

Victoria Potter by Taure is perfect for you. A fic that features great world building about magic. Feels very whimsical yet sensible in universe.

** There has yet to be a fic to top the ritual magic system from linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) imo but I believe taure might be giving it a shot with his deep dive into theory in general in VP.
