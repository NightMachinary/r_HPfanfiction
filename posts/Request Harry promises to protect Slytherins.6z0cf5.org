Looking for fics where Harry promises to protect the Slytherins at all cost and becomes their master/owner/knight in shining armor ect extra.


** I expect the Slytherins wouldn't tolerate such a thing. However, a Harry that wins their loyalty by going up to bat to defending them when they need it is something I could see.
