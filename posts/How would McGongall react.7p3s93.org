If McGonagall crossed paths with a grandchild of her ex-fiance Dougal McGregor? How would she react?

Although, I know this would be in AU since there were all killed in the first WIzarding War.


** She would be very calm and composed. Not someone who tends to freak out, doesn't seem to show lots of emotions. Actually, she reminds me quite a bit of my sister. She'd either turn and walk the other way, or if the literally ended up crashing into one another, she would give a tight smile and most likely nothing more.

So yeah, calm and composed definitely if not emotionless, maybe a tint of nostalgia which she'd quickly brush away.

*** If this character was one of her students how would she treat him/her?

**** Like any other student I would imagine. Maybe she'd try to limit contact a bit, but her professionalism would not allow her to be overly positive/negative towards the child.

***** That is the right answer. We have no evidence that McG treated the children of Death Eaters any different and those were much worse than a former fiance.
