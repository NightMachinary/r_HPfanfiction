Let me start, for one, I think a villain who would love to unleash all forms of chaos hidden from the public, such as darker magic, etc. and offer them for free usage, such as time-travel. Anyone who wanted to travel, is allowed to. They also might want to unleash prophecies, including top-secret ones.


** Are you looking for just grand, worldchanging stuff or are smaller ideologies applicable as well? To explain:

For the first, I'd like to see someone who took the Statute down from a Humanitarian viewpoint. "It's cruel, watching them suffer like we do, with no aid at all! We should rejoin the two worlds and work together for the good of all!" Lawful Evil Altruists are some of my favourite characters - especially with the 'Knight Templar' self-image.

For the latter, you could have a villain who wants the 'elitist ivory-tower hoarding of the Unspeakables to end' and opens up experimentation and spellcrafting to all. Or that just wants to be left along to experiment and perhaps took over a small town with a protection racket - they provide subjects, he provides protection.

You could take the standard WBWL 'I want to prove myself better than someone else' and have that pursuit of superiority grow into beating everyone else and becoming the Wizarding World's version of a Tarrasque or finding some all-powerful status.

** Technomancy supremacy can work.

A genius muggleborn decides that magic and science can augment each other really well, makes an magical robotic army to enforce his vision of what magical society could be. An added bonus is if the muggleborn was discriminated against for being a muggleborn when it came to his career options.

*** Or an army consisting of magical clones:

"Begun, the Clone War has."

"The time has come. Commander, execute Order 88!"

"In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Ministry will be reorganized into the first Wizarding Imperium, for a safe and secure society!"

** Cults are possible. Old families probably had long-standing views on where magic actually came from, and I think it's likely that a good number of them revolved around some God or two. That could lead to outright civil war with enough violent convertion attempts and hate crimes.

** Blood purity but not in the muggleborn way, but more of a genocidal crusade against any magical being that is sapient but not human. Veela, maybe giants, werewolves, goblins and so on, the leader believing that magic was gifted to humans and all these abominations stole it, and he is the prophet come to enlighten the chosen to their purpose.

A fight for the complete freedom of magic, no ministry of magic and no governmental bodies restricting magic. No matter the consequences, no matter the sacrifice needed, magic is to be allowed to be practiced freely with no oversight.

Instead of pushing to take over the world, realising how badly the muggles have poisoned the world and how they continue to do so. Researching a way to enter and alter dimensions that they could move to, but the governments don't want to because their power base would be disrupted so they decide to dominate the governments and form a single body under their control in the new world.

** The book thief - someone is raiding all the great libraries of esoteric works, and starts using spells no one has heard of for centuries.

Ekrizdis 2.0 - demon summoning is very out of vogue ever since Dementors were released into the world. Someone wants to bring them back into fashion, because just making hybrid creatures is boring (and also illegal, so why not go for the gold ring?)

Hagrid breeds them bigger and bigger, until... driders, xenomorphs, ... kaiju.

The only way to stop the curse that is lycanthropy is to isolate them in a quarantine and interrogate them to find out who else they've infected, until they all die off.

** Power and money is a good enough motive for me. You don't need a graphic novel / cartoon style villain to do harm. A greedy bastard who casts the Imperius on beautiful young (muggle) women and forces them to prostitute themselves and pockets the cash can do plenty of damage. Add in magical drugs and an lucrative illegal potions trade and Goblins willing to look the other way and it is a perfect storm.

** In my mind technology works with magic. Dark Lords don't want muggle technology because the masses would be to hard to control. The ministry pushes the belief to stay in power and to stop the magical population to join the muggles. The goblins also propagate that technology doest work so they work as currency converters for the muggleborn and muggle raised half bloods. Also any services they provide purebloods can be handled by muggles thus losing out on fees. Basically a giant conspiracy that the top people know of but for varies reasons cover it up. The anti technology Ward could be set up to block areas from the muggles.

** Magical supremacy rather than blood purity. Anything that's magical is inherently better than anything that isn't. It's not about blood. Magic doesn't truly care about blood, which is why squibs exist to begin with.

Magic is the tool of the worthy, the powerful. It can't be stolen or transferred anymore than a star can be contained by a clay vessel. A squib doesn't have magic because a squib is as worthless as a muggle. And a Muggleborn though from unworthy stock is as worthy as a pureblood.
