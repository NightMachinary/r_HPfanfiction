/Article by Ginny Potter, Sports Editor for the Daily Prophet/

The Daily Prophet is reporting that several elite European Quidditch teams, including Puddlemere United, the Montrose Magpies, the Tutshill Tornados and the Wimbourne Wasps, which currently participate in the British and Irish Quidditch League, have agreed to form part of a closed and exclusive league, called the "Magical League".

"There are currently many, many problems with the current European Cup", said Lucius Malfoy, a former Death Eater who is reported to be the financier of this new planned competition. "This will permit a greater quality of matches, which will certainly please the younger generation of fans. The best must always play the best."

However, outrage has been the primary reaction from fans around Europe; accusations of greed and disdain for the traditional sport have abounded. War hero and lifelong Chudley Cannons fan Ron Weasley spoke out: "Part of being a fan is loyalty to your team, your fan community and the sport, no matter if your team loses or if someone flashes thousands of Galleons at you. This is a complete disgrace." Fellow war hero and Tutshill Tornados fan Cho Chang was equally as scornful of the new plan: "As a Tornados fan this is only going to lead to more accusations of us being plastic."

However, it has not only been fans that have been vocal against the plan; many players have also vociferously condemned it, including from those who play with the breakaway teams. This includes legendary players such as Oliver Wood, the longtime Keeper and Captain for Puddlemere United: "I have loved and been involved with Puddlemere for a long time. This is a travesty and an act of betrayal. None of the players in our team have been consulted or even informed of this decision."

The Ministry of Magic is reportedly considering enacting measures against the breakaway teams.

I really hate it when authors use their character as a mouthpiece for their opinions about a country or worse, religion. But there it's just sport, for a non fan like me, it's not a high stake question so I can just read it and enjoy the parody.

*** This. I read fanfiction to get away from the present-day news and politics. And the excuse the clubs gave was that football was too affected by the epidemic. The last thing I want to read is fanfiction about the effect Covid has had on sports- fictional or not.

BTW What's the whole point of /another/ league? That's what the Champions League is for. Clubs are already playing 3 games a week and the quality of football decreases when the players can't rest between games.

**** Nobody has written the "Covid-19 is actually a magical disease which is why Muggles have struggled with it so much" story? I'm surprised.

As for ANOTHER league, I think the thought is that clubs have to qualify for the Champions League through a process. These teams want to bypass qualifying, stop playing in the Champions League, and just play each other in this new league every season and not worry about who is or is not qualifying. Basically they want to make their own Champions League where they automatically qualify. They would still play in their respective home country leagues (Premier, La Liga, etc.). Obviously this has pissed off a lot of people either invested in Champions League or a fan of the current structure.

** Mrs. Weasely's article is well-written, but as a commentary on the current events it is incredibly one-sided.

As much as I approve criticising the so-called Magical League, it was not born out of thin air. The European Cup as an organisation is incredibly corrupt (what else can you expect with Bagman on the job?) and on top of that has been caught skimming profits off the licensing without paying the clubs.

And meanwhile, due to dragon pox pandemic, most top teams are incredibly in-debt due to contractually guaranteed wages. If their profits won't increase, they will have to let go (not sell, since nobody will be able to afford them) most of their best players. And while Mr. Wood may agree to have his pay decked for the love of Quiddich, I don't think many of his teammates will approve.

Something needs to change, and soon --- as much as the Quiddich fans hate to admit it. The European Cup did win this round --- mostly due to the Magical League presentation being completely incompetent --- but I think by the next decade we will see another, better attempt.
