I wrote a little post-canon snippet about Bellatrix's (and Rodolphus') daughter, thought I'd share it here. Opinions, criticism etc. are welcome.

** Just read it. I really liked it! I was not expecting the story to go where it did.

2 things:

1) This isn't that big of a deal, but I'm pretty sure "birthrighteous" isn't commonly accepted as a word.

2) I'd make the fate of Goren just a bit more clear. The way I read it, it was initially implied that he was tortured to death by Lucille as he "lived out his last days very much against his will," but after the scene break it's stated that she rejects his offers of counsel, almost as if they were both on equal footing again. Later, he's shown telling her to shut up about her conflicts of conscience. The way it's presented might confuse some people given that his death is implied, but he still appears in a later scene.

But yeah, great job! :)

*** Thank you for reading, I'm glad I could surprise someone!

1) Yes, it's not a word, but I liked how it sounded, a bit of a writer's license thing. Should I change it? Might've been silly in hindsight.

2) The part where Goren had told her not to bother him was meant to be read as having happened before his death, and the 'rejecting his counsel' was afterward, having learned who he really was. Thank you for telling me this, I'll see if I can edit it and make it all clearer.

**** 1. While I understood where you were coming from, it's likely going to be confusing for people who are still learning English, who make up a surprisingly large amount of readers and writers of English-language fanfiction. Especially when they try to look it up and find the word not there. For clarity's sake I would recommend you change it, especially as "birthright" generally has a positive connotation, like a privilege, whereas what Lucille has is most definitely not. One of the definitions of "righteous" too has a definition of "free of guilt or sin" so you kinda made an oxymoronic phrase, which I like, but it can confuse others who don't realize the other definitions of "righteous." That said, who knows? If you keep it in there, you might start a trend and in a decade "birthrighteous" will be added to the dictionary. :)
2. Thanks for being receptive to it!

That's funny to imagine. Doubtful!

This is sensible advice, I'll find a better way to word that sentence. Thanks for your insight!
