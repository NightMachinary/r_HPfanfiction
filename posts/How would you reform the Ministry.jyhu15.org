Comment how you would reform the Ministry. On my oart, I would go with it this way.

The first and most important order of business is balance of power, better referred to as checks and balances. This term is used in American government(and maybe British too) and describes the powers each branch of government has over the other.

For example, the president can veto a law passed by Congress, and Congress can override that veto with a strong majority. The Supreme Court can declare a law unconstitutional. There are multiple others, such as only Congress can declare war, but the President can send troops to another country. Impeachment is also necessary.

Before checks and balances can be established, the Wizengamot needs some serious reforms. It should be abolished and replaced with a Supreme Court(which we'll call the New Wizengamot) comprising a small amount of elected judges. It will serve a similar purpose as the American Supreme Court. Lower courts will be established, as the New Wizengamot can't handle every case in Britain.

A congress will also be established, which we'll call Wizarding Parliament. It will serve a similar purpose as the Muggle Parliament or American Congress. All congressmen and women will be elected.

The Minister of Magic will serve as a Prime Minister or President, and his or her almost-absolute power will be taken away. He or she will serve a similar purpose as the Muggle Prime Minister.

Now, we arrive at very important item that the Ministry completely lacks: a constitution. It should be modeled after the American or British Constitution, but of course will be changed to provide citizens with their essential rights. The New Wizengamot will have the power to declare any law passed by the Wizarding Parliament and Minister as unconstitutional.

So, the government has been completely reorganized, checks and balances have been established, and we have a constitution. What next?

*Allow magical use of Muggle technology*: Yes, it's reasonable to allow certain restrictions to be placed on this topic, but Muggle technology is vastly superior to the wizards' technology, especially in this day and age.

*Remove Dementors from Azkaban*: As we see multiple times throughout the book, Dementors and their Kiss are highly inhumane. There is no reason why competent Aurors shouldn't be put in charge.

*Outlaw dangerous spells and products, such as love potions*: Sorry, Fred and George, but this new law means that 3/4 or your shop is now illegal. Love potions are a huge issue, as we saw with Merope Gaunt and Tom Riddle Senior. They're essentially date rape drugs. Spells such as the Memory Charm should be carefully regulated, as you can commit a crime and then Obliviate any witnesses.

R*emove discriminating or prejudiced laws*: Of course, we can't completely cure the world of people such as the Malfoys, but we can abolish laws that allow for them to legally discriminate against minorities. Non-human creatures should be allowed to carry wands, and House-Elf slavery should be abolished, but slowly, carefully, and over time, since it's a huge change in their way of life.

*In conclusion, the Ministry of Magic needs to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch based upon the principles of modern-day democratic governments.*


** I don't think it would be a good idea to base it off the American system. I agree with what you said about removing the discriminatory laws and banning love potions tho

I'd introduce political parties like the Tories or labour or lib dems (but you know more useful) cos it would be what the muggleborn/halfblood population are used to. Basically have a system that mirrors Parliament with the house of lords and the house of commons. Maybe introduce laws that have a stricter penalties for things like bribery. Also introduce welfare. Idk if magical Britain has the NHS but introduce a system similar to that paid out of peoples taxes as well as stuff like pensions or benefits for poorer families.

*** The reason I choose the American system is because of the separation of powers. It's hard for the executive to interfere with the legislature or the courts. The UK system is similar to what we already have in canon. The Wizengamot is a mixature of a court and parliament mixed together, the UK used to have that not long ago, when the House of Lords was the supreme court.

Also, the Prime Minister of the UK is also heavily involved in Parliament. Similar to how fudge was involved in the business of the Wizengamot.

Basing it on the American system would stop incompetent, authoritarian leaders like Fudge from destroying the wizarding world. Their powers would be checked.

**** That's a good point but the reason I argued for a more muggle like system was because it gave more power to the citizens. I don't think the the minister for magic elections take place every 4/5 years like they are in the muggle world. So that would be better because they could be replaced quickly if needed. That and the establishment of the local councils which basically sort out local problems and take them to the ministry if needed.

I dunno if I answered your question right. Sorry if i seem a bit ignorant.

** I think the American system wouldn't be a good system to reform the Ministry. The checks and balances are good at preventing corruption, but the bad thing about them is that they are good at preventing any kind of change, good or bad.

** You're an American, huh? Just FYI, we in the UK don't have a constitution. :)

So, are you looking for how this reformation might reasonably happen in canon/in UK culture, or just ideas in general for any changes to make?

** If I was to reform it, the first step I would take would be to get rid of it. Wizards should not be contained by a mugglelish concept such as a government. Might makes right after all. And in this new era the only type of 'governing' power would be the wizards council. A council of the most powerful and influential witches and wizards.

There might not be laws against mass murder, sacrificial rituals and the like, but I do understand that the vast majority would be averse to such things. So in this case the most powerful of this country, if they so chose may perhaps band together to deal with this threat to the lesser magical.

Perhaps this is not the best form of 'government' if you were wanting a safe, civilized society of magical. But as I said earlier, might makes right, and in this magical Britain you either strive to gain magical might or you are suffocated by the power and ambition of those around you.
