Looking for any well written Slytherin Harry stories but with conditions:

Dumbledore and the Weasley's are not bashed. Harry doesn't have to be friends with Ron, I just don't want the Weasley's or Dumbledore to be bashed.

So no Manipulative/Evil Dumbledore. Now he can be morally grey or whatever, I just don't want him bashed. Because so many Slytherin Harry stories for whatever reason tend to have him bashed.

If Snape becomes a mentor or something to Harry I don't want him to suddenly like him just because Harry is in Slytherin, I want him to still be his usual self, while maybe not being as harsh. I don't like it when Snape is suddenly okay with Harry just because of him being in Slytherin.

Harry doesn't hate Muggleborns, just because he's in Slytherin does not mean that he has to hate Muggleborn/Muggles or whatever. I mean his mom was a Muggleborn, and while his Aunt is a Muggle I don't see him judging all Muggles based on how the Dursley's treated him.

I don't want him to be super smart or super powerful, a little bit more then he was in canon is okay, but not super unbelievably please.

I don't want a Harem, I don't want Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, any other pairing is fine. Any rating is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much.

** linkffn(Path of Decision). Slytheric Harry that fits most of your requirements, I don't think that Dumbledore was heavily bashed, but Harry wasn't really in love with him like in canon. It is a crossover with Neil Gaiman's Sandman, but you don't need to read that to get this; I didn't.

Other than that Harry is very competent, though not insanely powerful. No romance. I can't remember, but I don't think that Snape likes Harry.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.

** -Harry doesn't hate Muggleborns

Show me one fic where Harry is in Slytherin and hates Muggleborns. Only thing I know of would be Control.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure that linkffn(8666085) has what you're looking for. I think he does get some kind of power around maybe Fourth Year, but he doesn't start training in it until fifth year. Currently on book six right now, but hasn't updated since June of last year.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

*** Well I just wanted to make sure no one gave me any suggestions where Harry hated Muggleborns. I was just being extra cautious on the matter.

Okay thank you, getting a power or getting more powerful like that in like 4th/5th whatever year is better then say 1st year or whatever. Thanks for the rec will check it out.

** Linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) It has quickly become my favorite Slytherin!Harry fic. Features the entire Trio in Slytherin, with Ron being a master chess player, Hermione having some sort of connection to the Celtic gods, and Harry brought into the Magical world by Snape. We also have deviations from canon beforehand, such as Arthur having died when Ron was young, and most interesting of all is the presence of one Thomas Gaunt, a lord of the Wizengamot and head of the pro-pureblood faction.
