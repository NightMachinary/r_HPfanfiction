Hey y'all; I'm struggling through finals and storing some stories to read after I'm done! I've worked through a lot of the standard genres -H/G, H/Hr, Political!Harry, H/OC Muggle (one of my personal favs). But tonight I'm looking in a different direction, and was wondering if anyone knew of any good fics either focusing on McGonagall or with her as a strong character. I'd especially love reading about her as a professor, dealing with the hijinks of the Trio each year (and just the other stupid situations that magical students would get into). I'm not a huge fan of bashing (especially Ron or Dumbledore - never really got it). If anyone knows of any, I'd be so grateful and would love to hear them. Thanks in advance!

#+begin_quote
  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  Wasted potential is far more offensive to a teacher than outright mediocrity, and it is for that reason, chiefly, that she considers him to be one of the great disappointments of her career. If, then, she should keep seeing potential where everyone else has given up, and if they are to be forever discussing what he will make of himself, so be it.Minerva wonders if he is as aware of the patterns as she is.Six conversations between Minerva McGonagall and Sirius Black, 1976-1996.

  Minerva McGonagall can see a lot of herself in Hermione Granger, and so, when she catches her skipping a Charms class, she decides not to punish her.
