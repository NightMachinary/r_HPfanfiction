[I did this before and it seemed people had fun]

If you could recharacterise one character, what would they be like?

I like the idea of Bellatrix Lestrange being less a crazed madwoman and a more meticulous, cold evil.

I like the idea of her being the Vader to Voldemort's Sidious.

She is prone to Crucio-ing failures and carries herself with a very definitive air of confidence. She is massively intimidating and serves as both Voldemort's right hand and key enforcer. Left effectively to command how she sees fit, because he has that much confidence in her.

Would be nice for some tragedy if, like Anakin, she was manipulated into his service and now stays less because she agrees with his rhetoric (which she does on some level) and more because there is no coming back from what she's done.

Even as Harry may discover this (e.g. his Pensieve lessons through Dumbledore and/or talks with Sirius) and tries to reach out to Bella but she has a slight crack in her armour as she says it's too late for her.

Would make her death a little more tragic.

...

Additionally, I like the idea of this cold feeling of dread coming over the kids, in the Department of Mysteries,as Bellatrix steps out of the shadows and is like:

"You would be wise to surrender." Then she kicks ass and it takes Sirius's death for her to back off.

I really just like the idea of Bellatrix being sent to deal with things that would take several wizards and witches worth of firepower, and she just mows through people without much effort or outward emotion.


** Snape as a person who uses humor as a defense mechanism.

** I like the idea of a less principled, more pragmatic Lucius Malfoy. Like, he's still a death eater in the first war, but after it's over he's like, "Well, sucks that we lost. But I got off scot free, guess I'll just go home to my hot wife and little boy and huge mansion and throw my money around." And everything's pretty much the same until the graveyard, after which he's like "Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. This is not ideal." Because he knows he lost that important diary and accomplished absolutely /nothing/ with it besides getting kicked off the pta, plus he wasn't one of the loyal death eaters who went to azkaban for Voldemort, /plus/ now Draco's nearly grown and do he and Narcissa really want Draco involved in all this?

And also... what can Voldemort actually /do/ for Lucius? In the intervening 13 years, he's put himself in a position to pull whatever string in the ministry he wants, the minister is in his back pocket, he can go to the world cup with his fancy ass tent and peacocks and have a grand old time. Would he be able to throw his influence around and show off how much better he is than everyone in Voldemort's wizarding Britain? Not like he can now. And it's not like he's having to "suffer" through living in some progressive utopia, the wizarding world in canon is lowkey pretty racist as it is. So maybe he does that mental calculus and decides that the effort of busting out the old cloak and mask and trying to take over wizarding Britain /again/ just isn't worth what minimal gains he himself could get from it.

But Voldemort knows where he lives, so he can't just be neutral. It would be in his and his family's best interest to go to the Order, but they already have one death eater spy, so he or Narcissa would have to come up with some hot goss that Snape doesn't know about for the Order to be like, "Alright, fine you assholes, you're in (but we still don't trust you as far as we can throw you)."

** Oh - Because of Lily's eyes on Harry, snape freezes/feels shame when he's being a dick to Harry eye-to-eye! (Rather than only ever seeing James.)

So imagine: like canon, snape rants about Harry to dumbledore. He dismisses him, he's never fair with house points, he lets Draco get away with murder with Harry, he hates him, he thinks he's impertinent and enjoys his fame etc etc. But when snape actually finds himself glaring at potter, he-

Shit.

He dismisses him resentfully and fucks off to the dungeons to glower at the stones in the wall and feel miserable.

I always found him going up to 11 on the rage with Harry very extra, and if he really did see lily in Harry's eyes it should have been a gut punch when snape was really being a dick. Training Harry with legilimency should have panged serious guilt in him staring into Lily's eyes on Harry. Who knows? Maybe it did and his reaction to it was to be a massive arse. I'd love a snape that actually felt a horrible wave of shame when he's a dick to Harry face to face.

Not in a way to foster slash romance, either. Instead, a snape that suffers a glimmer of insight into his own shitty behaviour when Lily's eyes stare at him being a petty, hateful teacher.

** I feel like Dumbledore's personality, in which he seemed to navigate the world with a combination of expert strategy, boundless knowledge, and whimsy, was a carefully constructed persona.

Inside his head, however, he was probably constantly battling his desire - no, his moral imperative - to lose his patience and be a sarcastic shithead to every person he met that was not as clever as he was, ie, everyone.

So I guess I would recharacterize Dumbledore as a sarcastic shithead. Expert-level troll. No argument too petty. No self-compliment too pretentious. He's published and has tenure. What do you have? Nothing? Thought so.

Or maybe I just want to rewrite every scene from the perspective of Dumbledore's internal monologue.

** Rather than fan fiction Draco, I like to think of Blaise as fitting that role.

My in progress backstory for his family is that while they are pureblood believers, they view pure blood in less absolute terms. If all your grandparents were magical, you're pure blood. The idea is that if you've grown up around magic, and raised by people who spent their whole life around magic, good enough.

His mother got on the wrong side of the death eaters based on this, and was cursed by Voldemort so that whoever she married would die. She then set about marrying rich death eaters and letting the curse kill them, all the while growing her wealth. That amused Voldemort, so he let her carry on this way.

Blaise grew up with this mindset of practicality while maintaining the sauve upper crust persona and political ambition.
