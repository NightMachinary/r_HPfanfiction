Ideally would be looking for something with a rich and complex plot over a light-hearted crackfic and the longer the better, I've not been able to find a great fanfic for a long time üòÅ Thank you!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11642540/1/The-Lawyers-Against-the-Cup][The Lawyers aginst the Cup]] by tangerine alert. Harry never put his name in the cup. No one would believe him, so he leaves Hogwarts searching for a way to fight the wizarding contract, using the thing that holds him to it; the law. Complete. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13171906/1/One-Trick-Champion][One Trick Champion]] by Right What is Wrong. "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." Harry discovers his hammer, and the Triwizard Tournament is looking an awful lot like a nail. Oneshot. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12459429/1/][Play to Your Strengths]] by ladyfoxfire. Before the first task in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Moody told Harry to 'play to your strengths' and Harry took those words to heart. Of course the Wizard World was less than pleased with the new Harry. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/Muggle-Raised-Champion][Muggle raised Champion]] by stargon1. The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive. complete. FFNet.

[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=Athey&sort=title][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]] by Athey. Isolated from his friends, Harry begins to reflect on his life and discovers his darker side. Slash. Complete but has an abandoned sequel. No longer on FFNET so the link goes to FF2EBook where you can download an epub.

*** I don't understand the authors thought process in play to your strengths. Sure Hermione loves rules but she's muggleborn . casting her as the person admonishing Harry for using muggle items doesn't even make sense

  Harry and Hermione decide to help Fred and George to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire. Then, they enter some more names. Chaos ensues... A story that combines humour, logic, canon concepts, and some unique plot bunnies into a 4th-year tale that's hopefully different. COMPLETE

What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?

  After his name came out of the Goblet of Fire, Harry woke to a disturbing reality. The wizarding world only saw him as an expendable pawn, his carefree attitude towards studying left him struggling to survive, and he had never truly appreciated the one, constant companion at his side---Hermione Granger. It was high time for change. Gradual Grey!HHR.

  Harry Potter is tired of running blindly into life and death situations. This series is about Harry thinking before he leaps. It starts off at the summer following the events that transpired in Prisoner of Azkaban.
