** Favorite Golden Trio: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630/chapters/14514247][The Sum of their Parts]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary:\\
  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
#+end_quote

Favorite Dark Harry: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1637290][Mutatum Series]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary:

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn.

  Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
#+end_quote

Favorite Dimension Travel: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/457151/chapters/786691][Stages of Hope]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary:\\
  “Your robes are...red,” Hermione finally said, strangely accusing.\\
  “Burgundy!” Severus protested. Red was tacky. Burgundy, however, had class.\\
  “And what did you do to your hair?” she asked in horrified fascination.\\
  Snape's hand rose to his scalp.\\
  “Nothing! What is wrong with you? I just washed it and blow-dried it like every morning...”\\
  “Ah, I see.” She nodded and stepped back. “Alternate dimension. It must be.”
#+end_quote

Favorite Time Travel Fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10093553/chapters/22482785][The many deaths of Harry Potter]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary:\\
  In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right.
#+end_quote

Favorite Crack Fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12983913/chapters/29683959][Triple Trouble]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary:\\
  Dumbledore would regret the decision to hand over the school letters to the house elves, even if it did save him hours in admin. Eleven year old Harry Potter was expected... Tom Riddle and Gellert Grindelwald... yeah, not so much. However they might turn out to be the least of the school's problems.
#+end_quote

and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27049720/chapters/66040888][Bad Education]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary:\\
  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)
#+end_quote

And finally, I found this one recently but love it: favorite crossover: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25976608/chapters/63150709][Love, Fate and Prophecy]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary:\\
  Hunters are not allowed to raise magical children. When it is discovered that Mary is pregnant with a wizarding child, MACUSA steps in, and the Potters step up. Henry Winchester is raised as Harry Potter until security concerns send him to a family that does not know he exists. As Winchester luck dictates, the road will not be smooth. Especially when Heaven intervenes.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] for ffn or [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1105731][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] on ao3

/As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job./\\
*or*\\
/Too intelligent child who doesn't feel like a child at all comes to believe the only real people in the world are the two who are kind to her. As she grows, the world turns out to be much more nuanced than that, and much lonelier as her friends don't stand by her, in fact they're not friends at all. She continues to struggle towards doing what she feels she's supposed to do, even as her reason for doing this starts to slip away/

(it's one of my favorite HP fanfiction, and there isn't /really/ a pairing, but it focuses on the relationship of Lily/Wizard Lenin)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12793151/1/When-Harry-Met-Tom][When Harry Met Tom]] on ffn and I don't feel like linking ao3 sorry

/When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry/

(This is frickin hilarious, like if you want to laugh READ IT. it's Harry/Tom but nothing is happening between them so far and we don't know /which/ Tom)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13598559/1/Eyes-Wide-Shut][Eyes Wide Shut]] on ffn

/Of course Rose Weasley would be standing behind him when he insulted her. As a consequence for his rudeness, he has to complete 9 tasks "to get to know her better" or he's kicked off his Quidditch team./

(It's a great, UNIQUE fic about the next gen and it could be interpreted as Scorose though it doesn't really happen and can I tell you that their personalities are NOT what you'd expect in a next gen HP fic)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11305455/1/Boredom-Is-Deadly][Boredom Is Deadly]] on ffn

/For Harry, the 'next great adventure' isn't really all that great. After two-thousand years of dealing with the whining souls of the dead, he decides to spice things up a bit...by returning to his first year at Hogwarts. Crackfic! MOD!Harry Darkish!Harry GaryStu!Harry with a twist. NO Bashing!/

(This one is crack and will get a laugh out of you. it's been some time since I've read it, but I don't think there's any pairings)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] on ffn

/AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing./

(One of the BEST Death!Harry fics EVER! too bad it was discontinued. . .and no pairings =) )

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] on ffn

/In the depths of the Ministry, there is a cell for the world's most dangerous man... and he wants out. Read warnings. No slash./

(Really good story about Harry and ppl dying and him accidently kidnapping a baby and then basically adopting her and warning there is some descriptions of gore that you COULD skip over)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban][All the Dementors of Azkaban]] on ffn

/AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot./

This one is a long one-shot that is pure crack and is hilarious. been some time since I last read it, but I think there are no pairings)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][The Wendell That Wasn't]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4509877/1/Broccoli-and-the-Art-of-Subterfuge][Broccoli and the Art of Subterfuge]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4366245/1/Fathers-of-the-Year][Fathers of the Year]] on ffn, all by the same person and really just very good and funny, especially the first two

/The true story of how Harry and Ginny's kids got their names. Really, it's all Snape's fault. Crackfic oneshot./

/Harry has some rather questionable parenting methods. And he may or may not be responsible for Draco Malfoy's receding hairline. NextGen crackfic oneshot!/

/Harry and Draco find ways to keep the hate alive. Albus Severus and Scorpius approve. NextGen oneshot crackfic ahoy!/

(no pairings)

OH AND

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4145459/1/The-Horror-The-Horror][The Horror! The Horror!]] on ffn

/Humorous, post GOF tale. Harry goes to Africa and sets up a potions ingredient business. Wackiness ensues./

(It's a 6 chapter crack-fic that is just plain FUNNY with no pairings [I think. . .honestly I forgot, but I'm pretty sure there's not {that rhymed!}])

​

Wow. That's a lot. Hope you enjoy (at least some of) them!

** linkao3(ever upward by stranglerfig) an absolutely hilarious and heartwarming ‘Harry is raised by the Basilisk' series. The author is an anthropologist and it shows, the cultures of the different beings are so distinct, interesting and fully fleshed out. The series is finished too, which is a bonus.

** None of these are deep cuts so you probably have heard of them if you enjoy the pairings already. But I was in the mood to look over my favorites!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative by Vinchan]] Addresses dark magic (and having an inclination towards types of magic) in an interesting, non-info-dumpy, way. Explores Harry being re-sorted into Slytherin for his fifth year. It is a very very slow burn, PG Drarry. Sirius and Harry's relationship becomes even stronger, which I always love to see. The sequel is currently in progress.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10620276/chapters/23489001][The Fallout by Everythursday]] is completed, even though it isnt marked as such. A classic Dramione, but has one of my favorite Hermione characterizations ever (which is sort of a controversial thing to say about this fic haha) because she feels very real and isn't overpowered or perfect by any means. I have reread this fic 4? times.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes by mskingbean89]] There is a reason has some of the most hits out of any on Ao3. The ultimate Remus-centric Marauders fic, with Wolfstar taking place in the second half. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll need to go read fix-it fics afterward to not spiral into a depression.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things by lettered]] Obligatory: I never ever read de-aging fics because I find them creepy, but this one isn't weird or problematic in any shape or form. It is cathartic to see Draco and Harry learn about the younger versions of themselves.

The last two or three are crossovers, but other than the last one you don't really need any background knowledge of the other fandoms. (Also please don't automatically assume that the first and the last ones are bad just because they're on Wattpad. Personally, the first one is the most hilarious fic I've ever come across, even though it's not crack.)

Hope you enjoy reading!

When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.
