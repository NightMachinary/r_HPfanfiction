Hi!

I'm looking for any fic where Harry is this handsome, amazing, good-looking, eligible person, and every girl is falling head over heels for him, just he doesn't realize it. He's not a womanizer, he's actually not interested in a relationship, but everyone wants to be with him.

Anything like dat? Thanks in advance.


** Had to recheck the subreddit name as this immediately reminded me of the tv show 'I wanna marry Harry' where they got a regular British ginger construction worker with no money to pretend to be prince harry and 20 American girls who had been recruited to this reality show who were hook line sinker all over themselves for him. Great trashy binge watch.

*** Thanks for the shoutout! Though I'm not sure Loose Cannon meets OP's criteria, since Harry is aware of his popularity and wants a relationship.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
