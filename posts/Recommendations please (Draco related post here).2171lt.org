Hi, I'm looking for a quality fics with smart!Draco and/or smart!Harry, and where both of them are friends (or at least on friendly terms). So something like The Code Trilogy ([[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Code_Trilogy]]) or Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality ([[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Ha...of_Rationality]]). Draco/Ginny is an added bonus. But NO Slash, please. Thank you.


** The Draco Trilogy (Or at least the first book) is worth a read.

*** Read this one before. The first one was pretty good but I lost the plot in the following installments.

** My favourite (current) portrayal of Draco has come out of MarauderLover7's "Innocent" and "Initiate" stories. They're very long and theyre AU but he/she has done some cool things to the way Draco (and Narcissa and Snape, by association) are displayed. He's not in every chapter but he crops up regularly and he does have a friendship with Harry. No pairings are known yet but I'd be surprised if the author made it slash.

** I'm reading a Slytherin!Harry right now but I don't know if I'd recommend it to anyone. It's the Saving Connor series? I rather like the Snape, and the parents Malfoy, but am pretty frustrated with the Harry character (which is a problem I have in canon as well) and I'm not sure how the Draco is going to work out with him. That said - it's a massive undertaking, a complete AU of all 7 books. I just finished book 1 and am like two chapters into book 2. If you're up to a massive reading then maybe?

*** That is my favorite series!!! But it does eventually lead to slash. Harry is frustrating, but Malfoy kicks his ass a few times and doesn't allow him to just continue with his insane thoughts ;) It gets better as it progresses, I think there is an insane amount of growth on both of their parts.
