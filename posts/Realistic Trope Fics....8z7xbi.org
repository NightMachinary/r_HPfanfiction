This has likely been asked before, but I'd like to see any fic that takes a trope and slaps it down. For example...

- Harems

- Marriage Contracts

- Magical Cores


** Just waiting for a fic to slap down the Veela Draco trope -.-

** I've done that for the whole political/magical Lordship tropes. Sirius, vaguely remembering that his grandfather could do as he pleased, thinks that the title would be a nice gift for Harry. Without too much spoilers, Harry does not become "Lord Black" and the position itself isn't nearly as powerful as Sirius remembered because the power came from his grandfather having blackmail on pretty much everyone.

Most of the political stuff is in chapter 7, although the others are recommended for context. Politics are not the main focus.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.

** I think it was in Love for Magic by Noodlehammer that Harry attempts rituals to enhance his body and magic, and the portraits of his grandparents help him. They slap down the idea of Magical Cores. Maybe you want to look into that, if you havent done already.

*** I don't think this story slaps down any cliches or tropes. There's dozens of them in the story, and it feels like the author was more on the side of "this is the kind of shit I like to read about" rather than "these ideas are overdone, lets do them proper"

**** Hi,

fair enough. However it was the only fanfiction I knew of that did not go into the "Magic Core" corner and abused said topic into oblivion.
