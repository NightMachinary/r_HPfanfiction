Me personally I've started disliking Dumbledore along with Hermione and Ginny. There's a few others but those are the top 3.

When I first started reading HP fanfiction everything was all sweet Rainbows and Sunshine and I loved all those characters just as much as I loved reading and watching them in the series. After coming across what can be called bash fics.

My attitude and how I viewed my once favourite characters changed. Hermione became a bit more annoying which I have to admit she already was in the original series but I no longer found it endearing. I can't even ship or read stories where Harry is with Ginny anymore not because of the trope where Ginny uses love potions because she's been brainwashed and is deluded in thinking she should marry "The Boy-Who-Lived" become the next lady Potter blah blah

Dumbledore was the easiest to dislike I already wasn't too sure about him after PoA. Instead of the Grandfatherly I found him to be manipulative and foolish. I don't think he's evil and that he did mean well but I still find myself agreeing with Aberforth in DH.

Maybe I'm being too close minded and silly and I do understand fanfiction is not canon but that's just how my views have been influenced because of it


** I never really thought about Molly, but seeing so many of y'all talk her up has made me... double down on dismissing her.

Molly Weasley is fine. She is NOT a badass. She is not uber powerful, or amazingly clever.

She's just a sweet, if a bit exhausted, mother

Saying the word "bitch" does not make you a badass. I don't care that she apparently outdueled Bellatrix, it's just dumb.

And what the hell does she DO all day? Her kids are all moved out or in school.

*** She didn't out duel Bellatrix, she joined a 3 on 1 fight and caught her by surprise. That's as if Neville ran Voldemort through with the sword of Gryffindor during the final duel.

It is also important to remember that, apparently as the only even slightly competent fighter on the light side, Molly went for the killing curse.

***** I Honestly, a SFW, clean language battle feels way more out of place. There should have been more dialogue along the lines of "let's kill those fuckers", "make those Bastards bleed", or "were going to bait them here and then fuck them right in the arse/bugger them from behind". Also way more cursing and the agony filled screams of the dying (not everyone dies to killing curses after all).

Trying to write a mild T rated battle just feels off and shows a massive disconnect between the genre/target audience and what's happening. McGonagall might care about proper language, but I don't see Seamus or the twins showing the same restrain.

That's not to say that I subscribe to the potion queen bullshit where Molly masterminds a systematic "shipping" campaign or Dumbledore is stealing Harry's gold, but "ten dark years" and not following up on the "bars on his window" are pretty damaging on their own.

** Am I the exception as someone who has found a new appreciation of certain characters? For example, I never paid Ginny much attention in the books, but there are some wonderful authors out there who really flesh out her character and now I love reading about her.

Or Draco, he's a nasty bully in the books, but at the end of Deathly Hallows you can see the beginning of a redemption arc, and I always enjoy a good Draco redemption.

The only one I can't stand as a main character is Snape. I appreciate his complexity and everything but I can only endure his bitterness and self-pity in small doses.

** I've read all of the books, and I think fandom has only changed my opinion of how I view Harry. That, really, if Harry had more drive and was just a little more ambitious (whoops Slytherin) he'd probably have been quite the formidable wizard. Not to say that wasn't a formidable wizard by the end of Deathly Hallows, but he would have been possibly well past Auror level in dueling or perhaps much more well-rounded in his studies. Harry, to me, didn't realize his potential. Which I guess I shouldn't be too upset about, because Harry grew up in an abusive home; it's hard to see yourself as more when others have systematically called you lesser.

I definitely disliked Dumbledore before I started reading fanfiction. All fanfiction really did was better develop just how manipulative and/or emotionally unattached Dumbledore really was when dealing with Harry. The detailed grooming of Harry by Dumbledore in fanfic just made sense after reading Deathly Hallows.

I still really like the Weasleys and Hermione. If anything, I'm extremely attached to Hermione. Love her to bits, don't really enjoy any bashing or the like.

** I agree that If you haven't reread the books since you were young and get now into fanfiction you'll be exposed to tons of bashing that will make you see everything from a very different point of view, but I'm certain anyone would come to similar theories on their own just by reading the books as an adult.

The trick to prevent such thoughts is to read the books with a simple mindset, understanding that they are filled with plot holes and that JKR never properly planned anything. Take what the books tell you as absolute facts and /don't think/.

/Fantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald/ opened my eyes to how much JKR's storytelling suffers from this, when it isn't covered up, as canon was, with lovable characters and evocative writing full of whimsy and unreliable narration. The camera can't be as unreliable as viewing the world through Harry's perspective, and that's why the plot in that movie feels so reliant on ham-fisted idiocy and convenience.

*** Really, you've got to read the books as two series. One, from books 1-3/4, is a kid's series. The adults are incompetent, magic is highly ill-defined and fluctuates from book to book, the challenges are tailored for smart kids, and so on. These are wonderfully written - but won't stand up to intricate/consistent worldbuilding examination.

Books 5-7 are a young adult series, and are (IMO) very different in tone. Book 4 is the middle part - bridging the two.

The magic system starts becoming more fleshed out and defined later on - and the plot starts to hit the 'big points' that JKR probably meant to (Voldemort's return, the horcruxes, snape, dumbledore's death, the end). The writing grows more complicated - and IMO less interesting, as JKR's mastery of simple writing falls away.

Both are filled with plot holes - but in the first half it's kind of to be expected.

** The one character that has lost the shine for me is Professor McGonagall.

After bingeing on a bunch of fics that followed the stations of canon, I saw that every other author and their mum had McGonagall in their fic, but reading so many iterations of the same re-hashed plot, I realized that very little of what McGonagall did actually changed the outcome of the story. She's present in important turning points, like when Dumbledore leaves Harry with the Dursleys, she's a member of Dumbledore's inner circle, and the reasonable teacher compared to bitter and biased Snape, crazy Trelawney, and the revolving door of DADA professors. But despite all of that, she's remarkably passive, not just unhelpful, but negligent.

This was the moment where it dawned on me that what we were told didn't match what we were shown. Professor McGonagall, we're told, is meant to be wise and guiding, but she fell far short of those expectations. It was similar to being told that Tom Riddle was the most talented and intelligent student Hogwarts had ever seen, but he wasn't really like that when we finally saw Voldemort in action.

And a big part of my grudge has come about from JKR messing with the timeline and making it so she was a teacher at Hogwarts in around 1908-1913, when Newt Scamander went to school. This makes her a full-grown adult when Tom Riddle was a little boy, and close to 100 years old when Harry is a student. 120+ or so when she's Headmistress to Albus and Scorpius. Ugh.

My frustration comes from her personally knowing about Harry's home situation after following the Dursleys around ("they're the worst sort of muggles") and treating Harry as a normal student, which is pretty distantly and uninvolved, when she has a job as teacher, deputy headmaster, and head of house. Instead of as a teacher with a kid who might need extra support or understanding due to his history with adult authority figures.

She does know that trouble always be comes from Harry and friends, so it seems negligent not to be more involved.

She had no idea that they would be actually neglectful or the animosity they held towards magic. All she knew is that they spoil their actual child, who is an awful brat but could easily grow out of it.

Indeed, there's not much she could do except report the situation to Dumbledore, who has his own reasons for wanting Harry there. If he were to undercut whatever inquiry she led by saying he thought the placement was valid (and what Ministry official wouldn't use /that/ to their career's advantage?), then she'd lose all support.

Sure he is very intelligent, sure he is influential, sure he is more talented at magic than the average wizard but it's only in the last book that we truly get to see him for what he is... a deeply flawed human who lacks the confidence to go to a head to head battle (it took him like 20 years or something to finally confront Grindelwald?).

The series is great and yes, there are plot holes and some situations don't always make sense, but ultimately, it's a good children's/YA series.

** If there's one thing I've realised after reading fanfictions, it that canon!Harry is a pretty average wizard. Think about it, he has the greatest dark wizard of all time after his life - that's enough of a motivator to stay ahead of everyone but he was averaging Acceptable in Transfiguration before his O.W.L.s, and unlike wizards like Dumbledore, Voldemort, or even Hermione, he gets, and is content with, Exceeds Expectations in most subject. You'd think that he will get Outstanding in most subjects, but he barely manages to keep up with his schoolwork.

He's lucky that Voldemort was an idiot to overlook things again and again, and basically handed his death, otherwise Harry is a pretty ordinary wizard that would easily get slaughtered.

Snape's words are not too inaccurate. He's rather lazy and a lot of times, he manages to find his way out simply by pure luck or having more talented friends.

*** Exactly and I mean after being able to escape the Dursley's for almost the whole year and learning about magic would have been a good motivator to become more studious. Heck even hearing people praise his parents should have been encouragement enough.

I don't know about you but if I was suddenly taken away from my abusive relatives and thrust into a world where I'm famous for vanquishing a Dark Lord who is the wizarding equivalent of Hitler who also happens to have killed my parents for trying to protect me. I sure as hell wouldn't be lazy about the school work. It's Magic for God's sake for someone who's just been introduced to magic he's not very enthusiastic about actually applying himself as much as he should.

Like you said Voldemort coming after him every year and when Sirius escaped Azkaban supposedly to kill him should have been enough motivation for him to expand his defensive and offensivespells repertoire. Where's all the Slytherin traits the Hat was talking about? Cunning, Ambiton to prove himself and some damn subtlety.

Also I know they covered this in Deathly Hallows but Expelliarmus? Really?!? I love Harry I really do but of all the spells he goes for that. I can understand hesitation for the Death Eaters but Voldemort? Yes he did succeed in killing him but no just no. The more fanfics I read in which Harry offs Voldemort in a different manner the more I find myself cringing at the scene.

That's not to say Harry was useless or anything I don't expect him to be OP in canon. He just could have done a lot better in improving himself. There were some moments like teaching the DA and learning the patronus to defend himself against the dementors which I was quite proud of.

** You read to many stories that bash them, then ;) I try to avoid those and usually (well written) fanfiction makes me understand and appreciate all the characters, even those I initially did not like. I disliked Sirius for example because of the “prank” he played in school. That was attempted murder he got away with and saw nothing wrong with. It could have killed Snape, or turned him into a werewolf. Snape could have told everyone of Lupin's secret. With all three options, Lupin would have ended either expelled or ececuted. That's a pretty terrible thing to do to a friend. But reading good fanfiction which manages to get people's psychology and motivations right, I came to understand that he's just super impulsive and short sighted. He never really considered the consequences. So, he's not as malicious as I had initially thought.

I really dislike Sirius after reading several fanfics because there he seems unable to get,say, that Slughorn's favouritism might hurt students or doesn't care about anything that is unrelated to Harry. But that doesn't happen in all the fics, so I'm still hopeful. I cannot stand Tonks now because she irritates me nearly in every fic I've read with the exception of fics by fernwithy.

And I don't even know why Sirius's lack of, I don't know, emotional maturity maybe annoys me so much. I guess I dislike that in reality.

***** I'm really annoyed by the power dynamics most authors write for Tonks. You have a woman in her twenties who already went through cop/military training and is outgoing/extroverted, and a teenager who at best had two relationships and a date. So clearly, Tonks will eternally swoon as soon as Harry asks about her "real self" or is kind to her. And clearly, he will be the dominant party in that relationship. /s

As for Sirius, I feel like he never really had a chance to shine. He went from an abusive home into a civil war, into a decade of unlawful incarceration in the worst prison on this planet to living on the run and in hiding. He never got a chance at life and that's something I'd like to see explored. Granted, a lot of fics handle him beyond poorly as an overgrown man child, but that's a different issue.

As for his violent side, good. You can't win a war with non lethal weapons if the other side is shooting to kill. I'd much rather read about Harry, Hermione, Sirius and Tonks fighting a guerilla war against Voldemort and Umbridge than Big Weasley family fluff with enough children so you need a spreadsheet.

Finding out the Draco fandom existed kinda made me pay attention and realize that Draco is not just a bully, but a whiny pathetic coward with no redeeming features. It's weird how JKR kinda hints that she wanted to give him some kind of arc but couldn't square it with him being a total coward and just let the cowardice define him.

Reading shitty writers bash Ron makes canon Ron look cooler in contrast. After reading about death eater/rapist/loser Rons it really stands out when he sacrifices himself in book 1 at the chess match and stands between Harry and Sirius in book 3.

I found Ron to be somewhat selfish and not a good friend for Harry but then again the 4th movie really just brought that feeling out. I couldn't get over how he just up and abandoned Harry when he was forced into the tournament. Like did he not truly know Harry? Harry didn't like attention or came so why would he enter himself into a tournament that could only give him attention and money if he won? He was already famous and rich so he had no reason to enter.

I started disliking Dumbledore and just see him as a person who didn't truly care for Harry and who manipulated his life so he would be a willing martyr. I always found a lot of his actions concerning Harry to be questionable. Like how he left a baby on a doorstep of family members who despised all things magic and who McGonagall swore were bad choices as guardians after just a day of watching them.

As for Voldemort I saw him as more than an insane dark wizard but someone who was once a promising powerful wizard that had people flocking to him but as time passed he fell more and more in love with dark magic and that lead to his decent into madness.

  But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn't hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn't put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn't at all in the mood to celebrate... Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn't get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands... Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore's Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet...

  "I didn't," he said, over and over again, "I don't know how it happened."

  But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.

  "I'm tired!" he bellowed finally,*after nearly half an hour.* "No, seriously, George - I'm going to bed -"
#+end_quote

There's no way that Ron didn't hear the "blast of noise" when Harry came in. But Harry remains downstairs with his admirers for nearly a half hour before he comes upstairs to find Ron. Which gives Ron a half hour to brood about why if Harry didn't put his name in the goblet, Ron's upstairs alone with zero information while Harry hangs out with his admirers downstairs.

And things don't go well when Harry finally does show up.

#+begin_quote
  He [Ron] looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.

  "Where've you been?" Harry said.
#+end_quote

Not a great start from Harry. Harry means it as "why weren't you there for moral support?" But to Ron, this registers as "Why weren't you downstairs congratulating me at the party with the others?"

Since we see the books from Harry's POV, we know that Harry wasn't really a voluntary participant in his own party. But Ron doesn't know this. Harry shows up thirty minutes "late" with a Gryffindor banner tied around his neck and looking like he's enjoyed spending the last 30 minutes being praised by the entire house.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh hello," said Ron.

  He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.

  "So," he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. "Congratulations."

  "What d'you mean, congratulations?" said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace.

  "Well... no one else got across the Age Line," said Ron. "Not even Fred and George. What did you use - the Invisibility Cloak?"

  "The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line," said Harry slowly.

  "Oh right," said Ron. "I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak... because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? But you found another way, did you?"

  "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it."

  Ron raised his eyebrows.

  "What would they do that for?"

  "I dunno," said Harry. *He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill me."*

  Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.

  "It's okay, you know, you can tell /me/ the truth," he said. "If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet, she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either..."

  "I didn't put my name in that goblet!" said Harry, starting to feel angry.

  "Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same skeptical tone as Cedric. "Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you... I'm not stupid, you know."

  "You're doing a really good impression of it," Harry snapped.

  "Yeah?" said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. "You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something."
