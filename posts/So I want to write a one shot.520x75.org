Writers block sucks. A friend gave me the idea to write something random. Which would be cool if I could think of anything random! So got an idea you'd like to see in text?

Give me suggestions and I'll turn one into a 10-15k Word one shot posted to my fanfiction profile on or before October first!


** Dumbledore sees that Snape is under a lot of stress from spying, and from teaching in general, and so takes him ten pin bowling.

*** I would read that. Mundungus is a much underused character.

** Hermione and Harry are secretly gay. They both drink polyjuice to be with the spouse of the other. One day Harry or Hermione fuck up.

edit: Some more.

Harry really liked flying on a dragon. He decides to tame himself one. That Horntail from the Triwizard would do nicely for that.

Harry meets his Aunt Marge strolling through the parks he bought from Voldemorts bounty. She lets her hounds attack. Little does she know that Harry has his own pet. Fluffy.

** Oh there are so many. I dont struggle for ideas, just time and I want to concentrate on my own original work now so I'm happy to give away ideas I once thought I might write - I don't think any of these have been done before - If they have been I haven't found them. Some probably aren't one-shots admittedly.

A proper story about how Hagrid and Olympe found and dealt with the giants.

the story of how Sirius got from Azkaban to Little Whinging when he escaped - he must have had loads of adventures on the way!

Real meaty Auror/2nd Order of the Phoenix stories set in the times when they weren't nursemaiding Harry. Moody and Tonks would be a great team and there is loads of scope for minor and original characters. Really you could do anything there without breaking canon. Also stories about Kingsley - there are hardly any. I did squeeze a couple of plotbunnies into a story but never followed through with them. One was about a gang of Death-Eaters smuggling a Vietnamese Five -toed Imperial dragon into Cardiff in a shipping container (that could have been a Torchwood crossover) and the other was about the Loch Ness monster being another basilisk. That could definitely be a one-shot.

And of course The Cursed Child has a bazillion plot holes waiting to be filled.

** Something to do with Luna Lovegood? Anything really--though I'm partial to stories that focus on Ginny and Luna's friendship.

Or how about something with the Dursleys? Dudley and Harry reconciling, to a point, has been done before, but rarely very well.

** 1. Dumbledore's fight with Grindelwald
2. Grindelwald's last moments. Just before he died.
3. I am curious to see a one-shot that goes in depth regarding Voldemort and his thought process. Especially his earlier years. No one is born evil..
4. Why did Sirius turn out so different from the rest of the family?
5. Dumbledore, such a fascinating character. I'd like to see a one-shot of Ariana Dumbledore and her relationship with her two brothers.
6. Merope Guant, perhaps you could write a one-shot where she continues feeding Tom Riddle love potions. How different would the world be.

These are a bunch of thoughts that could transition into stories. hope I helped.

*** Six is probably the winner. But I think I'm going to play with it a bit and have it just be Merope and Tom's time together.

1 and 3 are both going to be touched upon in the current fic I have in progress so I'm going to avoid those
