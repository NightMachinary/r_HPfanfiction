I'm looking for fanfiction where Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy BOTH time travel to the past, during their Hogwarts years preferably but I think it would hilarious if the fanfic would go even further into the past. I would prefer it if the fanfiction were completed or close to it. Maybe just a long fanfic, too.

I've read both Time Warp by Kittenn1011 and That Old Black Magic by Keira Marcos. They are both fanfiction that involves what I said above. Don't recommend them, though, as I have already mentioned that I have read them both before.


** are you looking for then to be funny???

If you want a good Fanfic, where both travel to the past, one option is Time to Spare

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

** I've got a list of time travel fics but I'm afraid none of them are fics where both Harry and Draco go back in time. Just Harry. And there is no slash between them.

*** It doesn't really matter. I've got a lengthy list of time travel fics, too. Like, almost forty-five of them, but I've literally only come across two fanfics that have Harry and Draco time travel. I was just wondering if anyone had more luck than me.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
