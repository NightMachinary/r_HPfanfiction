I'm looking for a fic I once read, about Hermione travelling back to the Marauder's era, falling in love with Remusand in the end both Remus and Hermione get obliviated so that she can stay in his timeline.

Thanks for your help!

  Draco meant to send her to the future, to a world ruled by Lord Voldemort. He really ought to read directions before he goes messing with other people's things. Hermione finds herself stuck in the past (The 70s!), pretending to be something she's not (Average!) and fighting with everything she has to keep from changing the future.

***** At the first time of reading it, it was amazing, but now rereading it makes me really cringe sometimes.

****** First time reading anything like DoT is amazing :D But yes, you're right; the pacing always seems so off to me when I reread because I already know what's coming next. It can definitely be a little cringey.
