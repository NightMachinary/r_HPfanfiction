Hi! I love Sirius and have been wanting to read more fics with him. So please recommend your favorite fanfics with Sirius in it!

Sidenote: it doesn't have to be Sirius-centric, just any fic you like him in

Types of fics I'm hoping for but I'm pretty open to most fics:

- Marauders era but can also be time travel (preferably Harry rather than another character)

- Alternate universes (wbwl/ James and lily live)

- I'm a sucker for Sirius and James, and Sirius and Harry friendship.

- He can have as big or small a part in the story. Sirius doesn't have to be the main character, it's okay if he is a side character as long as he's well written/characterized.

- I've read fics where Harry is reincarnated as James or Lily's sibling and then Harry and Sirius are friends or date that I've really enjoyed.

- I like when Sirius is portrayed as more serious. (Maybe a little darker)

What I don't want: - Sirius/Remus. I don't ship them but I'm fine with pretty much anyone else. - I'm not a Snape fan so not really interested in him as the main character.

One example is in Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi, Sirius honestly doesn't play a huge role but I love his and Harry's relationship.

Thank you!!


** I like Sirius a lot in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]]. Also, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13140586/1/Sirius-Black-Is-Sick-of-Your-Parenting-Advice][Sirius Black Is Sick of Your Parenting Advice]] is just a short oneshot but I adore Sirius in it.

  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was.

** My fav Sirius fic is the "Interwoven" series by Katinka31.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/714431/1/Interwoven-The-Seamstress-and-the-Lovable-Stray]]

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/katinka/]]

It was written before OOTP came out and paired him with a female OC living in Hogsmeade.

Another longer Sirius fic that I read and remember on the spot would be Cartographer's Craft. by Copperbadge.
