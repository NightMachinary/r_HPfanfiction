As the title suggests: come up with the most ridiculous story you can of FGO's Merlin's in his school year(s) in Hogwarts.

+all's fine, as long as nobody dies.+

For the uninitiated: [[http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Caster_(Fate/Grand_Order_-_Merlin)]]

also(tl;dr version from TVTropes):

#+begin_quote
  Merlin is occasionally called "Futa Maker" or "Dick/Cock Wizard" after his infamous meta changing skill, which fans joke to be the one that temporarily gave Altria a male sexual organ in her backstory that led to the creation of Mordred.
