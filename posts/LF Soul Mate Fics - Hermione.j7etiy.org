Hello!

I'm looking for soul-mate/soulbonded fics starring Hermione. I'm down with her being paired with Harry, Draco, or Severus.

Any recs?


** Harry is simple. Just Google 'Don't fear the Reaper'

Draco or Snape I wouldn't know I don't do /that/ ðŸ˜…

  Everyone knew what veela were. Veela were magical creatures, breathtakingly beautiful, who captivated men with a single look. It would have been nice to have been that strain. Instead, Hermione Granger was infected by another. Instead of captivating all men, she was captivated by one. She'd die without him. She was already in almost constant pain. DRAMIONE. COMPLETE.
