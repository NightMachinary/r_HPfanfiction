i was thinking that Bella is the Boss or its Right Hand of a Dubious Group, thats possibly lead by Tom Riddle. Whoever the Boss is, s/he wants to hire a Talented Person, because the need this Talent for a Coup. Maybe that Person has done a couple of "not quite legal" Jobs, so the risk of him talking is low. Bella is send to "convince" him to work for them. I will leave it to the Fic how far they go during the "job interview" or in total through the Quest, but as the title suggest, i would think of a Bella that surely tempts him....possibly even blue balling him, by keep him at bay before it gets any serious (because she has fun in teasing him, but she belongs to her Boss/Lover). But if she is in fact the Leader of this Group, the affection to a potential Boss is not important anymore.

Who the hired Person is, is not important. It can be Harry or Ron or even be an OC. I wouldnt be rejected by a Female one.


** Wouldn't that be under Prompt flair? Also sounds interesting.

*** Well that depends. Maybe he's asking for a fic like that which could fall under the "request" flair
