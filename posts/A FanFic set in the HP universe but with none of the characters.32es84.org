Hi guys, So I am completely new to Fanfic and I have just completed my first one. It takes place in the HP universe but I don't actual write using any characters from the book. Is this a common practice or do people generally tend to write from the perspectives of Harry, Hermione, Draco etc? The reason I ask, is that I sort of set up a trilogy but if its not "Fanfic friendly" so to speak, I'd rather scrap the project and start on something new.

Thanks, K.E.

also, always looking for feedback! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11180696/1/The-Falling-Stars]]


** It's vastly more common to use canon characters, but not unknown to have an all original cast. The Alexandra Quick series is quite popular and it's all original characters.

*** Yeah, it's popular, but it's not exactly the same setting. It's in America, with a completely different school. Even the magic works differently.

**** It's still set in the HP universe, and fits into it better than a lot of fics set in Britain with canon characters.

** It is not unheard off, but still very borderline acceptable for many people.

I mean, think about it: People who like Harry Potter want to read more about Harry Potter and his friends. Not about your OCs.

The story better be really really good and have great character development of its own in that case since you are essentially just writing an original story at that point.

** I like it when they use all new characters. It's hard to find authors that can write JKR's cast in character, so making up your own can avoid that. Of course, you may run into difficulties keeping your characters believable and not Mary Sues.

** für das größere wohl is one of the best fics I've read for Harry Potter, and the only canon characters in it is Karkaroff and Grindelwald, and they doesn't even play that big of a role.

As others have said, Alexandra Quick is also OC only, and thats also a great read. So while uncommon, it can be done very well.

** It has been done but has to be exceptional to take off.

Alexandra Quick I think fills this requirement...

Otherwise Second Chance at Life basically becomes an original fic after Harry changes his name.

If you are going to write something that original... I'd change a few place names and spell names and write an original fic to sell instead...

** Ended up skipping through almost all of it. The writing is ok-ish but I personally wouldn't call it a good story but I'm sure some others would
