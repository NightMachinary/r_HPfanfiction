*THE FIRST TASK*

/A large crowd makes their way away from the stadium that has been set up for the first triwizard task, all of them talking excitedly with one another. The four champions are being treated by the har- by Madam Pomfrey in the healers tent./

RANDOM BRITISH KID 1: Wow! Dragons, that was brilliant!

RANDOM BRITISH KID 2: Yeah, and Potter on that broom... Amazing!

RANDOM BULGARIAN KID 1: Vat I don't vunderstand is vhy Viktor did not think to fly.

RANDOM FRENCH KID 1: Vell, eet ees obvious, non? 'e may be intelligent dans le ciel, but eet ees obvious zat 'e ees not compétent in zhe head.

RANDOM IRISH KID 1: Yes well, Diggory din't haf much goin' for 'im, did he?

RANDOM BRITISH KID 2: Forget Diggory! Potter is the one to look out for now.

​

*THE SECOND TASK*

/Four students are crowded in Albus Dumbledore's office each of them facing their respective headmasters and headmistress. The old wizard with the beard as long as a first year sits calmly behind his desk./

DUMBLEDORE: You have been given the honor of participating in the triwizard tournament. For the second task you will be put at the bottom of the black lake in the middle of the freshwater merpeople's village. There, you will be tied down with chains and put into a deep sleep that can only be broken once your head breaks the water's surface and you reach air. Are there any questions?

GABRIELLE: /What?/

/THE NEXT DAY/

/Students are all making their way to the stands that are on the shores of the black lake. All the Beauxbatons' students faces match their robes./

RANDOM FRENCH KID 2: I 'onestly wonder why we are 'ere in zis 'orrible weather.

RANDOM RUSSIAN KID 1: Does not matter. Vhat do you think they are going to make the chempiony do?

RANDOM SCOTTISH KID 1: Well, yer just gon' have ta be patien' an' fine out wi' everyone else, aren' ya?

/Three of the champions are gathered on a dock. Each of them wearing traditional wizarding bathers. In other words, newly fashioned, waterproof long underwear. Then the youngest champion rushes up, rubbing his eyes and holding on to a piece of toast with his fist clenched shut./

BAGMAN: LET THE SECOND TASK BEGIN!

/Harry Potter gets pushed in the lake as he chokes. He flounders with his legs and arms flailing as everyone watches and slowly sinks into the water leaving only a few bubbled in his place. The other three have dived in gracefully into the cold waters that have ice slowly covering it. Madam Pomfrey stands to the side with eight white towels. The crowd waits for ten minutes./

RANDOM BRITISH KID 2: BOOO! Wankers!

LITTLE KID: Mummy, I'm cold! My tingly parts are hurting me!

MUMMY: Well, I'm sorry about that sweetheart, but there's nothing I can do about it until we get home. Maybe daddy can rub your tingly parts right now to warm them up.

RANDOM SCOTTISH KID 2: Tha's wrong, tha's wha' tha' is.

RANDOM BRITISH KID 3: My toes are starting to turn green and black!

AMERICAN KID: What am I doing here?

BEAUXBATONS DELEGATION: oom ever made zis task, are abzolutley stupide in zhere small 'ead.

/Disgruntled French and British noises./

RANDOM BRITISH KID 1: Look, I think I see something!

RANDOM IRISH KID 2: Tha's not somethin'. Tha's just the giant squid, that is.

/Groans fill the the stands. Less than five minutes later a retch and thud is heard, Dumbledore looks behind him./

DUMBLEDORE: Clean up on aisle six, please.

​

*THE THIRD TASK*

/The four champions are gathered into another tent as the crowd surges past them chatting idly with one another./

BAGMAN: Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen to the final TRIWIZARD TASK!

/There are cheers heard, and a band plays in full force./

BAGMAN: We have Harry Potter in first place with a total of 85 points!

/A large cheer goes up from the Hogwarts section of the Quidditch stands./

BAGMAN: Next we have Cedric Diggory who is also tied in first place with a total of 85 points!

/A large cheer goes up from the Hogwarts section of the Quidditch stands./

BAGMAN: Then we have Viktor Krum with a total of 80 points!

/A large cheer goes up from the Durmstrang section of the Quidditch stands along with the pounding of feet./

BAGMAN: And running up we have Fleur Delacour with a total of 60 points!

/A limp cheer comes from the Beauxbatons section./

BAGMAN: Each of our contenders will enter the maze according to their point total, so Potter and Diggory! GO!

/The crowd screams and yells and even when Fleur finally disappears into the maze they continue./

LITTLE KID: Daddy I can't see!

DADDY: Well I can't see either little peanut!

/Slowly the cheers die down until there just hoarse shouts that remain. And one by one everyone sits back down./

HOGWARTS DELEGATION: BOOOOO!

BEAUXBATONS DELEGATION: BOO!

DURMSTRANG DELEGATION: THIS ZUCKS!

/A few teachers nod in agreement and Albus Dumbledore hitches up his robes and turns to Olympe Maxime./

DUMBLEDORE: My dearest, Olympe, if you don't mind could you lather up my anti wrinkles cream? I'm having a hard time getting behind my knees and now seems as good a time as any.

MADAME MAXIME: /In appalment and shock/ I abzolutley will not Dumbleydore!

DUMBLEDORE: Ah, alas. Minerva will you-

/TWO HOURS LATER/

RANDOM BULGARIAN KID 2: Vait everyone!

/A sleeping crowd wakes suddenly/

RANDOM BULGARIAN KID 2: I think I see someving coming. Maybe ve should all cheer to show support to the pechelivsh shampion.

RANDOM BRITISH KID 3: I finally get a line! So yeah, let's do what he said!

RANDOM FRENCH KID 1: WHOOO! Nous applaudissons parce que c'est enfin fini!

/The Beauxbatons delegation turns to look at the cheering girl and grin at each other./

BEAUXBATONS DELEGATION: WHOOO! HOURRA!

/The band slowly starts again, but with a flash of green light and a pop two figures appear. One is a sobbing, bloodied, and twitching Harry Potter, and the other is the corpse of Cedric Diggory./

RANDOM SCOTTISH KID 2: I was only lying before. This whas messed up the mos'.

*This is just my take on the audience's point of view during the Triwizard tasks. I am not trying to be funny at all and cannot be humorous to save my life, I am simply highly intoxicated. Prompt is probably not a good thing to put this under as it is NOT a prompt at all.*


** But what if the audience had some other form of entertainment... maybe a Quidditch game?
