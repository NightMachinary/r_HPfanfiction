*Title:* Awakening ([[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/637005818780188683/763119044206395413/c2.png][Cover Art]])

*Summary:* After his name came out of the Goblet of Fire, Harry woke to a disturbing reality. The wizarding world only saw him as an expendable pawn, his carefree attitude towards studying left him struggling to survive, and he had never truly appreciated the one, constant companion at his side---Hermione Granger. It was high time for change. Gradual Grey!HHr. Fully illustrated by Arishatistic.

*What to expect:* Gradual, but realistic character growth, Harry finding himself a family and a home, some elements of violence and PTSD in the second half, no bashing.

I have to thank [[/u/arishatistic][u/arishatistic]] for bringing this fic to life in a way I could never have done alone, with her amazing illustrations (which, if you're reading on FFN, you can find on [[https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/awakeninghhr/?hl=en][instagram]] or [[https://arishatistic.tumblr.com/tagged/awakeninghhr][tumblr]]).

** I'm happy that I was able to contribute to this fic, it was a challenge that really tested my creativity and got me back into doing fandom art. It was a fun ride and I'm sad to see it end, but I think we both needed a break üò≠. Fingers crossed for a sequel one day in the future.

**** I find that in a lot of the stories I read lately there's a clear victor in the argument, one is right and the total victim and the other apologizes, and I enjoyed one where you can see the position clearly from both sides while still finding a resolution. Congratulations on an amazing story! üòä

  "One good piece of advice I've read is during an argument with someone you care about, don't think about it as you versus them; rather, think of it as the two of you against the issue."
#+end_quote

One of my reviewers left that on the argument chapter and I think it's similar to what you're trying to say. It was never about one of them being right and the other wrong; sometimes it's less about winning or losing and more about reaching an understanding.

I'm glad that you enjoyed it. And thanks. ‚ù§Ô∏è
