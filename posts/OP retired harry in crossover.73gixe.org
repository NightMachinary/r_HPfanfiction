What I'm looking for is a middle-aged OP Harry Potter who plays the badass grandpa trope.Harry Potter who retired, overpowered and filthy rich as fuck who plays around, trolling the young crossover main characters.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous) is exactly like that. An old and grizzled and very paranoid auror Potter gets sent to middle earth. As an elfling. He is not pleased

*** I will never rest until I read Harry/Galadriel interaction in that fic.

I can just see Harry telling the Lady that he is gravelly ill and the only chance of a cure is to nurse from her.

Or asking her to prove she's a natural blonde.

*** Olddd ish. Not really that Old. But OP did prompt "grandpa" and "middle-aged".

That being said, I friggin' love that fanfic. I want more. I want him in other universes too.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

** linkffn(7648998) is pretty much the opposite, but still kinda fits? A 200 or so year old Naruto pulls some shenanigans and becomes baby Harry the night Voldemort attacked. He then spends the rest of the book pulling stupid pranks on people like tying Snape's shoes together.

  An old and dying Naruto throws his soul forward through time in order to prevent the Juubi's escape upon his death. His soul merges with that of 15 month old Harry Potter in the moment the Killing Curse is reflected. Super!Harry.
