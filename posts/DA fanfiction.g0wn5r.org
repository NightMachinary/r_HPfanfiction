Any fanfics where harry trains the DA as his own personal army (or any sort of army) against both Dumbledore and voldemort.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18710152][Relentless We Survive]] is technically a xover with assassins creed but u don't need much AC knowledge. It's also one of the best dumbledore's armies ever.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346][D.S.S. Requirement]] is the most armylike army I know of (they even have ranks)

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but I know there's more... maybe I'll be back
