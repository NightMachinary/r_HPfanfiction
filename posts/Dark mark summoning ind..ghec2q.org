I've read lots of fics where Voldemort uses the dark mark to summon an individual, in most of them he uses it to torture a traitor. Perhaps my head is too fuzzy at the moment, but I can't find any canon evidence of this. The DEs use it to summon him and he uses it to summon a group is all I'm finding. Am I overlooking something?

Edit: secondary question along similar lines. Fic I'm currently reading: Voldemort marks Sirius (mental, physical, and emotional torture) against his will. Now, it's only fannon that only people willing to be marked can be marked, correct?


** It's pretty much just become fannon. There is no evidence of it and I think it would take a lot of extra magic.
