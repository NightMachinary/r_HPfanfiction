I think Sebastian Moran kills the Dursleys antics Harry with him. Moriarty and Moran are in a relationship of some kind. It's kid of funny, when harry gets injuries during a quidditch game Moriarty scares Dumbledore and is very protective of harry. Harry is a normal 11-year-old, Just a little bit more accepting p of murder. James Moriarty realizes he's a wizard some point

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
