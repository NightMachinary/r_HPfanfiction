In many time travel fics, the MC changes the outcome of a horrible tragedy and all is well. However, what are some well-written fics that explore the 'butterfly effect', where averting one (relatively minor) tragedy results in another? E.g. Harry saves Sirius' life at the Ministry ---> Remus dies instead.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/1/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] is a good example of a "butterfly effect" sort of unintended change.

Harry gets trapped in the year that Riddle would have opened the Chamber of Secrets, but this isn't one of those "Harry turns Tom good through the power of friendship/love" fics. A single sentence causes everything to go wrong on a scale that Harry would never have anticipated.

** There's "Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass", which has Tonks thrown back in time during the Ministry battle. It is well written and perfectly fits your requirements. Things get better, but nowhere near perfect.

*** Don't bother to get invested in these. The third book (at that point, you are a million words in), is an utter train wreck (the whole Ron/Hermione set-up and the way their romantic relationship begins is really, really awful) before it gets abandoned.

Edit: Let's put it this way. You start to read this series and it definitely has it's moments. It touches on several matters which are odd like time travellers putting a date on when they resume their physical relationship and not just when they feel ready. Yet it is an overall enjoyable experience and IIRC, the Third year had some interesting consequences.

BUT

You will have to invest a lot of time for this series. It's 1000k words. And in the end, you see a really shitty build-up for the Ron/Hermione relationship, which then begins when Hermione is in a really bad place emotionally. And then the story is simply abandoned. It dug itself in a hole and there is no simple way out. The author is infamous in that regard, most of his stories end that way. And while in some cases that leaves you just slightly annoyed, in this series it really ruins the whole thing because there are too many questions left unanswered and holes left which cannot be stuffed by simply looking at the canon works.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** If you're ok with slash, old and abandoned fic, you have Aorist Subjunctive, where Harry travels back in time to save Cedric, but then... The consequences are pretty much explained in the first few chapters (or the entire first book? I don't remember). After that, it can be consider 5th year AU, tbh.
