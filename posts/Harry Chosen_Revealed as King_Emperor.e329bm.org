:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm searching both for a specific fic, and/or fics in the same general theme.

In general, I'm looking for fics (not including Avalon Seven, which I'm just about to start) where Harry unexpectedly becomes king, emperor, or some other ultra-high muckety-muck, because he is discovered to be the long-lost heir, is chosen by magic, comes across the sword in the stone, or whatever.

What I remember from the one I was specifically looking for: Harry has a twin who is/is believed to be TBTL, and Harry is mostly ignored or seen as unimportant. James and Lily are alive, and Sirius was not imprisoned. IIRC the 'choosing' is that at a certain age everyone would step into a circle(?) (or platform or something?) and wait to see if they were chosen (by Magic?). This Harry was a little-regarded younger brother of The Boy Who Lived, who everyone thought might be the one chosen; when Harry was tested next, no one even paid attention, since his brother was the big draw - Harry's attempt was just a formality since everyone was expected to do it. I also remember that James asked Harry to abdicate in favor of his brother, who was (in James' opinion) obviously much better suited.

My apologies if I've posted this request before; I would have sworn I had months ago, but I searched and could not find a post, so either I asked elsewhere or I failed at my search.

ETA: And yes, I did look in other 'emperor/king/royalty' posts before I posted this I but did not see the one I was looking for (or failed to recognize it). I do have links to Emperor, Expelled, Quoth the Raven, Avalon in Arms, Harry Potter and The Iron Lady, Long Live the Queen, A Royal at Hogwarts, Bound in Servitude, and Royal.
