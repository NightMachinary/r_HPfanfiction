I mean, my favourite pairing is Harry/Gabrielle or Fleur, and it seems like everyone recommends to read Vitam Paramus, but I have read 6 chapters and I can't force myself to read further, it's just so boring. Maybe there is a twist somewhere?

Why the hell do people like it?

It seems like they just drink and chat meaninglessly, no events after the death of Weasleys and Delacours in chapter 1.

Just write why do you like it if you do, I need to decide either I want to carry on or not and you can help me with that.


** I've read this recently and really liked it. It's a fix that I can't really compare to anything else. It's a character driven fic that does not rely on romance, that alone is already pretty rare.

The Quidditch stuff did not interest me that much to be honest. The character of Gabrielle and the stuff she works through is incredible though. I don't want to provide spoilers but halfway through the story my whole outlook on the story (particularly Gabrielle) massively changed.

*** Quidditch there is boring for me because I'm not from the USA and it's based on the american system with drafts and all this stuff, so I don't understand a thing. Well, probably I should try to read more and it might become more interesting. Thanks for your answer

** It's a story about a couple of people just living their lives. If you think those people are boring then it's gonna be a boring story. I liked it well enough, but I've kind of got a thing for reading about broken people.

** Decent character building. TE7 has decent fics so people are partial to him/her as an author. Hard to find a fic with Gabrielle that isn't super weird so I guess it could be a « best of that ship » kind of like for it as well.

** The story is the definition of boring. There really is no pairing payoff either, other than what the author added like 3 years after the original completion. Boring quidditch stuff, anorexia plot line that leads to actual nowhere, even the casual sex with Daphne is boring.

But, I like it. It's simplistic, and sometimes that's all I desire. I dislike when an author jumps through a million hoops to try and make a convoluted plot point work. There's no need to do any of that when there are no plot points. Honestly, the biggest issue I have is the issue of scale. How does a tiny magical population field hundreds of quidditch players, and have an economy that can support players getting paid millions. And, I dislike Titus, but if you're reading one of the author's stories, that's something you have to accept before you even start. Otherwise, it's a decent character exploration story.

** VP is one of my favourite stories. In fact it's difficult to think of a completed story that I prefer to it. It's one I keep going back to - just to read a chapter or two to recapture the freshness.

The characters are brilliant. Harry and Gabrielle are the focus and their recovery from a horrific bereavement is written tenderly and realistically. At the start it's all about Harry acting strong to help Ellie, then she's able to help him when the veneer comes off. The moment they share the things they'll miss most is one of the most beautiful moments in fanfic.

The backup cast is good too. Titus is funny and a damn good friend for Harry. Daphne is ascerbic; Lunfrey is a pompous twit at first but comes round; Coach Barker is hilarious in his dismissal of Malfoy. Dammit, even Mathieu the irritating French boyfriend is written well.

I'll agree with the OP about the American-ness of the Quidditch background but it doesn't hurt the story at all. The flashbacks to things like Harry's first championship are great too - I love the way Finbar is just sitting drinking at the bar with all the carnage around him, for instance.

I don't agree there's a lack of magic. It's not emphasised but that's half the point. Everyone in the story is perfectly familiar with magic so they're not going to be walking around, wide-eyed at examples of it any more. Rather, the way it gets used casually as part of everyday life brings home that the story is about magical people living in a magical world. The only time there's ever much of a deal made about it is when Titus and Harry build Ellie's dance studio, and that's more for comic effect than anything else.

Likewise, the story is sometimes criticised for Harry's drinking but the only time he gets genuinely smashed is before that flashback about winning the title. After that it's a drink here and a drink there. Hardly an alcohol problem.

And ultimately, it's a happy story. The Portkey accident is a horrible thing to happen. Gabrielle is initially presented as being on the point of throwing herself off a balcony but she ends the story giggling with her school friends. Harry starts the story in shock and ends it realising that he misses Gabrielle more than anyone else. The epilogues make the happy ending more explicit but they're icing on the cake more than actual cakey goodness.

So that's why I like it. It's not a typical HP story, that's for sure, but for me it stands out all the more because of that.

** It is a character-focused story. There is no action-filled plot with explosions and underground street racing. It shows characters coping with loss and moving on in life, it shows their past and present. It has elements of life as a professional athlete. You have to decide on your own if you like such stories or not.

Personally, I'd say it is a story I enjoyed reading once but unlike, for example, "Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass" or "A little Child shall lead them", it is not something I feel like rereading once in a while. The whole ballet arc just feels too out of place IMO. And the whole "I wait until she is of-age" part towards the end was a little odd since, as Gabrielle points out in-story, it will not magically alter her.

** I'm the same, it just seems like an incredibly generic sports story with names changed to be in the HP world. There's really very little magic involved at all from what I got up to.

*** The ballet part felt really out of place. Like, this is a story about magic, Gabrielle is a magical creature (at least partially), and the best you could come up was cliché number one for girls who are not into horses?

** I like the pairing too so I charged through a decent amount of this story a while ago, but for a character based story, I didn't really like the characters, Harry most of all. The thing that eventually made me switch off the fic was Harry's aggressive flirtations towards Gabby despite her expressions of discomfort and the fact she had a boyfriend. I know they're the pairing and it's supposed to be about her loosening up or whatever, But she's a teenage orphan who's living in his house and can't comfortably say 'no' without the risk of having nowhere to go. He doesn't seem to take into account or care how dependent she is on his good will.

From what I remember, Harry was cool for a good portion of the story, then seemed to take a left turn into what I'd call creep mode.

*** From your comment it seems to be kind of similar to Hope, only difference is that here Gabrelle is dependent on Harry because she has nowhere to go instead of that bonding stuff. It's funny that people dislike Hope and like VP.

It's really not. When you look at Hope - and you don't have to go far below the surface - it's a terrifying story of slavery. Gabrielle has to do anything and everything that Harry wants.

VP is the opposite. One theme of the story is Ellie escaping her past and becoming free. She ends the story as a confident young woman able to deal with life on her own.
