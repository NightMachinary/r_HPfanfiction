I'm a huge fan of love and I've read stories for quite a few different pairings. Some of my favorites don't have the arranged marriage BS and I was wondering if you kind folks might have any decent recommendations. I'd prefer there wasn't any slash, romance between an adult and a child, or scenes of a sexual nature between children.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

** Me being me, I try to recommend Meaning of One by Sovran. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

Now... it's a Harry and Ginny Soul Bond starting in Philosopher's Stone, but HEAR ME OUT!

The Soul Bond in NO WAY forces the two together romantically, and even though they're kids, they aren't anywhere near doing the nasty. In fact, the story takes on those sorts of subjects realistically yet with profound maturity, never sexually or fetishistically.

The banter between Harry and Ginny alone is worth it.

It might not be exactly what you're looking for, and the romance is not the main focus... yet, (it's only finished PS and CoS) but give it a shot.

** linkffn(13381951) - Self-promoting. This is a Hermione/Cedric one-shot I wrote a while back. Not sure what you mean exactly by 'natural romance', but I don't think the HG/CD relationship in my fic is forced and it definitely has none of the red flags you've listed above. If happy endings are a requirement for this request, though, probably stay away.

  Cedric reaches up and sweeps a lock of her hair behind her ear, brushing her cheek with his thumb as he does so. He slowly pushes himself up into a sitting position, and Hermione finds herself breathless by the intensity in his gaze. He looks nervous, she realises, fidgeting with his cuff. He cups her face with one hand and she leans into his touch. "Can I kiss you?" he asks.

#+begin_quote
  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.
