  Harry and his snake's first summer away from the Dursleys and second year at Hogwarts. Featuring an awkward summer, an even more useless Defense professor than the one that had spent a year trying to murder him, a voice in the walls, a slew of petrified children, and a mysterious diary that seems oddly compelling.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

#+begin_quote
  "Slytherin would do well, help you on the path to greatness," the hat seems to be coaxing him, but for something that can read his mind, it sure doesn't seem to know him very well. Harry doesn't want greatness. He doesn't need his name in lights and on everyone's lips. He wants meals, hot ones, whenever he wants, with people that he likes and that like him. Friends he can have adventures with, huddle under the blankets with at night and laugh with. People who might think... think he's worth something.  In which Harry is sorted into Slytherin, and Snape deals with the fallout.
