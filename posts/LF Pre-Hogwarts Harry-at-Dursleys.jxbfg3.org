I've seen loads of pre-hogwarts fics where Harry is raised by Sirius, Remus or someone else, but are there any fics that focus specifically on Harry's life at the Dursleys?

Some canon-divergent fics (like /'Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff/Slytherin'/) do briefly touch upon it, but i'm looking for ones that focus specifically on that period of his life.

â€‹

The only fic I've seen this do this really wellis [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1136716/chapters/2298467][Hello Journal]]-

#+begin_quote
  Hello journal. Today we have a prompt. Our prompt is our favrit family tradition. I do not have a favrit family tradition because I do not have a family. Signed, Harry Potter.

  Harry Potter's third form journal. A peek at pre-Hogwarts life.
#+end_quote

It basically details Harry's life at the Dursleys in the form of entries of his third-form journal- the way Harry's writing improves over time is pretty realistic and he actually sounds like an 8 year old. It also provides a bit of an Outsider POV in the form of Harry's teacher who reads these entries.

(It's not complete, but it ends at a note that feels pretty conclusive.)

P.S: I've already read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12351608/1/Two-Things][Two Things]].

Thank you in advance, hopefully.


** I'm always going to recommend linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5121464/chapters/11782190]]) and the rest of the Perfectly Normal series

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right?

** I absolutely adored Hello Journal as well. Grey Space, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344/chapters/28275021]]) is an au where hogwarts start at 14 and the fic is about Harry from 11-14. Most characters are oc's because of the different setting but they're written wonderfully so even if you don't typically like ocs I'd recommend checking it out

*** I remember reading this!

I'd forgotten the name of it, though, and had been looking for it a while back.

Thank you!

  Dan was 10 when he realized that the way he looked at his friend wasn't normal. And people had started to notice.He refused to tell his mother why he was sent to the nurse's office with a bloody nose.He tried not to tell Phil either, but his friend was excellent at coaxing things out of him.
