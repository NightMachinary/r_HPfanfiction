It started when Harry left his dorm, nearly late for breakfast. He was passing by Snape when he thought he heard the man mumble, /insufferable brat. Just like his father./

Harry whirled around. "Dont say a word about my father!"

And a flicker of unreadable emotion crossed Snape's face. Harry would even venture to say he was....shocked?

The day just kept getting stranger from there.
