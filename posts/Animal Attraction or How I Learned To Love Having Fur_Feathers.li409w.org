She finally did it! She finally became an animagus after months of study, effort, careful potioning work, and keeping that disgusting mandrake leaf under her tongue!

...And she's a doe. A bloody deer.

She wanted to scream.

Still, at least that means she can go for "trips" in the Forbidden Forest or a night. Always fascinating stuff in there!

Two weeks later...

"You've got to be bloody kidding me. Potter's an animagus! Wait, he's a stag? A bloody stag! ... It might be worth getting to know him. ... He is sort-of cute, too. Hmm..."

--

I dunno where this came from, but it hit me after reading another recent thread on someone looking for more creature!Harry fics that aren't slash.

Basically, a lesser-used character, even a different incarnation of Daphne Greengrass, finally achieves the animagus transformation on their own... and she's a doe.

Then, by pure chance, she discovers that Harry did the same thing, but with a heck of a lot less work involved (thanks to having Sirius as a guide).

At first, she was angry. Then intrigued. After all, a doe and a stag animagus in the school, at the same time? Magic's gotta be telling her something.

...He is kinda cute, after all.

Another route? Lily goes doe. She discovers James is a stag. In this timeline, butterfly effects cause James to become more mature earlier on, causing Lily to return his interest sooner. Of course, this'd cause issues with his friends...

Marlene becoming a dog animagus and becoming "curious" about Sirius could be funny, too -- especially if it's unrequited.

Another possibility? The girl in question becomes a rook or raven or another corvid: so does Harry. She develops a slight interest/obsession with him after that.

Just fluffy, slice of life stuff as they hang out as animals... or birds. With a slight hint of curious obsession towards him.

Another possible idea:

Oliver, in his training fanaticism, tries to get the rest of the Quidditch team to become animagi as it may improve their senses, center of gravity, et cetera, thus their chances of winning/keeping the Cup: after all, animagi are so rare that there are no rules that prohibit them from playing Quidditch. At least Hogwarts Quidditch, anyway.

To everyone's surprise, Harry and Katie end up as the same type of animal --genders aside-- and naturally gravitate towards hanging around each other as a result. It may or may not be romantic but a sibling-like bond, too.

Of course, this saddens their other friends (Leanne, Ron and Hermione, et cetera) because they have another person taking up more and more of Harry's/Katie's time.

Other people notice their strange behavioral quirks: such as, if they're cats, liking fish a bit more or napping in trees, or if birds preferring to sit at a height, chasing chocolate frogs, et cetera.

Fluffy stuff, you know? I just find the idea amusing and cute.
