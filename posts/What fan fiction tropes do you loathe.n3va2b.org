What are the fan fiction tropes that you are just sick of. Maybe they are done to death, or lazy or just make no sense. What makes you want to stop a story whenever you read one?

For me it is the magical oaths: ‚Äúblah blah blah so mote it be‚Äù üôÑ


** Harems. Hate them. Instant drop. Doesn't matter which Fandom it is. The fic could be the best ever written, but as soon as a harem is started, it's over for me

*** I can read comedic harem's but not proper intentional ones. If the story is lighthearted I tend not to take the romance seriously, however the moment drama starts happening the harem goes out the window.

** Got to be honest, I read fan fiction because I love the tropey tropes.

I suppose one I do loathe is the angst porn prevalent in a huge chunk of fic, but I know that a lot of people obviously love it, so I just avoid it. It mostly bothers me when people sort of fetishise the troubles of certain minorities though. It's gross.

Also incest and grooming, lmao, but I don't know if that's a trope so much as something that pops up more regularly in fic than other places because fic isn't as highly moderated. I just remember my first foreys into fandom and realising how many people actually thought incest was sexy and being like ‚Äòwhat?! Just _why?!_'

*** Wow, where even have you be reading? I don't actually remember any popular incest pairings in the fandom, at least none that can be found easily. Grooming is probably more common, /Dodging Prison/ is pretty obvious about it and so are many of the so-called "Dark fics". Perhaps it's just me subconsciously developing an intuition for avoiding these over time..

**** Yeah I mean I don't read them, but explicit incest comes up a lot in Black family fics, and fics with the Weasleys as well. There is also an inexplicably large amount of fics that have Hermione being raped by her father.

The grooming ones are in a lot of Harry harem fics, and ones with Gabrielle Decalour, and that's on top of the male authors who comment about the bodies of eleven year old or younger kids in general. It's really pervasive

** I wouldn't say it always makes me stop reading, but god do I find the following annoying:

1) right of conquest.\\
God this whole concept is fucking broken beyond belief and NO author considered the consequences of introducing such a system, nor do they stay consistent with it.\\
Harry killed/defeated someone? he now owns everything they had.\\
But apparently, when Voldemort kills/defeats someone, he doesn't get the same benefit.\\
It is literally the biggest ass-pull and no author has done it right in my experience, because they are so horribly selective in who benefits from it, rather than making it an actual thing that applies to everyone.

2) 'for this ship to work, I have to bash 'insert character'.\\
By the lord, I hate this idea. Why can't writers just do something of quality and write an actual romance that grows over time, rather than just have one person be the enemy and then the shipped characters jump into each other's arms for comfort? Harry/Hermione and Draco/Hermione are ESPECIALLY guilty of this, by needing to bash Ron for it to work somehow.\\
It has come to the point where I actively avoid Harmony and Draco/Hermione because it 99 % of the time involves Ron-bashing.

3) Bashing-trope in general. Enough said about this. Anyone who writes bashing is a lazy writer that needs to get their priorities in check. Might be harsh, but I refuse to budge on this.

4) the whole 'Gringotts handles heritage/other stuff'-trope.\\
IT IS A BANK! THEY STORE MONEY AND THAT IS IT! This also comes with the dumb trope of 'remember goblin name and suddenly you get a million benefits'. like... one would think the writers of this trope never entered a bank in their life. You don't get benefits for being pleasant.

*** I totally agree on the Ron bashing. I largely avoid Harmony fics for this reason. It always seems to also be: Ron the sloth, Ron the moron or Ron the secretively manipulative fake friend. I'm not sure why (topic for another thread) but Ron bashing is almost a required trope in any non Ron/Hermione pairing.

** For me it is so boring when fanfictions have an uncontrolled bashing, it is laziness ... there is no character development.

"OMG, my friends are not really my friends, they are paid to be my friends" uhh no! Hermine and Ron were 11 years old when they met Harry; they can't have very bad plans for Harry and his wealth. even though Ron is jealous and Hermione may be a little unpleasant ... they are not big bad guys, they are just kids.

And teenage pregnancy, it's so common , it's clich√© and a little disturbing (I know it happens a lot in real life, but it's fanfiction), it's okay for me to have Mpreg, but at the right time. For me it is a little unbelievable when Harry's pregnancy is in the middle of a war or when he is 15 years or when it is not safe, especially when he becomes pregnant with Voldemort, L√∫cio or Severus ... they are extremely cautious men that they they wouldn't risk everything if it happened, they must think it can happen; And Harry, with whom he is suffering in Dursley, it's supposed his have a plan for a child, when he is ready, when he can offer a good life for the baby.

edt: an adult / teen relationship is already disturbing enough, this adult (in addition to being a criminal) completely irresponsible, I have seen many scenes of Harry asking for forgiveness for becoming pregnant at the age of 15

** Pairing Hermione or Harry with various random Death Eaters. Somehow I can make exceptions under certain conditions, usually for ones that changed sides in canon (like Malfoy or Snape years after the war), but don't be putting them with Rabastan Lestrange or Antonin Dolohov or Fenrir Greyback and whatnot.

Harems involving magical contracts or where they are still in school. I read an adult Harry fic where he essentially had a harem with both men and women who sought him out and married him, which was nice, but I usually hate harem fics because they have children thinking about or getting married and having babies.

Pregnancy/childbirth fics. I don't find pregnancy or childbirth appealing at all, so I don't want either taking up much room in a story. And most of the time the stories that have this involve teenagers, which is just plain disturbing.

Divorce and child custody or childrearing stories. I get that these are issues that happen in daily life, but I see zero appeal to this. I need something more to a story.

** It feels like this question pop up almost every week. But anyways here's my list:

1. Harem\\
   I don't care of the justification, whenever Harry is a Lord needing one wife for each of his Houses (which is retarded but let's ignore it), or if he just "deserves sum luve". Outside of obvious crack fics, if Harry has several Love interest/ Girlfriends/ Wife, I drop it.\\
   The Magical World (or at least Magical Britain/ Europe) is clearly not build with Harem in mind, and I really hate how only the MC get to have a harem (is that a cultural thing or not?). These stories tend to completely ignore the plot in order to always focus on Harry's next target. The (female) character usually lose all personality once they join the Harem (of course Hermione would be totally ok with Harry going out with several girls outside of her, several of them who may or may not have previously bullied her for her appearance or blood status). In some extreme case, I can also easily see a future demographic problem when a good third of the girls in a specific age group are all going out with the same man (may be hard to avoid incest one or two generations down the road).
2. Lordship\\
   I dislike Lordship in general. I think the trope has the potential to be interesting, but pretty much all the ones I have tried end up with Harry owning the Winzengamot at 13 and every children acting like political dragons.\\
   Most of these fics also has some elitism undertone with Harry leaving his current, poor friends for new, better "rich" one. I am one of these people that believe that Draco Malfoy is a little shit and no ammount of Galleons would change that, so it tends to annoy me when he becomes the new Ron.
3. Pedophilia\\
   No matter the story, a 15/16 years old should never be in a relation with an adult, unless the story treats the subject as it should (usually with the adult in jail and the child in counselling to make sure he was not groomed).\\
   And that's without even mentioning the fact that a lot of Teen/Adult stories also usually have pretty problematic ship. If I take the Bellatrix/ Hermione ship (which is strangely popular), age is only one of the issues of this ship and not even the worse one. Same thing with Harry / Death Eater or worse, Harry/ Voldemort. I know that Harry/ Tom has a lot of potential to make thing interesting, but please make the 2 of them at least somewhat equal in term of mentality (time travel, reincarnation or whatever), and not the 50/60 years old dude that is fascinated by a teen.

*** I hate big age gaps for relationships in general, and teen characters with adult characters is a no go for me. I like Tomarry, but mostly it's when they are the same age or very close in age somehow. In the least, if they aren't, they are both definitely adults in the fics I like.

** I really dont like Lord Potter or Lord anyone really I dont mind like a story about wizard politics in general but i like it when it can be compelling have character growth and isnt just set up after set up to make the mc look smart and competent

i also hate that supporting cast has often very little effect on the plot and that its usually with teens and preteens who act like adults instead of making it with adults.

I think for example Sirius being a lord would be way more interesting because he hates this kind or snooty culture and would struggle to find a way to find a balance between being able to be expressive and individualistic in his own way and playing politics smartly to help people he cares about. Its not going to come easy to him its going to be compelling and its not just plot devices to make him look smart.

But even when I see a Lord Sirius Black in a story that's not how its depicted ( and its not focused on him anyway)

I see this alot in smart or independent or dark insert character here stories even if it's not about them being a lord and i hate it there too but I think it's more common in the lord stories.

** This is really specific but I hate the word 'domestic'. When the mc sees their love interest cook them a meal and they think "It was just so domestic". It is good writing to contrast the tense moments and the happy moments, but it should stay in subtext. Or give me a paragraph about feeling warm, enjoying the company, and not worrying. That way I can feel the feeling with the character. 'domestic' is too abstract a word to carry meaning. Like if the MC said they "felt the love", what does that mean.
