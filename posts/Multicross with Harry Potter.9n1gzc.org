A Multicross is generally in the form of 'Character X has the ability to jump between dimensions and visits realities A, B, and C'. These can be quite fun because we get a developed character interacting with a lot of different environments.

They are different from a simple crossover story because generally a crossover will take a character from world A and put them in world B, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/1/Effloresco-Secundus][Effloresco Secundu]]s being an excellent example of this with Hermione going to Narutoverse, or where parts of world A are blended into world B, like Hogwarts being the premiere ninja academy of Britain (which actually sounds like a pretty sweet idea come to think of it).

A Multicross is not about blending multiple worlds together, or even really any blending at all. Imagine that Harry decides 'fuck this shit I'm out' during 6th year and starts burrowing from world to world, visiting Star Wars, Bleach, X-Files, etc. That would be a multicross.

Anybody know some where the character originates from or simply passes through the HP universe? I know of a good few crossovers of one sort or another but no multicross fics... Closest I know of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] where Harry visits Star Wars and then Star Gate, but that's kind of few worlds.


** DianeCastle likes writing multi-crossovers, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]] involves heroes from 6 universes to take down a major demon boss. [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], often recommended on this sub, is its prequel and plays out in the universe where Alex Mack came from.

** The Harry Potter Lone Traveller series is pretty much many one-shots of Harry going around fixing issues. Some of the one shots are developed into their own fics. There's a bunch of them. This is the author's page [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2198557/dunuelos]]

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

  The sequel to ItMoaS. Mad scientist Harry Potter, now twenty years old, is sent to the SGC to half-join SG-1, accompanying them on missions. However, this job, which was just supposed to be providing Harry with research and allow him to expand on his knowledge, will have him make grand discoveries about himself and that of the entire magical race.

  It's the year 2185CE. Commander Jane Shepard is recruiting members to bring with her on a mission against the Collectors and the Reapers. Among the candidates is Dr. Harry Potter, the reclusive mad scientist who has been missing for twenty years. Who knows what he was doing during that time? Rated M to be sure.
