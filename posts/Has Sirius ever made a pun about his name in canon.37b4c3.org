This seems to be one of the few constants in almost every fanfic (har har, Sirius sounds like serious) but I don't remember it ever happening in the books.


** I seem to recall he punned his last name... Kreacher said something about serving the House of Black, and Sirius said it was getting blacker (referring to Kreacher not cleaning anything). At least i hope I'm remembering that right.

*** Yip, here's the quote:

"Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black~".

"~and it's getting blacker every day, it's filthy," said Sirius.

But I think the OP is looking for the Sirius-serious one only.

**** To me that's solid evidence. If he's willing to pun any part of his name I'm positive he's done his first name, even if we don't get to see it in the books.

***** See part of me feel like he would use his first name as a pun, and part of me feels like he would find it incredibly trite and overdone.

****** Yeah, because he did it a million times when he was young before he felt that way. But if he has no objection to punning his last name which is also a commonly used word that he's probably had a million chances to pun in the past, I can't imagine why he'd find punning his first name more objectionable.

******* Like I said I'm divided. Honestly, I could see him getting really sick of hearing that joke.

Though I can see James Sirius Potter being asked "Are you serious?" and responding with "Definitely. Sirius is my middle name."

** It happens in the 800 word prequel that JKR did for charity several years ago. The one with him and James running from the police on the motorbike. The policeman makes the pun, I believe.

*** I feel like that has to be a common mistake when people (especially non-purebloods) meet Sirius.

"I'm Sirius."

"Serious about what?"

"No, like the star."

  “Oh, OUR names, did you mean?” asked the first, as Anderson spluttered with rage. “You should've said! This here is James Potter, and I'm Sirius Black!”

***** You mean the Death Eaters? I don't think they care if they break the statute of secrecy, to be honest.

Unless you mean James/Sirius for cursing them.

Though the law does allow for magic to be performed in front of muggles in life-threatening situations.

****** Yep, I meant James & Sirius for lifting up the police car and then flying off on a motorcycle with nary an obliviate in sight

******* Not sure, to be honest. There is a provision for using magic in front of muggles in life threatening situations, which I feel like excuses lifting up the police car. I don't think the motorcycle would qualify, but at that point the policemen already seen the Death Eaters fly in on broomsticks. So the cat's already out of the bag.

However, the magical world does not seem to view witnessing evidence of magical activity/objects as harshly as it does performing actual magic in front of or on a muggle.

I'm also not positive that the expectation is that the perpetrator will be the one to perform the obliviate. The Ministry does seem to have a way to detect magic performed around muggles, and they have trained Oblivators. I doubt everyone knows how to perform the obliviate, and you could do quite a lot of damage if you do it wrong.

So obliviating at the scene might be common for wizards, but I'm not sure its Ministry-recommended.
