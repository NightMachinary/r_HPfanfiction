I was doing some writing today and remembered a fic called 'Socks' and thus fell into a strange world of Dumbledore, Socks, and the Mirror of Erised. I felt compelled to share them with you.

Erised Stra Ehru Oy by greisful [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7003489]] Very, very short story about the Dumbledores.

I want the world by angeleledhwen (kallistei) and eledhwen (kallistei) [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1764847]] Incredibly short but rather interesting story. VERY SHORT (like, two paragraphs long)

Socks by SavioBriion [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/378503]] Although short, a very poignant story about pre-Gellert Albus that feels like it could be canon.

Socks by anotherbuskitten [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3307103]] A story about Abe and Albus over time, it's better than it perhaps sounds.

The Desire for Socks by CorgiFromSpace [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/195391]] It feels like an extract from canon from Dumbledore's point of view.

Reflection by DaughterofElros [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327531]] Bittersweet Albus/Gellert

A Lionhearted Boy by FreezingRayne [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/261693]] A crowd pleaser (has the most kudos) about Albus/Gellert and the lasting effects of love.

Blot out the Stars by tuesday [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/62510]] My second favourite, Blot out the Stars is about Albus, Gellert, Flamel, Abe, but most importantly: knitting therapy.

Socks by Ronile [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4316799]] My favourite of the stories. It... it's stuck with me.

What do you think of my strange collection?
