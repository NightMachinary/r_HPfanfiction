Silly idea while I was working that I decided to post here since I don't have anyone to discuss them with at the moment:

What if after years and generations of resentment, a Voldemort-like figure rises among the Squibs and his aim is to overthrow the Ministry of Magic so that the squibs could finally "get what is rightfully theirs?"

I don't know what that is, exactly, but then again, the motivations of villains can be very muddled up due to insanity.

Maybe this Volde-squib was supposed to be the heir of an old, prominent family but was blasted off their tree. Maybe because his parents didn't know anything about the Muggles, he was stuck in the Wizarding world with Kwikspell, which isn't helpful at all and is just a scam. Maybe he later on got into the Muggle world and somehow became a success there. He then tried to liaise with the Ministry of Magic to create a bridging program for squibs to get to the Muggle world. Somehow, everything falls apart and this gives rise to his ideas for a revolution.

It's all rather silly and I can't think of the logic and logistics of this beyond what I've written. Some other questions I had were: what even is a Squib? Is there some sort of ranking for example those who can't do magic at all up to those who can make potions but can't do wand work?

I don't know if stuff like these has been answered on Pottermore since my knowledge comes from the books. And in the books, the Squibs I remember are Filch, Mrs. Figg and to some extent Merope.


** Squibs do not have magic, though magic recognizes them as different from muggles by virtue of being born from wizarding parents. JKR has confirmed this. Squibs cannot make potions.

There's no way a squib rebellion would work. There are too few of them are they are too limited by their lack of magical abilities.

** Merope is said to be almost a squib, not because she is, but because she struggled immensely with wand magic due to coming from an abusive home and never receiving a formal education. Witches and wizards can also just not be good at wand based magics while still being not squibs. After all, there's more to magic than waving your wand and saying funny words.

Also, a squib revolution can't and won't ever exist because it will never work. They'll simply be either arrested and put into Azkaban or obliviated about magic. Unlike Muggle-borns, they can't defend themselves from magic, and they even are rarer than them who are already a minority.

** It is quite absurd. I don't have the talent to write a comedy, which is the only genre where this thing could be written
