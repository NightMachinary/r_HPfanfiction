** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936][Gryffindor tie(s)]] doesn't have the Dursleys kill him directly, but they do leave him locked in Dudley's second bedroom and leave on a vacation after the Dobby-smashes-the-cake incident, and Harry... dies alone in that room. I feel a bit off-kilter every time I read it. A what if scenario supposing that the Weasleys never rescue Harry in a flying car. It's a series with small vignettes in different POV's.

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

  They never thought he would live after they killed him. They never thought ghosts were real, but Harry has never let that stop him from haunting them. Please Review! Warning: Abused!Harry Beware of unhappy ending
