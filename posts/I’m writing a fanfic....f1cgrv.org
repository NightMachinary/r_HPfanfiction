** Most readers of longer fanfics have a 'mininum length' that a story has to have reached before they can be bothered to follow it. Also depends on how often you update it. Did it take you 2 years of slow updates to get there? Then no thanks when its not even a quarter done.

I personally used to have a minimum of 60k vefore i started reading longer fics, with min. 2k words per chapter. Now i check 40k words fics because i feel like i have read everything else, so checking "newly updated" 40k every few days helps find new fics.

For short stories, recommend them here when you are a few chapters in. For novellength (as this one sounds as) above 20-40k feels like a good point. Above 40k means you take it seriously (who writes 40k+ if they dont feel like writing the story?)

So recommend away!

*** To answer you question, I've updated my first five chapters (if not six) within a week and since chapter eight I update once a week on Fridays. My smallest chapter is over 1k words (the very first one, which was immediately followed by the second one). The second one is nearly 4k, followed by two 2k chapters and from that it grows exponentially until chapter 8 which is 11k. I'd say from then on my chapters are and will be over 6k. This is the link if your interested: linkffn(Scion to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Beaudelaire).

**** Interesting, I'll have to give it a look. Though, is the MC supposed to be French? Anthonie is not really a French name, if so. If you're looking for the equivalent of 'Anthony', it's normally 'Antoine' in French (eg, Mark-Anthony = Marc-Antoine). Google seems to say that 'Anthonie' would be Dutch or Swedish.

Just a small nitpick!

***** I know ‘Anthony' is English for ‘Antoine' and I thought for a while of it being the mc's name, but I have a particular bad experience with people named Antoine so Anthonie it was. And you'll find Anthonie's family is also quite multinational. But still, thanks.

** Depends on how often you will update your story. I hate when I'm reading a story, and there's no chapter, or even a update us in a month, informing us hey real life got in the way, but expect a chapter on x date here.

Then I saw the option to hide the post, but it looks like it doesn't do that. But now that you pointed it out I got on my computer and little did you know I can do it on it (I delete the second one).
