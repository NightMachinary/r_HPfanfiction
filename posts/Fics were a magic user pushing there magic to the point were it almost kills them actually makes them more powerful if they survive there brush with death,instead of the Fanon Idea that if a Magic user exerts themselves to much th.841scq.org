Sort of like the Eight Gate form Naruto except part of the boost they get from pushing past there limits is permanent, so maybe more like The zenkai boost from dragon ball Z.( or like the boost they get in danmachi from levelling up)

so when harry Does his Patronus at the end of Third year that drives off hundreds of Dementors he Breaks his limits, which in fanon would some how break his magic. But Instead leads to him getting a permanent power boost once he Recovers from from pushing himself past his limits?

It would also be a great way to balance wizards from different time periods Like Modern wizards are more skilled but they also lead safer lives than Wizards living in the founder time so they are not Breaking there limit very often if at all, making it a Skill(modern)vs power(ancient) with wizards like Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort getting the best of both world in having the skill of a modern wizards while also breaking there Limits like magic users from the founders time. Infact to stop the rise of powerful Wizards the ministry has started spreading the propaganda that magical pushing you limits is bad for you.

That could also be what Rituals are a Controlled way for a magic user to Break there Limits which is part of the reason that the Ministry band them( I feel like i have been watching to much Dragonball Super with all the take of Breaking limits I have been doing)


** Intesting theory i personally like it would explain why people say the founders merlin morgana where even more powerful then dumbledore etc.
