I'm looking for a specific fic that I don't really remember. All I can remember is that Harry and Dobby have a special relationship, Harry â€˜promoted' Dobby to be his major domo (that phrase might be from another fic) and Draco has a specially bound house elf as well. Harry asks if Dobby ever sees his family and it turns out that Draco's house elf is Dobby's brother.

Sorry this is so vague, this has been on my mind for days now and I still can't find it.
