** Young Harry Potter, he was just fifteen,

When he broke into the Ministry,

And found a portal to a world unseen.

After his godfather took a little trip,

Then Harry took a look inside of it.

There was a great big flash, everything just changed,

His molecules got all rearranged!

I'd go on, but I'd have to come up with an alias for him and it's late, so all I've got is Harry Polter...
