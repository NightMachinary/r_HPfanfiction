I do NOT want Sirius dying in the story, I'd rather him be helpful towards Harry and/or the Order in general.

I love Sirius and feel like Rowling just wanted him out of the way ASAP, which is just a shame. There is stuff he could do, to help, either Harry or the Order.

I want a more complex Sirius then what we normally get in fanfiction.

I'm perfectly okay with Het/Slash/Femslash

It can be on Fanfiction.net or on another site.

Sirius can be a major character or a minor/side character.

Harry can be the character we follow, or someone else entirely.

Harry can end up living with Sirius or not, either is fine.

Absolutely NO character bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but the author going out of the way to bash characters is a huge no no.

Would rather it be completed, but if not is fine.


** I just started this one but it looks like Sirius plays a major role: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7876690/chapters/17990080]])

He's quite important in linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief]])

No bashing to speak of in either fic

  Remus grew red in the face. His voice rose as he spoke, “This is illegal. They cannot be made to do this. It goes against Wizarding culture, and centuries of tradition. It goes against common fucking sense. What more will they ask of them? What more, Sirius?” Harry looked to Hermione as she took the letter. The communication that passed them was swift and silent. They had been through one war, and if fate brought them another, so mote it be. His pulse was steady, and Harry found that the worry and confusion was fading away, giving rise to a need to take action in the face of this unnamed foe. The confident look on her face faded as she scanned the official letter quickly. Harry didn't like the fear that bloomed in her eyes. She looked up, and Harry wasn't sure he had heard her properly when she said, “I have to get married.”

** In most of my stories, Sirius is alive, (eventually) out of Azkaban and plays an important role in Harry's life. Here are three longer stories as examples where that's the case, but there are more such stories - and all but the currently updating are completed.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
