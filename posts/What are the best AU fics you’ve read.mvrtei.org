Or the most creative AU fanfics. I've read muggle AUs, regency AUs and Voldemort wins AUs, but I wanted to know if there were any that were really unique. I just finished reading the Rigel Black fics by murkybluematter, which is an AU where Tom Riddle went into politics rather than becoming Voldemort.


** Significant AU fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: James and Potter got Voldemort that night with a nasty trap. They burnt down their own house, faked their deaths, and fled Britain altogether. As a result, Harry was raised by his loving parents and never went to Hogwarts. But that doesn't mean he turns out to be a nice guy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: Lucius Malfoy won through a daring maneuver after Halloween 1981, and Dumbledore had to flee for France with his remaining followers. Harry was raised by Sirius there and went to Beauxbaton with the Weasleys. But they would have their revenge 18 years later.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is Nothing to Fear series]] features a Gryffindor Tom Riddle. He's a lot scarier and more successful than canon Voldemort so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]]: No Voldemort AU, and Bellatrix becomes a cynical auror/detective, until she meets Hermione. Still plenty of bad guys here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]: Harry is blind and can't go to Hogwarts. He's soon joined by a badly crippled Hermione in his special education school. PS and CoS events do still happen in this fic, but nothing after Year 3 is the same. Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]] still let PS and CoS happen with significant changes. But it's Petunia, Sirius, Bill, and Fleur who did the heavy lifting against Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]] features a better Gilderoy Lockhart who gets to raise Harry. PS and CoS happened with significant alterations, and the plot is mostly resolved by then.

--------------

Then there are couple really good Muggle AU fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618513/1/half-awake-and-almost-there][half awake and almost there]]: Pretty good Harry/Ginny romance, written by the author of the very popular "The Changeling series".

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822&rewrite=true][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Sci-fi AU with superpowers, mirrors canon events loosely until Year 7. This Trio is awesome, and has compiled an astronomical body count.

** Barbed Wire Grass Crown is an AU where another child at Wools Orphanage is magical. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1628140]]

Brilliant Difficulty is an AU where Sirius gets a trial after PoA. Excellent world building in this series. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1876930]]

** You've gotten some good recs already - I especially second [[/u/Consistent_Squash][u/Consistent_Squash]]'s suggestion of 73 Aberdeen! I'll throw out two I enjoyed that both use popular AU tropes but combine and/or twist them in fresh ways.

The first combines a Slytherin!Harry AU with a James lives AU, but one in which James was presumed dead until Harry's fifth year. It's very good, and I'll also note that it has a couple of really engaging quidditch scenes, which I find people often have a hard time writing well.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9555569/chapters/21605777][*i won't just survive (no you will see me thrive)*]] *by EclipseWing:* In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults. Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

The other one is a Jily fic that flips the usual mixed-magic Jily AU configuration (wizard!James/muggle!Lily) and uses what seems to be the widely beloved "The Other Minister" chapter from HBP as inspiration for a Prime Minister!James/Minister for Magic!Lily AU.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18267275/chapters/43227482][*We are here*]] *by elanev91:* James Potter has just swept into the Premiership on a wave of Brexit outrage and, on his first night in office, a woman strolls out of his fire and tells him she's the Minister for Magic. She tells him not to worry, he'll never see her again unless something really serious happens. It goes, perhaps, without saying, that something really serious happens. As the anti-Muggle and anti-Muggleborn sentiments that have been brewing in the wizarding world once again ignite, Lily Evans finds herself in a position where she has to address the prejudice that has followed her her whole career. And she's prepared to do that alone, but the Prime Minister isn't nearly so willing to let her handle everything off-screen.

** On the shorter side, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987973][73 Aberdeen]] is a great Wolfstar story with an AU premise of Slytherin Sirius. It's pretty angsty and about 30K words. On the fullblown world building side [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2137872][Pandemic]] is unique with an amazing Voldemort characterization. It is about the butterfly effects of pandemics in the wizarding world. It's definitely not light reading and is about 200K words.

**** These are slash fics. Sometimes slash fics get downvoted in this sub's threads. Looking at the other comments, Children of the revolution and train to nowhere are also slash but I haven't read them myself to know if there's anything objectionable. The firebird trilogy I don't know much about.

****** A bit of that, but it's probably complicated - lesbian fics sometimes get an easier pass here. My view is that it's probably folks projecting themselves onto characters too much, esp with characters like Harry who they identify with. Downvoting for dislike instead of because it doesn't contribute is probably a practice folks picked up from FB.

but for this sub there's some history around the slash downvoting topic like this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ckfxc0/stop_downvoting_slash_fics/][thread]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/db4z1d/is_there_some_kind_of_silent_bot_on_here_that/][this one]]
