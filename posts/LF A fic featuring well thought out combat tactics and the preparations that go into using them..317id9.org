I have come across a few fics that feature a decently in-depth description of fights between two groups of wizards (and a lot of them that don't), but my search for a fic that does a decent job highlighting not only the fight, but what went into preparing, setting the stage for and finishing it from the participants' point of view as well has yielded some dramatically underwhelming results.

For example, why do the Death Eaters favor the Unforgiveables over everything else? How do Aurors actually take down an actively hostile group of dark mages? What role can potions and artifacts play in experienced and/or intelligent hands (and why is the use of potions and/or artifacts in combat such a rare thing in canon)? What spells precipitate what strategies for those that use them as well as those that counter them? I have read very few fics that delve into these particular questions and, of these, maybe a small handful could be said to feature, well, /good/ let alone exemplary thinking when showcasing what actually went into the fight scene.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal][This fic of LensOfSanity]] delves into it at times, for example, though I do believe your mileage may vary on that front. Fun read, though.

Any ideas, anyone?

Harry is trained by the Ministry's best- the Unspeakables, Field division. Plenty of well-tempered fights both in training and in practice. Suffers from its age a little (e.g.: references to magical cores and power ratings), but this is one of the fics that made the concepts meme-worthy.

*** If it helps, I am not. I have been doing some thinking about how to fight effectively using magic based around the following restrictions:

Straight wand-to-wand fighting is conducted at near close quarters due to the fact that A) magical spells still have to travel to the target and therefore distance affects the chances of landing a hit and B) given the fact that a wand needs to actually complete motions when casting a spell, this makes actually targeting someone less than a maximum of fourty to fifty metres away really goddamn hard.

-There are no magical cores. Rather, a spell relies entirely upon the individual's ability to concentrate on the 'instructions' required to actually cast a spell. In essence, what the wizarding world would call magical maturity is in fact the brain itself maturing to the point where it can handle the workload imposed upon it. In combat, this translates into the older & wiser, the more powerful, though raw intelligence and willpower can counterbalance these factors.

-Potions, bespelled necklaces, enchanted artifacts and other potentially useful magical combat accessories have severe downsides that need to be accounted for-potions and artifacts are delicate and can react violently and/or prematurely to shocks/adverse magical environments/containment failure etc. Bespelled objects 'leak' magic fairly quickly and, sometimes, violently. For example, a malfunctioning invisibility cloak could convert all that light into ionising radiation, which a distracted wizard wouldn't notice until their hair starts falling out.

-Time travel, apparition etc have rendered the idea of taking and holding terrain useless. The objective in attacking a target is not to acquire control of an area, but of the magical resources in that area. This partially explains at least some of the terror associated with the imperious. Sure, crucio and the venerable AK are scary in combat, but the imperious is the spell that can make a wizard or witch turn over control of the wards to their greatest enemies, trapping their friends & family behind magical wards that used to secure them.

-On-the-fly transfiguration: almost impossible to master, almost impossible to counter as Voldemort found out to his detriment.

-Since invisibility seems to be a favored tactic of closing in and ambushing enemies, it makes sense that sensory charms, abilities and magical alterations thereof exist in substantial numbers. How do those synaesthetic aspects of fighting change combat? Depending on the abilities, quite a lot actually.

-Repeat after me; Magic equals Absolute. Battlespace. Control. Clashing magics equal Absolutely. Unpredictable. Terrain. Especially if clashing spells carry secondary effects on the immediate environment such as give off heat, cause gravitational or temporal fluctuations, turn the vegetation into obsidian replicas with very sharp edges etc.

The degree of latitude and sheer potential magic carries is incredible. Trying to come up with viable group tactics whilst taking some of this stuff into consideration is insane. Getting multiple viewpoints in order to come up with good plans and ideas that won't get shot down for being utterly stupid is vital.

Hence the LF request.

Well, that and I get to nerd out some too whilst reading how others deal with these questions.

You're making an assumption that direct attack spells always travel straight in a line. Granted, it does seem like in canon that this statement is true. But then again, we really only see Harry's knowledge. More advanced spells might allow for targeting.

You mention elsewhere about intelligent targeting magic, and claim that it would seem to be difficult. I would disagree. First: is magic supernatural or is it just an energy form? (See [[/u/Taure]]'s [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2ocz76/wizards_vs_muggles_xpost_rwhowouldwin/][post]]). Second: it seems like just about all magic calls upon an intelligence of sorts: how does repario know what the restored object should be? how does a scourgify know what to clean? How does a dish-washing charm know what to clean? Animation charms ... as many roboticists can say: even walking is surprisingly difficult. Third: there are already intelligence-creating magics: magical paintings, the sorting hat. Forth: transfiguration and animal conjuring appears to create animals that have animal level intelligence.

I tend to think that a magical dual would occur at a distance of between 10 and 20 meters. If it is less, it begins to make more sense to launch a physical attack. See the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tueller_Drill][Tueller Drill]]

I more or less agree with this. It also explains why most people are unable to deal with Death Eaters: terror does not lend to the mental state conductive to magical casting.

I would argue that there is more to magic than just concentrating on the "instructions": that there has to be an active component to casting magic. (Otherwise there'd be a whole of miscast spells while students are studying.)

Also, intentionally mis-cast spells seem like they could be used to produce dangerous results. Of course, it becomes a question of who is more in danger: the defender or the attacker.

It has always seemed odd to me that a potion can be "completed". I mean, why wouldn't random environmental factors affect it? E.g. someone's hair, etc. It seems like potions would need some sort of "stabilizing" factor, so that it no longer (readily) reacts to the environment.

At first apparition seems like a major positive in a fight situation. However, after thinking about it more, it seems more like a recipe for disaster. First, it (it seems like it) requires a fairly high amount of concentration to avoid splinching, something one doesn't really have time for in a battle. Second, there are area-based anti-apparition spells, so one can't really assume that this tactic is usable. Third, if anti-apparition spells are possible, why not a force-splinching spell? If anyone apparates within the affected area, force them to splinch. Say, force the splinch to remove their head from their body. Opps.

Of course, if during a battle you (or your teammate) has time to create an area-based anti-apparition ward, you might have time to cast a "stun" ward, that automatically stuns everything that, e.g., has the dark mark. Or a ward to redirect apparition into the ground. Or ...

I doubt that invisibility is really that useful in a battle. Its not that difficult to detect (homenum revelio, flood the area with water: you'll see where they are walking, conjure a bunch of white-powder, etc. Or, simply attack with area affects spells. Poison or acid clouds. Large fireballs. Lightning. Drop the ceiling. I think the benefit is primarily for ambushes and temporary confusion

One thing that I don't like is that a lot of authors think: why doesn't Harry simply do X? And X lets Harry save the world. But they never think about how others might counter X. (E.g. flooding the area with water: enemy could send electricity through it, or freeze it to reduce your mobility, etc ...)

How did you tie this up with Moody's eye?

Also, have you any thoughts on the spell's movement mechanics? I.e. the speed constant for all spells or not, roughly what percent of spells in total affects the target instantaneously, are there self-navigating spells, why people don't use self-navigating and instantaneous spells that often, etc.

***** For Moody's eye? Simply put, I believe the man modified it to act as a secondary spell focus i.e. a backup wand hidden in plain sight. With a constant flow of magic passing through it courtesy of the Eye's proximity to the brain, Moody could renew the charms as soon as he thinks about them.

My headcanon is that spell movement mechanics are mnemonic tools as much as they are initiators to the spell. You can cast without them, put the degree of complexity simply pointing and casting adds to the whole process is exponential in nature-whereas a simple first-year spell could be pointcast by virtually every wandwielder after a few years' experience with the spell, a second year spell may take twice as long to get down. Then in third year it would take three times longer /ad nauseam/.

As for the speed of spells? I do not believe they are constant but instead have their velocity determined by the casting capabilities of the mage (accuracy during cast, degree of focus provided, intent powering the impetus of the spell etc.), the environmental conditions the spell faces when it manifests in 3d space, the volatility of the spell itself etc.

As for instantaneous transfer, I do not believe that that is, strictly speaking, possible without time shenanigans being involved. In my mind, the only spells capable of instantaneously reaching their target do so by effectively going FTL-which is something they would have to be designed to do from the get-go. 'Normal' spells may theoretically achieve a velocity equal to the speed of light provided that they do no manifest solid components within the spell after casting (which could potentially happen). To us, though, it would be similar to instantaneous anyway as the nigh-infinitesimal delay would be hard to spot without advanced equipment. Those spells are so fast that they don't have a chance to actually do anything except basically shed light at the point of impact and have so little mass that light and/or radiation is the worst of the emissions in the physical world. The percentage of spells that could do that? Maybe five, ten percent at most, mostly designed to imbue pre-existing terrain elements with specific instructions and the means to carry them out than capable of inherently changing them somehow-which is why transfiguration is so difficult since it straddles the gap between these two elements.

The existence of the 'point me' spell and the protean charm indicates that, on balance, self-navigating spells can exist, though the casting complexity may be something to consider here. The spell would have to contain a degree of intelligence to successfully navigate obstacles, after all, and specifically crafting an intelligence, even through magic, in order to follow a specific purpose /at least/ semi-independently does not sound easy. Think intelligent software agent in terms of complexity.

And that's the crux of why the above spells would be rare-complexity.

Correct me if necessary, but aren't at least some charms able to significantly affect their target with no delay? Hovering charm for instance.

******* Ah, but this is where someone like me will start asking the /dumb/ question. Stated plainly, the dumb question is "how would it do that?"...

At which point you'll inevitably get a "magic, bitches" response.

Then there's also the fact that 0.000000000002 seconds' delay may as well be instantaneous to us, so it's a mere matter of perspective. Just because it takes an almost immeasurably short time does no mean the same as saying 'it happens in two places at once'.

Fun fact: Apparition is not instantaneous, though the travel might as well be. Put bluntly, the apparator folds space between himself and his point of origin, overlaps two weak spots over each other and then has his or her magic fling him/herself through the tear. Speed-of-thought setup tiime, long distances travelled.... theoretically, a wizard could do FTL without assistance using this spell provided there are no hard limits on distance covered.

This story does a good job of showing how Harry fares at the Auror office after the war. Has a nice plot involving Death Eaters. I feel the author certainly tried to incorporate some more 'realistic' magic into the story.

The story has a prequel too, which deals more with Harry and Ginny's romance, but is an okay read too. The only annoying thing is that it was never edited which makes it harder to read in that aspect than the sequel.
