Tonks dies in the final battle and had been dating Harry, who is devastated. Somehow he ends up meeting death who send s him back in time to the night his name came out of the goblet, to act as sort of an angel of death I believe. He also makes a deal that if he can get Tonks to fall in love with him again she will get her memories back of the timeline where she died. Does anyone know the name of this fic??
