So like someone working for an inane and possibly made up branch of the Ministry? Hermione seems rather ideal for the enthusiastic main character, but I suppose I wouldn't mind anyone else, including OCs. Maybe something lighthearted post Voldemort or OC ministry worker trying to get shit done while Harry and co try to defeat Voldemort?


** Charlie Weasley can be Ron Swanson, Harry is Ben Wyatt, Ron is Andy Dwyer with Ann Perkins being Lavender Brown.

** OMG I love Parks and Rec! I would read the shit out of that! Neville would totally be the only sane one a la Ben Wyatt.

*** In my mind I was placing Neville in the rather unflattering position of Jerry... Was I being a bit too unkind?

**** I dunno. Does he have a cube butt? I could see like, 11-year-old Neville as the Jerry, but adult? I dunno. He kept it together during the DE takeover of the school, so he's seen some things.

Hmm ... who would I put as the Jerry/Garry/Larry/Terry? I could see someone who wasn't well-liked at school, maybe MacLaggan or Crabbe/Goyle (whichever one didn't die). I can see Dean as Tom with Seamus as his Jean Ralphio. He made his money the old-fashioned way. He got hit by a Nim-buuuuus!

Fun stuff!

***** Well J-G-L-Terry wasn't really liked, (cube) but he's still a nice guy. MacLaggan or Goyle are both too much of a dick to fit that role, I think.
