  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny Weasley is straight - she's had boyfriends, after all. But when she sets her sights on a position with the Holyhead Harpies (the only all-women Quidditch team in the League), she decides that going to the Harpies' favourite hangout - which is also London's only wizarding lesbian bar- and pretending to be a lesbian will help her chances of getting on the team. She decides to bring Harriet along for support - unaware that Harriet is in the closet, and terrified of anyone finding out.But Ginny's reasons for going to the Kitty Kat Club are more complex than Harriet knows - and maybe people finding out the truth about Harriet won't be such a disaster, after all.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything.

** I'm going to be cheeky enough to mention my own story, Holly Potter and the Witching World. It's only six chapters in, and no real pairing yet, but I can tell you that I'm not planning on hooking her up with either FemDraco or Hermione... Tom Riddle is still male in this universe, and regardless of gender /definitely/ not a romantic prospect.

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, the cupboard which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it all have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about in hushed tones? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)
