I'd like it to be well written and have at least 100k words. Also for it it be during Hogwarts, not after the battle, please.

Thanks!


** I can only name three fics off the top of my head that fit your guidelines and it's still pretty loose.

linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) Harry basically yoinks the wand from Dumbledore and kills a couple people with it I think. You've probably read this. Very controversial fic.

linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) You've probably read this one too. Harry pulls the yoink move again and then takes over the world via supreme yoinking.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power) Slytherin Harry Potter receives the wand before his first year and then proceeds to destroy everyone until he gets destroyed being trained and then he destroys everyone harder. Also Elemental powers. And maybe a Drakon or two. Very good fic. Very long.

These might not be what you're looking for but you're not gonna find many long well written fics based around solely the elder wand and the elder wand only.

Uhhhh, honorable mentions that don't follow your requests at all but you might enjoy anyway:

hpffn(The Denarian Renegade)

hpffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord)

hpffn(The Other Side of Reality)

hpffn(The Unwinding Golden Thread)

hpffn(Welcome to Hogwarts 1949)

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
