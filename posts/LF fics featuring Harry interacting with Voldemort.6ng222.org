Looking for any fics that focus on or at least heavily feature Voldemort. This can be as enemy or as mentor with Harry as dark, grey or light. I will admit that grey Harry is my favorite. Not looking for slash stories, but if it's not just smut I'll take a look.


** You've probably read it, but linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) fits

*** Man I was excited at the 1 million word count... But now im 150k words in and so little has happened and so many side characters have been introduced. Quite difficult to read without losing interest.

** linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/832559/chapters/1584001]]) - first chapter is a little confusing but you're given more information as you go. It's incomplete and hasn't been updated for a while but definitely still worth the read. And the author really improves their writing within the first couple of chapters.

linkffn(8507725) - this one is also incomplete and no longer updating, sorry. This fic is quite funny and has one of the best opening chapters of any I've read so far in the 'Voldemort-raises-Harry' trope.

lilnkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/934466/chapters/1819027]]) - I feel super bad bc all of these are incomplete so far :~) anyways this is another good one. well written and very compelling characterisation of Harry, Tom, the whole cast.

All have a grey!Harry who is more similar to how he is in canon and no slash (so far, but really i'm not really expecting the authors to suddenly start updating again).

Edit: found what I was looking for! lilnkffn(3672254) - Another Harry kidnapped from chamber of secret by Tom. It's really good and the themes and Harry's character are executed brilliantly imho. and it's complete

Edit 2: Just saw your thing about not minding m/m stuff. linkao3(Consuming Shadows by Child_OTKW) grey!Harry, m/m stuff with an omc very briefly but nothing explicit, and when the author was first writing it they even says there might never be though that's more uncertain now. incomplete but regular updates. great story, characters, and world building.

  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.

** linkffn(7118223) has a ton of mind-to-mind chatting after Voldy sends Harry away from his dimension. Some very funny scenes, unfortunately incomplete.

linkffn(9268425) also has a running dialogue in Harry's mind and also features some hilarious moments. It's also just a terrific story in and of itself. Sequel fizzled out, unfortunately.

linkffn(4003405) has Horcrux Tom mentoring him. I'm not a huge fan of the story (Harry gets overpowered really quickly, in my opinion, and there's not enough reaction or concern about it) but it fits your criteria pretty well.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.
