I'm not partial to any specific pairing. Just really keen to see a realistic portrayal of Luna on the side of the dark! I've read a few fics in which she's a secondary character that fits this description, but one that focuses on her more would be great.


** linkffn(Twelve Dark Moons). Can't say how dark she is of her own accord, but it's Luna/Voldemort.

  As a captive of Lord Voldemort, Luna Lovegood never thought she would live beyond the first 24 hours. Saved at first by her quick wit, Luna learns the depth of human evil...and becomes the Dark Lord's greatest weakness. Eventually LVLL.

** Unfortunately, I've got another with Luna as a secondary character. The art is a somewhat opaque -- the transcripts help a lot. [[https://www.elidupree.com/voldemorts-children][Voldemort's Children]] by Eli Dupree.

Unfortunately, the work isn't finished.

** It's hard to come by, I think, because it would be so difficult a character transformation to achieve. Luna's a fundamentally /good/ person, and her intrinsic sense of universalism should temper the darker impulses of those around here . . . it's hard to imagine what would shift that.

That said, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241798/1/Pathetic][Pathetic]] is one of my very favorite stories, and she reaches some rather grim depths in it. The prose clunks about at times, and the mechanics can be faulty, but there's little to match its mad surrealism. The conclusion is one of the few sequences in fanfiction that really sticks with me. It is the final battle against which I measure all final battles. Your mileage may vary.
