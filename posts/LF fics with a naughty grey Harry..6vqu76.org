I've been looking for some specific type of fics lately, and havent found quite what i have been looking for, so i hope you guys can help!

Im a bit tired of the "noble Harry cant even think of boobs without blushing" And so now im looking for fics where harry is naughty in interresting ways:

Glasses charmed to see through clothing!

Happy accidents! (Groping, upskirt/downblouse, accidental penetration?)

Good utilization of invisibility cloak or spell. (A boy and his cloak is a good example)

Using Room of Requirement for naughty purposes

And any other interresting way for harry to spy on girls, have random naughty accidents etc.

Doesnt have to be smut, can be a fun sidestory to the main story.

Obv no slash.

No lenght requirement but quality writing is preferred

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Out of curiosity, are there pairings in this fic and what makes it rated M? Is it just language or are there darker elements or lemon elements that affect it? (I ask because i find it silly when authors rate M just for language)

**** Harry tortures/interrogates/experiments on Death Eaters and is casual about killing.

Quite a lot of smut but it's within the realms of plot.

The pairings for Harry seem to have stabilised for now which includes casual sex on the side but has become less common.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

**** Maybe to get a few of the inside jokes between him and his other "weeb" friend, but it's not at all important to the plot or story in general.

Probably 10-15 one-line jokes that you might find funnier if you watched a shit ton of anime.
