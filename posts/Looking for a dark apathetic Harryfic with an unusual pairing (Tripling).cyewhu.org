:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic a long while back based around Harry who grew up with a darker perspective on life, all based around good and bad choices. He is friends with Blaise or Nott I, cant remember, and he is with Hermione, except due to his nature, the slytherin male also has a relationship with hermione, cos harry is sort of aesexual(?). Anyway, I might look under names like Choices or 'something' + choices. A sort of odd fic, thanks for any help.

I think you're talking about this one. It's Harry / Hermione / Theodore Nott.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
