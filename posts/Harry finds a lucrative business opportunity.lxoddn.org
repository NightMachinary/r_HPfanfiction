A 16 Dudley was found in possession of Cannabis by the Surrey police, which gives Harry an idea. Smuggle drugs into Hogwarts / The Wizarding World and sell them for incredible prices.

Possible follies: 1) Hermione because she knows what they are and is morally opposed 2) Fudge / The Ministry. Because there's a new menace bringing strange substances into Magical Britain. 3) Lucius Malfoy/ Some other rich pure blood. How do you think they got their money?


** I bet there would be some much more interesting magical plants you could take / smoke in the wizard world.

I'd love to see this the other way around. Harry discovers a magical plant that is like the perfect weed replacement (somehow, I don't know the details!) and starts selling it to Muggles

*** JKR has probably said something like “Wizards are immune to muggle drugs because they're built different” in a random interview. So likely yeah

**** Whatever JKR has added after the books is fanon to me. Like, biologically, that's not even really possible, so...

** Wouldn't the wizarding world be so backwards that drugs like opium are still legal?

*** Not necessarily, without entering too much on the same old and frankly already tired discussion the magical world's instance on altering the state of your mind is ambiguous at /best/, with something's being forbidden (like the imperious) while others like the cheering charm are not only allowed but a part of the school's official curriculum. To be fair though, the main reason drugs are bad is because the amount of the substances needed to cause the sought effects causes certain chemical and hormonal reactions on the brain which causes damage to the nervous system, this could quite easily simply not be a consequence of the main magical means.

Plus by Pottermore Wizards are supposedly immune to many muggle health-hazards, so quite possible that cannabis, opium or even absinthe would just be plainly useless.
