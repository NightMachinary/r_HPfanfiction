:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This was one of the best Harry Potter/Luna fanfictions. Luna is still her weird self and serves as a counter balance to Harry. None of his friends like Luna initially but eventually fhey warm up to her. Harry is very powerful. Luna like halfway in the story ends up dying in I think Hogsmeade due to a deatheater attack. She saves Harry from an attack that he didnt see coming. I unfortunately stopped after that, because I was so disappointed.


** I would have too - killing Luna is an automatic "nope" for me, with only one fic ever managing to hold me past that point.
