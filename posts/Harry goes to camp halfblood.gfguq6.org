Don't care when it is but I want just Harry to go to camp and be a wizard. Don't mind about pairings and I'm not looking for joint worlds. Just Harry getting tossed into more crazy shit


** Harry Potter, Squatter - linkffn(13274956) - It does have Harry, who is still a wizard, goes to camp. Though that isn't the main focus but this story is amazingly good.

A Potter in America - linkffn(11576439) - Has Harry becoming a teacher at camp half-blood.

Home is Where the Hearth is - linkffn(12791536) - Another good story about a wizard Harry going to camp half-blood.

These are the best ones that I remember and know.

  There was a bit more to the Deathly Hallows than anyone knew in the Wizarding world. Moving to the New York country side to be closer to his job, Harry wouldn't be Harry without something major happening and drawing him into a new adventure. Except this time, the beings he fights are a threat to the entire world.

  Voldemort didn't know the powers he was messing with the night he attacked the Potters. Lily Potter was much more than she seemed. Freed of her temporary mortal body, she left behind a child with a very uncertain destiny. Taken to Camp Half Blood to be raised, he spent most of his childhood in New York. That was until circumstance drove him back to the country of his birth.
