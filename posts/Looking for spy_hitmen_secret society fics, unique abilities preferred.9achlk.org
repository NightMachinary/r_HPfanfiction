So I'm looking for particular types of fics, some cloak and daggers/secret organizations stuff, involving Harry and Hermione (preferably shipped but that's not necessary), and preferably having the members have unique equipment/weapons/abilities. A couple of examples are:

​

The Serpent Court by whitetigerwolf:

​

and Light's Hope, Death's Hunters by reptilia28

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3534595/1/]]

​

Hopefully some of you guys enjoy these types of stories and have some recommendations. I've been writing a couple of fics with these concepts for a while but I lost motivation and never published them. I'm trying to get back into writing and have gotten back into reading fanfic as inspiration.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
