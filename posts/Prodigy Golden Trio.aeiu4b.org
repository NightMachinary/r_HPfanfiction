  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822&rewrite=true][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Although set in a non magic Sci-fi AU, the Trio are outstanding when it comes to intelligence, discipline, effort, leadership, reasoning skills, and combat capabilities. They royally fucked over their enemies in latter years, and I almost feel sorry for Umbridge...

**** Yes. It helps to know a little bit about the British intelligence agencies, but the story is self-contained. I have only a vague idea about what Alex Mack is all about, but the story made perfect sense.

** You might enjoy the chessmaster series. While they aren't quite prodigies they are far more competent than in canon, especially Ron. Though fair warning, this story is basically 50% politics and "Lord X of Ancient and Noble House Y" stuff. But to be fair, this fic does the best out of all the ones I've read so far. It's actually pretty interesting for the most part, and there's a ton of worldbuilding that makes it believable.

And here's the series on the author's Archive of Our Own account: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/775506][The Chessmaster series by Flye Autumne]].

Be warned: the series is still incomplete. Three books have been completed, and the fourth book's third chapter was added 10 days ago.

** Linkffn(Femme Fatale by cleotheo; Buried Secrets by cleotheo)

Both set in the same universe it includes Harry as a kickass lawyer, Hermione as a ‘magical' medical examiner of sorts, and Ron as a specialist it forensic psychology - figuring out motives and patterns and next moves. I really enjoyed them! They're mostly Dramione pairing but the pairing isn't the focus of the stories.
