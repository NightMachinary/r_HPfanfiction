:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All that I remember is all of the heirs and scions of the ancient and noble houses were discovered to be dangerously exhausted and always on the verge of magical exhaustion. This was because they had to continuously employ occlumency to protect their family secrets. I think it might have been a fic where Harry's abuse by the Dursley's was significantly worse?


** It may be Linkffn(Dodging prison and stealing witches).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
