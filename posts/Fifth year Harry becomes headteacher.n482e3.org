I'm sure he becomes headteacher anyways

And Umbridge is in some cage thing (at least that's how I imagined it) on Hogwarts grounds

Uhh idk what happened to dumbledore then?

I'm pretty sure it all started with the blood quills and that they were really bad and messed up people's magical cores or something

I have no idea how I remember so much I swear I read it like 8 months ago

But if anyone knows what it's called or something ðŸ˜… I know i probably have it saved somewhere but I really can not be bothered to look rn ðŸ˜‚
