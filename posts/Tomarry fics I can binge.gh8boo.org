I'd love to get some recommendations for Tom/Harry fics that ARENT voldy/Harry pedophilia. Preferably complete, but 20+ chapter stories that have been updated fairly recently are great too. I recently read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7189349/chapters/50181764#workskin][“Wear Me Like a Locket Around Your Throat”]] and it's essentially what I'm looking for.


** This is one of the best Tomarries I've read. Quite recent also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13169788/1/Son-of-Magic][Son of Magic]]

  After decades of war, the world is on the brink of destruction, with no hope for survival. The only way to go on is to travel back in time and change everything that's gone wrong, starting with Tom Riddle. That's how Harry Potter found himself in 1941, a time he had hoped never to find himself in again. Why 1941? Death has a pretty messed up sense of humour, that's why. HP/TR

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

  He is the first seer the Potter family has ever had, but is it really as much of a blessing as it appears? Harry knows he has a chance prevent the horrors of the First Wizarding War from ever happening and set things right. Things don't go quite as planned, however, and Harry instead finds himself being part of a larger game with hidden rules. A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired pawn that is trying to survive the war that looms.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
