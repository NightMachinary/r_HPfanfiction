** Sherlock wouldn't even bother. The whole idea of the Horcrox Hunt is ridiculous. What if Voldemort made more than 7? What if he made even one that isn't easily tracked... like a random stone and throw it in the ocean? How would you even know that you got all the Horcruxes before killing Voldie?

Clearly the only sensible plan in their situation would be attempting to capture Voldemort alive and dose him with Veritaserum. Then disable him, but keep him alive and try to deal with the Horcruxes.

The Horcrux Hunt was only successful because it needed to be (because it's a book). Someone like Sherlock wouldn't engage in such a fools errant.

Exactly, Voldemort might very well choose 5 artifacts and 1 random rock just to be safe, then Dumbledore's canon plan would be completely screwed.

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771), has addressed that scenario. Unfortunately, that piece of rock got too close to the sunken wreck of Bismarck, and (s)he came back with a vengeance.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

Sherlock isn't a real person, he's also fictional. If an author can sell him getting involved, then he's involved, just as JKR managed to sell her incredibly lame and overcomplicated plots. (This is a testimony to how good a writer JKR is.) The only question is how skilled the author is, not whether this would happen in real life. After all, in real life, there is no magic to begin with.

Sherlock's a consulting detective, and often intrigued by danger in itself, and I suspect the Wizarding World would be bizarre enough and the fight against Voldemort dangerous enough to him that a story like this isn't too OOC to be made to work.

Anyway, I also find this story idea incredibly appealing, and have for along time. Someone needs to write it. :)

**** I should also add that the whole Horcrux Hunt thing read like a videogame to me. They hopped around places, encountered a few challenges, got hurt, got better, saved the day etc. In the end, Voldemort made very predictable choices for someone who was supposed to be the greatest Dark Wizard to ever live if three teenagers were able to find them all and end his reign of terror.

I think muggledad said it best in The Last Casualties, when he had Dumbledore say to Harry that he would have very little chance opposing Tom Riddle.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle was genius of the like I don't think the magical world has ever seen. He was also an athlete. While not one for Quidditch, I routinely saw him performing calisthenics and running for distance about the grounds. He was charming and witty when he chose to be, but above all, he was an extraordinarily focused and smart young man.
#+end_quote

For all intents and purposes, LV and TR are two *very* different people. I know he started making Horcruxes when he hadn't yet transitioned to his Voldemort persona, and that's probably the reason why he went so crazy/monster-like in the end, but Tom Riddle would have made a better villain.

(And yah, sure, to another commenter's point, JKR's plot is more than a little silly. What if, as in HPMoR, Voldemort just put a Horcrux onto a spacecraft? What if he carefully picked entirely random and innocuous objects that were hard to distinguish and thus safer? But never mind, I /do/ want to see what happens if Sherlock Holmes, and especially possibly modern BBC Holmes, gets involved.)

However, rationally speaking, anyone smart enough to be the finest or second-finest wizard in the world and capable of running a large group of people (even by terror) isn't going to be that dumb. This is a mistake practically straight out of the Evil Overlord's Handbook.

One has to distinguish between what sort of things one can reasonably expect a book villain to do when the plot demands it and what would be reasonable if it were "really" happening. And yes, in the context of a book, we often allow ourselves to be sold on unrealistic plots, because a good writer can make us suspend our disbelief and go with the flow. JKR is a fabulous writer, so it works.

This is, of course, why one could sell (say) Sherlock Holmes in this world as well, at least if one was good enough to do it (which I'm not claiming to be, though if I find time I might try someday).

(Presumably if you decide at some point that you really do want to die, canon claims you can apparently repent your actions, which will reunite your soul and kill you.)

Of course, as long as there are six of the things, there's other failsafes you can use. Put one on the next spacecraft leaving the solar system (shades of HPMoR), put one on a rock that you've hidden somewhere amidst lots of rocks that even you can't find somewhere on earth, put one on a rock on Mars that even you can't find...

  “So, why are we going to ... Little Whinging? How is there even a town named Little Whinging? Is it next to Greater Whinging? Part of Blubbering County? Bisected by the Distraught River, perhaps? Ridiculous.”John just sighed. “We're going because Lestrade asked us. He said this was right up your alley---a classic locked room mystery, clearly a murder, but with absolutely no clues or evidence left behind, not to mention an undetermined cause of death. Victim's name is Vernon Dursley."

  The Potters' move to 221 Baker Street was fairly misguided. Yes, the nosy neighbours and poisonous press weren't outright trying to kill them. But a consulting criminal knows exactly how to burn their hearts. So as London falls and memories shatter, a hero may be rewritten. --- Book 1 is finished! Working on Book 2 with PotterWhoLock.
