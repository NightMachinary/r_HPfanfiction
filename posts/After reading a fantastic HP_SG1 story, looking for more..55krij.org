Must not be ginny as love interest, prefer dr Fraiser or the one that replaces her. Sam or Vala or Hermione, Fleur, Tonks, or OCs as the love interest is fine but no romance is perfectly fine too. No slash.

Prefer he's an sg team member or leader but being in sg1 itself isn't necessary.

Must use his magic, even if only surreptitiously. Sg command knowing or not about magic doesn't matter.

Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2849939]]) is really great and sad and wonderful.

Edit: also write linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/49/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery]]) {full link used because it's an edit} a few minutes ago.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9261735/1/Madness-at-the-Gate][Madness at the Gate]]. It's a sequel to another story. It's basically a sort of guilty pleasure type story because Harry is basically a Gary Stu in how OP he swiftly becomes, but he's also an asshole and I find that sort of thing entertaining. Think mad scientist with magic + Greg House, and it's sort of similar to what you might come up with in your head. He pairs with Tonks in these stories.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4564625/1/Isis-s-Bane][Isis's Bane]] that stars a younger Harry. The premise is that a Gould gets inside Harry and takes him off-world. He defeats it, but then has to deal with SG-1.

It's pretty short (three chapters), but it splits into two longer stories. They're AUs of each other. One is "what if Harry went on by himself" and the other is "what if Harry went to stay with SG-1?"

The nice part is that they're "complete" stories and one of them even has another, finished, sequel.

I quite liked it, but then I was a huge fan of Stargate growing up, so I'm a sucker for this crossover. At least, when it doesn't get too unbearably stupid.

*** I read Isis's Bane this morning and I'm reading the Jack raising Harry sequel atm. I think I'll skip the Harry-Sue one for now. I actually [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/49/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery][wrote]] a short bit on a character driven story last night as well and may write a few more pages or so on the idea, probably a few vignettes.

** I have not yet read a SG/HP crossover with a Ginny/Harry pairing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Stargate-SG-1-and-Harry-Potter-Crossovers/68/224/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&s=2]]. I recommend everything up to "Nobody Said it would be easy" with the exception of Harry Janus Potter. I haven't read any of the fics after that (except for a couple fics that are <5000 words).

*** Eh, the majority of evil!harry stories ignore the fact that riddle and harry are essentially mirrors of each other, signified mostly by their similar looks and opposing hue eyes. If one showed harry growing evil as riddle grows to regret his actions only to be murdered by the new dark lord harry to cement the sheep's view of him as a savior that could be interesting but few evil harry stories have him being competent, they just have him essentially declare he's the new dark lord.

  This is an AU cross-over from Harry Potter with Stargate SG1. Harry meets Seth/Setesh, Harry wins. This is Harry's story of what he would do after assimilating the knowledge of Setesh and Voldemort. I take plenty of AU liberties with canon so don't complain about what the tech or science does or does not do. Pairings: Harry/Hermione.
