AU where Remus survives and Lavender Brown also survives after being bitten by Fenrir Greyback. She asks him for advice on how to live as a werewolf. Might be just a friendship between them, might turn to romance, both or either would be interesting to see.


** It would be fun to see a friendship between Tonks,Fleur and Lavender 's boyfriend in this scenario

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with “The List.” The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.

  Harry Potter is screwed.With a penchant for Firewhiskey and late-night parties, he had no idea that he would find a handsome man in his bed the next morning, when he wakes up; already late for his first day at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies as a Healer trainee. He also had no idea that his mom's ex-boyfriend would have an axe to grind, the most eager girl would follow him around like she'd been hit with a Permanent Sticking Charm, or that the handsome man in his bed that morning was his boss, Tom Marvolo Riddle, Head of Spell Damage.Like I said, Harry Potter is screwed.
