I mean if aquamenti is essentially just 'water spout.' Then were ancient wizards just pointing sticks at each other and screaming fireball! And if that's the case why don't modern wizards just scream obsinaties when they're mad? I really wanna know what 'fuck you' might do as a spell.


** It does paint a ridiculous picture, especially of magical fights where people are screaming explosion at each other.

The way humans process language is interesting though. The best example incantation think of is when people have names that are just normal words, like Joy. Most native English speakers that know or meet a Joy don't have any issue separating the name from the word. Our brains just recognize and accept it as a name and don't give it any thought. I'd imagine it would work the same for spells, yes intellectually you would know that you are saying the same thing, but Water Spout would feel different from water spout and people just wouldn't give it that much thought.

Is it only the children in the books? I always had the impression that non-verbal spells were much more difficult, and that most adults ended up still relying on the crutch of saying it verbally (with the caveat that they'd likely have a few spells that they used often enough to just use non-verbally).

I know the movies had a lot more of that non-verbal casting, probably to help their flow.

But the connection of wizards going around sounding like modern day larpers is hilarious and I want some poor muggle overhearing wizards discussing spells and thinking the wizards are losers.

** It only seems weird to you because we've all been indoctrinated by Modern English into thinking that advanced vocabulary should come from Latin or Greek; that native Old English words sound uneducated and lower-class in these contexts. In other languages it's perfectly normal for technical and prestigious vocabulary to consist of native words. For example the German word for "Hydrogen" is "Wasserstoff", literally "water-stuff". To us that sounds juvenile, but to Germans it sounds perfectly normal.

In my head-canon, each cultural region uses their own local prestige language for spells, so South Asian wizards would use Sanskrit spells, East-Asian wizards would use classical Chinese spells, etc. Once upon a time, they would have just been normal vocabulary, but as the languages evolve and the spells are borrowed by wizards from other cultures, the spells remain frozen in time until they became incomprehensible to their users. Presumably there's nothing stopping people from using English spells, but it's probably stigmatised as uneducated and crass, due to a similar mindset to yours.

*** I think the main part about those compound words and how they sound in English is that breaking it down like that makes us think about each part individually - but I'm not certain how much, say, Germans actually think about the words that make up the compound ones (I know that I have to think them through individually, but that's from the perspective of a non-native speaker. On the flip side for French, words like 'quatre-vingt' - literally 4 20, meaning 80 - I don't think of it as the individual one, but just as the combined word).

We certainly have a lot of compound words in English that we don't consider juvenile - 'campfire', 'aircraft', 'farmhouse', even 'foodstuff', etc. I know that personally I don't think of them as individual words combined, even if that's how they started off as.

You are right that it doesn't sound quite as high class as Latin or Greek, but that's a general western European thing I'd say.

** I think the main thing with spells is the intention. The word/wand movement just helps you focus. And I guess the language was used because everything technical was named from Latin or Greek back in the day, and the trend stuck. It's not a rule though, as Hermione's Four Points spell is literally just "Point Me".

Another example would be Serpensortia. It is supposed to have originated in India, and logic would dictate that the incantation be in Sanskrit. Yet, it's from Latin, and I assume this is likely because some visiting British wizard saw the spell being performed and came up with their own word for it.

We know from canon that intent is required for the unforgivables, I don't know that it wouldn't be required for other magic. Obviously varying complexities of spells would require different levels of concentration and intent.

Small children could certainly "will" things to happen by having strong intent to reach things or avoid things and thus make simple magic happen.

Older wizards that have become very adept at magic can use their wands and intent alone without vocalization at all.

However, I liked a theory I've read a while ago, that the Fidelius is simply an adaptation of an even older spell into Latin by roman sorcerers. If its discovery and adaptation was the result of a betrayer, then that would be some truly JKR-worthy naming irony. The spell named "Trustworthy" being discovered through treachery.

Its nature also strikes me as something older than the other spells we see used, especially with the three ritualistic components - caster, secret, keeper.

So they just use an even older language, like Mycenaean Greek or something.

** I did not know this was a story I needed, but I now I need the story of the origins of wizarding wand magic back in ancient Roman, Celtic and Norse times.

** The explanation I've seen in some fanfics is that languages acquire power and hence can be used for spell-casting through being used for a long time, and that power becomes available when the language is no longer used by ordinary people and hence no longer having the mystery sucked out of it by being used for talking about such thoroughly mundane things as soup and chamberpots. Back when normal people used Latin wizards would have been using an older language. Perhaps what we call Proto-Italic, or Hittite, or one of the non-Indo-European languages that has since gone extinct.

Therefore Norse could have been used from about the 14th century onwards, as it was then the dead ancestor of Danish, Swedish etc.

** No. They used to use Altantian, but they switched to Latin after the Witch Trials, to make it easier to blend in with the muggles. At least, they did in Europe. Really, it's more about learning to apply your Will and Magic, than it is doing a dance and saying a few ‘specific' words in a dead language. The exact words are meaningless, as long as everyone in your general area agrees on what they are.

This is all headcanon, of course, but I like to think that Magic is slightly cognitive, that it Knows a bit about itself and the world, and that if you just push at it it'll try to help you. That's where ‘accidental' magic comes from, children begging for help, and getting it, just not in a trained way. It's the natural magic Halping you, trying to help, but not knowing what you want it to do. That can be dangerous, so, a While Ago magical people got together and desided.. We Say This, You Do That. Words fall out of use as new ones are added. The more people Believe in it, the easier it is. The more people use it, the easier it is. The more You, Yourself, believe that you Can Do It, the easier it is... but you CAN do Anything with magic, technically. Just most people Don't Know How, and almost all would say, No You Can't.

You'd be pushing against the Belief, the Will of the World, and of Everyone Else in it, if you went off the beaten track. But you still COULD. If everyone says “You need a wand to do Magic.”, then clearly you DO. But, Magic can be done without one, accidental magic is done without one, as a rule. So, clearly you don't NEED a wand. A wand just makes it EASIER. Or does it? If people tell you “you have to say the spell, and do the wand motion”, but you don't have a wand, do you Just say the spell, or do you do the motion with your hand? Once you get Told the way things are, it's Much harder to think otherwise about them. You stop being able to do accidental magic as you age. You need a wand to do magic. You need to say the spell, or think it. You can't use more that one spell at a time. You can't transfigure Part of something. Magic Can't Do Anything.

Yes. It can.

** I think this is where invocation came in. You know the chuunibyou "light of hellos, I call upon thee ,banish this darkness. lumos!" since stuff is chanted like galdr or something (I just remember that Norse spells in the eddas are written and spoken differently, or something). So likely, ancient Egyptian, Romans or Greek invoke the gods or titans. Then came shortcuts, but not everyone can do it. Merlin is probably that guy who hates all the dramatics and did practically forgoing presentation since he's likely get poked with a sword before he finished chanting. With the secrecy, there's no need for dramatics to awe people so they won't revolt so short hand version was popularized. As far as weird pig-Latin and stuff, it's probably shortened after by someone who isnt Latin fluent and just know what the spell does. Thus, pig-latin = long Latin invocation and is good enough.

It's probably why unbreakable vow works despite no 'magic spell' involved but needs a 'bonder'. if the bonder to a spell is an 'invoked deity or element' then it works the same way. (therfore, theoretically Harry can use the power of christ to compel Dudley to leave him alone :D).

As for the last part.

I think I've read something... Not sure if it's an HP fic or not but the person did have a "power of words" in that story "screw you" was accidentally said with magic and the guy was twisted and drilled to the ground. The "fuck you" (once he realized screw you worked) was a demonic 'moo' or 'bleat' is heard before "unspeakable acts" occurred. The second time it was used, a moo was heard and the man is seen in the distance running from what seemed like a heard of livestock and was told the creatures won't die or disappear until their job is finished. I imagine it's the reason for weird cursing in wizardry world to prevent weird "curses".

** My headcanon is that they were all using "accidental" magic, except, you know, purposefully.

Chants, wands, and runes (wards and enchanting with runes is a thing damnit! It's not my fault JKR is boring as hell) were introduced later to "nerf" wizards.

This kept people from blowing each other up in an argument. Or someone exploding when they accidentally drop your letter.
