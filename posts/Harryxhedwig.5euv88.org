  She was supposed to die, she was supposed to be destroyed, she was supposed to be completely annihilated, but she wasn't. He wasn't the happiest, nor was he the luckiest, but now a guardian angel all of his own had found her way to him. Let's see what Hogwarts makes of these two. This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
