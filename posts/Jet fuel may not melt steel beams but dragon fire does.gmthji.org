Wherein 9/11 was an ICW coverup for a dragon mating flight.

** The whole "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" thing always irritates me, more so than most other conspiracy twaddle. Seriously, how hard can it be to grasp "things get softer when they're heated up" - have these idiots never before encountered that mystical substance known as "butter"?!

*** Exactly! And the reason i added the youtube link to disqualify myself as one of those nutters.

*** How about "If heavy object flies into building and the fuel tanks explode, building may collapse because the structural support beams were snapped by the force"? Support beams are built to withstand compressive strength and be extremely inflexible. But as everyone knows, steel swords for example need to be flexible or else they literally shatter into pieces.

The whole "melt" thing is idiotic, because the towers collapsed when the planes flew into them and then exploded, not because they flew into them, got lodged while all the supports were perfectly stable, and then began burning, and the fire melted the supports.

Sure there were a couple very weird coincidences surrounding the whole thing, but that's how it happened.

**** Actually the fire DID contribute to the collapse. Steel, like most things, gets softer and weaker as it heats up. The damage from the impacts alone wasn't enough, but eventually the surviving columns lost enough strength due to the fire that they could no longer support the weight of the floors above, no melting required. There was insulation around them specifically to prevent such a thing from happening, but either it was damaged by the impact or just not up to handling a fire of that intensity and duration.

*** Hot take, but it's been 20 years. And this post isn't even making a joke or anything, it's just incorporating past tragedies as part of the story.
