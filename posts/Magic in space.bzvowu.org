What on earth would happen if magic was used in space? What if a black hole was hit by engorgio? Would magic just be another form of energy. It could be that magic is converted into many types of energy. Like lumos is magic converted to light? But how much power would a transfiguration spell need? That would be like turning carbon atoms into oxygen atoms and that seems like it would need a lot of power.

​

And what if wizards went to the moon? What would they do? Could there be a race of magical creatures already there? I am so curious about this - Let's mix magic and space! Any theories welcome!

Edit: I am looking more for theories rather than fanfics.


** Although it has some serious problems, the space travel mechanics are very well done in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929), is also doing a great job regarding the space travel aspect, despite its other issues.

On a more canon compliant note - i doubt they ever did. Space travel has got many an issue, and without proper understanding of physics it would be near impossible to go there and back. Temperature, air, distance, velocity and radiation issues would make it insanely difficult.

As for magical creatures - well, i suppose there could be some horrible things waiting out there. If you can have small, earth-borne dragons why not have a massive space-based one?

  What on earth would happen if magic was used in space?
#+end_quote

It would like have some changes. We have seen magic working differently underwater, so the same thing might apply here. For example, Relashio, a spell that forces the victim to release their grip on what they are holding turned into boilling water attack under water.

" "Relashio!" Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. ... A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin."

Assuming, Harry Potter Magic works the same way in space, it would very likely increase in size.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, fundamently, that could be the case. Practically, tho? It never comes up. Canonically the only limits to your magic is your knowledge, imagination, and skill. They never seem to run out of magic.

#+begin_quote
  But how much power would a transfiguration spell need? That would be like turning carbon atoms into oxygen atoms and that seems like it would need a lot of power
#+end_quote

That's nothing. Wizards can make matter out of nothing. You have a sandwitch? Wave a wand, now you have 20. Where did thet come from? Nowhere. Another thing they can do is make a potion that straight up gives you luck to know exactly what to do to succeed and be able to cast spells like you never have before. They also have spells to create liquid out of nothing, like water or wine.

" “Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.” "

-HBP 187

" “One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. “Enough for twelve hours' luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt." "

-HBP 188

"Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all . . .and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy. . . . He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence. “Excellent,” he said. “Really excellent. Right . . . I'm going down to Hagrid's.” “What?” said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast. “No, Harry --- you've got to go and see Slughorn, remember?” said Hermione. “No,” said Harry confidently. “I'm going to Hagrid's, I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.” “You've got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?” asked Ron, looking stunned. “Yeah,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. “I feel like it's the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?” "

-HBP 477

" “Trust me,” he said. “I know what I'm doing . . . or at least” --- he strolled confidently to the door --- “Felix does.” "

-HBP 478

"His feeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest: This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts"

-HBP 478

"It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time: He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door."

-HBP 479

"The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill."

Oh, in that sense, yes! Sure! Due to the physical properties of space, you could certainly find a lot of outside-the-boxes uses of common spells.

The difficulty of a Transfiguration increases with the size and complexity of the target, though. /Engorgio/ may not be a Transfiguration /per se/, but it's probably the same underlying magical principles. So I doubt anyone but Merlin would be able to cast such a spell on as large an object.

That's if the Black Hole doesn't simply absorb the magical energy, of course, which is always a possibility.

#+end_quote

To be ruthlessly speculative, I think that most wizard spells are optimized to travel through air; adjusting for the medium through which the spell is to move is part of the spellcrafting process. /Usually/ the spell's ‘DNA' (so to speak) is unique enough that even in the wrong medium you still get something like the desired effect, or hitting in the same ballpark. For example, when the magic of the Basilisk's Gaze is filtered through a mirror of some sort, this 'weakens' the death magic into a sheer burst of energy that seizes over the victim's magical system but fails to properly sever their soul from their physical form, causing petrification.

Also like with DNA, however, sometimes a tiny change is enough to change the whole function. Which is what happened with /Relashio/ underwater, with the water to slow it down.

#+begin_quote

As I said it's just conjecture. But unless you assume the laws of magic are completely arbitrary and random, then it seems to me to be reasonable enough to assume that the same underlying principles that govern one form of matter-affecting spells will, in some form, affect another.

#+begin_quote
  but their evidence is a non-canonical video game.
#+end_quote

Why "non-canonical"? I mean, I don't think Rowling's ever said anything definitive to define the /Harry Potter/ canon, /à la/ Roddenberry. (In fact, the one time she said anything about anything being canonical, most everyone ignored her, because she was talking about /Cursed Child/.) So why not follow the Wiki's canon policy --- under which the video games /are/ in fact canonical sources? It's as good as any, and more fun to play about in than a more limited scope of canonicity.

Then what exactly is are crackling bolts of light that shoot out of wands? I don't know if they're any type of energy Muggles would recognize (probably not), but magic is clearly... /stuff/. It has a physical existence, travels from Point A to Point B. As such, it's not absurd to propose that it might be subject to a black hole's attraction.

  To be ruthlessly speculative, I think that most wizard spells are optimized to travel through air; adjusting for the medium through which the spell is to move is part of the spellcrafting process.
#+end_quote

I disagree. If it was dedigned to move through air, the on high alitude we would see them acting differently due to the difference in air. I think you are looking at it too scientifically.

#+begin_quote
  Usually the spell's ‘DNA' (so to speak) is unique enough that even in the wrong medium you still get something like the desired effect, or hitting in the same ballpark
#+end_quote

That more or less seems to fit with Relashio underwater, although the same effect might be more of a side affect. It does achieve the same purpose of making you release something, but that's more on the account that the spell became a flamethrower.

#+end_quote

I would argue differently. The victim's magical system works fine. Othervise after petrification they would not be able to perform magic. Also seeing as there is no IV bags or something similar, I am led to assume that their magical system is what keeps them alive.

What do you mean?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't believe you stated that before. Anyway, wiki says you are right about the size part, although they forgot to quote it, so I really can't check.

#+begin_quote
  then it seems to me to be reasonable enough to assume that the same underlying principles that govern one form of matter-affecting spells will, in some form, affect another.
#+end_quote

I disagree. It's magic. It seems unreasonable to expect rules that govern one branch of magic would transfer to another branch. Either way, the point is wortheless, since you admit that you made up rules for transfiguration.

#+begin_quote
  (In fact, the one time she said anything about anything being canonical, most everyone ignored her, because she was talking about Cursed Child.)
#+end_quote

People ignore her because half the time she has absolutely no idea what she is even saying. This, in turn leads to some stupid statements that also contradict canon as shown to us in books. See, for example, Summoning charm travels at the speed of light comment, which is not only stupid, but also contradicts book 4. If you really look into it, it contradics every point in the books where the charm is shown.

#+begin_quote
  Why "non-canonical"?
#+end_quote

Because it's not in the seven original books. She didn't make the movies or the video games.

#+begin_quote
  So why not follow the Wiki's canon policy --- under which the video games are in fact canonical sources?
#+end_quote

Because then acording to wiki canon, expeliarmus can also reflect spells like protego because that's how it work in a video game.

#+begin_quote
  Then what exactly is are crackling bolts of light that shoot out of wands?
#+end_quote

Magic. And most of the spells don't have bolts of light. In any case, this is my original comment "Magic seems to not display *the usage of any energy to work* unless it's something like levitation." Like it is stated in my comment, magic doesn't appear to need any energy to work, except for things like levitation where logically it must use something like kinetic energy.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That would be a good point if that is all magic did. However, Magic frequently shows the middle finger to the laws of physics. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume it would ignore the laws of physics in here too.

Did warn you I was going to be "ruthlessly speculative". I choose, for the purposes of this theory, to also take the option that this is how it kills.

#+end_quote

We agree more than you think; perhaps I wasn't clear enough. I think that Petrification is the "power-saving emergency mode" that the individual's magic system puts them in to wear off the shock of the surge of magical power.

#+begin_quote
  What do you mean?
#+end_quote

Whenever they're visible, spells are seen to physically move about from Point A (the tip of the caster's wand) to Point B (the target). And they can be blocked by physical objects. So it seems a fair assumption to presume that friction in water would slow them down like any other projectile.

But what /is/ magic if not some form of energy? It certainly isn't /matter/.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

And? Not every canon is based on personal authorship. (Though she /did/ in fact have creative influence on both the movies and video games, as a matter of fact.) If there has been no canon statement, you can't just make one up out of thin air!

It is Magic. Nothing more and nothing less. It is certantly not energy by Muggle definitions anyway, nor does it require any.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Only in the later ones, and they still turned out poorly. Likely her influence was the same as in the Cursed Child. As in, she signed her name, and asked for money.

#+begin_quote
  and video games, as a matter of fact
#+end_quote

Citation needed. Somehow I doubt that she was glad to introduce things that contradict everything about a spell in before the game's release and after. Or HP games being turned into Call of Duty

#+begin_quote

I can however decide what is more reliable. 7 books directed and writen by the author or some video game that decided that the Disarming sharm is now also the shield charm and some sort of a deflection charm.
