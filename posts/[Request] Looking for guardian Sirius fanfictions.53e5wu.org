Hello, this is my first post to this subreddit and I am in search of some fics where Sirius is Harry's guardian. I've read countless fics where Snape becomes Harry's guardian but I am craving some where Sirius takes on the guardian/parental role. I am not too picky in terms of content as long as the fic is well written, not terribly OOC, and is (preferably) complete or regularly updated.

I am aware that a lot of guardian fics in the HP fandom contain corporal punishment (at least in the ones that I've read, this is always an issue that is at least mentioned, if not a focal point). I don't mind if the fics contain corporal punishment or not.

I look forward to your recommendations!


** Try Innocent series. Good writing up, similar to canon, perhaps a bit annoying. Currently in 3rd year in 4th book. 1st book is pre-Hogwarts where Sirius broke Azkaban & took Guardianship of Harry - Linkffn(Innocent by marauderlover7)

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][The Stealing Harry series]] is a great one for this! Sirius and Remus steal Harry back from the Dursleys when they find out he's being mistreated when Harry's 8. It's Remus/Sirius slash but (if you're not a slash fan) IIRC it's not too graphic and feels very natural. The rest of the series follows Harry at hogwarts. It's a really well done AU.

** The Wise One series is like that. Linkffn(4062601;4423362; 4711743). Book two is probably the weakest of the three; in it Harry annoyingly behaves like he did in canon, despite of very different upbringing and experience. Book one is very nice, if you don't terribly mind lots of OCs and foreign places. In book three, I like the (extremely long) epilogue the best.

** Then there's of course linkffn(A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool). Though I must admit I never was able to finish it, mostly due to extreme length (893kW). Otherwise it is well-written and mostly interesting.

** Sirius is Harry's guardian in Like Brothers, linkffn(11360264) though it isn't necessarily a huge focus of the story. Interesting AU though, where Harry and Draco grow up together and are both sorted into Gryffindor.
