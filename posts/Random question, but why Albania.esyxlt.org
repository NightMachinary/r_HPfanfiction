Helena Ravenclaw went there to hide the Diadem (she was also killed there, along with the Bloody Baron). Tom Riddle obviously went there to retrieve it. Then he hid there after his defeat at Harry's hand. Quirrell went there, Bertha Jorkins went there. Did Voldemort meet Nagini in Albania too, or is that never mentioned?

​

So... why? It seems so random. Is Albania the ground zero of some mighty magical nation? Or some long extinct one? Is there some inherently powerful place there? It seems to be quite a favored destination for wizards, at least British ones, and I dont get why. Voldemort literally crossed Europe as a disembodied spirit just so we can stay there! Is there some lore explaining why? Fan theories? I suppose the Doylist explanation is that Rowling either picked the first nation she saw when she opened a map, or she is merely fond of the place. But in-universe? It seems like such a random and weird place to attract British Wizards.


** Headcanon, so take it as just a theory worth considering.

Helena Ravenclaw stole her mother's diadem and fled South, pursued by the man who loved her (whom she was also fleeing, I believe). Helena hid many places, but the Baron caught up with her in western Byzantium. Helena hid the Diadem there before being murdered by the Baron.

Tom Riddle came to Hogwarts in the 1930's, figured out who Helena really was and talked her into telling him where she hid the diadem. After leaving school, he traveled there to retrieve the artifact. The diadem didn't quite impress him with its powers, so he chose to make it a horcrux, along with another one he'd been preparing along the way (bear with me on this). He made the Diadem and the other object horcruxes, but he decided that Helena was really good at hiding things, so he chose to hide his last horcrux in the same secret place in the mountains.

Riddle brought the Diadem horcrux back to England, as he planned to use it as a trap in Hogwarts.

When Voldemort's body was ripped apart by the protection on Harry Potter, the disembodied spirit was drawn to its last properly-enchanted anchor, all the way back in Albania.

And there it waited.

Quirinus Quirrel stumbled upon the horcrux in Albania and fell under Voldemort's influence. Using the hapless professor as a vessel, Voldemort left the horcrux in Albania while returning to Hogwarts, hoping either to reunite with the Diadem or forge a new body. When Harry Potter once again defeated him, his soul was again drawn back to that last-made horcrux in Albania.

Two years later, Wormtail traced back Quirrel's path and found the Albanian horcrux again. Attempting to correct his previous mistake, Voldemort had Wormtail assist him in remaking that horcrux into a mobile platform (Nagini) and then concoct another usable body for his eventual restoration.

**** The last bit may be out of order, but the essence is that Riddle realized that he'd be drawn back to that horcrux, so rather than leaving it in Albania again, he brought it along and made it independently mobile.

The reason I came up with this headcanon/theory was to explain why if Voldemort could linger around any of his horcruxes, why he wouldn't have stayed in Gringott's and possessed a goblin, or showed up at Malfoy Manor and demand that Lucius arrange for a new body for him. If, on the other hand, a complication of making multiple horcruxes is that you're stuck lingering near your last anchor when you don't have a working body, his actions in the background of the books makes more sense.

At least to me.

******** The diadem horcrux is in the Room of Requirement. My headcanon/theory suggests that another horcrux was made that was later converted into Nagini somehow (or maybe just fused to her). Voldemort also mentioned in the Little Hangleton graveyard that he had many different measures he'd taken to ensure his immortality. Some people ascribe his becoming inhuman to the making of his horcruxes, but I think he just wanted to not be burdened by human frailties, and mutated his body over time to take on more snake-like abilities.

********* In my opinion is your theory far too complex and complete unneccery, it is more likely that he chose albania because he was there before when he created the horcrux. He didn't seek anyone out because he was afraid they betray him.

** They have a mountain range called the accursed mountains. One of the last truly wild places in Europe (and amazingly beautiful).

Perhaps to Rowling (and Enembee who wrote Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone), the forest is a huge magical place similar to the Forbidden Forest. A place few magicals live as it's wild and untamable.

** Albania is the litainization of the Gaelic name for Scotland, Alba. High chance it's not actually modern day country of Albania in the Balkans.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania_(placename][Wiki]])

SuperCarlinBrothers made a video explaining it as well.

**** Scotland was referred to Alba/Abania/Glen during the time Rowena Ravevenclaw and the other founders lived. Likewise the country of Albania wasn't established and would be apart of the Byzantine Empire, thus not referred to as Albania. The video I linked explains it in further detail.

****** It's just a fan theory. I remembered them making a video about it and wanted to share. By your own arguement, you can't claim that Glen doesn't refer to Scotland. Even if she wasn't from Scotland, it would be more likely for her to travel north a bit to Scotland than across Europe to modern day Albania.

** The post [[/u/5919821077131829]] linked below is, no doubt, the most likely interpretation when it comes to "serious" literary exegesis. For fanfic purposes, though, I like to think that the Forests of Albania are, generally, a haven for Dark Magic in general, perhaps because the government of magical Albania's ideas about Dark Magic are more along the lines of Durmstrang's, and that as such, it's where /all/ wizards and magical beings with something to hide tend to go.
