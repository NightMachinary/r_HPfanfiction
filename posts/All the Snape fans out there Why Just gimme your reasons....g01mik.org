***** Goody, I get to copy/paste this again.

Let's end this obsession theory forever.

We have three interactions between Snape and Lily from the time they're not children. In one, he says they're "supposed to be friends", and she confirms. Interestingly, she does accuse him of obsessing - over Potter and his mates, so not over her. In interaction 2, he calls her a mudblood, in interaction 3, he attempts to apologize. At no point does he ask her out or say she owes him anything or act entitled to her, unless apologizing is an act of entitlement. Further, Harry goes through his potions book with a fine tooth comb, and nowhere does he find a scribble of her initials or anything like that.

Sirius and Lupin, meanwhile, as adults, never say Snape tried to pursue Lily or stalked her, or that they ever spoke, including in the context of listing reasons why Snape was jealous of James. You KNOW they would have. When she asked him to, he left her alone.

Then she is put in the crossfire. Well, wanting someone not to die is not obsessive. I know people read a lot into Dumbledore's "you disgust me" comment, but that comment only proves that Dumbles is manipulative.

Then she dies anyway. Snape is feeling expressly suicidal, as many non-obsessive people do when someone they love dies and it's their fault. Dumbledore leverages his guilt into recruiting him to spy. He proceeds to keep his love/"obsession" a secret from everyone but Dumbles for 17 years, and in fact talks a lot about James, so it still looks like his obsessions are toward those he hates.

People say the "always" line is obsessive. Nope. If Dumbles had to ask "after all this time", then clearly Snape very much shut up about Lily even when speaking to him. People say it's obsessive that he stole the letter and the picture. Having one lousy souvenir of a dead loved one isn't obsessive. As for tearing the photo up, ofc he won't walk around with a picture of James. Ofc he won't carry a letter that says "dear Padfoot." So in summation, no evidence of obsession in his behavior, only of love, remorse, guilt, and grief.

Magical evidence: the Patronus is a symbol of positive feelings, not obsession, unless Harry was obsessed with his dead dad and wanted to bang him. Further: he managed to hide his "obsession" from a mindreader, Voldemort. Obsessions are something you can't control by definition. You /KNOW/ Voldy questioned him about that, probably in a way that involved torture, since Snape asked him to spare her, thus directly causing his first downfall. When Harry occludes Voldy successfully for the first time, it is at a moment of grief, and love - over Dobby. Was Harry obsessed with Dobby? No. He felt responsible for the little guy's death though. Snape's unequalled talent for occlumency should prove that he loved and grieved Lily which is precisely the thing Voldy can't access and understand.

The author herself denied that Snape was obsessive, but frankly, even if she had said he was, what she wrote is very different. It also makes no sense that the big reveal and Voldy's downfall is because of some obsessive incel who wanted to bang Lily, in a CHILDREN'S BOOK about the power of love.

Let's stop talking about the supposed obsession forever and instead wonder why fans cannot wrap their heads around any explanation of anything that isn't gross and irrelevant.

***** So... because of double standards and poor reading comprehension?

Unlike McGonagall, Snape doesn't drag a student around by the ear while screaming at him (PS), he doesn't repeatedly endanger students' lives and turn them into targets of bullying (PS, PoA), and he doesn't allow a kid who's just been tortured to be dragged away by his torturer (GoF).

Unlike Hagrid, he doesn't repeatedly put children in mortal danger for his own benefit (PS,CoS, GoF, OotP), he doesn't threaten a visibly traumatised child with more torture (GoF), he doesn't laugh while watching students get hurt (GoF), or blame 11 y.o. children for getting hurt by his beasts (PS).

Yet you only ever see "McGonagall is such a Queen, Yaaaas" posts, calling her a ~lioness who protects her cubs, when she's actually the Gryffindors' #1 enemy. And of course, people think Harry should have named his child Rubeus, calling him a father figure, when Harry was the one who had to constantly clean up after him. By PoA, Hermione seems to like Hagrid more than Harry does.

As for the second part - yes, Snape went to Dumbledore (which was a prison/death sentence) for Lily. By the end of the books his main motivation is to save as many people as possible, and he risks his cover and his life for that purpose (which is why the idea that he was "playing both sides" is embarrassing).

Yet you never see posts whinging about Dumbledore giving up his desire to be a tyrant solely because he possibly killed his sister while he was shooting lethal spells /at his own brother/ (and because his boyfriend dumped him and ran away; if he'd stayed behind, it's possible Grindelwald might have convinced Dumbledore to carry on).

How does he teach? In potions, one of the most dangerous classes in Hogwarts. A class where one person's mistakes can endanger EVERYONE in the classroom. Does he teach properly? Fuck no. "Instructions are on the board. Begin." And then he stalks around the classroom, and stands behind people he doesn't like until they mess up (most often caused by him doing that) and screaming at them. Which often makes the mistake even bigger. Then, you have the kids from HIS OWN GODDAMN HOUSE throwing shit everywhere, which can set off an explosive reaction. Does he do anything to change this? Fuck no. He blames a completely irrelevant person.

In fact, Snape has endangered more kids in his tenure as a Potions "Professor" than Dumbledore ever did with his harebrained schemes.

Then there's the whole Slytherin vs Gryffindor thing in which Snape is there handing out free gasoline and matches to his own house members.

#+end_quote

Oh, God, not the Boggart nonsense again. Dean's Boggart is a hand, which confirms hands went overboard with Dean! Hermione's Boggart is failing her exam, which proves she's a sociopath who cares more about exams than she does about the deaths of her family. And Ron is more afraid of spiders, despite the fact that, just a few months prior, his little sister had almost been murdered by Voldemort's spirit - what a jerk!

No.

In-universe explanation: the Boggart turns into whatever is on that person's mind at that moment; Snape had just told Neville he is an incompetent student, so Neville's thinking of Snape. This also explains why not a single child has a serious fear - they're told to think of scary things, and their minds jump to normal, ridiculous fears (a mean teacher, a banshee, something from a horror movies, and so on).

Neville, who is a poor student, defeats his Boggart on the first try... because he's not actually afraid. Harry struggles with his the entire year, and Molly can't defeat hers in OotP.

Out-of-universe explanation: the whole point of that scene is that Harry is a marked child, who, unlike everyone else (including Neville), has a mature, very serious fear, because of the way his destiny is intertwined with Voldemort's. And, of course, Snape-in-drag was obviously supposed to be comedic relief, not a call to arms for kids who think being told they're shit students is "abusive".

Boggarts also represent deeper issues - Hermione's fear is failure and being proven as unworthy of being in the magical world (failing one's exams leads to expulsion and having your wand broken), Harry's fear is fear, and Neville's fear is being inadequate (which can be represented by any teacher, since he's stated to fear all, except Sprout, in GoF), because of his family - his grandmother constantly compares him, negatively, to his father (and even forces him to use his wand), and his uncle risked dropping him out of the window rather than having a Squib nephew.

In any case, if you want actual cases of Neville being ~tortured~:

#+begin_quote
  Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done? [...] the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years. From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated.

  [...]

  They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted. [...] Well, think again, boy---it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece.” At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. [...] Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him.
#+end_quote

Compare it to:

#+begin_quote
  Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.”

  Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically.
#+end_quote

Neville's classmates and Neville himself think fearing Snape is ridiculous, and list him among such fears as:

#+begin_quote
  “Did you see me take that banshee?” shouted Seamus.

  “And the hand!” said Dean, waving his own around.

  “And Snape in that hat!”

  “And my mummy!”
#+end_quote

The more disturbing thing is that Lupin had everyone face a Boggart in public, despite the truly horrendous things that could have popped out, if the children had realistic fears, like a relative who molested them. And having Neville engage in a public humiliation of Snape shows a lack of professional ethics, and is a great way to put a target on Neville's back.

******* I think you need to calm down and not begin your posts with "Did you even read the books?", when all of your "arguments" are completely made up.

#+begin_quote
  A class where one person's mistakes can endanger EVERYONE in the classroom. Does he teach properly? Fuck no.
#+end_quote

Actually, yes, considering there are exactly zero serious incidents, over 5 years, despite his class containing hopeless students like Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. There are 2 incidents that involve someone getting hurt, but I'll get to those later.

#+begin_quote
  "Instructions are on the board. Begin." And then he stalks around the classroom, and stands behind people he doesn't like until they mess up (most often caused by him doing that) and screaming at them. Which often makes the mistake even bigger.
#+end_quote

Do you have any source for that? Other than Tumblr/Twitter posts? Because in the official version of the books, Snape doesn't go around screaming at students, he speaks "softer"/"quieter" the angrier he gets (and the reason behind that would make for an interesting topic of discussion, but not with people who are still stuck in the "Snape is a big meanie because 11 y.o. Harry thought so" phase). You might be confusing him with McGonagall, she does a lot of yelling. He also doesn't "stand behind people until they mess up."

Also, do I need to explain third person, subjective narration? That's not how Snape teaches, that's how Harry, perceives it. /I/ actually have sources for that statement: in CoS, Hermione mentions that Snape explained the brewing of Polyjuice Potion to them, and Harry and Ron literally say they "have better things to do than listen to Snape". Similarly, Snape says "did I not explain that you have to..."

And the fact that his students get excellent results on their OWLs speaks for itself.

#+begin_quote
  Then, you have the kids from HIS OWN GODDAMN HOUSE throwing shit everywhere, which can set off an explosive reaction.
#+end_quote

You realise that posting a false statement in caps doesn't make it true, yes? Or are you genuinely worked up about something that you invented yourself?

As I mentioned earlier, there are 2 incidents where someone is hurt in Potions class: during the first lesson, when /Neville/ hurts himself, and potentially others, by not paying attention, and during the second year, /when Harry himself blows up a Slytherin's cauldron/ in order to create a diversion for Hermione, so she can steal the ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion. /Harry's little stunt gets several Slytherin students hurt./

Should Snape have punished the Trio severely for that entire incident, especially after he found out they did it in order to brew an illegal potion? Absolutely, but then Snape's lenient like that. He docks Ron five points for physically attacking Draco, and he only assigns cleaning or office work as detention, even when the crime includes publicly insulting and yelling at him, or /butchering Draco/.

If you think he should have taken a page from McGonagall's book, and sent them to find an evil monster... sure, why not. Sadly, Snape is too concerned with student safety, as evidenced by the fact that he's usually the first on the scene when someone cries out for help (as seen, for example, in OotP).

#+begin_quote
  In fact, Snape has endangered more kids in his tenure as a Potions "Professor" than Dumbledore ever did with his harebrained schemes.
#+end_quote

Once again, I'll have to ask for a legitimate source. Meanwhile, I'll point you to the fact that Charms class is repeatedly described as a chaotic disaster, where the professor himself ends up being used as target practice, and Transfiguration class, which involves mutilating animals, also involves students practising spells /on themselves/. Harry messes up his face, in HBP, and McGonagall doesn't even notice.

#+begin_quote
  Then there's the whole Slytherin vs Gryffindor thing in which Snape is there handing out free gasoline and matches to his own house members.
#+end_quote

You know I'll ask for a source for that, too. Other than Malfoy making snide comments behind Snape's back, the same as Harry and Ron, the Slytherins don't cause any problems during Potions class. Meanwhile, Harry and Ron, in addition to exploding the Slytherins' cauldrons, injuring them in the process, also throw expensive ingredients at their face, risking another potions disaster (PoA).

I can provide exact page numbers for each and every statement. I expect you to provide, at the very least, the book where you claim each incident happened, and details of the scene, so I can search for it.

Do I even need proof for this? Every time Malfoy said mudblood, walked right up to them and instigated, threw the first spell, etc. Even in full view of Snape, he doesn't do anything. If anything, he'll punish the Gryffindors and leave it at that. Not to mention the simply obscene ways he deducts points for the most asinine of reasons. This further ignites the house rivalry. It says "Hey, do whatever the hell you want, I'll cover you!"

Here's one directly in Potions class that directly effected Harry's grade.

/He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise; Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around again. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and Snape was watching him with a look of gloating pleasure. “Whoops,” he said softly. “Another zero, then, Potter . . .” OoTF: ch29 page 661/

Again, this is a "pick on Snape" thread. The other teachers are bad too. Except for Sprout. She was one of the best teachers in my opinion. McGonagal was bad to EVERYONE and overreacts, Flitwick couldn't even spot his own students collectively bullying one of his own. Sprout? The only really "bad" thing I remember was her being "slightly colder" to him after his name came out of the goblet.

#+end_quote

Once again, you prove that Snape goes around teaching students what to do, and that he /doesn't/ scream at them to provoke them into making a mistake. He makes a sound of anger *after* Neville makes a mistake that endangers everyone. Here's an actual example of screaming and physical violence:

#+begin_quote
  Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear. “Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you---” “You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming---he's got a dragon!” “What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on---I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” (PS, Ch.14)
#+end_quote

(Does she apologise when it turns out he wasn't lying? Nope.)

#+begin_quote
  If a student from any other house did that, Snape would have been on top of them trying to get them expelled for "endangering everybody yadda yadda yadda".
#+end_quote

Setting aside that Draco was doing it behind Snape's back (who, at that moment, was "prowling" and instructing students), it's disingenous to compare it with the disaster that follows, and which Snape /doesn't/ punish the Trio for.

#+begin_quote
  Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate. [...]Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed up lips
#+end_quote

And, no, actually, Snape would not ask for them to be expelled:

#+begin_quote
  Ron finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor.
#+end_quote

Ron throwing a large, likely expensive ingredient straight at Draco's face is more visible /and/ more dangerous than Draco flicking puffer-fish eyes.

#+begin_quote
  There's a difference between gross negligence, a class having necessary/accidental risks, and a teacher being overwhelmed by the student population.
#+end_quote

You're right, and Snape would fall, at most, in the last category - the two incidents happen because he goes around the classroom, giving individual instructions, so he can't keep an eye on everyone at the same time.

On the other hand, McGonagall and Hagrid actively endanger students, by knowingly placing them in potentially lethal situations (PS-OotP). And here's a bit of Hagrid's classes (these are 2 different days):

#+begin_quote
  “Look like they're havin' fun, don' they?” Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren't; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts' ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.

  [...] Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear. (GoF)
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  /Then there's the whole Slytherin vs Gryffindor thing in which Snape is there handing out free gasoline and matches to his own house members./

  Do I even need proof for this? Every time Malfoy said mudblood, walked right up to them and instigated, threw the first spell, etc. Even in full view of Snape, he doesn't do anything.
#+end_quote

You said Snape instigates these incidents, so yes, you need to back that claim up. Funnily enough, Malfoy /tries/ to throw the first spell once, in GoF, and the consequence is that he gets *tortured* by Moody, until he's crying in pain, then McGonagall lets Moody drag him away for more punishing.

McGonagall does absolutely nothing about the Gryffindors' behaviour, which includes drugging and impersonating Slytherins (CoS), attacking them repeatedly (Ron physically attacks Draco in PS, and Snape docks 5 points, then he /tries to do it again in CoS, right under Snape's nose, and Snape doesn't even deduct any points, probably because Draco had just been talking badly about Hermione/), and even attempted murder (Fred and George lock Montague in the Vanishing Cabinet and tell nobody about it).

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention the simply obscene ways he deducts points for the most asinine of reasons.
#+end_quote

They're actually quite normal reasons - being late to class, being outright disrespectful (up to and including screaming at Snape and calling him names), reading a magazine in class, attacking other students, etc. And he usually docks relatively small amounts (5/10 pts). Compare it to McGonagall docking Angelina 5 points for yelling at Harry during recess.

#+begin_quote
  Here's one directly in Potions class that directly effected Harry's grade.
#+end_quote

That is, indeed, the one time Snape spoils Harry's grade. Considering it happened immediately after Harry had grossly violated Snape's privacy and endangered his life by sticking his head in the Pensieve (everything Harry sees, Voldemort sees), I... struggle to care. It's childish, absolutely, but not any more than Hagrid guilt-tripping the Trio, in HBP, for dropping his class. Other than that, considering Harry expected an E for that potion, it means Snape usually assigns him fair grades (Hermione even comments, in OotP, on one incident where Snape was "unfair" to Harry, suggesting that he otherwise is).

#+begin_quote
  Again, this is a "pick on Snape" thread. The other teachers are bad too.

There only are "pick on Snape" threads. If you apply the same standard uniformly, Hagrid and McGonagall are monsters, yet you never see posts criticising them - they're used as positive examples, and their abuses get downplayed. I agree that Sprout is one of the nice professors, but just for the fun of applying the same Outrage Standard to her - she has young children raise, then butcher sentient, anthropomorphic plants, which seems emotionally abusive; she also ignores students getting physically hurt:

  “You're lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Neville's already got his first pod!” They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.

#+begin_quote
  That he wasn't in the room at all, and the examiners not allowing any of the usual petty crap that goes on in class stands out more.
#+end_quote

Knowledge of potions does not suddenly pop up in their heads in his absence. Accustoming students to working under pressure seems to produce results, though. At least 10/28 students get an O, and Harry and Ron, who are not brilliant students, manage to get Es. Why? Because Snape, with his harsh and demanding manner, has them overachieving. Even the classroom slackers get dragged forward, which is why his students are "advanced for their level".

Snape gets the students studying and paying enough attention, that there are zero serious incidents (outside of the one intentionally provoked by Harry), and he's the only one who seems to care about the students' safety.

  Once again, you prove that Snape goes around teaching students what to do, and that he /doesn't/ scream at them to provoke them into making a mistake. He makes a sound of anger *after* Neville makes a mistake that endangers everyone. Here's an actual example of screaming and physical violence:
#+end_quote

Ummmm... He knew exactly where it went wrong. Like he was watching for a mistake to happen. And then didn't he punish someone else for not stopping him? What was his job and function again? Teaching and keeping students safe.

​

#+begin_quote
  They're actually quite normal reasons
#+end_quote

“That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.” /CoS ch9 page 172/

Ummmm, isn't he the head of house for the cunning? "You broke a social rule, so I'm deducting points because I'm a cunt!" Sure, that might have been a somewhat maybe valid reason to deduct points, but then he deducts points for something stupid. If they actually challenged the point deduction it would get retracted. Why is he the leader of the cunning again? Oh right, he got his job because he's a spy and not because of his qualifications.

/“Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.”/\\
/“He's just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. “Wonder what's wrong with his leg?” PS ch11 page 132/221/

Intentionally misinterpreting a rule to use it against them. I can see that actually being a rule, but used that way? They were still on the school grounds. Otherwise the rule would be "leave the castle".

​

#+begin_quote
  you said Snape instigates these incidents
#+end_quote

/“Let's see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it'll be a week's worth of detentions.” GoF ch18 page 300/ Right after he insults Hermione and Harry AND Malfoy curse each other.

By him not putting a stopper to it, he is in fact instigating it. You have the Slytherin Quidditch Team who cheats so badly it's actually a health liability to play against them. Slytherin members cursing people. Slytherin members instigating loudly in plain view of everyone. And then when someone says something back, Snape swoops in and deducts points, punishments, etc.

​

This is enabling, and it instigated them to continue this route.

​

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, because academic sabotage is okay because Harry violated his privacy after Snape violated his for weeks in that sham of what he called "Occlumency Lessons". And if his life was so important, he would have taken the care to actually store it properly.

/They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn't get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away./ PoA ch16 page 318

Yes, because that clearly deserves a zero. It's like there aren't any other grades between a zero and a pass... Weird, that.

Ummmm it's established, repeatedly, that Snape can tell what went wrong with a potion, based on its colour, consistency, and so on. You know, on account of being a potions genius. Which is why he also knew that Neville's potion wouldn't harm Trevor, for example.

Docking Harry 1 point was petty, absolutely.

Ummmm, docking points from a student who spoke out of turn /three times/, after being repeatedly told to settle down, is absolutely normal. Teaching children to follow social rules is... one of the most important duties of parents, primarily, and teachers, secondarily. I wish someone had taught you not to use gendered insults, for example.

Being a "know-it-all" is not a good thing - it means a person who thinks they know more than anyone, and flaunt it. Which was exactly Hermione's behaviour in that scene - the others argue that they haven't studied the subject yet, but she starts speaking, despite being told to shut up twice, because she's desperate to show she's smarter than everyone.

#+end_quote

First of all, you need to learn the difference between not doing anything, and instigating. Unless you're arguing that McGonagall is instigating the twins to test experimental substances on 11 y.o. kids, and to murder Slytherins. In fact, the worst behaviour, as far as we're shown, comes from Gryffindor, from the Marauders to Ginny and Harry randomly hexing people.

Second of all, please provide some examples of Snape swooping in and deducting points, assigning punishments, etc.

Third of all, he literally stops it:

#+begin_quote
  “And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly voice. Snape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, Explain.”
#+end_quote

And he /doesn't/ dock points from anyone for the duel. He would have actually let Harry get away with mutilating Goyle. The points he docks are for Harry and Ron screaming and cursing at him, and he only docks 25 points each.

Also, the Slytherin girls laugh at Hermione behind Snape's back, and in PoA, Draco makes sure to taunt Harry and Ron when Snape isn't looking, so they expect some sort of punishment for doing so.

And since you bring up Quidditch - McGonagall breaks school rules to put Harry on the team and buy him the fastest broom, she disregards his safety, in PoA, specifically because she wants to win the Quidditch Cup, and she does absolutely nothing about Lee Jordan's completely inappropriate commentary.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, because academic sabotage is okay because Harry violated his privacy after Snape violated his for weeks in that sham of what he called "Occlumency Lessons". And if his life was so important, he would have taken the care to actually store it properly.
#+end_quote

"Academic sabotage"? Get a grip. But it's interesting that you're more incensed by Harry's grade (which is irrelevant, since jobs are based on OWLs, where Harry gets a good score thanks to Snape's usual exigency), than by the outright abuses going on. That's totally not hypocritical at all!

And the idea that Snape violated Harry's privacy, when Harry consented to the lessons, is... amazing. Snape was forced into giving him Occlumency lessons (which was a terrible idea anyway, because he couldn't have justified the success of the lessons to Voldemort), had to let his trigger rummage around his mind, and wasn't even angry about Harry seeing Snape's mother getting beaten by his father, or about Harry physically harming him. Since Harry agreed to the lessons, Snape wasn't violating anything. Harry sticking his nose in the Pensieve, knowing that it contained memories Snape wanted to keep private is a tremendous violation of Snape's privacy.

And what the hell are you even arguing anymore? That Snape was suicidal, so he left out the Pensieve on purpose? That Harry was justified to stick his nose in it? I hope you never accidentally forget a window open, and some criminal comes in through it and murders you. It would obviously be your fault, no?

#+begin_quote
  Yes, because that clearly deserves a zero. It's like there aren't any other grades between a zero and a pass... Weird, that.
#+end_quote

Except he didn't give him a zero, since Harry finished the year with no issues. Or, if he did give him a zero, he must have also given him very high grades, that ended up compensating for it. And Harry also thinks Snape looks disappointed that he couldn't murder/expel him, because, remember, third person subjective. In any case, the fact that this is the level of "evidence" you have to resort to should make it clear you're not right.

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an “E.”
#+end_quote

Harry expects a very good grade when he turns in a decent potion.

#+begin_quote
  No, but being able to actually work without his Greasiness stalking around, criticizing, and whatnot does. And actually being graded fairly.
#+end_quote

"His Greasiness"? Really? I thought it couldn't get worse than unsubstantiated statements and gendered insults, but...

In HBP, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are left to brew with zero criticism, and in Harry's case, with excessive praise. Harry can't do anything without Snape's instructions, Ron is disastrous, and Hermione, for the first time ever, can't successfully complete a potions. Draco, who is a competent brewer, also suffers.

#+begin_quote
  Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand. Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie's potion and passed on to Ron's with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron's cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly. [...] Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry. [...] The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something that looked like cat sick over himself.
#+end_quote

But this weird notion that criticism is bad must explain why some western countries are reduced to importing brainpower from countries where children aren't allowed to insult teachers and slap their own parents around.

That's setting aside the fact that... you have yet to produce an actual example of Snape seriously favouring the Slytherins.

Also, heads of houses favouring their own students, to a certain extent, is reasonable, considering that they're supposed to be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housemaster][parental stand-ins]]. McGonagall sociopathically punishing the children in her care is not something praise-worthy, it's a reason for the parents to lynch her.

And in fact, outside of Sprout, none of the other adults should be in that school. McGonnagal and Flitwick can't even do their Head of House job properly, Hagrid can't understand that students aren't sturdy like he is, Filch is redundant in a school full of elves, Trelawney is the definition of Asperger's, and Dumbledore can't not think of children of chess pieces.

#+end_quote

By that logic, all heads of house /and/ Dumbledore instigate bullying and abuse. Dumbledore more than anyone else, considering he should be impartial.

And yet, if you compare the actions of the Gryffindors with those of the Slytherins, Gryffindors are actually the more aggressive and dangerous ones (find one instance of a Slytherin student casually and intentionally endangering someone else's life; HBP Draco excluded, because at that point Draco's story is no longer about being the token jerk and Harry's nemesis). And while intra-house bullying is a big issue in Gryffindor and Ravenclaw (the main thing that a head of house should be working to prevent, yet in Gryffindor is actively encouraged by McGonagall), we see no cases of bullying among Slytherins.

So Snape actually seems to have the tightest hold on his house, together with Sprout. Even Hufflepuffs aren't saints, considering they take part in bullying Harry in PS, they're very vocal about suspecting Harry in CoS, they (and Sprout) treat him nastily in GoF, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, like a group of kids will understand that. That just screams "I'm docking you points because you are Potter and Company and not Slytherin."
#+end_quote

So... they shouldn't have been punished at all? 14 is the age of criminal responsibility in a large part of the world, "I didn't know it's bad to curse and yell at my teacher" doesn't work as a defence. If anything, the truly disturbing part in that whole scene is Harry's reaction:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces. [...] Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things happening to him... If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse... he'd have Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching...
#+end_quote

These thoughts border on sociopathy, but are honestly one of the few cases where you can see the damage inflicted on him by the Dursleys. So, at least they're realistic.

#+begin_quote
  But savoring the fact that you get to do it, snarling it at them like they are lower than a bug?
#+end_quote

Yeah, Snape really sounds like he has fun around Neville. No, he's obviously frustrated by Neville's incompetency, the same way McGonagall is, and a snarl is an expression of anger, not of disdain. The only time he seems to enjoy himself is when he puts Harry in his place, since in his mind, Harry deserves it, and he also thinks his words don't affect Harry at all (as per Snape's discussion with Sirius in OotP).

#+begin_quote
  “Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can't even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!” Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus.
#+end_quote

McG does the exact same thing, down to being described using an animal sound, but Harry likes her and actually agrees that Neville is a disaster, so he doesn't focus on it, or the effect of that comment on Neville. If Snape had said that, we would have gotten a detailed description of Neville turning red, shaking, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Please, you are using Slughorn of all people to prove your point? He's the exact same and opposite of Snape. Except instead of anger, he treats kids he doesn't like with indifference.

Yes, because he's the only other Potions professor and Slytherin head of house... Under him, Tom Riddle flourishes, children are groomed for the Death Eaters, a nepotism scheme that excludes Muggle-borns (and the "wrong" kind of pure-blood) from important positions is in place, and good Potions students like Hermione and Draco languish.

Under Snape, who actually has to maintain the illusion of directly working for Voldemort, no Slytherin children are drafted into the Death Eaters, except the ones whose parents are DEs themselves, we don't hear of Slytherins attacking other students, a Muggle-born has the highest grades and receives no criticism regarding her work, and students overachieve.

#+begin_quote

In any case, if we're suddenly applying real life standards to a children's book about magic...I have never heard of a teacher getting sacked for losing a student's homework. McGonagall and Hagrid would be rotting in jail, though, for sending children in a forest, alone, or for setting wild animals on them.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was Told (that capital T denotes how little choice he had in the matter) he was doing the lessons.
#+end_quote

By Dumbledore. Snape was also Told this. So, at most, you can argue that Dumbledore violated their privacy. Except, if Harry hadn't thought he knew better, and had actually tried to learn (which he didn't, because he didn't want to lose the connection to Voldemort), Sirius wouldn't have died.

#+begin_quote
  And if you can seriously say that Snape was doing his best to teach Harry Occlumency and not cause him pain and dig around for dirt? You are mistaken. OotF ch37 Dumbledore apology.
#+end_quote

Snape definitely wasn't trying to cause pain or "dig around for dirt". In fact, during the Occlumency lessons, he is at his most serious and open with Harry, and displays a certain level of contentment at Harry managing to defend himself. Still, the lessons were doomed to fail because of the bad blood between the two, and because of Harry's desire to keep the connection to Voldemort open. /That's/ what Dumbledore apologises for - if he'd taught Harry personally, Harry would have been much more receptive.

#+begin_quote
  He looked up at Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist. There was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark.

  “Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex?” asked Snape coolly.

  “No,” said Harry bitterly, getting up from the floor.

  “I thought not,” said Snape, watching him closely. “You let me get in too far. You lost control.” [...] “Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,” said Snape, raising his wand once more. “You managed to stop me eventually, though you wasted time and energy shouting. You must remain focused. Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand.”

  “I'm trying,” said Harry angrily, “but you're not telling me how!”

  “Manners, Potter,” said Snape dangerously. “Now, I want you to close your eyes.”

  Harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told. He did not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while Snape faced him, carrying a wand.

  “Clear your mind, Potter,” said Snape's cold voice. “Let go of all emotion...”

  But Harry's anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins like venom. Let go of his anger? He could as easily detach his legs...

  “You're not doing it, Potter... you will need more discipline than this... focus, now...”

  Harry tried to empty his mind, tried not to think, or remember, or feel...

  “Let's go again... on the count of three... one---two---three---Legilimens!”
#+end_quote

Snape isn't bothered by Harry hurting him, and even says he didn't do terribly, then he explains exactly what Harry should do. But Harry is filled with anger (it's his main feeling in OotP, after all) and hatred towards Snape, so he can't clear his mind. Funnily enough, if the lessons had continued after SWM, I think Harry would have actually been more receptive. But no way would Snape have trusted him anymore, at that point.

#+begin_quote
  And last, I'm done arguing over Snape. I don't even like Canon. I had to suspend my disbelief while reading it.

Honestly, I think the problem is that you're reading canon from a very biased perspective. You should try re-reading the books while having the context in mind (children's series+coming-of-age story, which automatically implies incompetent adults; mystery series, which means there has to be a red herring in every book; boarding school in the 90s, which actually meant caning and rape, etc.), which should greatly enhance your enjoyment.

**** Mental abuse is a much more serious issue and so is teen suicide; Harry was never close to being suicidal and if he was it was never because of Snape. Mental abuse consists of more than sarcastic remarks and mild punishments, there are people in life who won't like you for reasons that have nothing to do with you. Not kissing Harry's ass isn't abusive in and of itself.

It's not Snape fault that in Harry's life, adults have either abused him or fawned over him to the point that it was hard for him to tell abuse apart from general and non-criminal, non-evil dislike. It's indirectly Snape's fault, of course, that Harry is not just a kid but also a symbol which means that people fawned over Harry from the moment he set foot in the wizarding world and so any adult who disliked him could be presumed to want him dead and be evil. In actual fact, disliking Harry is perfectly understandable even if you're not Snape, who also has his own reasons.

If you read my post again you'll see that I've acknowledged that Harry /was/ abused at home, by the Dursleys.

Snape does not mention James once in PS or in COS. He mentions James to harry twice in POA, not once during GOF, once in OOTP, and twice in HBP. Except the one time in OOTP, James and his various flaws were relevant to what was going on. Harry never felt worthless because of Snape, he felt like Snape was unfair to him, and hated him. Ideally, Snape wouldn't have been teaching walking trigger Harry James Potter, but protecting walking trigger Harry James Potter required him to. I'm not denying that this was highly unpleasant for Harry, I'm saying Snape wasn't abusive and that their relationship was doomed because of each one's respective traumas; keep up.

Ask your psychologist friend what she thinks about McGonagall, Hagrid, Lupin, Dumbledore, Trelawney, and Slughorn, who between them have committed multiple acts of emotional abuse, neglect, physical abuse, and exploitation.

Again, I never denied that Snape hurts Harry. I argued that his behavior, unkind and unpleasant as it is, is not abusive, and /if/ Harry (and Neville) experience it as such, it's because of previous abuse they've suffered at the hands of people who should have loved them unconditionally.

I agree, the way McGonagall strong-arms Harry into playing Quidditch without asking him if he'd like to play, and just assumes he'll love it because James did, is horrible! The way Dumbledore manipulates Harry using his parents' memory into sacrificing himself is outright evil (except that it was actually Harry's best chance of survival, but whatever, Harry certainly didn't know it at the time of walking willingly toward certain death)! The way Slughorn whines to Harry about how bad it was for /Slughorn/ to lose Lily was pathetic!

This one is one of my favorite arguments, it's just so stupid.

Snape did not know he will be Dumbledore's killer before the summer between OOTP and HBP. By this point he had already risked himself to protect Harry multiple times. When Dumbledore summoned Snape after he had gotten /himself/ nearly killed, Snape could have simply done nothing and taken credit for finishing Dumbledore off. When he did find out he'll have to kill Dumbledore, he didn't want to. But even if this was somehow part of some grand scheme, he was only playing both sides from the moment he killed Dumbledore. Except even this is ridiculous.

A) Why send Harry the Silver Doe and lead him to the real sword of Gryffindor?

He could have simply done nothing.

B) Why follow Dumbledore's plan to the letter? In case you've forgotten, Dumbledore's plan was as follows:

#+begin_quote
  There will come a time when *Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.*”\\
  “For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.\\
  “Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, *then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.*”\\
  [...]\\
  “So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly.\\
  “*And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus*. That is essential.”
#+end_quote

Snape prevents others from killing Harry:

#+begin_quote
  “*No!” roared Snape's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started*; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, “Have you forgotten our orders? *Potter belongs to the Dark Lord --- we are to leave him! Go! Go!”*
#+end_quote

Snape must have fed Voldemort that line, or at least manipulated Voldemort's arrogance so that he'll continue to insist on killing Harry himself, even though he is the one person who /cannot/ kill Harry. Preventing them from torturing Harry was just a cover-blowing moment, though.

Voldemort himself:

#+begin_quote
  “I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”
#+end_quote

Snape follows Dumbledore's plan exactly:

#+begin_quote
  “I have thought long and hard, Severus. . . . Do you know why I have called you back from the battle?”

  And for a moment Harry saw Snape's profile: *His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage.*“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. *Let me find Potter.*”
#+end_quote

He also did not tell Voldemort that he is /not/ the master of the Elder Wand; we know how that worked out for him (not very well). But, say he hadn't died. Say he hadn't died, and Harry hadn't returned from the dead to clear his name. In this scenario, Snape looks like #1 Death Eater, Dumbledore's killer, who opened the Gates of Hogwarts to let Voldemort in. Rather than playing both sides, that's how you buy yourself a Dementor's kiss, or if you're lucky, death by raging mob.

Had he chosen to simply do none of that after killing Dumbledore, Voldemort would have won, and Snape would have had a very nice life.

********** From the book:

“All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,” said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, “wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner . . . and I think I have the answer.” Snape did not speak. “Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.” “My Lord ---” “The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.” “My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand. “It cannot be any other way,” said Voldemort. “I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.”

Snape might not be aware that he's not the master of the wand because Draco had gained mastery of it before Snape killed Dumbledore, but he does know that Dumbledore planned his death and Snape had never defeated him and won the wand from him. He chose to be murdered rather than inform Voldemort that the wand is not his, and will not serve him.

********* I just wanna address one of your points- I'm too tired to do the rest:

#+begin_quote
  Neville's boggart is meaningless. Lupin singles Harry out as a student with a serious fear that needs to be addressed individually and with extreme caution, not Neville. Neville defeats his boggart on his first try, just like the others, who fear nonsensical things.
#+end_quote

1. Lupin singled out Harry because his Boggart could actually inflict physical damage to him. Harry's Bogart- the Dementor, could not be repelled by the Ridiculous Charm because he had Dementoric effects on Harry. Also, Harry needed to know how to cast the Patronus because plot device. Also, don't you think the fact that Lupin was one of Harry's parents' best friends may be a factor in the attention he gave Harry's Bogart?\
2. Just because Neville's fear was less dangerous overall, does not mean that it was a less fearful experience for him. My greatest fear, for example, is a bomb blast in Yemen. Lupin probably wouldn't take any interest in that, but for me, it's a very real fear- my mom works in a bunker in YemYou en three months a year. Anyway, Lupin probably wouldn't have cared about that, because there was no way for me to make the real thing go away, just like Neville can't spell the real Snape away. Harry can spell Dementors away. So even if Lupin wanted to do something- he couldn't. Also, can you imagine what it must mean seeing your greatest fear every day and having him belittle you in front of people that already bully you? Snape was HORRIBLE to Neville and there was nothing he could do about it. You cannot say it is meaningless because it has meaning to him. And even if Snape wasn't that much of an immediate threat to Neville, he was still there, in his head. You could say that since Dementor's tried to suck Harry's soul out, and Snape didn't do that to Neville, his fear was meaningless, but if you look a little closer, you'll find that their heartrates would have increased at the same rate, they would be the same level of frightened.
3. The fact that you are able to call Neville's fear meaningless is also a testament to how terrible Snape is: Neville had a VERY tragic life, perhaps even more tragic than Harry. His parents were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange, his family thought he was a squib until he was 8 and threw him off roofs to confirm that- can you imagine how that must have felt to an eight-year-old? He lived with a grandmother who was constantly disappointed in him for not living up to his parents, and oh yeah HIS PARENTS WERE TORTURED BY THE EVILEST WITCH ALIVE AND HE HAD TO GO VISIT THEM EVERY WEEK DURING THE HOLIDAYS AND WATCH THEM IN THAT VEGETATIVE STATE AND COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT EXCEPT TAKE CANDY WRAPPERS FROM HIS MUM AND HIS GREATEST FEAR WAS NOT ANY OF THAT OR BELLATRIX AND THE OTHERS BREAKING OUT BUT HIS *MOTHERFUCKING SCHOOL TEACHER!!!*

I will reply to the rest soon. Goodbye.

********** Are you familiar with the logical fallacy "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question][begging the question]]"? It means your argument is assuming what you're trying to prove. I think this is what's going on here, with your response - you're assuming Snape mistreated Neville to the point that he feared Snape more than he feared the Death Eaters who had tortured his parents into insanity, more than he feared his life-threateningly abusive relatives. We see Snape being unpleasant to Neville, sure, but we don't see him torturing anybody or endangering anybody's life, so that needs to be proven rather than asserted. Neville himself compares his fear of Snape to the fear of his grandmother - except that his grandmother should have loved him unconditionally, and Snape was his teacher, whose job it was to tell Neville when he was doing poorly (even if he could have gone about it in a kinder way). If you /must/ attribute a deeper meaning to this boggart, it might mean that Neville fears his own inadequacy, which is constantly brought up by both Snape and his grandmother.

Alternatively, you're assuming that the boggart necessarily reflects one's truest, deepest, darkest fear, and not what's just at the front of one's mind at the time, and this is also false, because accepting that conclusion would mean accepting that Ron fears spiders more than he fears dying or losing his family, and the same goes for every other student. It would also make Lupin a fucking monster, to be honest - he sees that a boggart turns into Snape and doesn't immediately stop the lesson and do something about the horrible abuse Neville is surely suffering at his hands? He thinks it's a good idea in the first place to make 13 year olds face their deepest darkest fears in public with less than five minutes of preparation?

I'm not saying Snape didn't trigger a physiological fear response in Neville, I am saying that the same is true for Ron's spiders, Dean's severed hand, etc. There is already a creature in canon that actually reveals one's true, deepest, darkest, trauma - the dementors. Another one would have been redundant - and indeed, Lupin, who isn't a monster, /didn't/ confront children with those, but with the boggart. You've said Harry needed to learn how to cast the patronus because "plot device" - so you do acknowledge the existence of plot devices. Since you do, here's another explanation why Snape is Neville's boggart: Snape's true motives and allegiance are a secret until the end of the series. He was angry at Lupin and taught the class about werewolves after Sirius Black broke into the castle on Halloween, but of course there was a need to make this look petty and vindictive, so JKR needed to give Snape something to appear to be petty and vindictive about. The twist is that he wasn't petty or vindictive at all, he was protective (even if he was wrong in the sense that Sirius wasn't out to get Harry). Another explanation for this might be, of course, that Neville's story was only formed in JKR's mind when she wrote book 4.

I think it all depends on context. If you are reading a great book where all main characters are assassins and you end up liking them, you easily forget they were capable of murdering lots of people and doing terrible things and usually just ignore it cause they are so great and (whatever positive adjective you want). And that is not even what we are doing with Snape, we acknowledge that he is a terrible self serving arsehole, but a self serving arsehole we like to read about.

** I wouldn't call myself a "Snape-fan" but he is a very interesting character. We get a lot of backstory from him, and overall in the books we never quite knew which side he was on. His motives are very mysterious. He spied for the Order returning to Voldemort again and again, a feat not many would've been able to do and a very dangerous job indeed. Snape wasn't a nice person, he was very bitter and he had many bad things happen to him in his life, partly through circumstances of his surroundings and partly through his own choices and yet in the end he did the right thing.\\
I think his character is very fleshed out and he is an intriguing person. He was very intelligent and capable as well as well versed in the dark arts. And he was 20 when he overheard the Prophecy. It is no excuse of course but a fact to be considered. There is a lot you can work with in fanfiction if you use him . I can see why people dislike him and I can also relate to people who like him.

Overall I think he was not a pleasant person when we got to know him in the books but nonetheless he was not bad per se. Just bitter and hardened by life. The only thing that can't be justified in my opinion is how he treated Harry because he reminded him of James. His grudge against Sirius is understandable and they both weren't very mature in that regard. That being said Snape was the only DADA teacher who didn't try to torture or kill Harry. Which is ironic in it's own way

PS: In the books Snape never entered Godrics Hollow to cry over Lilys dead body and ignore Harry completely so I think we can ignore that being used as an argument against Snape.

** 1- the best fics I read were Snape-centred and he is such an interesting character in canon that allows you to take him wherever you want and still make the changes believable because canon never gave us his insight

2- Snape is a F* arsehole. There is no other way to put it. Still a hero tho. He's just a terrible person who did something really really good and really sacrificed himself(no matter his motivations). The thing is, he is completely morally grey: his great actions should not be diminished by the fact he was an arsehole; and him being an arsehole should not be overlooked because of his great actions.

I love complex characters and just cause I love a character does not mean he is a great person. I love his complexity and the grey area he walks in.

I could go on and on about justifications for his behaviour and why he did this or acted like that(believe me, I spent a lot of time thinking of them for fanfics and personally think they are plausible), but at the end of the day I don't really think it matters that much. Why can't he be both a bad and a good person? Characters in general are usually way more complex than the little "hero" and "villain" boxes people try to shove them on.

** If I was to meet him, as described I wouldn't like him but I think that as a character he is deeply interesting and one of the few dynamic characters we meet. Dumbledore is set up as a foil, I believe. Except, the DH plot never really has that much time to ponder Dumbledore - not with a conclusion. In my opinion, Cursed Child shows that Harry never really came to understand Dumbledore and his actions.

When it comes to the adults in the Harry Potter series, there is little in the way of complex characters. Snape, I think fulfils an interesting premise for fanfiction because his actions are so closely guided by the shitty hand he was dealt so you can potentially interrupt that by changing some things.

Note: I am in no way suggesting that all, or even most, people with his experiences would have followed his path.

Though as a person, I wouldn't like him at all. I understand why he became so bitter and mean but at the same time everyone has to take responsibility for the way they act and how they treat others.

3. He's unashamedly awful and gives zero fucks. Severus Snape is not a nice person, you love to hate him but he helps out anyway. He makes Wolfbane for Lupin even though it's a long and unpleasant process. He watches out for Harry even though he loathes him

4. He's brilliant and creative with his magic. His potions book, his spell crafting are good examples

5. He's incredibly brave. The scene at the end of GOF where Dumbledore asks him if he's ready still gives me chills

6. He tried to redeem himself. He made a bad decision as a very young man (joining the Death Eaters) with horrible consequences (the death of Lily) and spent the rest of his life trying to atone for it. He very obviously lived with tremendous guilt and it's my head canon that he's profoundly depressed

He's a very human character. That's why I like him so much. I can see the possible reasons for him being the way he is

** Snape is my favorite character precisely because he's a fucked-up, grudge-holding, ugly, morally grey character trapped in a nightmare of his own making who, for /whatever/ reasons, does the right thing.

He's a great foil and secondary antagonist, he energizes every scene he's in, and he sacrifices his ambitions (the only thing besides Lily that seemed to give him hope as a child) and then his life. The fact that he's responsible for Harry's terrible circumstances because he gave Voldemort the prophecy in the first place -- and then is ultimately and agonizingly responsible for passing Harry the information he needs to die "properly" in order to survive Voldemort -- is satisfying on a narrative level. He's a fabulous ambiguous character, a wiry, watchful, intense bugger with huge amounts of poorly controlled anger simmering beneath the surface and a very active sense of malice. His hatred is practically a living thing. He's immensely talented and trapped by his own mistakes. He's been stewing in guilt for years, even if he can't be bothered to care about what he did to James and Harry. He's obsessive, and that all becomes focused on Harry and Voldemort. He's not a tall man, and in his youth he was weedy and not very articulate, but by the time Harry meets him, he's learned how to be intimidating. Certain painful reminders will make him explode into half-deranged tantrums. He's brave, and he's very open about his emotions (which leads me to wonder how he could be such a successful spy), and there are hints that Dumbledore's opinion meant more to him than the headmaster ever realized.

While the series was in progress, there were various mysteries and questions concerning his motives and loyalties. He was bullied and precocious, working class, brilliant, a potions prodigy and adolescent inventor of spells, a duellist, an Occlumens and Legilimens, a double agent, Dumbledore's murderer, a vicious abuser of his position, a terrible excuse for an adult -- and he could fly without a broom. Plus he died painfully and tragically, driven by a combination of grief and guilt, while remaining an arsehole to the bitter end.

Rather pointedly, he's the middle part of the morality spectrum that includes Harry and Tom Riddle, the three lost boys of Hogwarts, all halfbloods, all damaged by their childhoods.

Perception of Snape's character has changed radically over the last few years, but the little working-class weirdo from the divided Muggle/magical household, with his boiling resentments, his obsessions, his utter lack of emotional maturity, his myriad gifts, his courage, his self-loathing, his darkness, his viciousness, and his fatal mistakes makes him a gift to hundreds of fic-writers. Greasy hair, hooked nose, habitual cruelty, and all, he's a mess of contradictions and a moral basket case whom I still enjoy more than any other character in the canon.

** Snape is interesting because he's one of the more morally grey characters in the series, and has a lot of potential. He's a sarcastic, jaded asshole who is managing to betray one of the darkest, most insane wizards in history while still being one of his most trusted underlings - what's /not/ to like about that? :P

In fanfics, I find that he can work very well as a mentor of sorts, if set up correctly. There's some fics that have adjusted large or small details in a fairly natural way to make that happen or make him a bit /less/ of an asshole to students, which is nice - though, of course, it's just one way to handle him.

But in general, he's a pretty unique character in the universe, and his potion brewing abilities and just general skills are also quite interesting to play with as a character!

** I‘m not a fan of Snape, because he's introduced as a bully and stays as such, but i would say that most fans are from fanfictions that give him more character. Because ultimately that's what makes him such a more or less bad (?) character. We don't really have any information about him. Maybe he had at least some regrets about joining the DEs. Considering that Dumbledore or the ministry didn't do much to stop Moldyshorts is it really that unthinkable to be able to say that Lily‘s death was the only thing that turned him around. The problem ultimately lies with JKR. But at the core of the characters i would draw a comparison with Doofenshmirtz (of Phineas and Ferb). I know wild comparison but hear me out. Both Doffenshmirtz and Snape have been abused to some degree in there childhood\\
Both tried to proof themselves to a darker being\\
I could draw more proof, but its shortly after midnight and I am tired so it stays with those to points that already are half of a characterdesing. The only reason why Heinz Doofenshmirtz is more liked and accepted than snape is because we have more background to him than snape. Yes Snape bullied students, but do you really think he liked his job at Hogwarts with the first years (he doesn't have his record as youngest potions master for nothing for christ‘ sake). He was at the start of the second year just out of his 20s (or something). Yes he's a horrible teacher but if you were in his position (bullied for nearly his whole childhood and shoolyears, only having one or two childhood friends, abused in his childhood, etc.) would you say you wouldn't be the same?! He is a horrible human being because he didn't really learn different. His "Love" for Lily may have been one reason to leave the DEs but maybe he had some doubts. We are missing a lot of his characterdesign to really know. And that's why the fandom of Harry Potter is so spilt about opinions of Snape. If you want to have someone to blame for shitty Character design blame JKR. But try to see some points that make sense because nobody is evil just because they were born that way. On an emotional level with Physics Logic there is no pure hate only absence of love. Think about what makes a character that way in their story, then draw conclusions that make him dislikeable/likeable. I hope that was good as i wrote it. If not blame it on my tired mind (it's now 1 am).

In terms of villains, fiction can be a way to explore feelings and unpleasant aspects of humanity in an exaggerated (and largely harmless) way. This is part of the reason that stories about redemption or character change can be meaningful.

******* I'm somewhat confused here, I was just answering from my perspective about whether he can be seen as good of you take a general view of Snape. I like villains, and morally gray characters are typically interesting to me. I don't find Snape to be interesting though, because... what is gray about him? He was a bad guy. Having a checkered past isn't really what "morally gray" is about. He didn't choose to be good for anything that typically makes a character gray and thus interesting to me (i.e. picking a different side on morally debatable questions that blur the lines, or horrid tactics used in service of a goal that seems good). He was very bad, up until it directly hurt what he cared about most, so he just becomes a generally unpleasant guy who does good things grudgingly and without really seeming to have a belief about the relevant issues one way or another. It's not that he was plain bad all the time, but that I think he was just written poorly in terms of his motivations (if he wanted to help Harry, trying to get him expelled, and therefore killed, isn't sensible).

Though, I don't think pointing to fanfic where people do things differently really matters to me when talking about liking or disliking Snape. Fanfic versions of characters are all over the place, to be honest.

****** Sure, and it seems somewhat hard to actually do that for Snape. Villains are usually interesting because there's something about them that people can empathize with or agree to, up to a point. For Snape it's... his bad childhood? It's nothing that we actually experience, because it's all 20 years in the past and only barely connects with the Snape we actually read about (the one who simply hated the protagonist for absurd reasons). In any case, if it's about liking the bad things Snape did or finding a character who changed sides fascinating in and of themselves, that seems quite different (and in the former case, kind of disturbing).

Besides that, though, I also think that Snape as a character himself is informed by that negative childhood and past.

His past is supposed to inform how he was later as a Death Eater, yet we see from even before he was 10 that he understood Muggleborns weren't lesser than other wizards, yet he still became a DE. This is a hypocrisy even Lily pointed out, Snape couldn't have really disagreed with pureblood supremacy and was evidently quite firm in that belief based on Lily knowing he used slurs against Muggleborns quite liberally.

There are much more compelling hero figures in literature who aren't superheroes, you should look it up. In any case, Snape has perhaps not saved any particular baby, but that's a weird criteria, really - neither did any other character. The only characters who had died to save a baby were James and Lily who had a vested interest in said baby. It was the only baby Voldemort had targeted, so...

Snape risked his life constantly and demonstrated a complete lack of self-interest to the point that you could argue he never got over the suicidal mood he was in after Lily died. He tried not to die, yes, so that he could complete his mission. In any case, "trying to survive" makes one human, not heroic or an anti-hero or a villain.

#+begin_quote

They don't justify it. They explain it, and some of them highlight that even at his worst he was not as bad as some. In any case, bullying has long term consequences for victims, these consequences include undesirable behaviors, so that's exactly how it works, psychologically if not "ethically".

Wow. First of all, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/eq77qs/the_marauders_vs_snape_was_bullying_not_a_rivalry/][this]]. But to your specific argument, Snape fighting back does not make the relationship any less one-sided. We don't even know for a fact that he /did/ fight back, we know for a fact that Lupin says he did. When is it stated in canon that he /sought them out/? The text and the author clarify that it was completely one-sided. The argument "Snape was a victim" is supported by Pensieve memories, which are better than video evidence; the argument "it was a rivalry" is supported by a second hand account from a biased source, and even that - only if you choose to read it very selectively.

Until Dumbledore tells him Harry must die, at which point Snape protests, but ultimately delivers that piece of intel to Harry and causes Harry to sacrifice himself. I personally believe that off-page, Dumbledore told Snape the truth - that self-sacrifice was Harry's best chance of survival - but his survival was certainly not guarantedd.

  But saving Harry has a lot if different methods, you put a kid down and he works twice as hard even if it fails. At least that's what I did.
