Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Completed or not

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Asexual/Bisexual. Threesomes, etc

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing, as I love that family.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18704896/chapters/44362291][Anaticula]] tons of work with the Weasleys in this trilogy and tons of pairings that flow in and out of the story as it progresses.

Summary - In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.

Pairings - on/off again Charlie Weasley x mc oc, Sebastian Krum (oc) x mc oc date in Triwizard Year, Barty Crouch Jr x mc oc fake dating/engaged/baby daddy relationship

Remus x Regulus fake date until Oc, Harry and Neville can stop having to pretend to be dead and stop pretending to be Remus' kids with a Muggle born Ginny x Dean Dean x Seamus Luna x Neville Harry x Ginny Harry x Romulus Vane Draco x Astoria Ron x Lavender I think that's all the pairings.

Second book no pairing other than Ron Weasley x female Elf Oc (series crosses over into the Hobbit fandom & Wizards go to Middle Earth.

- this series has several soulmate pairings

Third book main pairing is Glorfindel x mc oc x Thranduil Ron x female elf oc Hermione x Fili Regulus x Lindir Ginny x Haldir Those are all I can think of off the top of my head.

  Percy ignored her sudden stiffness, he didn't care what the state of her injuries were, Hermione was so tough, so brave, he almost couldn't focus on something as every day as skin when he was blinded by her radiance, the beauty that shone from her eyes, from the set of her mouth, in all the little noises she made.

  Hermione knows working herself into the ground isn't a healthy coping mechanism, but right now it's the only one she's got. When deliberate intervention forces her to work with one of her old schoolmates, will things fall into place, or will they just fall apart?

  Hermione has just been brutally tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange. Luna has just spent months in the cellar at Malfoy Manor. Now, they are about to spend several weeks sharing the smallest bedroom at Shell Cottage. Will they be able to come to terms with the trauma they've experienced, and will they be able to resolve the enormous differences in their personalities?

  One day in the library, Hermione and Percy strike up a comfortable friendship. As they grow closer, their secrets grow deeper. How far will this unlikely pair go to keep the other's confidences? Only time will tell. Hermione/Percy Friendship to start. Canon to start, but will deviate. COMPLETE. Sequel now in progress: An Inch To The Left.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** I bring you smut!

Rule 8 fics first:

"Quaffles and Broomsticks" by HoosYourDaddy is a good Angelina Johnson/Harry Potter story set during the Umbridge regime at Hogwarts.

"Surprise Child" by Harry50 is Millicent Bulstrode/Harry Potter. First chapter is during the Umbridge year, rest is post-war

Do you count Pansy Parkinson/Neville Longbottom as a rare pair?

Now, non-rule 8! Cissamione isn't rare, but I believe there is only 1 person who has written a post-war trio of Hermione Granger/Narcissa I-Divorced-Lucius'-Worthless-Ass-So-It's-Black-Again/Blaise Zabini's Mom. I give you the 19 chapters of linkao3(Ask Me No Questions (I'll Tell You No Lies) by inkheart9459)

  Fred never really thought of Hermione as much more than Ron's know-it-all best friend.Hermione never really thought of Fred as much more than Ron's chaotic older brother. What would happen if they actually got the chance to get to know each other? A closely canon compliant Fredmione series rewrite starting the summer before the events of GOF.
