Time travel is ever so popular but mostly people send characters back to their own schooling and occasionally harry back to the 70th. It seems far less popular to relocate other characters into Harry's time (doesn't have to be his year but the same time and events).\\
I'm not picky about the adult in question, but I would prefer stories that have them be sneaky about the whole time travel thing. So no running of to Dumbledore/ the ministry and outing themselves as time Travelers. üòÖ


** ...Huh. Now I want to see a Madam Rosmerta/Older Harry fic (where an older Harry is punted back in time to the time of his own schooling, so he sees his younger self running around), or where Rosmerta herself is punted forward in time during her own schooling to Harry's time in the 90's.

Could easily get away with it by using split timelines as an excuse: older Rosmerta meeting her younger self on a date with Harry would be goddamn mind-fucking hilarious.

I mean, c'mon: she's an attractive, fiery, auburn-haired bar-maid.

** There are many of them. For example, just rereading ‚ÄúReboot by Kallanit‚Äù linkffn(9552519), where all three Severus Snape, Hermione, and Harry are thrown back.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
