** He often does that in time travels. Barring that, Harry often returned to Hogwarts as a 'White Knight' to save and train his damsel-in-distress (usually Hermione and/or Ginny):

  Minor events can have repercussions far beyond their size and importance. When one of these minor events occurs to a ten year-old Harry Potter he finds his world turned upside-down and it starts him down a very different path than the one he expected to follow.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

** In "Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool" Harry is thrown into an alternate universe, turned into a girl, ends up teaching Defense and tutors Sally-Ann Parks before eventually adopting her. First few chapters make Sirius a dick but the bashing drops out pretty soon afterward. Harry/Tonks

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Sirius is a dick

Because of the dinner where he made crass jokes, right? I never knew what to make of that scene. Am I supposed to see Sirius as the bad guy? What he did was improper, yes, but Jamie went completely nuclear in response. It just made me think of her as unstable, although I'm not certain that was the point of the scene.

****** That this Sirius is not the one Harry knew. And that joking about one's sexuality is not a good idea unless you know the person very well.

I interpreted this scene that Sirius crossed the line of good fun and Jamie took it as ridicule. Since Sirius is the head of house he ought to approve of any serious relationship and Jamie took the bad jokes as disapproval from a person she did not expect it from.

****** Then start with chapter 5: Welcome to classes. There might be some references you will not get but the main plot starts once Harry/Jamie becomes a teacher.

When looking back at the story I tend to remember the second half a lot better because it is frankly said a lot better. Once you get past the initial angst/Sirius being a dick things start looking better and the interactions between Harry, Sally and Tonks are well worth it.
