** If you want the most cliche fic out there you're looking for linkffn(the power of time by rosswrock) . This is the Mother of independent Harry fics, including but not limited to long shopping trips, super trunks, goblin buddies.

Now, if it is readable or not, that's a totally different discussion. It depends on your tolerance as a reader, I guess.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

** Linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) Super Harry, lordships, ancient family, political alliances, family magic avatar(actually a really cool idea tbh) Morgana's blessing, Merlin himself, death personified, 14 year old Harry as Master of Death/Deaths Champion, "Pronglet", magical cores, and more.

If you go in accepting that it is cliche, you can certainly enjoy it. It gets really sappy and melodramatic at times but the political drama is entertaining.

**** Thing is, its either OP or useless/weird.

Relatively good idea, is to have family magic as a collection of powerful spells that were either invented or gathered by ancestors and kept in secret. But any ideas of magic bloodlines and other similar things are bullshit.

  Hey, wouldn't it be cool if someone took as many fanfic cliches as possible and stuffed them all into one story? No? Well, I went ahead and did it anyway. Multi-chapter Mockfic. This summary is actually a lot better than I originally thought.
