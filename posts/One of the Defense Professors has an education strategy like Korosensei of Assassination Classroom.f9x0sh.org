For those not familiar with Assassination Classroom, the basic relevant premise is that the teacher is a monster who destroys most of the moon and says he plans to destroy the Earth -- but gives us one chance to avert that fate... by killing him. He sets up as a teacher in a High School in Japan with the goal of graduation being his successful assassination.

Bonus points if said Defense Professor is Grindelwald, the Giant Squid, or a House Elf.

Personally, I'd love to see this happening between the Marauders Era and the Canon Era, with almost all Original Characters. I think it would be a fun crack!fic with plenty of room for exploring lots of world developing, particularly in the magic system (how many different ways can you kill someone with magic?).


** I think I've read one that was a Danganronpa (apologies if I misspelled that, Japanese games are hell to spell) AU/Cross-over... thing. Can't remember the title, but instead of a bunch of children being locked in a school and killing their teacher, they're trying to kill each other and then Ace-Attorney-ing their way into finding out Whodunnit. Can't remember the title, but hopefully someone else reading here remembers it. The story was basically just the Danganronpa story but with Harry Potter characters instead.
