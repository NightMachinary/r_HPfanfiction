I was wondering why he didn't hide his horcuxes like at the bottom of a volcano, or as the voldemort in HPMOR did, deep space. It's mostly fanon but canon does not indicate anything that requires that he has access to his horcuxes.


** The real reason would be extreme overconfidence and sentimentality. /If/ however I had to find some reason for Voldemort to select his hiding places as he did, I would assume that the specific locations of the Horcruxes are also somehow magically significant. 6 horcruxes in 6 places of sentimental importance, perhaps it gave him additional magical power or something.

*** I agree, Voldemort would want to hide them in the significant locations to him not randomly in the Muggle world and Volcanoes and Space are to Muggle for him.

**** Honestly, why Voldemort would go to such extents for an immortality backup and then somehow forget a ressurection contingency is beyond me. I can only assume that he couldn't trust anyone to perform the ressurection. Instead of finding their Lord, the Lestranges blunder around torturing aurors. Heck, if I were LV I would order an House Elf to ressurect me with the precise instructions.

***** I am pretty sure that his arrogance made him blind to the fact that he could be harmed - or killed. Another example: Xerxes guy from 300. Most tyrants see themselves as the apex of perfection, and that they simply can't fail.\\
Those are unlikely to have a Plan B. Doing so is admitting to themselves that they aren't as great as they think they are.

*** I'm thinking it's something like the fidelius. Fidelius grants absolute defence, with a glaring weakness of someone you trust being able to betray you.

So maybe There's a similar spell that hides the Horcrux from any magical means of discovery, but the vulnerability is that it needs to be in a location significant to you, as in one vulnerable to being discovered by more mundane investigation, something Voldemort would probably be dismissive of.

** It can pretty much be boiled down to "hubris".

He was too /proud/ to just use random stuff - it had to be either artifacts of legend, his own personal belongings, or a mix of the two.

His defenses, then - he was prideful, but also mildly /paranoid/. He'd want to make sure he could check on his Horcruxes, which means he couldn't just launch them into space or drop them in the ocean. He then relied on a flawed, "no one but me could do this/would think of checking here" mentality out of hubris - see also, he basically just hucked one into the Room of Requirement assuming no-one but him would ever find that place.

Pretty sure the number had Arithmantic significance in canon - which is why he couldn't make hundreds as per Methods of Rationality.

** You know the Gru's Plan meme?

Step 1 - Hide Horcrux in volcano/deep space with no way for anyone to get at it

Step 2 - Die

Step 3 - Remaining soul is in volcano/deep space with no way for anyone to get at it

**** that's because Quirrel was possessed by the OG spirit of Voldemort, not a horcrux.

Which is also why the plan would work. The OG spirit still lives on if there is a Horcrux existing.

*** Pretty sure you don't need the Horcruxes to be anywhere you can reach for them to work, you just need them to /exist/ somewhere. As long as a Horcrux exists, the soul is anchored to life, thus a new homunculus-body can be made by a follower (assuming, of course, you have some way of getting them to actually do that).

In theory, launching one into deep space would do the job, assuming it can handle the things that can happen up there (most destructively "collision with a star", but even just the increased radiation might form a problem over time). Would be difficult to check up on, though, and there's a lot of unknowns about deep-space.

** The most likely answer is pride and plot.

However... what if there were actual reasons like magic comes from earth so throwing it in outer space, it would deprive it from the magic, would break the spells and the Horcrux would be gone? What if lava is something that can damage a magical object beyond repair? What if at the bottom of the sea there is a magical creature that Muggles don't know about that could destroy it beyond repair?

There are many things left unexplained into the HP-verse and, realistically, no one could explain them all so for fanfiction writers it's a free for all.

** The diagetic explanation is that he's an arrogant bastard who wanted his horcruxes to be artifacts of enormous power and value held in places of status and prestige. Even the one that was kept in a cave was guarded by a literal army and a poison that brought down Dumbledore.

The exegetic explanation is that whether or not he turns a pebble into a horcrux and hides it in the ocean has no bearing at all on the story. If he had done that, Harry's quest to find the magical macguffins would have instead been a quest to find the magical macguffin that lets him find or track the other magical macguffins. It makes way more sense from a storytelling perspective for Harry to be rediscovering pieces of history by tracking down artifacts related to the founders than it does for him to be stressing about which pebble out of millions is the one he needs to break.

Basically, Voldemort didn't take full advantage of how nonsense magic can be because JKR is a pretty good writer who knows what she's doing most of the time.

** I mean... he did hide them didn't he. The locket was protected by a lake of infery and a poisonous liquid you had to Drink and couldn't throw away. The Diary and the Cup were (supposedly) in Gringotts which is (supposedly) the most difficult place to break into right after Hogwarts or something of the like... Speaking of which, the Diadem was in Hogwarts. Hidden with all kinds of rubbish, not exactly a place you'd find it in accident to take it with you. And Nagini was always at his side. The Ring was really the only one that wasn't protected all that well...

And I think the bottom of a volcano or deep space would be rather stupid... after all they can be destroyed. Who knows if they survive a volcano? And also, in case he dies, who's gonna get his horkrux out of deep space ot the bottom of a volcano to revive him... their main purpose is so he'll have a second life, so his soul being stuck somewhere behind Jupiter doesn't do him any favours...

*** it's not really a plothole if it is consistent with characters and their flaws.

Voldemort is\\
a) Horribly prideful and arrogant. He likely assumed no one else could get to them and live, or resist their influence.\\
B) surprisingly sentimental. He values things from his past or things of power. That is why he made a muggle diary a horcrux, despite him hating all things muggles. It was something close to him once.

****** Because he didn't want someone to find it back then. When he gave it to Malfoy, he really wanted him to protect it, just not forever I believe. It was probably temporary, but then the prophecy happened so he probably put all his plans on hold. And then we all know what happened.

The diary was created with the intention of eventually ending up with someone so that Tom Riddle could finish what he started when he first opened the chamber of secrets. Back then he couldn't reveal his identity as the heir of Slytherin to everyone.

Also the fact that the diary could actually bring 16 yo Tom Riddle back is a non négligeable fact. I don't know if all the other horcruxes have the same power, but IF it wasn't destroyed then a part of Voldemort could have been back in book 2. However i don't know if it would have just lasted untill Ginny's death or if it would have brought back a part of him for real.

While I do agree that where Voldemort hid some of his horcruxes was pretty dumb, I also don't agree with just putting them anywhere like inside a volcano or somehwere unreachable. He should probably have chosen somewhere with no meaning or link to him making it impossible to find.

** Honestly I don't think that horucruxes are as indestructible as people assume.

Yeah, a cutting or blasting curse doesn't destroy it, but I doubt it could resist Lava or some kind of bombs (C4, RPG, missles, rockets, obviously Nukes).

It would take effort but it should in my opinion be destructible
