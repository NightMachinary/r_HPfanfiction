Like I don't see a 30 year old character, or even a 20 year old character being perfectly okay and being able to hang out with 14 years old people or younger without it seemingly being odd. Same with their magic, it'd be a lot more powerful then a teenager's, I can't see them being able to hold back as easily.

People might not think "time travel" but they'd think something was up.

Similar with characters going to alternate universes, they tend to have characters get along pretty well with everyone, despite the changes. It'd be difficult to try and play nice with everyone, when you're wanting to go back home, and depending on the story, have no way to get back. That'd make the character feel hopeless/depressed and stuff, but I don't really see that in stories.

And other similar aspects as that.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing)

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.
