I read a story like two years ago. Severus Snape goes back in time, gets adopted by the Evans' and ends up helping raise Harry with Petunia. Severus arranges for Harry to grow up with Hermione as a best friend somewhere in there too.

Anyone have any ideas?


** linkffn(Reboot by Kallanit) ... lady Hermione Graynge. It is slightly too long, and slightly too much Dumbledore bashing, but not crazily so, and it is rather pleasant reading.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
