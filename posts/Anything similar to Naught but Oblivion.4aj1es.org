A crossover where Harry is reasonably dark but without cliches!

  Lord Voldemort sneered at the thought of a mere child being the cause of his downfall once again. No wizard could defeat him, for he was immortal; he was a god! Unfortunately for him, Harry Potter was not a wizard. He was an alien, a son of Krypton, and if one of them was a god, it was him. Voldemort was right about one thing though: a mortal stood no chance against a god. ONESHOT.

** Crossover, dark, not cliched, hm... Okay, darkness and writing quality vary a bit and I'm not sure what exactly qualifies as cliche but:

linkffn(8933408) - One of the many Kathryn518 coauthored crossovers with an OP Harry fixing another setting (Warcraft in this case) and acquiring a harem. He has no qualms about killing and bloodshed, but I couldn't really describe him as dark either. Long and in progress.

linkffn(8832598) - Harry's new familiar is OP, but Harry himself still feels very young and unsure... but his familiar will influence him in disturbing ways. There's some significant writing problems (English is not his first language). Dead fic.\\
I haven't read them but I know there's a number of Dresden Files crossovers with good reputations, that are supposed to involve dark or at the very least semi-dark Harrys:

linkffn(11188292) - Harry raised by 'Lash, updates on a reliable schedule.

linkffn(3473224) - Harry with a Blackened Denarius. Complete with sequels.\\
oh wait I did read this one, it's awesome:

linkffn(7779108) - HP dies and as MoD his next great adventure is interrupted by being summoned in to Dresdenverse as... well, spoilers, but read it. Dead fic.

*** I think it would be pretty hard to do. Even if Kryptonians don't have any resistance against magic, they're still gonna be able to kill any wizard so fast that they don't even know what happened. And if they're dark--and thus willing to kill--it's going to make a pretty short story, or a one-shot.

*** I'd love to read it if you ever get it somewhere, barring cliches, convenient plot devices and a plot that you can see from miles coming. If you want do send me a pm if you ever need a different view or a idea or two if you were to write it.

This would be the issue. I'm not confident enough in my writing to do the idea justice. Most of the ideas I have so far run into the problem of being mostly a canon rehash until end of 4th year. I don't want it to be hugely AU either.
