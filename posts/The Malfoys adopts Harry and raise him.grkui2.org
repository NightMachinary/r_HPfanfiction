I'm curious, very curious.

Harry make the Malfoys change their views (if Harry is older enough to have views for himself, but I don't think so) or the Malfoys make Harry a traditionalist?

They could adopt him when he is a baby or older. (Just imagine if Harry is 11 or older and already hates Draco, they have to learn to live together!)

One thing is almost certain. Harry probably don't like Dumbles when the fic ends.


** They would probably rename him to Hadrian Malfoy, too, because, you know.

Pureblood name following the Malfoy bloodline's naming tradition.

**** True, for example, Izar.

Though maybe Lucius would decide that since Draco follows the Black line naming, Harry will continue the Malfoy naming tradition

*** I don't think they would rename him. Give him some Malfoy-ish middle name, maybe. The name â€˜Harry Potter' is famous, it makes more sense that they would use that fame. It also would make them look bad (in society's eyes, as well as Harry's when he's older) if they took away one of the few things his parents (who sacrificed their lives for him) left him with.

**** Honestly, if they get harry young enough they might raise him with pureblood beliefs and harry would become arrogant like draco was

only to go through a crisis when he realises the background behind his family and the fact the malfoys served the wizard who killed his parents and that his parents fought against voldemort due to disagreeing with pureblood politics.

**** Well... Yes, but in case they want to keep it secret because his death eater friends or whatever they could re-name him and treat him like a Draco's cousin from the French branch of the family.

I know it's unlikely, but the possibility exist.

***** If we're following canon, all their DE friends are imprisoned, and if they're not, you could use the same â€˜we're just using him' excuse (whether it's true or not).

If Malfoys are hiding him from everyone (for whatever reasons) out the goodness of their hearts (meaning they're sincerely (ooc) good), they would use something like Henry/Henri Malfoy. It's a rather common (but high class enough) name, and they could still use â€˜Harry' diminutive to give him a connection to his birth-parents.

****** Ha! The Malfoys doing something for the goodness of they hearts. That's a good joke.

A long time ago I saw a fic where Narcissa kidnap Harry and hide him because the Dursley's (I think Harry just trip with her when Petunia and Vernon abandon/lost him in London). Lucius found this later and well... His wife kidnap The fucking Boy-Who-Live AND want to keep him so he is against this BUT allow it because he loves Narcissa or something like that. With the past of the time Lucy's icy heart melt a little and treats Harry better. Is abandon just before Harry hits the Hogwarts age if I remember right.

**** Hardwin would be better, as an ancestor had that name.

Hadrian does fill in some of the Black roots. It was a Roman Emperor that named the constellation Antinous (later merged into Acquila). But this only works if Dorea was his Grandmother. That, and there's a few fics scattered about where the Potters came from Rome. In the above circumstances, it's a traditional name that honors both Blacks and Potters.

Of course, that's something I pulled out of my ass with five minutes of googling.

**** Well first of all the name is /gorgeous/ and I adopted it into /all/ the fics I can find an excuse to do so in the moment I saw it in a fic.

I don't get all the people hating on it irrationally just because a few prominent fics with Richest Man In The Universe! Lord of the entire planet! Harry, fics that they read far enough to know all that and that are popular enough for this to be a trope in the first place.

Second, in this case, not only is it beautiful, but it's even logical - the Malfoys name the males in the line ancient Roman names as a tradition, and since Hadrian is the name closest to Harry, it would make /perfect/ sense to name him Hadrian. Yes, Draco was named after a celestial object, but that's because his mother is a Black, and the Blacks are known for naming everyone after stars and constellations.

Which is also why OP argued that it could be either Hadrian or a star name in case Narcissa decided his name.

For example, if we keep the requirement of the name being at least somewhat close to the original, we could choose Hadar after the star named HADAR, although it's far and I'm not sure if the wizards know about that one. That's why they might choose the star from the constellation Aurigae, which is officially named Haedus (though it is called Eta Aurigae if you Google it, but you can read the first line and it's said there that the name is also Haedus,) which is 1) beautiful and I will be using it if I make Harry the Black heir 2) elegant and pureblooded 3) just overall superior (IMO.)

Or, after the constellation Hydrus, which is elegant and pureblooded and I simply /like/ the name, or, if the author prefers, Hercules since that constellation is more prominent.

** The Malfoy (as most Wizarding Family) would have gladly adopted Harry when he was a baby.

Taking care of the "Boy Who Lived" and spoiling him would have been an excellent way to show the world that poor Lucius was truly a Death Eater against his will and that he only wants the best for the boy who saved him (even though the accusations would probably rule him out of the list of potential parents).\\
Also, before his return to the magical world, nobody knew how Harry managed to vanquish Voldemort, and the "rival Dark Lord" trail was still an option. Raising the potential future Dark Lord would have been an excellent way to get a good position once he climbs to power.\\
The only "problem" I have with the Malfoy adopting baby Harry is how he would have grown up. The only 2 options I can see is either a spoiled/ arrogant brat (a Dudley, or Draco bis), or a kid raised to be a Dark Lord or at least a Dark Wizard (a bit like Delphini Riddle in the fanfic that should not be named), and while these 2 options can give interesting stories, it would also give a really annoying MC.

If the adoption happen later, the timing is a bit difficult. Harry started to dislike Draco around 30s after meeting him, and all bridges were burnt when he refused to shake his hand in the Hogwarts Express. Yet, his opinion of Draco would be secondary during a potential adoption. The main problem is that Lucius became a "racist asshole who tried to kill Muggleborns, and Ginny" at the end of CoS, and I can't see any adoption passing past this point.\\
So any past babt adoption would need to happen during the summer between PS and CoS, since Harry would really hate all the Malfoys after this (though a "adoption contract" may be envisaged, as the worthy successor of the "marriage contract" trope).

** There was one that started with Harry in the hospital dying of something that wizards can cure but non-magicals can't (or non-magicals can cure it but Harry is to malnourished/abused or is in to late of a stage to survive the cure). Snape finds Harry and brings him to the Malfoys. Harry is young enough that they give him a stuffed toy (a dragon I think) The toy ends up doing more then what it was charmed to do. I can not remember the name but it is a multi-chapter story.
