I really want to write a Harry Potter Fan Fiction or two. I have been considering a time travel one and one with an OC related to James Potter. So I was hoping you wonderful people might be able to help me. I want to avoid ideas that are thoroughly over done. What type of fan-fiction ideas do you hate? What do you never want to read more of? And alternatively, what would you love to read?


** Lords and magical cores.

*** I like Magical cores concepts. We can't expect a spell from Pettigrew packs same punch as a spell from Dumbledore/Voldemort or that any average Joe can last as long as Dumbledore. These core concepts atleast in partial explains that.

But I hate when authors make cores are everything. In my headcanon, bigger magical core means your spells are slightly powerful and you can cast more spells without tiring easily. But that doesn't mean you can win against everyone who has smaller core than you. Magic wasn't about brute force only but combination of skill, intent and power. In last movie ( I don't remembered what happened in that scene in books), Voldemort destroyed protections around Hogwarts single handedly with a mismatched elder wand while hundreds of his followers failed.

Magical power was one of the many things left unsaid in canon.

**** For my own stories, I prefer a model closer to D&D's lore, which has magic as an infinite fuel source, but one's own power is limited by how much magic their bodies can channel at once. It's a metaphysical muscle, not a reservoir. Use too much, and you won't get magically exhausted, you'll just be regular exhausted.

Hence why having a well-matched wand is incredibly important. A well-matched focus increases your quote unquote “efficiency” to the point where exhaustion is only going to be an issue for the average person if you're casting for hours non-stop, or massively overpowering spells. So things like Harry practicing the summoning charm until his arm feels like it's going to fall off in GoF still make sense.

** Emerald orbs.

. . .

Now for the serious part of things, I generally don't mind tropes so long as they fit into the canon universe reasonably well (which lords do, I could totally see the wizengamot being made up mostly of stuffy old nobles) and are most importantly well written. Logical writing is not so much an issue because wizards aren't big on logic in the HP universe anyways, but at least give it a backstory however ridiculous it may be.

I personally like to see someone take a major event in the HP universe and send it completely off the rails and see what happens. I am actually working (glacially slowly) on one of those myself, with entirely too many other tropes thrown in than is probably good but most of them have yet to show up (because I'm slow, mostly). Write what you want to read though. In my case I spend too much time reading and not enough writing, but whatever.

** Misunderstood purebloods.

Misunderstood / Good Guys Slytherin students.

Goblins barely holding themselves back from sucking Harry's dick for even the most extremely minor show of 'respect'.

So mote it be. It's unbelievable people still use this utter shit in 2020.

Many authors treat Harry as the sole person/individual in the story, probably due to identifying with him the most, and push all other characters aside when they're planning/writing.

*** The magical oath thing really shows that a lot of authors don't understand the mindset of HP wizards. Like, do they seriously believe that they would actually risk their magic on a spur of the moment type thing? The one Oath we do know of is ritualistic and takes three people, do they seriously think you can just randomly forfeit your magic by doing an untrue oath?

Not to mention, how flimsy do they think magic is? A wizard is a highly magical creature, and that magic infuses their entire being, down to their /very soul/, and they think that can just be taken away? An actual magic-loss would be horrific. It would be torturous. Death would be a mercy as the magic is burned from their body, boiled from their mind and torn from their soul.

** Character bashing. Largely Dumbledore, Ron, Molly and Ginny, very very few Hermione bashing, though that's there to a little.

Characters using Lord to showcase how important they are. Malfoy doesn't use Lord in his name, so I doubt others do as well.

Rehashes. I used to love rehashes, but now think that they're over done. Change things around, make things AU or different than canon in some way, please! I might as well be reading the books if you're going to do as little change as possible.

Wrong Boy Who Lived without anything different. What if Harry and his sibling got along? What if his sibling was someone great, but just wasn't the Boy Who Lived? Tired of James and LIly bashing too, if there's a Wrong Boy Who Lived, too often James and/or Lily are alive, and the author bashes them. I don't think that they'd neglect Harry for the other sibling.

Characters changing because of the author wanting a certain ship, too often characters change not because they realize they were wrong or such, but because the author wanted to ship two characters together, and try to change it around to work. I just want characters changing because they realized they were wrong and such.

**** I'm going to assume that it's pretty much canon, so they don't need to do the rehash, unless it's stated otherwise, I'll assume it's still the same in canon.

Slytherin!Harry has to be OP and curbstomp everyone through brute force and not actually outsmarting people or face slapping with schemes instead.

** Honestly, you'd be better thinking of things that are under-done. Stories where the main PoV character is a minor Canon character (Hagrid doesn't get nearly enough attention for instance), stories with a solid, properly planned out plot: stories that explore the many gaps in Canon: stories that develop under-explored ideas and characters.

No goblin trope.

No Lords and heir rings trope.

Reminding the reader how awesome and powerful Harry was, in every paragraph. And how Harry's eyes looks like a soldiers eyes.

Incompetent Dumbledore. And Hermione bashing fics.

Passing out after every confrontation I think is a sign of a lazy author and I'll usually drop a fic around the third time it happens.

I did, once. It was a crossover with Tolkien's stuff in which at some point he does make himself a wand, out of desperation, and it comes out ... wrong, yes. That said, the focus of the fic is not wand-making and it does have some of the best potion brewing you will find in any fic.

Yes, it's The Shadow of Angmar.

** Actually, there is one thing that ALWAYS makes a time travel fic feel cliche to me. In just about every one of them, Harry (or whoever went back) either calls the aurrors to collect Pettigrew or contacts the DMLE to re-try Serius Black. It seems they all have one of two ways to release Serius and no one is really thinking of something different.

This actually rises another issue. I see in a lot of fics where Harry is 10 or 11 (sometimes younger depending on the fic) and he goes to Gringotts to get answers ot to the ministry. Even in the Wizarding World, even if it's Harry Potter, no one is just going to take what a child says at face value. One major example I see a lot is Harry goes to Gringotts, finds that Dumbledore has been keeping a hand in Harry's Vault and he just starts making changes. It's completely unrealistic for them to just believe everything a child tells them, and even more unrealistic for them to just treat him as an adult.
