Hello guys, I'd like to know if there are more fics like Lightning's Tale. Possibly without the heavy angst of the physical and emotional abuse. I've read only the most famous fics on ao3, so there's a good chance I've not read one of those. What I'm really looking for is a talented Harry that starts from First year and has a different atmosphere.

P.S. I can't stand Evil!Dumbledore, really!

These are the ones similar to what I'm looking for if anyone's interested.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

**** It is fantastic. It's built similarly to Tyrant, Lords of Magic, and Prince of the Dark Kingdom. It has wizards that live in the millions in their own slice of world. Chief Wizard Malfoy comes from - there are 4 distinct magical regions and families that oversee each magical region (a hold over the feudal system). It also features realistic dueling (as a sport), Harry delving into Potter magic, and exploring the world thoroughly. Best of all, the author really captures JK's whimsical tone, which seems to be part of what your looking for. Take the leap of faith, I guarantee you won't regret it

** The only one off the top of my head isn't quite what you are looking for, in that it starts in the 5th year, but The Merging by Shaydrall has Harry really start trying, and his abilities come forward leaps and bounds. Its fairly light on any angst, there are bits and pieces, but its a fairly well written work and I've always found it an enjoyable read if nothing else. Unfortunately the update schedule has slowed to a crawl, maybe one a year at most, but there is enough there at least to make it worth your time.
