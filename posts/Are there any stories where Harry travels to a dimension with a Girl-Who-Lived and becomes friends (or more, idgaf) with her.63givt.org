  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

****** While I don't understand your hatred for Hermione (her being my favorite character), you're really limiting yourself if you only read fics where she is bashed or ignored. Most of the best fics (and just most fics in general) in this fandom have her as a major character --- probably a result of her regularly polling as [[https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/aug/30/snape-favourite-harry-potter-character][one of fans' favorite characters]].

Like for example, Malfoy.), arrogant (If someone else try to be clever she will ignore him. Again, like when Harry guessed that Malfoy wanted to kill Dumbledore. She just ignored him.) Jealous and selfish. (Remember her reaction when Harry bested her in potion? OR even better, her reaction when Ron date Lavender?)

That's 10% of why I hate Hermione, and I'm really not limiting myself considering that for me all Hermione centric fic are really bad. I read a lot where she is bashed and ignored and to be honest I really love them.

******** Obviously, she has flaws. That's what good writing is. But consider that she's very helpful (especially with studies), loyal and brave. Ron ditched Harry multiple times. But Hermione was by his side throughout. She figured out that Sirius being tortured was a trap. Yet, she followed her friend knowing that they were being led to possible death at the hands of the Dark Lord. I think that shows extreme loyalty to one's freinds and great courage.

As Dumbledore would say, she does what is right instead of what is easy. When the Firebolt arrived, she could've let Harry keep it. But she did the right thing out of concern for her friend, even though she knew they would be angry with her. And she was actually right about the broom --- it really /was/ sent by Sirius. Of course, he was innocent but no one knew that so she can't be faulted for it. Considering this, Harry's and Ron's behavior to her seems really petulant. That they were more concerned about having fun with the broom than protecting themselves form an escaped mass murderer shows how immature they are compared to Hermione.

All the faults that she has (arrogance, etc), Harry and Ron have ten fold. Anyway, would you really want her to not be bossy or arrogant? That would just make her a complete Mary Sue --- Intelligent, modest, powerful, loyal and brave.

Ultimately, we can't convince each other obviously. To each his (or her) own. I will point out that she is the favorite (or close to favorite) character of almost every Potter fan I've met.

********* I think you're really exaggerating the universal Hermione love that you've experienced, or maybe you've chanced into being surrounded by mostly her fans. Shes definitely not universally hated by any means but plenty of people dislike it her. She was a top fav of mine for a long time but ive become increasingly ambivalent towards her at least from a ff point of view.

I do think Quoba is limiting himself by seeming to universally disregard any fic with her involvement but the consumption of Fanfictions definitely a highly personal thing and i have found myself disregarding certain fics for specific criteria like that too. Fanfictions both great and terrible cause the authors can impose so much of their own will onto a character that it can change you're view of said character in the long term.

Definitely possible. But she /does/ feature near the top in pretty much all online favourite character polls and such that I've seen. I believe [[http://m.imgur.com/yuqeZXx][she was second in this sub's survey]] at 33%. Harry was first at 35%. And after these two, there was a large drop off for Luna at 23%, indicating that Harry and Hermione are head and shoulders above others in this sub --- something I've noticed in most places. Curiously, the usually popular Snape doesn't seem that well like here.
