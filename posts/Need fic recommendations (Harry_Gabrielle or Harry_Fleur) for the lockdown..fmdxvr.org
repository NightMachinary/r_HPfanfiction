As the title says, I need something to do/read while I'm stuck at home for the Corona lockdown. I like the pairings of Harry/Gabrielle (with the caveat of Gabrielle being aged-up to not be creepy) and Harry/Fleur.

Things I like:

- Easily digestible writing style.
- Slow-burn in serious fics, whirlwind-romance as comedy.
- Lengthy and/or ongoing stories.

Things I dislike:

- Overly dark/depressing story tone.
- Character bashing/derailment, including Evil!Dumbledore, Dark!Harry, etc.
- Stories that haven't updated in a long time but aren't completed.

My favourites so far are:

- Hope and Healing ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13855500/chapters/31870299]]), a wonderful Harry/Fleur fic. Starts from the fourth book and deals realistically with the "abusive Dursleys" issues.
- Harry Potter and the Power he Knows Not ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160344/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Power-He-Knows-Not-Book-1-The-Reluctant-Champion]]) which is a Harry/Gabrielle fic. Starts from the 4th book, with deviations (Harry couldn't save Sirius in this one) and goes on from there.
- The Harry/Gabrielle stories by Jeconais. ([[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]]), which are post-Hogwarts. Jeconais enjoys tying in Arthurian mythos, and deviates a lot from the later canon books.

I've tried to read A Cadmean Victory ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/A-Cadmean-Victory]]), but it falls under the "overly dark/depressing story tone" complaint for me. I couldn't get through it.

EDIT: Clarifying "dark" a little bit.

EDIT 2: Thought it might be useful to explain my current favourites in a little more detail for any interested parties. Those fics are along the lines of what I'm looking for.


** Linkffn(Twelve Days by TheEndless7) is the best Harry/Gabrielle I've read. It's post Hogwarts and not very long.

Also, your flair should be Request instead of Recommendation

*** Fixed the flair. I think I remember Twelve Days having quite a bit of Ginny-bashing, but I'll give it a re-read. Don't remember it 100% off the top of my head.

EDIT: I'm misremembering. It was another fic that had the Ginny-bashing - while Twelve Days does have her get addicted to something and do the jealous-ex thing, it's not quite as bad as the fic I can't remember the name of. That one had her outright try to kill Gabrielle.

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

***** "No graphic torture or anything like that"

... Whoa nelly. I think I need to brush up on the fanfic community's idea of "dark" given that response. A story doesn't have to feature graphic gore, torture, rape and/or murder to be dark. If written with enough emphasis on the negative emotions, a purely vanilla breakup can be dark.

I'm guessing my definition of "dark" would be more in the line of what you probably meant by "solemn".

From that, I'm assuming this is a crackfic with a side of womanizing Harry. I'll give it a read but that wasn't exactly what I was hoping for.

EDIT1: Less harshing.
