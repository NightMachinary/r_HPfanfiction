By far my favorite Harry/Daphne story in years, the characterization is completely on point, the plot is really cool, and the ending is great.

Don't be turned off by the contract aspect of the story, it's what makes it so good.

** I read a couple of chapters several months ago. What I didn't like was that Daphne had no choice but to date him. Well, there was a choice - marry him or date him. Compared to Harry who could break the contract at any point. I know that it is addressed couple of times in the starting chapter. Harry does have his doubts. But really? Forcing someone to date you? Who does that?

And there was this (alluded) part that James mentioned in the contract - that the contract was only valid if Daphne was certain 'sizes'. It's like "my son won't marry your daughter. Unless she's super hot. In that case, yeah, he can own her." (and yes, 'ownership' was the word used in the contract) Really? Let alone the whole treating someone like an object, but there's no way Lily would have gone for that.

I guess the second point boils down to the contract part of the plot - which didn't make it good at all for me.

That aside, the writing is pretty good. It is very engrossing - reason for which I read several chapters before giving up. The characterisation is interesting. It's not cannon. But none of them is like super-perfect. Each of them has their own flaws and qualities.

*** I feel like they addressed the fact that Harry was a huge asshole for doing that pretty well. Seems to be a part of the plot. They talk about it a bit in the beginning and a little more later on, and at the end of the day I never found it too terribly outside Harry's apparent character and motivations.

James and Lily buying off on the contract was a bit outside of my suspension of disbelief as well. Plus there was a scene where Daphne reflects on how hard it was to meet the physical requirements of the contract and that was a little too disturbing for what was meant to be a throw away joke IMO.

Overall I think the good points outweigh the bad especially in the trope ridden wasteland that is H-D fics.

** linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) for those who want a ffnbot link, or downloads or whatever.

A fun fic, plays with contracts, Ice Queen-ish (phrase never actually used, but gives the feeling all other fics fail to), a sneaky Harry, fun worldbuilding and a celebration of things fathers do for us.

4/5, 9/10, 6/7. Worth a read.

** Not the worst fic, not the best. Definitely rises above the 99%, but there are things that detracted from my enjoyment, such as the way action is written. Way too much detail, which in turn slows down the action. Above average, not quite up in the "good" category.

** I'm looking forward to reading this, but I'm apparently I'm incapable of reading fanfiction right now. I think the coffee is making me cantankerous. Once I got passed feeling like

#+end_quote

and now I'm stuck at

#+begin_quote
  He never planned to stay a simple Auror forever, of course
#+end_quote

Harry doesn't really do plans. At least, he didn't when he was younger. Of course, he can and probably did change and mature and all that. But I doubt canon Harry thought past becoming an Auror. So claiming he always viewed becoming an Auror as a stepping stone is sitting wrong with me.

** It was a fun read, I just never really understood /why/ the contract was made in the first place. We don't have a ton of honest-to-goodness canon personality for James and Lily, so I would have liked a little more time spent on explaining why they would have done such a thing. James "looking out for Harry" was a cute gag, but seriously, why'd he do it? Why'd Lily go along with it?

I can buy a legal marriage contract because those things have existed and in a smaller scale still exist today, and this is hardly the most obnoxious use of the trope I've seen. But I would assume that most people would be a bit more curious if they found themselves in one.

There's no way this could have been going on behind the scenes in the Canon books, it would have come up.

Remember sluggys party where that guy wants to write Harry's biography, in those kind of business networking party's marriage contracts would have come up.

There would have been girls in tears in the great hall when they find out they have to marry someone they hate.
