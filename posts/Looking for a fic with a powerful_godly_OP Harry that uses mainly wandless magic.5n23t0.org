As the title suggest, I'm looking for any fic with Harry where he uses mainly wandless magic and is stronger than others. I'd prefer ships like those ; HxDG / HxHR or HxLuna. I don't mind bashing of any other character than those in the ship. And if possible if it can start where Harry is not a 11 year old OP who has a Harem.

I know i'm specific but i'm sure there are some fics that at least cover some of those areas. Thanks in advance !


** "Emperor", linkffn(5904185): Harry's wandless fiendfyre fried thousands of Spanish soldiers, greatly impressed the British military, and thus allowing him rapid rise through the ranks. MoM eventually caught on and SoS was inadvertently broken. During the ensuing chaos, Harry made his bid for power and managed to take over Britain....

*** Why not ? I mean if you are really serious about this question, the answer is because I'd like to read something with that kind of setting and I'm sure someone has already wrote something that is kinda close to what I'm looking for.

**** You have no idea how true you are.

Godlike!Harry has so many stories it's become a trope and is constantly poked fun at. You'd have better luck just searching "Lord Potter" on google.

***** Well, i'm sure there are any good fics with that setting. True that there is a lot of godlike Harry and that most aren't really good but eh, it's still one of the most complete and fun universe in which to have a powerful protagonist. On another note, do you have any suggestions for wandless harry?

EDIT : most, not must
