I, for one, have just finished A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEntrothed, and cannot seem to find motivation to do anything. After taking up nearly three full days of my life, it feels wrong to not have anything to read now. It was a beautifully written story and I'm hard pressed to find a more appealing story ark for me.

Any advice on how to recover from what could best be called withdrawal?


** Cadmean Victory put me in a slump for a few days, then motivated me to write one where I like the ending better.

What helps me is to toally switch ships. I have a few ships I like, and switching helps keep me from comparing the new story to the one I've just read. That's what usually helps me iut

*** That's a good idea. I've been wanting to try working on a Daphne/Harry fanfic for a few months now.

Any stories you'd suggest?

**** There's this really nice one shot somewhere that I can't remember the name of, but it's got Harry and Daphne but Daphne's just this ice cream nerd and it's the sweetest fic I've ever read. Honestly. It's really great and plays on the whole "ice queen" ridiculous trope by showing she's just this nerdy awkward dork that has a hard time with people, but ice cream melts her heart.

I'm still overdosing on sweetness from that fic, if you can't tell.

linkffn(Novocain)

However, both those are good enough to leave you with withdrawal, so there you go.

linkffn(Heart and Soul) is what got me into Harry/Fleur, so there's that one too.

*** I think it's not common in fanfics because they are the fix for that withdrawal from a fandom. You know the originals and are there for a fix. You need some more of that good stuff.

Obviously a well written fic will leave you wanting more of the same, or with the dreadful realisation that you only have three chapters left, but the mindset with fanfics is different to the one with original works IMO.

** The problem with A Cadmean Victory is that it sets the bar too high. But don't lose hope. I've found myself in the same situation as you several times. The trick is to actually launch yourself to the next fic with abandon. I usually start reading thinking they're not gonna be as good as the one I've just read, but often find myself immersed in that new fic's world and I invest myself in it. It usually does the trick. If you want to find good ones you can always search recommendation threads in this subreddit and save the most popular recommendations for when you finish your current one. I actually have a "stash" of fics saved for this purpose precisely.

** 1. Start writing your own fic. Think of what you liked and disliked (not necessarily in the same fic). Maybe there is a point where the plot went right but you wonder what would have happened if it went left. Explore that. Sometimes, a oneshot is enough to explore a possibility, sometimes it takes more.

2. Read something from another fandom. Or even an original work. The change of topic, themes and tropes is refreshing.

3. Do something with other media. Watch a movie. Binge a series. Play a video game. A short break with a contrast to what you have been reading will give you a different perspective and you might want to read something specific afterwards. Eg you watch Game of Thrones and then look for a Lord Potter fic (and weep because none can hold a candle to the political intrigue and brutal dream crushing of GRRM).

** I get it after fics that only defeat Voldemort. Like after all this time and these characters I want and need more! Especially if I've spent over 300k words on a new life for the characters just ending with school leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. Makes me feel like life should stop after school or what happens after is of no consequence.

** A book hangover (or fic hangover in this case) is real! It's how I know I've read something special.

After this happens I usually take a small break (going for a walk to decompress helps) and then after a day or so start something completely different. Besides fanfiction I also read a lot of novels, varying from YA to literature. I also read non-fiction, which is usually a good way to ease me out of a hangover since it's not structured around a plot in the same way as fiction usually is. Social interaction can also help me to get my head out of the story, and after that I feel more ready to start a new book/fic.

** Oh I get that SO MUCH. I'm still not over the fact that I can't find very good sci-fi stories anymore ever since reading an awesome one 3 years ago. It hurts so much because the story was so good but now I've finished it every other story of that genre feels like watery trash.

It makes me really upset because sci-fi is my faveourite genre! I wish there were more really good AND unique sci fi stories!
