One of my favorite tropes is seeing others react to the “big reveal” and so I'd love a time/dimension travel fic where the person keeps it hidden at first but then later in the story it's discovered or they're forced to reveal it. I'd prefer the reveal to not be the very last chapter since I would like to get a chance to see how people suddenly shift in how they act around the character (if at all).

Any character or pairing is fine.


** The Second String. It is one of the best time travel fics I know and Harry has some really awesome moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]] One of my favorites.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]] Another really good one.

** [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/755028][This series, hands down.]]

Of a Linear Circle starts off with a portrait in the Slytherin commons that gave Snape advice. Fast forward to the summer before Harry's fifth year where he disappears from his bedroom... and then an amnesiac portrait falls out of his painting on the following Halloween.

This story isn't written in a linear fashion (though it's a fairly logical one) and it's absolutely a slow and satisfying burn as various people figure out who the portrait is. Start here: linkao3(11284494)

This is slash, and I don't like the primary pairing. Somebody calls a certain somebody fit, and I scrunch up my nose in distaste. I scroll right by explicit scenes. And I just /cannot/ get enough of this series and am waiting with baited breath for the next chapter. Weird, huh? Don't let disliking slash stop you, this is fucking amazing on so many levels.

  In September of 1971, Severus Snape finds a forgotten portrait of the Slytherin family in a dark corner of the Slytherin Common Room. At the time, he has no idea that talking portrait will affect the rest of his life.

***** That's a tricky question because ... interesting stuff with time. Let's just say the people involved are well above the age of consent when it happens (like 30s or 40s).

  AU. Snape's first Defence lesson goes horribly wrong for Hermione when she is caught in a freak spell explosion and finds herself in a strangely altered version of the world she knows. While desperate to go back, she can't resist getting involved when she realises her memories may be the key to thwarting Voldemort's plans. But can staying lead to anything but heartbreak for her?
