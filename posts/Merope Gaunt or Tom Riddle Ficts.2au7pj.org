Just want some ficts that either focus on Merope Gaunt or ficts where she lived and raised Tom. I'm writing the latter category and need some inspiration. Ficts about Tom in school also welcome. Slash/het/gen/AU I don't care.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3221511/1/The-Right-Hand-Path][The Right-Hand Path]] by Sophiax is exactly about that. It's probably abandoned, but what is written so far is good.

*** Thanks. It looks good from the jump. Shame good ficts always get abandoned though. D:

** Try this. It's a MeropexHarry time travel fic where they raise Tom together. [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=19432][Boy Who Lived]].

*** Gah, I had actually passed this by when using filtered fanfiction. Me and time travel do not go well together...

But screw it, I guess I will check it out.
