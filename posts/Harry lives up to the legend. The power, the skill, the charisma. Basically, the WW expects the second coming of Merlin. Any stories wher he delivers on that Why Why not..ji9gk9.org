I've seen godlike Harry, I've seen darkest of the dark lord Harry. I've seen Harry raised by the founders/Merlin/Elves/etc... What i've never seen is that everything the magical expects of him, he delivers in spades. I want him to have the power of Merlin, be a dashing, honourable hero. I want Harry Potter from Harry Potter adventures. I'm not expecting a Harry that has saved a damsel at 3 from a dragon, but I want the magicals to act like he's a legend whenever they're in his presence, and he is. Crossovers welcome, any pairing welcome. Just be of decent length, either 100k+, or at least at the fourth year, or beyond.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Harry Potter is a boy with nothing. No parents, no family, unless you count the Dursleys but then who would, and nothing to believe in. Of course, this can be easily fixed by a dimension hopping dogoo and a sadistic goddess. Unfortunately for the Wizarding World, she made a lasting impression on young Harry.

I highly recommend also Basilisk-born (it is masterpiece!!) Linkffn(10709411). This is not marked as exactly dark!Harry but Harry is definitely darkish.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** Linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries) is not exactly that (since it is a WBWL, and so Harry doesn't /have/ much of a legend to speak of), but he really does live to even the wildest of those supposed books.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, & the TWT in a way you have never seen. Alterate Universe.

*** I make it a habit to steer clear of robst stories. It's always the same old boring formula. On a first read through, it's fun enough I guess, but it gets real old real fast. His fics are what early fanfic reader me enjoyed. I prefer more meat on my bones these days with the occasional OP self-indulgent fics, and those I prefer Naruto, or Worm.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence. (DISCONTINUED)
