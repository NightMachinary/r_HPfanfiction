Hello humans! I am looking for a copy of a pretty popular fanfiction called "Sugarquills" by ShellyK. The only caveat is that I am looking for the multi-chaptered version that was once on Checkmated.com's bedchamber section before ShellyK removed all of her work. Does anybody have a copy of this saved anywhere? Also, if this is tagged or formatted inappropriately please let me know. (I did not see any applicable flair tag and I am not trying to be lazy, I promise!).

Also, less important but I am also looking for a copy of Merida a Medianoche by Lady Serpentina, but I am DYING to re-read Sugarquills. It was one of my favorites back in the day.
