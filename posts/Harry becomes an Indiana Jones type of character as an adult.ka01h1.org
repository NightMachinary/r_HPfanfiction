** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-Atlantis][Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis]] is exactly about that. You may need to read its prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]] to get a better idea of this universe

** There's one about a Cursebreaker Harry who leads a team of OC cursebreakers into a heavily booby-trapped pyramid. It includes a 20-year old Teddy as part of his crew.

I can't remember the name of it, but I'll search around and see if I can find it.

** Some of the curse-breaker Harry stories might be interesting, unless you are really dead set on that specific crossover.

I guess neither of these are really "as an adult" but they get the feel I think.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
