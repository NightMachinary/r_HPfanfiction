** HPMoR. I really can't get into it. I have tried so many times to sit down and read it, but I can't. It's really not my cup of tea. Though that's not really hate as such, I guess.

Harry Crow... Don't even get me started on why I dislike that fic. But I'll just give you two words as a clue though: Gary Stu.

****** I wouldn't call it a bias against Transhumanism so much as resistance to fanaticism that in this case is coming from transhumanists who are big fans of EY and his disturbingly-popular work in our playground.

There are (or were, before they shifted to their own subreddits) so many people that would gush about the story and how it was better than any other fanfiction not to mention superior to the author's original work that the mere scent of their drooling makes us twitch.

"Yeah, we went out for pizza the other day--"

"OMG! Did you ever have a better pizza than DiGiorno's?! It's impossible! Nothing comes close!"

"I was just talking about this restaurant. They had a nice Tiramisu--"

"How could you possibly want that- it's no where near as nutritional and well-balanced a food as a DiGiorno pizza! They use tomatoes /and/ cheese. Plus- oMG the spices!"

"Er... ignore him. Did you have wine with it?"

"A cheap but tasty Merlot."

"You guys are just alcoholic drunks talking about that. DiGiorno won't sell wine, 'cause you're drunks."

'Um... what?"

"I had a DiGiorno pizza- a new one, with chicken that was just released. I was on the chat board for DiGiorno last week and someone made a joke about 'it tastes like chicken'- which is doesn't, but anyway do you think they read the boards and that's why they now make a chicken DiGiorno pizza?"

"Y'know, chicken has been put on pizza before."

"Not like this. I don't even know if you're just being theoretical about that- sure, someone /could/ have put chicken on pizza before."

"They have it at that restaurant I was talking about."

"UGH! Do you ever shut up about your stupid restaurant? No one else has been there. It's not like a national chain- I can't get it in the supermarket. What a freak."

It's a subreddit about Harry Potter fanfiction, which aside from the EY/Methods association has very little to do with transhumanism as an ideology.

********** Ah- you misunderstand me. It isn't a fair association, since most of the fanatics have long since migrated to more welcome shores but there is the lingering fear in the minds of those who experienced it at the height of the MoR popularity, such that newer visitors pick up on their (for lack of a better word) bigotry and reflect it as well.

Not saying transhumanism is an invalid topic or philosophy, nor that it doesn't deserve an audience. We just don' lahk their taype around these parts, 'cause it reminds us of the dark days.

******** I guess transhumanism simply isn't something many people like to think about or discuss, much less in fanfiction.

I, myself, am a fanatic transhumanist, but do I believe MoR is the /best/ fic because it promotes transhumanism? No! Do I approve of the message of MoR more than any other fic? Being a transhumanist, of course I do. However, that doesn't make the fic objectively /better/ - agreement or disagreement with a set of ideas postulated by an author does not, in any way, determine the writing quality of a fic. We must look at fics objectively.

And on that topic, transhumanism feels depressing at time. Any transhumanist will understand what I mean - we know our goals will come to pass, but we don't know if that will happen in our lifetime. And that's a /super/ depressing thought for us - I read fanfiction to distance myself from reality. Born too early for immortality, but born just in time to realize the dream of transhumanism? It sucks, and it's quite unfortunate.

Once you consider that, it's a bit easier to see why people might not want to think about transhumanism. It is certainly a goal worth pursuing, and one I plan on dedicating my life to, but it does not bring pleasant thoughts when thinking realistically about our own lifetime.

******* Five major categories of reasons that I can think of:

- Many religious people have a theological objection to this sort of thing (calling it "playing God", and all).
- Many social justice oriented people are concerned that these technologies will only benefit the wealthiest and the most powerful. (Immortality is a pretty good way to get around inheritance taxes, no?)
- In general, many people aren't comfortable being asked to think about themselves as just another biological system, about death as an engineering problem, etc..
- Many with disproportionate influence on our culture often dislike these ideas, for reasons known only to them. (The most prominent example I know is /Star Trek/ series' uniformly negative treatment of transhumanist concepts, and also [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/][see this comic]].)
- People who promote these ideas are often (not always!) rather unpleasant, perhaps because most people who are pleasant about promoting their ideas are in the previous bullet point's camp.

For example, in /Star Trek/, if you use cybernetics superior to human biology to compensate for a congenital impairment, you're Geordi LaForge; but if you /dare/ to use cybernetics superior to human biology to exceed normal human capabilities, You Are Borg.

Use human genetic engineering to compensate for developmental disabilities?

***** You're right! I didn't phrase that correctly. Let me elaborate:

I didn't find the writing particularly bad. Perhaps because it was one of the first major fics I read and I didn't have high standards for fanfiction at all. It was interesting to see someone involve transhumanist ideas in Harry Potter - that, along with some sci-fi references, kept me going. I liked the colorful descriptions of magic, and the clever solutions to some problems seemed novel for someone new to fanfiction. The /actually/ competitive student battles were fun to read, and one of my favorite parts of the fic. It combined one of my favorite parts from one of my favorite books - Dragon Army from Ender's Game - with Harry Potter. The intrigue surrounding Quirrell was nice. I liked Harry's relative intelligence and I felt that many characters were characterized well. The Harry/Draco interaction was something new to me, but still intriguing. The divergence from canon was nice. I liked reading an intelligent protagonist.

In summary, worse fanfictions exist. As I wasn't as picky about writing quality as I am now, and I found the plot relatively interesting, I didn't have a problem with it. In regards to the donation issue, I really didn't notice or care. Even today, I would take MoR over the thousands of canon-rehashes that populate the HP fandom. Furthermore, even though I try to be unbiased while reading fics, the fact that the fic was firmly rooted in transhumanism probably caused me to gloss over some shortcomings, as I was excited to see how EY would handle it. I also read the fic quite quickly (300-400ish WPM) because it was so damn long.

That said, better fics do exist, and many fics in the DLP Library blow this out of the water. And while MoR may not hold up to them, I think many of the criticisms are exaggerated or overdone. The vast majority of fics in the HP fandom suck - and I think MoR was so-so, it was /alright/ - when I first read it, it was even /enjoyable/. It certainly doesn't deserve to be lumped in with the rest of them, I think.

But perhaps that's just me.

** Oh God Not Again!

It had a few funny moments. Otherwise it was a complete 'do over' fic with almost zero deviation from canon. Some stories that stick to canon can be pretty good, but when it has to bend itself in loops to avoid its own deviations, then it's a bad story (Umbridge just happening to send dementors to the Hufflepuff quidditch game in third year).

The characters weren't likeable, except Gilderoy.

The worst is how Harry's thoughts often broke the 4th wall, were used to address reviews, and acted as authors notes. Especially when it was to fill plot holes that came about because they were trying to stick to canon so closely.

The reason I dislike it is just the endless darkness; not everything has to be or can be a picnic in bright meadows, I realize that, but that just sapped my will to read on.

There are others that are popular that I've never managed to summon up to the will to read, as well, like Applied Cultural Anthropology. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that fic, just that I found Hermoine pretty boring in canon and reading fanfic has made that into active dislike.

**** Firstly - I'm not calling these kinds of stories simplistic, I'm saying they are far too bloated.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom is longer than The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and the Silmarillion combined. It's longer than all seven Harry Potter books. This story, while AU, does build on the Harry Potter world. It's far too long, even for a massive AU.

Although it is perhaps has a bit more consistent story-telling than my other examples.

Most of these stories have no end point. Even a fantasy story so far removed from storytelling tropes like A Song of Ice and Fire has overarching plot and a discernible start and end.

It doesn't have anything to do with simplistic plot or good vs evil. If your story is four time as long as it needs to be, no one serious will read it. Writing cohesively is a skill, and a skill that most fanfiction authors seem to lack.

***** I'll agree with you on most fanfic authors having one issue after another, but I argue only for PotDK. It's an adult, hugely AU version of Harry Potter. It's to be expected that it's going to be longer than a child's version. Have you seen the word count for other adult series? WoT is about 4.5 million words. It's could stand to lose a bit of that, but it's still considered a height of fantasy. So is the Malazan Book of the Fallen, which comes in at 3 million+ words only with the main ten book series. For your own example, each of Tolkien's works that you mentioned is relatively short and there's only five of them. Besides that, you can't point to one series, say it took x words/pages to be complete, and then say others are too long because they take more. Difference stories take difference amounts to be complete.

I don't know if you were trying to say that PotDK doesn't have an end point, or you just meant others, but it certainly does. The entire fic has been building to one great final conflict to determine the fate of the world in relation to Harry, Voldemort, and Dumbledore. It's slowly and surely been building towards that, with much of the wordbuilding pushing it in that direction and serving to make it more complex.

I also like "New Me" by the same author. I will say that the characterization of Dominique Weasley in "New Me" is one of my favorites. For whatever reason, most FF.net authors have decided that Dominique has lots of issues with her family, which makes for some decent conflicts.

Harry Crow is in my opinion rather cringeworthy, read a few of the first chapters of it, and I just couldn't continue, the Goblins being nice to Harry is just a terrible cliche. Combine that with what seemed to be dumbledore bashing, and well you have a story I severely dislike/borderline hate as much as HPMOR.

To Shape and Change, time-travel and severitus, and if I recall correctly it also includes parselmagic or some such fanon concept. Enough to make me hate the fic even though I've only read a few chapters.

To quote myself from an earlier post, imagine, for a moment, an AU of PoA told from Draco's perspective, describing how he first successfully manipulated those around him into sentencing Buckbeak to be executed, then, in an awesome gambit, simultaneously got Sirius Black captured and Kissed, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger expelled and their wands snapped for attempting to aid in Black's escape and for Time-Turner abuse (thus making himself next in line to inherit the Black fortune), and, in the end, Buckbeak's execution was only delayed by a day; and it's all told like it's the funniest thing ever, and there aren't any permanent negative consequences to the protagonist: somehow, people like him and trust him just as much as before.

While I couldn't finish /LL&LL/ for much the same reasons, I would argue that there are at least a few stories falling nearer the middle of the spectrum between MRA screeds and "on the booklists for uni womyn's studies courses." As a case in point, linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) is a very sharp, Ginny-centric, near-canon-rehash story that does quite the opposite of demeaning or disempowering women.

For instance, if a story has five male characters for every female character, that is probably due to sexism, all things being equal. This is still true if every female character in the work is powerful and respected.

Since we're starting with the Harry Potter series, which is something like 80% male (over 79% of gendered terms in it were masculine), it's harder to pinpoint whether insufficient representation is the fault of the source material or the fan fiction author.

You know what hurts people? When they see that people like them /never/ get to be in a particular role, in fiction or in their personal experiences, and they take the hint society is shoving at them and realize that they aren't allowed to choose that role for themselves. That's why Martin Luther King Junior [[http://www.techtimes.com/articles/73455/20150731/civil-rights-leader-mlk-convinced-lt-uhura-stay-star-trek.htm][urged Nichelle Nichols to stay on Star Trek]] when she wanted to leave, and [[http://today.duke.edu/2013/10/maejemison][seeing Lt Uhura on television inspired Mae Jemison to become an astronaut]].

Fiction's also entertainment, of course. Entertainment isn't a luxury; it's one of the things that makes life worth living. If all your entertainment says that you can't be the hero, that people like you aren't worth talking about, it stops being a balm and instead becomes a source of stress.

The tactic you are employing doesn't serve to redirect energy to more fruitful topics. It is designed to silence people. If you had an honest complaint, you would be able to articulate a specific problem I'm exacerbating, or a specific way in which I am impeding efforts to ameliorate sexism. You would possibly even offer a more fruitful (in your opinion) way of combating sexism. But you're not. You're just telling me to shut up.

You don't get to play that line when you've explicitly denied it in this very thread. You're /not/ about heroism or fair treatment of women in fiction. By your own admission in your response to my original posts, you're about how many women vs. how many men.

You're about numbers, about loading a fic into a reader and counting how many 'he' vs. 'she, 'his' vs. 'hers,' not about reading what's actually written.

"What hurts people" is when feminism is turned into a punch line, when stories showing women as heroic, strong, independent, and important are somehow branded 'sexist' because (arbitrary) reasons.

You want a solution to gender bias? Do as my wife and fight tooth and nail every single day for workplace equality. Don't spend energy on pronouns, spend it on progress. Fight for equal pay and equal status for equal work. Volunteer for politicians and ballot initiatives that matter. Join professional organizations that steward women in underrepresented fields (STEM, e.g.). Get an attorney and sue when some gormless jackass in the workplace gropes your ass. Mentor junior women in your place of work and teach them to be strong. Insist on fair treatment at the negotiation table. Insist on a fair representation of women when screening candidates for a job, not characters in a silly fanfiction story. Show by your goddamned competence that nobody had /ever/ treat you as anything less than a serious person simply because of your gender. /That's/ how you make change, not tossing around 'sexist' epithets.

I'm not telling you to shut up, I really am not. But I do think that you're sabotaging the very cause you profess to believe in. (Honestly, I'm starting to wonder whether you may in fact be an MRA troll, in which case, well played.)

No, I said it wasn't enough to just have the hero be a woman. It isn't sufficient to avoid sexism to have one woman that is competent.

When you only have a small number of women in a work, each woman bears a larger portion of the burden of representation. Have only one female character and if she's vain you're denigrating the entire gender. Have only two and one is weak and you're implying that women tend to be weak. If you have a large cast of women, each one can have their own virtues and vices and foibles and that problem goes away.

Harem fics would meet your single most important criteria for being 'non-sexist.' That's an obvious sign that your metrics are not right.

By embracing token gender representation foremost among all literary criteria, you play to some of the most persistent and tedious MRA/RWA complaints: "Quotas over qualifications, wah." By insisting that /any/ story that doesn't strictly meet these numerical criteria is necessarily 'sexist,' even if "every female character in the work is powerful and respected," and therefore is unreadable, you present an easy (and easily lampooned) foil to your definition of 'sexism.'

If changing minds is your goal, I think you'd be more effective saving your ire for the handful of fics that are truly deserving and not go after, say, Lady Altair's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] (an undeniably great piece of writing that "suffers" from a somewhat male-heavy cast and male lead character).

Token representation is typically found by including one character from an underrepresented group. You get one gay guy or one woman or one person of color. One of the problems with token representation, as I just told you, is that you have a character who must represent that entire demographic. Another problem is that the token character can be irrelevant to the story. Worse, the character's demographic can be played for laughs.

I'm not a fan of tokenism.

If you force yourself to write a whole cast from underrepresented groups, you are forced to make them interesting characters with depth. You are forced to make them important to the story. The alternative would be to write a story with no interesting characters.

That is Harry Potter fan fiction. It inherits the representation problems of Harry Potter. It's also only 1600 words long and features only four words of dialog and almost no action. The problem isn't that my filters are outrageously restrictive; it's that they are designed for novel-length fiction.

Besides, that fic has /good/ gender representation.

You may have been confused because Dennis is the only one who does anything, but Dennis isn't there as a character as much as a frame to show everyone else.

***** I disagree with the idea that an individual work is sexist for lack of representation; this is a distinction I've tried to make before in this sub that wasn't understood. I think the lack of representation in stories overall and the lack of recognition for minority-led stories is an issue of sexism. There needs to be more diverse stories, which is not necessarily less non-diverse stories, although ideally that would happen too.

Stories with sexist ideas are still sexist, of course. Stories with poorly written female characters are bad writing and such flaws shouldn't be handwaved away, as they often are. But stories with great female characters and just not a great number of them? I don't see anything wrong with that.

  I disagree with the idea that an individual work is sexist for lack of representation. I think the lack of representation in stories overall
#+end_quote

If I can't criticize any one work for having insufficient representation, how can I push people to change? Your position lets you feel like you're not contributing to the problem, but it doesn't let you try to make anyone change. In the end, it supports the status quo and opposes change.

I push /everyone/ who has insufficient representation, and a tiny fraction of them change by a small amount, and then we still have insufficient representation.

******* I think the conversation becomes too much around "how much is enough diversity" in this approach. There are too many categories--gender, sex, race, culture, class, able-bodiedness, and so on. It's a good writer's responsibility to read and write diversely, because it's better writing to look beyond your nose and discourage stereotypes, but most of the time I don't feel like it's productive to talk about diversity at this individual level. I understand how it seems to dilutes the responsibility, but I also dislike how often these conversations focus so much on one person and one example.

I definitely find issue with inflated praise and hype for media that largely appeals only to those of the default demographic (white straight able-bodied male). And that same movie might have stereotypical female or non-white characters, but the flaws are treated like they're minor. Great diverse stories are out there already, but they're talked about less, they don't get as much marketing, they're whitewashed (Hunger Games), or there's stigmas attached ("issue books", "chick lit", "black stories"). They're often criticized for being not relatable because of their non-default qualities. Getting these stories better recognition is another way to get sufficient representation out there.

Are you portraying a historical period from the real world? Start with the demographics that existed there. Is it speculative fiction? Your audience's demographics are a good starting point.

**** I am not [[/u/tries_to_explain]], but I think that the problem that he or she is talking about is not about sexism being a deliberate part of the setting (though there is little evidence of that in canon in the first place) but the /author's/ sexism affecting the author's decisions about what to do in the story. Some elements that show up pretty often:

- Ginny being slut-shamed by the narrative for dating men other than Harry; when Harry doing the same thing is not.
- Generally, weakening female characters and taking away what canon initiative and personality they had, often in order to set up a romance. For example, in many, many Dramione fics, Hermione's personality is stripped, reducing her to a flighty and naive bookish ingénue; while Draco becomes a suave rich badboy. (Surprisingly often, said badboy also ends up schooling said ingénue in some academic matter.)
- Doubly so in harem fics.
- Hermione (in particular) unable or unwilling to stand up for herself, until her soon-to-be-love-interest (usually Harry) begins Defending Her Honor, often without her permission or even knowledge.
- The plot device wherein romantic female lead (usually Hermione) is attacked (usually in an attempted rape), where she is unable or unwilling to defend herself using magic, and is rescued *by* (Edit: Typo) her soon-to-be-love-interest (usually Harry) in the nick of time.
- Alternatively, a situation where the villain's first impulse upon subduing a female character is to attempt rape her, even if he has much better things to do (because, for example, they are on an active battlefield). (Sexism can be against male characters too.) Surprising and overcoming a villain doing that are often the /only/ combat victories a female character gets in the story.
- Male characters (often Snape) being sexually assaulted being played for laughs. (Ditto on sexism against males.)
- Female characters only ever physically attacking male characters with groin shots; and general reluctance to have male and female characters engaged in a pitched /magical/ battle, while making magical duels between male characters the centerpiece of the story.

It's important to note that much of the time, the authors who use these tropes don't actually /intend/ to degrade their female characters or bash them. For example, in all evidence, the Harmonians and Dramionists that use the above tropes tend to /like/ Hermione.

I've read one story that has sexism part of the setting and not part of the author: linkao3(In Loco Parentis). Have a read. Compare it with, say, robst's work, or muggledad's, where the sexism is in the author and the author refuses to consider any woman as a real person rather than a caricature from a wet dream.

The story is set in the UK at a period when the age of consent was eighteen for m/m and sixteen for m/f sex\. It's my intention and belief that all the sex in the story is depicted as taking place between fully consenting adults, even when it is ill\-advised\.Thanks to my generous and able beta\-readers; I disregarded many of their suggestions, so if this story is flawed, it's my fault, not theirs\.

I explicitly mentioned that it's hard to judge fan fiction according to representation, and the problems I brought up that you were responding to were about characterization rather than the amount of representation.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Canon leaves a lot of characters sketchy so you can read whatever you want into them. It hints; it rarely tells. So you can imagine them as being from all walks of life, and while canon allows for that, it doesn't support it.

What walks of life does Harry Potter canon omit that are reasonably common and commonly ignored in England?

- Any sexuality besides heterosexual. Dumbledore's got vague hints, but that's nowhere near enough to be considered representation.
- Romani and Jews.
- Black women. The books mention that Kingsley Shacklebolt is black, I believe, and Lee Jordan's described hairstyle is associated with black people, but no women are described as black. (The movies are better about this, though of course Lavender Brown had to change into a white girl when they were about to film her making out with Ron.)
- Muslims.
- Transgender people.

And that's only the ones that are common in England.

It's a far cry from all walks of life. The only ones represented by characters with significant screen time (as it were) are middle-class Muggles and poor purebloods, and that's just two characters.
