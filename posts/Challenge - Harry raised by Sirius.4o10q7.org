** The hardest part of this challenge is finding a plausible way for Harry not to turn into a cocky asshole. It's hard not to see that outcome with being raise by Sirius.

*** Yeah I always think Sirius raised Harry fics are poorly characterized by nature. Dumbledore was absolutely right that a kid growing up as the Boy-Who-Lived would go to someones head. Sirius would just compound this I think.

Doesn't mean its a bad idea, and there are surely a lot of things that could counteract this without being convoluted.

**** Being raised in the Muggle world was the right call, just not the muggles who raised Harry. They were the bottom of the barrel of humanity.

I would like to see a fic about Harry being raised by his maternal grandparents.

**** only because his fame was written so out of proportion in cannon, completely irrational.

*** So are you one of those who believe he should have been raised by Snape?

** This sounds like a dime-a-dozen, seen it a thousand times before, tedious drudgery of a fic.

You know what really annoys me about this idea? It isn't even that it's clich√© - I can deal with that. It's that it takes Harry Potter as a character and ruins him for me. What makes Harry great is that he comes from a shitty environment, and ends up great anyway. It ties into the whole theme of one's choices defining them.

It's meant to highlight how much of a better person Harry is in comparison to Voldemort - who was raised in a similar way.

So yeah, this idea is stupid, I've seen it before, and I hate it. Also, tumblr is the cancer of the internet. That's not really relevant, just felt like saying it.

*** Also, just because I find it odd that people think this is a revolutionary concept, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Sirius-and-Remus-raise-Harry/62182/][here]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Black/93203/][here]] - those are two communities based around this premise. This is literally one of the most common story ideas on ff.net. Here's a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3152469/1/Paddy-s-Little-Pup][link]] to a fic following this concept with over 2k favorites.

"Harry raised by Sirius and Remus" is about as new an idea as "Harry travels back in time to save everyone that died."

Am I missing something here? Please, someone explain if I am. Because I don't get this.

**** Honestly? The idea that Sirius only writes to Harry in the medium of Howlers is kind of amusing, but that's it. Don't know why people were downvoting you, you're about as right as you can possibly get.
