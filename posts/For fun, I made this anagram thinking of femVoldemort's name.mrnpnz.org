So first, the "O" and the "R" for Lord, I replace them with the "A" and the "Y" so that now it can be written "I am Lady Voldemort".

I change the letters of "Tom mavol ya" (so as not to change the surname), and this is the result. What do you think?

Ava Tommy Riddle.

But, there is a problem... I don't know where to put the "L" and the "O". Does anyone know where to put those?


** My fem!Voldemort (from a old fic I wrote a couple years ago) was named “May Molatov Riddle”. I have no idea what ‘Molatov' is supposed to be, but it sounded cool to 16 year old me lol (I did not come up with this name on my own, I copied it from somewhere, probably tumblr)

*** It sounds inspired by a Molotov cocktail, which seems appropriate.

** I brainstormed a little... Most of these middlenames are nonsense though. Also lots of Nordic names cause I'm Scandinavian so that's what comes the easiest to me

AA L MM OO T V Y

ALMA VOTMYA RIDDLE\\
Alma (from Latin for "nourishing", also Spanish for "the soul" and Hebrew "young woman")\\
Votmya / Tova-My /this 100% could be a real name. "Y" - and thus My - is difficult to pronounce for Brits and other English speakers though/

YLVA MOTAMO RIDDLE\\
Ylva (Nordic, from "Ulf" meaning wolf)\\
Motamo / Tamomo / Momota

MOLVA TAMOY RIDDLE\\
Molva\\
Tamoy / Maoty / Tymoa

MAY MOLVATA RIDDLE\\
May\\
Molvota / Lova Tom /lol Merope just chucked Tom's name in there cuz she loved him so much? Lova is a real name though/

MOA MOLVATY RIDDLE\\
Moa (Swedish, unknown meaning)\\
Molvaty

I kinda like the sound of Alma Votmya but I would personally probably rename Voldemort to something else (if I were to write a fem!Voldy story), to get a name which meaning fits the character.. the names in HP are very fun with lots of different meanings and hints about the character (like Albus meaning light, Tom meaning twin while he's so lonely and also it's a common name which ofc Voldy despises, /Remus Lupin/...)

*** Whoever wants to make anagrams will surely get interesting or made-up names. Or they can always call fem! Tom "Tomasina Merope / Marvolo" or something like that.

*** Well, it doesn't have to be an anagram. Fem! Tom could have substituted letters and (etc.) to create her name.
