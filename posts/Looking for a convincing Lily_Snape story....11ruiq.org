I'd really love to read a AU story where Lily and Severus got together. Any suggestions would be great!


** The only one that I know is actualy worth it is this one. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6306296/1/]]

** I've quite enjoyed this fic: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=250668][Unwritten]] . A bit deux ex machina-ish but very good quality writing.

** This is so old but if you're still looking, there's a fantastic fanfiction if you can find it called "There is no such place." Trouble is, I think ffnet deleted it during their mass deletion of doom years ago. And it's not complete, ending on the most terrible cliffhanger. But was written was amazing IMO. It captured a more dark and possibly more realistic spirit of Hogwarts. Full of politics and a more angsty Snape.
