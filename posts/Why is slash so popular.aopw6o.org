Or more specifically, why do you like slash? From what I understand, slash is suppose to cater to young women. I don't quite see why slash would be interesting to women. Is it an acquired taste? I find it hard to imagine Harry being with Snape, for example. It's just too out of character. I think, however, that it would be similar to how guys find lesbians appealing.


** I like slash for exactly the same reasons I like het: I might like the dynamics, chemistry between the characters, or I'm interested in exploring the possibilities of how the relationship between characters A and B would go, or I just find the two characters hot together.

Also not all slash fics are smut or even focused primarily on romance. I like many slash fics for their plot, writing, or individual character development, just like with het. In fact, I'm writing one myself, a plot-centric post-Hogwarts fic about Harry investigating a disappearance of a student undercover as a Divination Professor. It's also a (much dreaded here) Snarry.

Nobody feels the need to point out how Harry/Bellatrix or Harry/Pansy is out of character, so how are slash pairings different? Especially considering that your usual Drarry will most probably have a redemption arc for Malfoy or assume that he changed his ways, while many het fics pairing Harry with a Slytherin will have Harry adopting "pureblood culture", "acting Slytherin" or otherwise changing him or his behaviour. And I'm not even touching how no one even bats an eye when Harry in fic is some OP sociopathic genius, for example, or a ruthless killer, or an outgoing prankster, but a slash pairing? No, clearly THAT is going too far in the out-of-character territory.

** I don't have a profound reason for it, I just like reading slash. I don't get off on it either - it's like genre preference for me.

I started reading m/m as a teen and never stopped. One story led to another... At the time slash was new to me and the stories were interesting and usually well-written, the characters compelling, so I kept on reading. With time I discovered more fandoms, saved a bunch of new fics to read, got more involved in the community. I made a lot of friends reading slash fic and BL in general, and I suppose it felt good to be surrounded by people who were far more open-minded and accepting than my peers at the time. Even so, it was mostly sheer enjoyment, minus the fetish.

I should probably mention that I saw my mom read romance novels a lot while I was growing up too. Seeing her enjoy them made me curious about reading in the first place. I don't know more than that, it hasn't mattered.

Edited clunky wording.

** It is exactly the same as why many guys find lesbians appealing. Straight girls find two guys together to be hot.

I do like slash if the pairing makes sense in some way but I'm a bisexual guy. For me it's just a pairing, whether it's gay or straight I don't really care.

** I'm a bisexual girl and I like slash because I can relate to it on some level. There is much less femslash in fanfiction than slash. I prefer femslash because it's more relatable to me, but I read slash because there's more of it. Either way, reading about a same-sex pairing makes me feel like I'm being represented in fanfiction, even if it's written by straight girls.

**** For things like Harry/Snape and Harry/Drace, is tends to follow the same formula as a lot of romance novels often do. Two people who dislike each other are, for some reason, forced into close quarters over an extended period of time. Over that time they begin to see aspects of the other person they didn't before, and perhaps a physical attraction develops, and it's so passionate and dramatic because of the conflict, and it eventually evolves into something more emotionally intimate.

Essence of drama is conflict. Those characters already have an established conflict. Plus, hot guys. It all mixes together into the archetype romance story where enemies or rivals become partners.

***** Yea, I get what you're saying. I think maybe the archetypes that some writers use to portray certain characters are types that I would not have liked in female characters either. Or maybe I have not read the good ones. It just gives me an eww feeling.

****** I don't blame you. Although I'm a straight guy, there's a couple of Slash fics I really enjoyed. I personally love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3286591/1/Learning-Life-Over][/Learning Life Over/]]. Was written before Deathly Hallows so it's cannon from HBP onwards. It's a Harry/Draco story where Harry is a workaholic and Draco decides to take certain extreme actions to teach him to enjoy life again. Got a bit of sex but it's fairly sparse, it's mainly about how they develop as people through the relationship.

** Frankly, most of the well-rounded (and well-written) characters in mainstream media are still male. If you want to read a relationship fic with existing characters, slash is your best bet.

** There is an unrepresentative porportion of LGBT members inside fanfiction communities than in reality. That's not even including that guys like woman on woman and women like guy on guy. This is also a platform where slash is accepted which encourages its creation - which further encourages new stories. A beautiful cycle.

**** Every so often there is a survey in various communities like this one. The only one I could find was for 2015, but I doubt it's changed too much since then. For those who don't read it, 17.5% of the people who did the survey were LGBT while the numbers range closer to 3-5% in developed nations like America, Canada, and Australia.

[[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x15Y7snXZIvfs1Vs7Ix017M9oGQg33yZloO4aCJaYfk/viewanalytics]]

This survey definitely isn't perfect, but it's likely to be fairly representative. I would expect the LGBT portion to go down slightly if a more accurate study was done, but I doubt it would decrease enough to make this higher LGBT rate to become negligible.

***** Thanks for the link! Out of curiosity, where was the survey posted? The demographics of fanfiction communities tend to vary greatly between websites. ([[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] is much different from Ao3, for instance.) Here are a few other demographics surveys if you are interested:

- [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3vWAgfzMRwCcFaGFYPtok8TLPMcH0GpbWauvWtlNOg5vWwQ/viewanalytics][2018 r/HPfanfiction survey]] - 834 respondents, 69.8% heterosexual

- [[http://centrumlumina.tumblr.com/post/62840006596/sexuality][2013 Ao3 survey]] (primarily spread via Tumblr) - 9,929 respondents, 29% heterosexual

On a side note, here's a nice article which discusses demographics that might explain why slash is popular: [[https://ladygeekgirl.wordpress.com/2013/11/12/why-is-there-so-much-slash-fic-some-analysis-of-the-ao3-census/][(wordpress link)]]

** It's fanfic--most anything goes for me if its written well (not underage or noncom or really heavy BDSM but pairings wise, if the writing is good I might try it!)

And I'm bisexual and honestly wouldn't find it hard to believe Harry is as well in a fic. I didn't figure my myself out till I was a bit older.

**** Well, I do prefer canon compliant stuff so realistically I don't read much at all. But for me it's more about the essence of who they are as a person and whether they would make a good match. I can't, for example, see Harry dating anyone who was interested in the dark arts, just as I can't see Hermione dating anyone like that either. So both Harry/Draco and Hermione/Draco are always going to be out for me, even if I'm reading an AU fic.

For more ambiguous people or those who we don't know who the final match is, it's more important to me that they seem like the person they were in the book. So, I like the idea of Seamus and Dean together but I wouldn't like it if they suddenly turned Seamus into some stereotype. I like the idea of Oliver Wood and Charlie Weasley, but both of them are pretty rough and ready characters so I wouldn't be interested in a fic that portrayed them as anything but outdoorsy and obsessed with Quidditch.

Both me and my husband aren't 100% straight, despite only ever being in commuted relationships with members of the opposite sex. If we had never got married and my husband had ended up with a man, it wouldn't have changed his actual character, just as my character wouldn't have changed if I had ended up with a woman.

** If it involves my favorite characters and it's there, I'll read it. Sirius and Remus are two of my particular favorite characters in the series. I enjoy their friendship dynamic. So I'll read friendship fic, and I'll read fic where they're paired with women, and I'll read WolfStar too. There happens to be more decent WolfStar than there is decent gen or het fic, so there you go.

(I'm rather bothered that the HP universe doesn't have more fleshed out female characters as options, especially in that generation.)

** For me, it comes down to characters who seem like they work together. Or, as I sometimes say, they have complementary baggage. Depending on the fandom, I'll read het, slash, femmeslash, trios, multi, etc. I have some fandoms where I'm very OTP, and others where I'll read any of a dozen or more pairings. Also, some characters read more flexibly in terms of sexuality than others.

I think in some fandoms, the slash pairings have a better signal to noise ratio in terms of quality writing because canon het pairings can be popular among inexperienced writers. The sheer volume makes it hard to find the good stuff. (Tiva in the NCIS fandom is a perfect example of this.)
