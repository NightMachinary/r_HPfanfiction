** Bears are creatures that scare people in olden days. The bear wasn't always called 'bear'. The original name is unknown, but people are scared to speak its name, so people created the name: 'the brown one' in some language. In the end, it got translated to Bear. Since the bear's name's history is like Voldemort, my suggestion is for it to be named: Triddle (tom riddle)

** A bear :D great animal. Maybe some teddy bear pun? Or other language?

I think i can help with a history tidbit, how the word changed throughout time and languages:

Hrktos (PIE) -> Arktos (proto-Greek) -> Artos (Gaulish) > Orsos (latinized) -> Ursus (Latin) -> Ours (French).

Hope you will find sth, tell us what u choose! c:

**** Hmm, okay. And I'm assuming it's the Marauders who are giving the nickname? Like, James, Remus, Peter, and Sirius? And they're still their canonish cultures? (ie. Not Indian James or Welsh Remus or such)

******** Hmm. Well, in that case, I'd say you've probably got two options. You can either go with something directly or metaphorically descriptive of the animal he turns into (ie. Padfoot, Prongs, Wormtail), or you can go with something strongly linked (ie. Moony is named for the moon that turns him, not his werewolf form).

I'd say what you should pick would depend on how you want your character to get the name - yes, the marauders will likely give him the name, but there'll be some lead-up to it that'll direct you. Does he transform to protect someone and fend off an attacker? He'd probably get a growlier, aggressive name (or a jokey Mama Bear reference). Ripclaw, but less Goblin sounding. :D Does he transform and go after a fish in a river for food? Probably something more cuddly and food-related. Salmonmaw, maybe. If there's no big event, it'll probably end up being simple and descriptive. Furnose or Grizzleclaw or something.

********** A whole bunch of different reasons. As with most things in this fandom, it probably became popular because one person did it, other people liked it (either as a story/art piece or because they felt better able to relate to a POC Harry than a white one) and then did it themselves and that just spread out. And I've heard there's a lot of draw to Harry Potter generally for Indian representation in Western Media, with the Patil twins being portrayed as actual human beings instead of caricatures, so that'd get people with those wants and desires for representation and character moving into fandom like everyone else.

There was a relatively prolific fanartist who did it a while back basically because they thought it would look good and there was nothing really stopping them (plenty of POC can be pale-ish and frankly Europeans got all over the place so there can be white and biracial people from pretty much any part of the planet these days).

There's also a slight association between India and Pottery that I've seen some people make. I'm not sure how valid that it is - I know pottery is a historical art form there, but I've no idea how 'current' that might be - but its a very English thing to nickname other cultures based on associations we make. Like certain xenophobic aspects of the British community might call the French 'Frogs' or the Germans 'Krauts' and so on.

Personally, I quite like the idea of an Indian Harry. I'm not bothered or switched off by it, and it might help someone else get more into stories or storytelling and that's a good mission. :)

*********** AH cool. That makes sense. For me it's always all of them were pale but for some reason Harry is lightly tanned. So indian sort of makes sense to me. But like both either way :)

** Don't. Nicknames for animagi was fun, when it was first time, but now it is one of the most overused tropes ever. Why in the world one could call that dog Sirius (unless, you need cover name for the prisoner on run, but that's not your case, I suppose)?
