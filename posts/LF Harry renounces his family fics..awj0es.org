I once read a fic where Harry found out he was being lied to and he magically renounced his name and people couldn't call him Potter anymore, can't remember the title though.

Any similar fic? Or similar fics to the one I'm talking about? Slash most welcome.


** There's bobmin's long oneshot /The Fall of House Potter/. That may be the one you're thinking of? It's not a challenging story full of complex characters by any stretch of the imagination, but it can be a satisfying example of the trope. linkffn(7508571). It's got a cringe-worthy Harry/Daphne relationship, but again, it's decent for what it's trying to be.

*** Thanks for the recommendation! I'll give it a read.

Never liked the Harry/Daphne pairing but I'll try to keep an open mind.

**** Yeah, I can't stand it much either. I just glanced through the story and realized it's much more cringe-worthy than I remembered, so now I'm kind of embarrassed to have rec'd it. It fits your request but...

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300/1/Black-Luminary][Black Luminary]] is a massive AU where he chooses to become a Black over a Potter which has long and lasting implications as the Blacks and other Dark Pureblood families are reviled after the fall of Grindelwald (Voldemort never rose) . As of now there is no romance and no bashing (unlike most fics with this premise/plot point) and it is a very ambitious and creative AU. The Lethifold Arc remains one of my favourites in all of fanfiction. Give it a try

** Linkffn( Wolf Lord) not exactly what you asked for but it does involve Harry going by a different name and not wanting to be Harry Potter because of everything surrounding that name
