Like what if they want to go to the Victorian Era to get to experience how people lived back then? See their town and how it was a few centuries back. Or maybe they want to go see Ancient Greece, meet a few of their idols or maybe even attend a legendary concert they missed out on because they weren't born yet! You know, /that/ kind of stuff.

It obviously doesn't have to be a time turner, anything would do, even if it doesn't fit in with the canon magic system. Time Travel is usually used to go and fix up some crap they did/save a few people/prevent Voldemort from broking Voldemort, but what if they want to use it for fun? I know it's a closely guarded secret, time travel, but I just think it's a bit fun to go back and get to experience the past.

It's obviously more of a feel-good story rather than a fleshed-out one with a full plot. However, that'd also be very welcome as long as there's an element of my original request.

Thanks in advance! :)


** Maybe not quite so, but the closest I've seen is linkffn(The Anachronistic Adventures of Patch and Eddie by nonjon), and it's a fun read, if very weird.

There are a few fics you might like that don't quite fit: linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners; The Lone Traveler)

  WIP. PostOotP. Harry gave his life to defeat Voldemort. So what should he do now? Hop through time with Dobby on some zany misadventures, of course. As if there really was an alternative.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

** There's a Doctor Who crossover I really like that has bits of this, but not all the time. They visit Elizabeth I, for instance, and hang around the palace for a while. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8187591/1/The-Savior-Child-of-the-Tardis-Son-of-a-Mad-Man]]
