Bonus if they're set in the Marauder's Era (Without James CONSTANTLY asking Lily out, as that was never stated in canon and more of a fanon thing). I always found that odd that writers did that. Also, bullying of Snape is fine, but nothing extreme. Pulling his pants down should be the most extreme bullying with Snape.

Bonus as well, if it's about Lucius and co's time at Hogwarts. But not mandatory.

It can be any other ERA as well, as long as it's canon-compliant enough.


** If you want a lotta Lucius, I've got one for you: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26862214/chapters/65540506]]

It's post-Hogwarts but still set before before the books. Technically Marauder-era I guess since Lucius is older than the Marauders and I guess they'd be in Hogwarts for most of this fic haha

I'd like to see a canon-compliant one with Lucius and co at Hogwarts too though! Will keep an eye on this thread and hope someone else suggests a good one :)

Edit: I've got another one that is farther from your requests but I can't not rec it, it's canon compliant for Voldemort's POV and just about the best thing out there right now: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11682174/chapters/26295996]]

** The author of the Innocent series, where Sirius escapes early and takes custody of Harry, has also written linkffn(White Flags by MarauderLover7), which is canon-compliant.

  Who'd have thought that the man who tore them apart was the one who brought them together? Head Girl Lily Evans is determined to keep her distance from the Marauders but that's easier said than done when James is Head Boy and in love with her. It also doesn't help that she becomes rather attached to Sirius during an eventful Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson...

** I love Northumbrian's stuff and it's all canon-compliant, but I've really only read their post-Hogwarts stories.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] - Marauder's era, follows Remus Lupin. Extremely canon compliant, the author clearly put an incredible amount of effort into the characters and setting. Like, you can /see/ how the characters' traits and dynamics with each other lead to the events of canon, it's fantastic.
