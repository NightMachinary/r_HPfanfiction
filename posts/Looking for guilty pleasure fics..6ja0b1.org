I want fics that, despite neither being top-tier nor perfectly made, are entertaining enough to be forgiven for their faults. Cliches are welcome, OP Harry is great, WBWL stories are fine. The one thing I'm not too keen on is romance, but otherwise, whatever you like despite its flaws, I want to read.


** linkffn(Basilisk-Born by Ebenbild) is probably my guilty pleasure fic.

I mean, it has manipulative!Dumbledore, lordship nonsense, creature inheritances (though technically all witches and wizards do), while I don't recall the phrase magical cores existing anywhere magic can be used up, spelling and grammar issues (though I'm fairly certain Ebenbild is a non-native speaker, so I'll give him a pass) and a whole host of other things that would make it a meh fic. However, it is really entertaining.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia and Vernon Dursley never married and they never had Dudley. Petunia has always wanted a child, a girl specifically, so when she finds Hailey Potter on her doorstep, she's ecstatic.Petunia has never been pretty like her sister Lily and she has always found it difficult to have men interested in her. All the guys she had dated had left her when they had realized that she wouldn't have sex with them before being married. Because of this experience, Petunia has convinced herself that the only way to gain men's interest is to always be willing and eager to have sex with them. Petunia teaches this to Hailey because she doesn't want 'her little girl' to become a spinster like her.Hailey - following Petunia's advice - loses her virginity at 13. She soon becomes addicted to sex, willing to spread her legs for anyone with a cock and that can give her an orgasm.When the Hogwarts letter arrives, Hailey is thrown into a very strange world where everybody there knows her name and has very set ideas on how she should be and how she should behave. They expect her to be a hero but all she has ever known is how to be a slut.

  - At 14 years old, Harry wasn't really ready for the Triwizard. If not for Hermione and Barty Crouch Jr, the poor boy would likely have done himself a whole lot of damage if left to his own devices... Of course, if not for Crouch he wouldn't have been IN the tourney, but that's another story. So, I asked myself what if things had gone a bit differently? What if his broom hadn't shown up? What if other... opportunities presented themselves?- There are those who say, if you're not cheating, you're not trying.

** linkffn(Core Threads) is a favourite despite an inconceivably OP Harry and a total lack of an overarching plot. Also, a reasonably well-written short, feel-good, "Harry defeats everybody" story that I rather liked was linkffn(Harry Potter and a grandfather's gift). I also rather like HPMOR and some of its sequel-fics (including /Revival/ and /Following the Phoenix/), though some would call HPMOR a top-tier rather than a potential guilty pleasure (it's a weird case, how that story gets treated on this sub). linkffn(Escapologist Harry) is a one-shot that has an evil Dumbledore but is otherwise a /gem/. linkffn(Dementors by Myranya) is an /old/ fic that didn't put enough thought into its premise, which is the basic "Hermione or Harry gets sent to Azkaban for a crime they didn't commit" thing that's over in one chapter, but the rest is really interesting. Finally, the agonizingly-slow-paced Lily/Snape linkffn(The Moment It Began) was still well-written enough to make me stick around till the end.
