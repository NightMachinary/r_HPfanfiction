Besides what we know in canon, where did the fan interpretation that Dumbledore was this inherently evil chess master who kept supporting some Light Magic utilitarian fascist state while managing schoolchildren? In the books Dumbledore is pulling the strings, but he seems to be well-intentioned and trying to manage the complexity of the Horcux situation with minimal options. As for having Harry live with the Dursleys, honestly who else was there? Remus is a werewolf, Sirius is in Azkaban, the distant relatives (Narcissa, Andromeda, etc) are too distant. And he is human, he has flaws as we can see from his lack of foresight in picking up the cursed ring or more obviously in trusting Grindelwald. Why did Dumbledore become the villain when Voldemort was sufficient? Does it relate to the whole Darker and edgier is better narrative? The persecution of Purebloods for being pagan idea that seems popular in fanon?


** Teenagers are arrogant. Teenagers are stupid. Teenagers hate being told what to do. Lots of fanfiction is written by teenagers. Harry is a teenager who's life is negatively affected by the adults around him. They can see themselves in Harry and Dumbledore is their controlling parents.

Dumbledore made decisions for Harry. That's probably enough for some teenagers. With hindsight, you can potentially see alternatives. If you lack the awareness to see that you needed hindsight to see the alternatives then you think that people are idiots or they're doing it out of malice. Dumbledore wanted Harry to go to the Dursleys and in the fifth book he confessed to knowing Harry wouldn't enjoy it. He hoped Petunia would be nice but it wasn't vital. He even says 'my plan was working well' -pg 737 for me chpt -The Lost Prophecy. To all those looking for malice there it is.

I'm a big fan of something called Hanlon's razor. Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

In writing things happen for narrative reasons. The trope of the idiot ball exists for a reason. Sometimes for the sake of stories people make mistakes. We have hindsight, we have read the stories and we might think people could make better choices. An arrogant person and/or one lacking self-awareness might even say we would have made better choices and therefore they should have. If you therefore look at every mistake in the series, or simply every major event but look for malice rather than a mistake then you end up with conspiracy theories.

Dumbledore in a lot of ways should have been better. He was the greatest wizard, the wisest man and all that, yet he makes a lot of mistakes. He admits it in the series. He confesses that his mistakes have bigger consequences. If you said, a man that clever can't make mistakes, then he must be doing it all on purpose because I can see that clearly this won't work out (often using hindsight to reach that conclusion). For narrative reasons Dumbledore had to take a back seat to Harry. They say surely someone as great as Dumbledore should have found ways around this? Surely therefore he wanted it all to play out like this? He even called it his plan? What gave Dumbledore the right to think he knew what was best for Harry?

A lot of evil Dumbledore is teenagers who hate the idea of being told what to do seeing Harry as someone who is constantly being controlled and told what to do. They aren't self-aware enough to accept that the are influenced by knowing what happened. They're performing results based analysis. Its a flawed method. If you looked at Dumbledore's mistakes not as mistakes but deliberate moves of malice then he might seem evil. Its easy to see conspiracies and evil if you assume that everything that goes wrong was made to go wrong by someone out to get you.

*** One point that might need to be added is that a lot of these people that Harry, being the pivot of the whole Voldemort issue, should be the primary concern in each and every of Dumbledore's considerations, that all other considerations have to take a backseat to his happiness... no, not happiness, to his unceasing bliss. That he should have no negative experience whatsoever.

Also, Dumbledore grew up at a time when the relationships between parents and children could be rather distant to habitually abusive depending on the social circle. With such experiences and the examples of his peers being the product of such families it is easily possible that his expectations regarding the Dursleys' behaviour, when he made his decision to leave Harry with them, was skewed and out of sync with the times. If you want to read it that way McGonagall's interaction with him at the Dursleys' doorstep shows that difference between the generations.

*** He does more than make mistakes, he makes some awful decisions.

My favorite example is when he sends Harry and Hermione back in time to deal with not only the risks of time travel that have been alluded to, but also a werewolf and a massive swarm of dementors. Most adult wizards would run screaming from a werewolf or a single dementor. Most of them are /incapable/ of handling one.

Either there's some weird background reason that fanfic writers have to make up to excuse Dumbledore, or he sent children to deal with monsters when he was right there and could have gone himself.

** Fanfiction for the Harrt Potter universe started well before the books were completed. I've been reading it since just after GoF came out. Back then there was very few or no evil Dumbledore fics. They started after the OoTP came out. In that book Dumbledore is very aloof and ignored Harry for the better part of the book. Like another commentersays, teenagers tend to write fanfiction, and teenagers are angsty af. From there it just became a trope. That's my observation :)

** Evil Dumbledore came to be when people tried to make sense of his canon actions and inactions and didn't realise that there was no reason for them other than narrative demands. If you want the poor abused orphan hero, you can't have Dumbledore act IC and ensure he has a decent childhood, nor can you have Remus check up on him. If you want kids to be the heroes of your book, adults have to be useless (or absent). If you want a dramatic reveal of information at the end of book 7, Dumbledore can't inform Harry and co. of what they need to know in book 6. If you want Harry to get tortured by Umbridge, you need every teacher to be useless and Harry to be dumb.

So, in a narrative sense, it's clear why those things happened. But people try to find Watsonian reasons for this - and that leads to Evil!Dumbledore, Senile!Dumbledore (also known euphemistically as "flawed Dumbledore"), convoluted and utterly ridiculous excuses for Dumbledore's (in)actions or blind fan-atism ("Dumbledore did the best he could because he is Dumbledore, so there have to be reasons he didn't do the obvious to prevent this, and since canon is perfect, even though we're too dumb to see the reasons, they have to exist. Have faith, brother/sister!")

And for many, evil!Dumbledore was more attractive than the alternatives.

** Well-intentioned, with a reputation and works in his past indicating he's really powerful and knows a lot about magic, and yet a set of plucky children save the day year after year. There's something off about that. Eeevil Dumbledore is an attempt to make it make more sense. I don't think it works too well; a vaguely competent evil Dumbledore would vastly outmatch Harry.

Though I could use it as the basis of an evil vs evil story with Voldemort as the other antagonist. Our plucky heroes need to ensure the defeat of both parties: Voldemort, who will commit genocide, and Dumbledore, who wants to freeze society as it is or something. And it seems like an impossible task because they're both evil and powerful and competent, but our plucky heroes have pluck and heroism, and the two giants are focusing most of their efforts on each other.

I don't think I could do it well, though.

It has to be Lily's blood relatives, I believe, and I'm not aware of any canon blood relatives besides Petunia and Dudley. If Dumbledore had been as competent as his reputation implied, though, the blood protections wouldn't have been necessary. If he'd shown concern for Harry, he'd have visited him on occasion to make sure he was okay.

Abusive home life is a genre staple, though, and isn't played seriously.

Tom Riddle might have been cold, calculating, minipulative, and hyperintelligent but some of his plans you have to admit are kinda ridiculous. For example he already has Barty Crouch jr at Hogwarts for a full year before anyone really suspects him. Why not just have Harry kidnapped sooner? Come back sooner? Why does it have to be during the third task? With literally everyone there?

Dumbledore is very smart too but also in a position of great authority from the very begining with a lot of power and influence over Harry. If he was evil that would be in my opinion a very creepy intimidating set up.

#+end_quote

I really get tired of these arguments in bad faith. I'm sure you are well aware that even if Harry absolutely has to stay at the Dursleys there's plenty of things Dumbledore could have done for him. The least of which is telling Harry about the true fate of his parents and that they loved him. The amount of malevolent neglect at display by Dumbledore here is staggering. What Dumbledore does here is what amounts to child abandonment and he'd get a prison sentence in any civilized society.

That's a non-argument. Surely you wouldn't accept if if I said "Well Hitler, you know, he did some bad things, but he's just a human, he has flaws." No I'm not saying Dumbledore is like Hitler, I'm pointing out that the statement is worthless.

#+begin_quote

Just because Dumbledore is borderline evil doesn't make him the villain. There are plenty of people in real world history that I would consider to be evil, but they were never the villains, usually because they stood against a bigger evil.

#+end_quote

Not at all. People who defend Dumbledore are dark and edgy: "well, a little bit of child abuse and neglect is necessary for the good to triumph, so Dumbledore was right all along." In the "dark and edgy" fics Dumbledore is usually portrayed as some kind of Goody Two-Shoes, who blabbers on and on about the power of love and who is unwilling to do sacrifices in war, blaming him for Voldemort and portraying Dumbledore as a villain/enabler. A ridiculously OOC characterization.

Besides the whole Harry issue I find it obscene how Dumbledore as Headmaster of Hogwarts and leader of a militia, puts targets on the back of a bunch of school children. Bringing the philospher Stone to Hogwarts?! REALLY?

His first priority should be the welfare of the children, always. If he can't do that he has to resign.

*** I have a defense of Dumbledore that's not dark and edgy. He was literally born more than a century before the events of the books. Dumbledore's criteria for what constitutes a childhood is likely very different from what we in the 21st century would consider adequate child rearing. Doubtless he assumed that as Harry was alive, unmaimed and not an Obscurus by his 11th birthday that his arrangements worked out. Dumbledore maintains his position of prestige and authority for most of the books because he is no freakish outlier in his views compared to the rest of wizarding society. The Weasley family has a ghoul that lives in the attic!

The magical world is both much more dangerous than the mundane one, and yet has protections and medicine that the non magical world lacks. Their main sport is played on broomsticks, by children who often wouldn't know a basic cushioning charm. And yet Pomfrey always has a potion or treatment that fixes most hurts up almost immediately. Wizard views on "child welfare" may simply be terribly different from our own. Remember Neville's family doing all sorts of things to try and make his magic appear, as well as Harry's hair growing back, etc. Magical children may be able to withstand a good deal of dangers that would kill a muggle child. Indeed in CoS, the school is not shut down until a child is thought to have died, and Dumbledore punished not because of the mere presence of this monster but because of his apparent inability to find it. Hogwarts moving staircases, proximity to a forest filled with dangerous creatures, giant squid monster in the nearby lake, etc would never be acceptable in a real school in 2018, yet they're considered normal by all wizards and witches in the books.

I don't think that my defense requires that the world of Harry Potter is dark and edgy but that magic in this world is both wonderful and dangerous, and all witches and wizards accept that you cannot have one without the other.

**** Okay lets unravel the little ball of yarn you have spun here:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore's criteria for what constitutes a childhood is likely very different from what we in the 21st century would consider adequate child rearing.
#+end_quote

Sure. For example in his time physical discipline would have been seen as perfectly normal. It is good that our society categorically disagrees with that kind of child rearing, but it doesn't mean that children in those times were all abused. Treating a child like a pet, housing it in a cupboard and making the child wear what amounts to rags to humiliate it would have certainly been recognized as abusive by Dumbledore. Maybe it would have been more obvious to him than to us, because following social norms, being dressed properly, etc. were much more important things during his childhood. No bourgeois family of the fading 19th century would suffer the indignity of failing to dress their child properly. Everything was about status and proper decorum. A Dumbledore who is supposed to be a man "of his time" would have quickly identified the Dursleys as antisocial outcasts.

Another important aspect of raising a child at their time was treating boys as adults at a much younger age then what we are used to. They were expected to take responsibilities at a younger age and what we might consider a childhood (fooling around with friends) was rarely in the cards at the age of 12-14. Except, this is not at all how Dumbledore sees Harry. He wants him to be a child (in the modern sense). He doesn't want him to have responsibilities. He retains information from Harry, so that Harry can have a "light heart" and not worry about his fate. All of these are very modern notions and not at all how someone who follows antiquated standards of amounts to a boy's childhood would act.

#+begin_quote
  The Weasley family has a ghoul that lives in the attic!
#+end_quote

The Ghoul is comedic relief! There is zero indication that he poses any sort of danger to any of the Weasleys. In DH they dress him in Ron's clothes so that Voldemort thinks Ron is still at the burrow for gods sake. It can't get any more ridiculous than that!

I'm glad that you brought up the Weasleys though: Molly is extremely over protective of her children - even for our standards. Why is that, if all your upcoming mental gymnastics about how safe the magical world is supposed to be, were true? Is Molly a paranoid schizophrenic?

#+begin_quote
  And yet Pomfrey always has a potion or treatment that fixes most hurts up almost immediately.
#+end_quote

There is canonically no potion that can reverse death. No matter how magical Pomfreys potions are, if you get eaten by an Acromantula or break your neck from a broom fall you're just as dead as a Muggle.

Which is supposed to be a very dark tale, especially throwing him out of a window, and not something that is normal! Why are first years not allowed to play Quidditch if they all will just bounce of the ground instead of breaking their necks? Clearly Neville would have been dead or very badly hurt if he were a squib and even as a Wizard bouncing of the ground isn't a guarantee.

Multiple children have been petrified and have to languish in what amounts to a coma for a whole school semester. This flys in the face of "Super!Pomfrey will always have a fix-it-all potion available!"

The only reason why Hogwarts isn't immediately closed and angry parents storm the school to take their children home in order to buy Mandrakes for them on the private market, is because there wouldn't be a book if anyone acted a little bit less insane. Read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation]]). Or at least it wouldn't be the book about Harry and his Magical adventures that JKR wanted to write.

You would have a point if Harry was their child, yet he is not. Wards/adopted children not being treated well is a well known stereotype of this era (and many other eras, including today), and we see this in British fiction all the time. It's why JKR used the trope. My explanation fr why Dumbledore clearly did not see this injustice as egregious enough to remove Harry from there is that he is a product of his time.

We can indeed throw up our hands and say "It happened this way because it happened this way!", but I disagree that my theory or "ball of yarn" is not sufficient to explain most of these points.

I agree though that Dumbledore's later actions and telling Harry he wanted him to have a childhood does not agree with this explanation. I guess JKR is trying to have her cake and eat it too with Dickensian mistreatment of the protagonists yet modern sensibilities to some of their interactions. Another aspect that concerns me is how so many villains do absolutely terrible things, and yet often their punishment seems so mild. But I accept it as stropes of the genres JKR is writing in.

Also, I don't disagree that Molly Weasley was insanely protective, but my argument is that what's considered dangerous to Wizard parents in this universe, and what's dangerous to normal parents in the real world of 2018 may be very different. I gave several examples of "normal" Hogwarts features to back this point up.

** From my childhood through now, I have always considered withholding information from children "to protect their innocence" or to "save their childhood" to be somewhere between "moronic" and "evil", depending on the precise circumstances.

Thus, when I first read PS (almost twenty years ago!), when Dumbledore refuses to answer Harry's question after the Quirrelmort fight, deflecting, my initial belief was that Dumbledore was secretly evil, and would be revealed as the main villain, or would at least be an equal and opposite villain to Voldemort.

His subsequent actions only strengthened this conjecture, and that he had purportedly good intentions does not save him.

**** I was 8 or 9, and that particular trope (withholding information from children to try to protect their innocence) was one that I had... strong feelings about from a very young age.

Some of my earliest journal entries are vitriolic complaints about this very thing IRL with regard to chib-me (albeit on a much lesser scale than "chibi-me is a Horcrux).

By that age, I had quite a large amount of experience trying to ferret information out of adults, and although I was not yet so skilled at obtaining it, I was savvy enough to know when I was being parried.

I thought his actions were bad because I held the action of withholding information as intrinsically evil, even if coming from good intentions, and I suspected Dumbledore was a Big Bad because, in many fantasy novels I had read by that time, the mysterious old wizard who knows more than he says was evil, plotting something of questionable morality out of desperation or blindness, or both.

Now, I did not conceive of the above to the explicit and nuanced degree in which I have stated it, my current formulation, but the gist holds invariant.

** It is not a big leap of logic as it seems, I think it is important to understand that HP follows the classic theme of the hero journey which means that Harry is the one who has to solve all the problems, unfortunately Harry differently from other heroes is completely useless(just compare him to Luke Skywalker or Naruto) which means that in order to keep internal logic the adults around him must be even more useless than he is. And while this is a perfect explanation for Dumbledore's many mistakes outside the books, it is a bit hard to find an in universe explanation that doesn't paint Dumbledore as an idiot or outright evil. For example Dumbledore didn't stop Malfoy in HBP, which would have been ok at the beginning but after Malfoy almost killed Katy Bell Dumbledore still didn't do anything endangering other students such as Ron. That's idiotic at the least and evil at the worst. My personal headcanon is that Dumbledore such as Snape is a very weak person who couldn't defeat his inner demons thus becoming ineffective, but I see why he could be considered evil.

It simply isn't the kind of story where all the characters have complex and consistent internal thought processes which explain all their actions, instead stuff happens because the narrative demands it. Dumbledore wasn't intended to be evil, JKR just wanted to write about Harry solving the problem not Dumbledore, so that's what happened. Works for me. Now if a fanfic wants to do it differently, sure that's fine. But canon Dumbledore isn't evil. He just isn't a real character when he isn't plot relevent.

That single line from OotP made it absolutely clear that Dumbledore was a Machiavellian politician and not some kind, old grandfather who cared for Harry. He is not evil, since the "greater good" is a very real concept and you have to make sacrifices in war. It sucks for Harry, no doubt there, but dooming a few so that millions can live isn't exactly an evil thing to do.

*** Very selective quote. As explained in the rest of that conversation, Dumbledore's choice was:

1. Unhappy Harry raised by Dursleys, or,

2. Dead Harry.

He chose the former.

A lot of people think that there /should have been/ other options. But that's an argument against JKR's worldbuilding, not against the morality of Dumbledore's choices. In the world as depicted in canon, those were his only choices.

Ultimately, Dumbledore knows a lot more about what magic can do than the reader; he also knows a lot more about the political situation. If he considers the above two choices to be the only possible outcomes, the reader doesn't really have any basis to disagree with him. You may be able to suggest alternatives that you /think/ would work to protect Harry effectively, but Dumbledore has already considered these alternatives and discounted them as viable, so clearly he knows something you don't.

The real problem is we know Dumbledore could have blunted some of what he foresaw happening to Harry. There was nothing stopping him from dropping in occasionally, he can access four kinds of teleportation for goodness sake. But he didn't. And it can't be that they would have kicked Harry out immediately if so; the Weasley twins and Ron tore prison bars of his window to get him out and he was still allowed back. The occasional checkup by Dumbledore (who could even disguise himself) wouldn't even compare.

He +only had 24 hours+ wouldn't have know how much time he had, but he knew he was racing against time to stay ahead of the remaining Death Eaters to figure out what happened, plan what to do next, improvise a new protection for Harry when the Fidelius Charm had already failed, and deliver him to the Dursleys safely--all with incomplete information and while trying to put out all the proverbial fires resulting from Voldemort's death. At that point, he was probably just looking for a solution that worked because he didn't have time to find the best one.

That neither Dumbledore nor Remus ever checked up on Harry over the next twelve years is much harder to justify. I do think the best rationalization for that is what you said: that he didn't want to provoke Petunia's wrath, and he had Mrs. Figg to watch over him.

(And of course, Mrs. Figg would have reported that Harry was /not/ being physically abused ("probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured"), nor starved ("The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry"), so Dumbledore had no reason to think it was worse than he expected.)

All of Voldemort's followers were captured and imprisoned in Azkaban shortly after Voldemort's demise in the First Wizarding War, and Voldemort himself was reduced to "little more than a shade" for the next 10 years, with Quirrell only finding Voldemort in Albania the summer that Harry got his Hogwarts letter.

Even then, Quirrell was primarily focused on trying to keep himself, as a vessel, alive, and to try and help Voldemort regain his strength (hence, the unicorn blood in PS/SS). Given the above, in hindsight, Dumbledore /did/ needlessly subject Harry to years of neglect and abuse at the hands of the Dursleys, when Harry could have easily grown up in a magical family, and in the magical world, instead.

There is also the option of Dumbledore himself choosing to adopt and raise Harry as his own child or son. Even McGonagall, Lupin, or, dare I say it, Snape could have also done so, and still kept Harry under a much more close and watchful eye. Even the Weasley family would've been eager to take Harry in and under their wing, raising them as their own son, as Molly treats Harry as one of her own in the books anyways.

After being enrolled in Hogwarts, Harry spent most of his time there, where the blood wards had no effect. While he is not at Hogwarts, he /is/ allowed to leave his "home" at the Dursleys, as long as he spends some time there. In the time where he is not at the Dursleys, he is not protected by the blood wards either. If those blood wards were really so important, then why was he allowed to leave at all?

He could have just as well been raised at Hogwarts, or under a Fidelius charm. That would probably have been even safer, since if Voldemort or his Death Eaters had ever found out where Harry lives, they could have easily attacked him there as long as Voldemort did not do it himself.

***** In my ethical framework, yes. Though I admit that there's probably no strong consensus in either direction.

Just to be clear on my position: It may also be wrong not to shoot it down (if all other options have been explored in good faith). That's a dilemma then. There are certainly scenarios where you are forced to commit an evil act either way... Doesn't make it any less evil though and you won't get a clap on the back for it from me. I might be willing to commiserate on how much life sucks sometimes.

Bringing it all back to Dumbledore: He certainly hasn't been dealt an easy hand and I have some sympathies for the difficulty of his position.

** The inability to grok nuance largely seems the cause for evil!Dumbledore.

Generally good, decent people can have lapses in judgment. They can also have been shitty people in the past, and have been making up for that shittiness for decades.

But if you're prone to black-and-white thinking, or haven't really experienced a lot of the world, you might think that morality is an either-or proposition for most humans instead of a continuum.
