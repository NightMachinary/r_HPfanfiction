So we've all heard the tag 'God-like Harry' slapped on fics of more... questionable quality, but I'm looking for any fics that actually do it right. Fics where Harry munchkins his way into godlike power, or has godlike power but is affected by possessing it (like Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen slowly losing all touch with humanity due to them posing no threat or benefit to him whatsoever). Master of Death fics could also count to a certain degree, as long as some of the above criteria feature. On a Pale Horse (linkffn(10685852)) is a good example: Harry has basically no connection to the rest of humanity due to a quirk of his powers.

*** A munchkin in the context I used it is a person who uses every single trick, every little loophole in the rules and every underhanded/rational tactic they can think of to gain as much power or strength as possible, with no thought to the downsides or people they step on to get there.

  In gaming, a munchkin is a player who plays what is intended to be a non-competitive game (usually a role-playing game) in an aggressively competitive manner. A munchkin seeks within the context of the game to amass the greatest power, score the most "kills", and grab the most loot, no matter how detrimental their actions are to role-playing, the storyline, fairness, teamwork, or the other players' enjoyment. The term is used almost exclusively as a pejorative and frequently is used in reference to powergamers.

**** Really? Back in my day munchkin meant that one guy who exploits everything and makes you want to call him out for cheating except every time you do he gives a swift logical explanation why it's not his fault the rules were broken and that you should blame them rather than him without any arrogance.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** It's not exactly what you describe, but I highly recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads][Core Threads]], where Harry progressively gets godlike powers. The story is well-written, wonderfully entertaining, and creative. However, Harry does get the powers basically by chance, though he learns to handle it on his own. And he isn't affected in the way you describe. Still, it's a good godlike Harry fic.
