More and more lately people have been abusing the report button. Having an opinion you disagree with is not "threatening, harassing or inciting violence". Arguing with you about something is not a personal attack. Please don't waste the mods' time reporting things that don't actually violate our or reddit's rules.

Just out of curiosity more than anything else.

**** Yeah, if those really were reported then whoever did this has issues. Of course, the first two on that list do have some more context: the user is behaving disrespectfully because their “I don't give a fuck, so get out because I'm right because I say so” attitude is bad and they really should get in line, which could count as “purposefully inciting arguments” if they happen to have a history of such replies, so I can see why someone would feel justified in reporting those two even if ultimately those replies were deemed not that evil. The rest of the comments, though, yeah, someone has very thin skin.

  I think that the problem with my replies is that I did not like something that they liked, and so they felt the need to go after me like piranhas. Especially with the slash and mpreg responses. I expected that though.
#+end_quote

No, the problem with your replies is that you replied without actually reading the post and were caustic about it and did not seem to get that writing caustic replies when you did not even read what you are replying to pretty much makes you an arsehole there; and considering that you were quite flippant when told that you shouldn't really be commenting in such a way when you did not even read it, I don't blame anyone for making such an assumption. That, I reckon, is where most of the downvotes come from, and I presume so does the report.

I don't particularly care about the pairing myself. But there is always the option of simply walking away as opposed to being caustic just for the sake of being caustic.

******** Then you should have written that instead of doing what you did there. So if people misunderstood then you are at fault for it too, though I won't get into the question of who is more at fault because that's just nitpicking and it's stupid. Point is, you /could have/ handled it better, and you came across badly.

Because we have this:

#+begin_quote
  Did you even read the post
#+end_quote

And your reply:

#+begin_quote
  Of course not, out of all possible AUs that he could have been looking for I just guessed that he was looking for one in which Lily fucks snape, and James gets thrown in the gutter.
#+end_quote

And when you were asked back if you even read the post, instead of writing that you did when it's clear that people took your comment not as sarcasm but as a flippant “no, I didn't, but fuck it all” response, you went further with it and reinforced your image as the bad guy of that party.

It's not always easy to recognise sarcasm, especially when it's mistakable for flippancy and knee-jerkiness. Yours was mistakable and did get mistaken. That that didn't make you stop only made people more assured that they were right, and at the point when you stopped it was too late.

*** To be fair, I'm pretty sure the vast majority of people on Reddit have downvoted something they merely disagree with. Happens all the time, that's why the posts on so many threads are extremely cut and dry.

**** Yeah, but there's a difference between simply downvoting a comment from time to time, and a horde of trolls hunting down every single comment you make.
