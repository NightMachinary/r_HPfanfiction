** Not at all. There are hundreds of thousands of fics, and even if only a thousand of them are good ones, it would still take years to read them all. Two years is not nearly enough time to read them all, and that's also how long I've been reading HPFF myself. Good luck finding new ones, you'll find that there's too many to chose from. I have a list of ~400 fics waiting to be read.

*** Agreed. 700k fanfics in the Potter fandom, and if even one percent of them aren't crap (and to your preferences) that's still seven thousand fics to wade through.

*** This right here. RWBY seems to be the most active fandom right now but the world is so barebones that you really can't write ambitious fics without AUing the fuck out of everything. Worm has the problem of fanfics never ending, but at least they can be awesome from the beginning.

**** My major problem with the Worm fandom is that so many of the fics are on SB/SV. It's an absolute nightmare trying to navigate some of those threads, and keeping track of them is irritating as well. What I wouldn't give for some nice, simple ffnet/ao3 links.

** Yes. To put it modestly, I read and write fast. Even with 555k English language Harry Potter fics available on ff.net I find that only 1 in 20 is even worth opening. Even fewer are worth finishing.

Adding in the less trafficed sites still doesn't make a total that is insurmountable.

** Yup. I really like reading only high caliber fics, and I generally want something Harry-centric and more focused on adventure instead of romance. All these things mean that I feel like there are a limited number of fics out there for me that I might enjoy.

*** But, to be more helpful, I suggest going to the Dark Lord Potter forum if you're interested in really good fic. It's a discerning group and the fics they have are very good. Here's a new one posted on their Almost Recommended thread that's new and was updated today. I haven't read it yet, personally, but I figured I'd just suggest it as something new to read.

  Lily Potter, Harry and Ginny's youngest child, heads off to her first year at Hogwarts, hopes of a future of love and ambition at hand. But more than just school, boys, and the trials of growing up will challenge her: A lost mystery has stirred from a long rest in the years since Voldemort's final defeat - and evil abhors a vacuum. Hogwarts again will be a magnet for trouble.

** The only thing I can think of is to broaden your horizons (if they're narrow). Do you read fics that aren't HP-centric? Also, if your standards for quality fanfiction are high (some people only read fics that have published-author quality prose) that might be a limiting factor.

** To some extent. About twice a month I grow disenchanted with the quality or lack thereof in fanfiction, then find a new one that's really good and get back into reading fics again. Reading fanfic is like having a friend you keep breaking up with and making up again. You need patience and understanding to maintain the relationship.

** I get that feeling sometimes, especially since my default search is set to 60k+ words, but I just change my settings when I feel like that. Pick a specific genre, a specific character, click a random page in the search results, something new.

I also follow a few authors on Tumblr, so that gives me the feeling like no, I definitely haven't read all the good stuff, people are still making it.

** Sometimes. That's when I either start writing my own story (recently completed a h/f story), or I reread a classic (a black comedy, denarian trilogy, etc).

Alternatively, I'll check out another fandom. The problem with that is that some other fandoms are tiny, and the amount of actual good fics might not even be in the two digits. Worm is a prime example - the universe is massive, so writing any sort of story that plans on going to end game is a daunting task and will likely involve hundreds of thousands of words. That's why I haven't written anything there yet. Then, the other half of that fandom is dumb crossovers or alternate power!Taylor, most of which are just cringeworthy. But every fandom is like that. Like go to the RWBY fandom, and then you've got like half Jaune!harem fics (boring), and half SI/OC fics (also boring). And then GoT/asoiaf has tons of crap like san/san (lol) that plagues it. And DF... well, there's like 5 stories total worth reading, all of which are unfinished/abandoned.

So yeah, when all that fails (and it usually does), I start writing.

** Sometimes. I've been reading HP fanfic for about a decade now, and during several of those years I've had a ton of time on my hands because of health issues. I pretty much /have/ read everything from certain parts of fandom. Branching out into new themes or pairings helps a lot, and sometimes there are random fics I stumble upon that I love (like, there's a Draco/OMC one that's got the whole alpha/omega nuttiness of all things, but the characterization of Draco is just so, so glorious that I'm in love. And I often have a lot of trouble with romance fics focused on Draco).

** My problem is that I tend to not finish them.

I stop reading fics the moment its storyline interrupts for some forced romance or "sidequest", as I call it.

Seriously, there are fics out there who would be /so much better/ with 50 to 100k less words. So, yea, for me it seems like I got all the good ones checked.

So, let me use this platform to remind our dear writers out there: Cut the living shit out of your stories until you reach the core of your story.

** There's just so much I can't ever see that happening, and there are new fics coming up all the time, old fics that are worth re-reading. Discovering one good fic leads to more from the same author and then checking out their favorites. What fics do you read? If you give more info maybe we can link to new stuff for you.
