See title. For this prompt, Alastor Moody is a Marauder - whether honorary or true (the latter of which would probably require some age-shifting). What kind of stuff does he get up to? How would events change?


** Remus Lupin is the long suffering auror lieutenant under Bones. Alastor Moody's a werewolf in the Marauder's year. Of course, he sniffs out Wormtail's betrayal real quick, still as paranoid as ever. Harry grows up with two very strange and mildly insane uncles.

also cautious of friends pranks is far different from being paranoid because your job constantly put you in the line of death

****** I never /quite/ said that, did I? I did say "whether honorary or real", which was meant to imply I'm okay with /not/ replacing Remus.

In fact, given that Remus is practically the entire reason the Marauders got started (they got their Animagus forms to provide some support to Remus on the night of the full moon), I'd prefer if he /was/ there.

*** While I like the idea of Moody turning into a beast using concealment, I don't think wizards can turn into a Magical Beast (if Demiguise can even be considered a beast, are they even alive?), maybe a chameleon.

Though my preference still goes to the honey badger. Hard to kill and doesn't even knowing the meaning of fear.

**** The Harry Potter Wiki suggests that wizards think it's theoretically /possible/ for an Animagus form to be a magical creature, but have never seen it happen.

Plus, given how many fanfics feature Harry becoming a phoenix animagus with full protective-enchantment-ignoring powers, I say Demiguise Alastor is entirely acceptable. At least it'd be relatively interesting.

*** One of my favorite fics lists Moody's animagus as a scarred and greyed tiger (scars to match the human ones + that missing leg because a tiger with a peg leg is absurd).

Massive and deadly, but silent and able to vanish in thick foliage.
