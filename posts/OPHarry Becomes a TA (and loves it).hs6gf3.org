It was noted /V E R Y/ early on that Harry James Potter was exceptionally talented with magic. Though his written work at times left much to be desired, his practical skill and intrinsic knowledge on the subject (even in courses like Potions, where he was being graded incorrectly out of spite) was second to none amongst his peers.

By the end of his first year he was a prime candidate for moving ahead at least 2 academic years for almost all of his subjects (with the exception of History).

However, despite vehement arguments from staff, Professor Dumbledore refused to allow it. Only telling Snape and McGonagall in confidence that he wished for Harry's skills to be as hidden as possible, so as to have the Dark Lord underestimate him on his return. Additionally, be wished to keep Harry within the safety of the Castle for as long as possible, thus allowing him to skip years would be to the detriment of his safety.

Thus, second year came and went and it was a nightmare. Not just because of the Chamber of Secrets debacle, but desperately monitoring their inquisitive little prodigy.

Though it could not be proven that he was filching through the Restricted Section late at night, a handful of Professors were aware he had an Invisibility Cloak. Despite his attempts to be polite and at least pretend he was paying attention, he was clearly bored in class and not exerting himself. Often surreptitiously trialing spells and concepts that were many years off for his classmates.

But a stroke of genius in how to rectify this came from Filius Flitwick as the year came to an end.

He walked into one of his last 2nd Year Charms lessons, where his students had entered the room much earlier than usual, and delighted as he watched Harry walk Neville Longbottom through an intricate tracking charm so he would not lose track of his toad again. Then progressing to instructing his two friends in Granger and Weasley before half an hour later he'd (effectively) helped the entire class master it.

Thus, that evening at the Staff meeting, he was practically bouncing off the walls when he declared a way for Potter to still be engaged in their classes even if he was far beyond the material.

So when they returned for their Third Year and were pulled away from the Opening Feast, Hermione was given a Time Turner and Harry an option: continue attending classes but as a Teaching Assistant to Professors who asked for him. In turn he would be offered some private tutoring in more advanced theorems and practices in that field WHILST having unrestricted access to everything in the library.

Though he was initially reluctant, the mind numbing boredom that was his first week back quickly changed his mind...

...and he thrived!

Not every teacher took the opportunity for extra help right away. Flitwick and McGonagall had him working from their next lesson with him, Harry volunteered to assist Hagrid (who was grateful for the support), Sprout was more inclined to turn to Neville for help and had both boys in a similar role, whereas Binns and Snape waited until the back end of the year before utilising him.

Snape, seething, reluctant to admit Harry wasn't a dunderhead and could be put to some use preventing explosions...

Binns... he saw it as an out and disappeared after Harry took over his lecture...

--------------

Fast forward a few years. 1995 seeing the return of Voldemort and increased Ministry oversight of Hogwarts (thanks to the Ministers dismissal of the facts). Dumbledore, in the summer, privately allows Harry to take his OWL's and NEWT's in his stronger subjects (Transfiguration, Charms, Defense and Potions) under a few strict conditions. Of course he is to continue assisting teachers, but instead doing so for younger year classes and even taking some classes by himself.

But the most important task he was given was /Educational Overseer of Defense Against the Dark Arts/ (a fancy title Dumbledore pulled out of his ass to spite the idea of the Inquisitor)

"Provided due to an unfortunate lack of consistency in teaching of the subject", he was to shadow, critique and monitor Delores Umbridge's DADA classes to ensure they hit the "high quality expected of Hogwarts staff". Neither of them are happy at the appointment, but due to Umbridge's attempts to rile him up (as well as her curriculum's complete lack of practical tuition) all leading to Harry effectively in charge of the Defense class without actually being its Professor...

*** This isn't Dumbledore Bashing though? It's a perfectly reasonable stance to take. He's not doing anything malicious as the worst that happens to Harry here is that he's bored in class until he becomes a TA.

He's literally trying to keep Harry safe and give him a better shot against Voldemort.

****** It's an issue in canon, but it's mitigated somewhat by the fact that in canon, not only was Harry not as skilled as Voldemort was when Voldemort was Harry's age, but Voldemort also had like, 6 or 7 /decades/ on him. In canon, Dumbledore could have abandoned all his duties in favor of personally teaching Harry 24/7 until it was time to face Voldemort, and Harry still wouldn't have had a shot in hell at beating him in a straight fight. This Harry would still be heavily outmatched, but given the proper instructions, he might last half a dozen seconds in a real fight. (Also, the whole thing about Voldemort underestimating Harry doesn't really work after 1st year ends, since by that point Dumbledore knows that Voldemort was a teacher for a year, he would have attended all the staff meetings, and he'd know exactly how much of a prodigy Harry was.)

******* It's a prompt instead of a fic because I don't have all the answers tbh, that's Dumbledore's reasoning and I can work from there with it.

For example there is your point earlier. By keeping Harry in with his peers, in theory, he's not learning anything, which means regardless of his skill he isn't (from an outsider looking in) developing past his classmates. From there, I don't think it's too much of a leap for Voldemort to arrogantly assume that Dumbledore has let his skills go to waste, making him easy picking for the Graveyard duel.

Also, I think Barty's faith in his master would be so absolute that even seeing Harry has a position as TA at 14 he'd still not believe he was anything close to beating Voldemort, maybe even dismissing it all out of hand and not telling him.
