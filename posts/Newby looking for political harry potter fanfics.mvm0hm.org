Im looking for fanfics where harry becomes powerful in wizarding politics. Im especially interested in fics where that happens through either inheritance, marriage or both. Looking forward to your recomandations


** Look for harry/daphne stories

They usually have a lot of politics. Racist politics that make sound like neutrality between neo-nazis and ultra conservatives is the enlightened position. But lots of politics nonetheless haha

**** Unfortunately, you are very, very wrong. They're commonly tagged “grey!Harry” and/or “indy!Harry.”

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...
