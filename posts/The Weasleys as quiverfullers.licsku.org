I'm in the mood for some entertaining silliness, and ran across a post talking about the quiverfull movement, where people choose to have as many children as possible so as to outbreed those they see as inferior (gross, I know). I thought it would be entertaining to read something where the Weasleys subscribe to that view. Maybe the source of their beef with the Malfoys is that the Malfoys tend to have only one child, despite having the resources to care for more. The Weasleys would of course be pro-muggleborn still, after all, muggleborns make excellent breeding stock when married into a good pureblood family...


** I'm not sure how someone's supposed to make a movement as gross and disturbing as quiverfulling into a silly and entertaining fic like you're asking.
