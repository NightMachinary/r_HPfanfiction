** Hm . . . this is long. I'm very old, you understand, and my daughter is the real HP fan. she first introduced me to the books and then from GoF onwards we went to see the flms together. It was a regular mother/daughter thing we did every year. I suppose she must have been going through uni at the time.

Then three years ago she emigrated to Australia and I found myself missing her and reading the books again and noticing different things about them. Then I bought a dolls house (wait, I'll get to the point!) on ebay and decided to turn it into 12 Grimmauld Place. And as I was planning it I started to think up stories and scenarios for things that might have happened in that house in all the time poor old Sirius was practically imprisoned there on his own. And I started writing the story down.

Then I thought, "If I'm writing stories like this, I bet other people are too." So I looked and Lo! I discovered this thing called fanfiction. And the rest, as they say, is history. I've archived over 200k words since then and learned a lot, but the dolls house is still unfinished.

**** Oh I don't mind. I like to see my stories being read, that's what they're there for. I'll warn you now though, that it's a CC/OC pairing and I know a lot of people don't like those. Anyway, this is the first thing I wrote and then it expanded into a series and there is another story in the pipeline. If you do read it, I'd love to know what you think. And concrit is always welcome.

If I was writing it now, I think I would approach it a bit differently, but I don't think it's too bad. linkffn(10841322)

I was wanting more and didn't want to wait for the next book and being comfortable with the world of fanfiction due to accidentally discovering erotic fanfiction a few years before while in college, i decided to see if there was HP fanfiction. I found fanfiction.net and found people who were just as annoyed/exhilarated by the world of HP as I was--annoyed by the strange plot holes and inconsistencies, exhilarated by the world one could use, a hidden world of magic. Your weird neighbor down the street could be a wizard. That path no one traverses could be a spelled road to a magical alley. The ideas abounded.

** I originally started looking for books like Percy Jackson (Wait until I get to the point!) and ended up finding "Percy Jackson and The Game" A beautiful fic that's still being updated.

After a while of reading Percy Jackson, I realized they weren't that good, and most Percy Jackson ones were terribly written.

Eventually I went onto Naruto fanfiction, and eventually ran out of things that fit my tastes.

Because I was so enamored with fanfiction at the time, I scoured my bookshelves, looking for things that would make good fanfiction. And, lo and behold, I found Harry Potter! I started by reading linkffn(The Natural Animagus by White Cat) and linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

I eventually got to the point where I started to read fanfiction all day, even through class.

And that brings us to today :D.

On a side note, I used "Eventually" a lot in this...

*** I started via Percy Jackson ff also--I was reluctant to venture into HP ff for a long time because there were just so many, I saw some really bizarre and outlandish concepts and pairings when I first looked, and I figured it'd be impossible to find anything of quality. Eventually I took the plunge, and am now hopelessly hooked.

I should note that I ended up looking for Percy Jackson ff after absolutely loving reading the books with my older son (now 16)--I know that I am much older than the typical ff reader, but I enjoy a good escape as much as anyone else! I also know that I do have much less patience for bad grammar and ridiculous writing than many, however, which makes me extremely picky and excited to find a nice, long, fabulously written story! I get a lot of good recommendations (as well as easily downloadable MOBI links for ff.net) from this subreddit for which I am very thankful.

** I started reading Harry Potter Fanfiction when I was twelve or so. I devoured everything on Mugglenet.com like it was my job while I waited for Order of the Phoenix to be released. About a year ago while on summer break from med school, I was yearning for more Harry Potter in my life, and I remembered how much I enjoyed fanfiction as a kid. So I signed up for FF.net, and here I am, hundreds of stories later, and in the beginnings of actually writing my first one. It's become a little bit of an obsession at this point.

** I started reading fanfiction on muggle.net in fifth grade between GoF and OotP (sometime between 2000-2001). It was much easier to be satisfied by any random fic back then. Harry/Ginny was a crazy idea, or at least seemed like it to me. Fics got better and better until about 2009-2010 when the rate of new fics started to dropoff. After that I was well into college and I took a break. I read for a couple months in 2012 and didn't touch it again until December of 2014.

I tried my hand at writing sometime around Junior high (sometime around 2002-2003), but it was horrifically bad and I never wrote again. At this point I'd been reading fanfiction on and off for around 15 years and I was a man grown. I started writing at the end of 2014 and practiced on and off for over a year before finally submitting something reasonable earlier this year.

Great times. No matter which school I went to, what grade i was in, or whether I was happy or sad, Harry and the gang were always there when I wanted or needed them. Harry Potter is just as much a part of me as any TV show I watched, sport I played or friends I've had over any period of my life.

**** I first started with that too, I enjoyed the first few chapters, but then it just got boring, I saw a lot of people praising it at the time and thought it was one of the best fics and there was no point looking for more. A year later I read Dumbledores army and the year of darkness, really enjoyed it, and then see most people hate it. Seems I started out on two of the most controversial fics.

Now having read a fair amount of fics I see how much better ones there are out there compared to my first two.

** I started reading Ranma and Dragon Ball fanfics in primary school - off and on. That was around the turn of the millennium, so there weren't nearly as many HP fanfics around... Well, I say that. I think I liked the canon books too much to give it a chance.

The Three Year Summer hit its stride. I sniffed around, skimmed a couple of fics (several of which depicted Harry's grisly and/or undignified demise, though there were a couple of which I have very fond yet infuriatingly vague recollections) and discovered the RPG Toolkit and the How To Draw Manga book series.

Time flew by. I read the canon books all over again. And again. I found out what the Internet /really/ was.

OotP dropped. I was lit.

The thirst was real after reading the prophecy. I found myself neck-deep in a lake of boundless possibilities, but I didn't know what or how to drink.

And then I remembered what I originally thought the Internet was meant for.

It's been an interesting programme since. :D

During my first week of reading fics (in September, I think) I quickly narrowed down to reading pretty much exclusively Harry/Ginny. I read Epeefencer's Unexpected Events (used to love his fics, but not so much any longer) as well as Aspirations (yes, back then I actually thought it was the best of the best).

** I was about 10, so it was around 2001, and there was a cute site about Redwall that I'd found, with recipes and fanart and fanfic. I hadn't even thought about fanfic before that, but I was very keen on having more access to fantasy writing. (I, uh, ended up finishing my school's collection of fantasy novels before the end of middle school).

I ended up reading mostly Harry Potter fanfiction because it was really a fairly massive fandom compared to the others I read. It's big enough that I can go through phases: I get in the mood for certain tropes and pairings.

My tastes have, of course, changed significantly, as has my understanding of the characters as I matured and the series finished.

** Honestly? I'm ashamed to admit it, but the thing that got me into HP fanfiction was, well.. My Immortal. Not because I enjoyed it! But rather because a friend and I decided to look it up after hearing about it somewhere and read it aloud for a few of our other friends and had a great time laughing at how terrible it was. Later in the week I realized that if there was /terrible/ fanfiction of the Harry Potter series, surely there was /good/ fanfiction, right? So naturally (and dumbly, in hindsight, because it was the worst possible place to look for good fanfiction) I looked for smut. Specifically Lucius smut.

Luckily the first one I read, though now long forgotten, was well written! I fell in love with romance fics and the rest is history.

** Well... I was in 7th grade when the last book came out. It was around that time that I had also discovered the Internet (even back in 2007, India had notoriously bad Internet connectivity). I loved reading a lot. So whenever I went on the Internet, I would always try searching for some sort of online library where I could read books. But I was unsuccessful. But I did discover Wattpad, which described itself as the /YouTube of eBooks/.

For anyone not familiar with Wattpad back in the days, it was host to quite a few original published works (pirated) like Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew novels. There were a few Harry Potter fan fictions, but not that many.

I don't remember the name of the first fan fiction, but I do remember that it was quite bad with a lot of cliches, but I printed the entire thing out because any reading material was reading material for me. I thought I could while my time on the journey to Bangalore by reading the fan fiction, and I'd finished it by the time I'd reached Bangalore.

Anyway, that opened the flood gates for me. There were a couple Potterheads at school, and my printed out fanfic made the rounds from grade 8 through 10 and back to the 5th. The next one that I remember reading was [[https://www.wattpad.com/84912-harry-potter-happily-ever-after][Harry Potter Happily Ever After]] and I never quite finished it. It was pretty monotonous and bored the crap out of me a few chapters into it.

Reading Potter fan fics fill me up in a strange sort of way. Potter has been a huge part of my childhood and was a window into a culture I've grown to love (even Blyton's books too, actually) over the years. When I find new fics by new authors, it never ceases to amaze me just how much of an impact Rowling has made on a bunch of kids' lives with just 7 books.

Whatever happens, I know that I will be a Potterhead all my life, no matter what. It's just that one thing that people can never take away from you. Once a Potterhead, always a Potterhead.

Thankfully, that ran its course pretty quickly, though I do look back fondly on the times where I could read pretty much anything, and I would devour 200k words in a day, every day, because the whole fandom was new to me, and I hadn't developed my bullshit detector yet.

I remember using tabs in firefox to pre-load chapters, since we only had dial-up. Eventually found some software that would crawl a set of URLs and store them for off-line reading. Much better (plus no accidental closing/loss of tabs).

Fell in love with fanfiction, eventually stumbled upon fictionalley.org and finally fanfiction.net. Worked my way through all sorts of crap and cliches, which I didn't realize when I was younger.

Eventually tapered off after I realized I was spending way to much time reading and not classes. eventually picked back up and dropped off a few times. Now I'm better at pacing myself.
