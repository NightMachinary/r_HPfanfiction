Would love to hear your recommendations.

I just read this (Fred/Hermione) and I liked it a lot, sadly it's unfinished but it's pretty close to canon. It also has a snippet about how hurt Hermione is that neither Ron nor Harry askes her even as a friend which just adds an interesting contour to the canon Yule Ball too.

  In an act of desperation, Harry invites Flora Carrow to the Yule Ball. He never expects having to entertain her twin sister Hestia too.

  "She Transfigured Seamus' testicles into a pair of tweezers!" Through a series of unfortunate events and unwise decisions, Harry Potter ends up going to the Yule Ball with Daphne Greengrass. Perhaps things won't turn out so bad after all: when you've hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up, right? ...Right? Not your usual Daphne fic. Warnings for language and underage drinking.

** (Fremione) The Yule Ball is a little dramatic in this one, bu the story resolves in really satisfying way. A bit of teen drama, but not too much, and lots of this cosy Hogwarts atmosphere. And what I really liked is that Hermione is just like Hermione should be, not too overpowered and not too childish - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18268010/chapters/43229228]]

*** Hey I LOVE this, thanks so much for recommending it. I skipped to the summer when Hermione realizes she likes Fred. For the most part the pacing is really good and it's a fairly realistic portrayal of teenage wizard romance.
