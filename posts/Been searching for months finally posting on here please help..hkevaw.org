:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So basically I'm looking for thing one time travel up fic. I know that he can flameport. And I also remember a scene where he finds out Vernon is abusive to Petunia so Harry come and beats him up. I think that it was Harry/Daphne but I'm not sure. I know it's 100k+ words and it's not harems or anything like that.


** Sorry mate. I know that Twins: A different life (I can't link right now, but you should find it on ao3) is like that but it's James being abusive to Lilly and Harry doesn't beat him up, but he can flameport. Maybe that's what your looking for? It's wildly popular though, so I'd be suprised if you haven't ran across it before. Sad to say that I can't be of much help, but good luck!
