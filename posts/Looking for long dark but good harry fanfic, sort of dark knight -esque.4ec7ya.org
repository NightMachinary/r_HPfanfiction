So, i like Dark!Harry and similar, but i really dont enjoy it when he just starts becoming evil all of a sudden, it feels OOC and i do tend to like a fanfic better if i actually like the Main character.

So if harry starts to randomly kill people, acts like a major douchebag and starts to bang the entire female population of hogwarts it tends to kill the fic for me.

Are there any long Dark!Harry fanfics that have him be dark, even very dark but still fundamentally good?

"Harry potter and the boy who lived" is a good example at the start i think, but i fear he may slide into the whole evil side of it.

So are there any good, long (at least 150k words or longer, i read very fast, anything below that is most times not even worth starting to me as it is over so quickly) fanfics that kind of fit that? No slash.

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): the Ministry kept sucking up to pureblood extremist after Voldemort's fall. Harry was angry, very angry, and he was not alone.

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650): Harry's horcrux offered him a deal, resulting in a far more powerful and ruthless Harry. But Voldemort was not his only enemy.

*Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463): Slytherin Harry/Ginny fought hard against Voldemort, [[/spoiler][only to be betrayed by the Weasleys and the Ministry.]]

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): that one is an epic of intrigue, politics, and war. Extreme AU, even in muggle world. This Harry was ambitious and ruthless, but still benevolent.

There are several other great dark!Harry stories, but they are too short to meet your criteria.
