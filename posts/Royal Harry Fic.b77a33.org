There was a fic where harry claims I think to be the king of magical Britain due to his bloodline during the trial in fifth year, also quite a few of those on the wizengamot owe him their loyalty due to fealty oaths their ancestors swore to his. If anyone knows the one I am talking about and can point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.

  Tied to a tombstone, being tortured by Voldemort. Harry wanted it to end. His mind, his soul cried for someone, anyone to help him. He hadn't expected for someone to actually answer. Now he will learn the truth about the Potter bloodline and prepare himself for the war that is at their doorstep. However, unlike what he had thought, he won't be facing what is coming on his own.

*** yeah I think that's the one and I know it's on fanfiction.net unfortunately without the title or the name of the author I have really no way of finding it. I tried Google searching at also and still couldn't find it so. I guess my next step will be to try adding some of those keywords to the search on fanfic and on Google see if I get a hit thanks for the help I appreciate it
