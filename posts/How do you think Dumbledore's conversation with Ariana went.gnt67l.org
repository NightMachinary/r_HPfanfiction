** Her death happened about a hundred years before Albus finds the stone. Since her death, he's done everything in his power to atone for his behaviour during those months after he became an adult (unlike certain other scum). He might not have succeeded in all his endavours (because he is human), but he'd done his best.

Stopping Grindelwald, fighting Voldemort, teaching and guiding several generations of students, all the while believing that those who have strayed can still find redemption (even if they don't deserve it) - Albus in 1996 is almost the polar opposite to the young wizard who was set to enslave all mankind in the 1890s.

I imagine Arianna forgave him almost instantly.

** I think that depends on whether she matured in the afterlife, or she remained the same child she was when she died. Two Very different conversations.
