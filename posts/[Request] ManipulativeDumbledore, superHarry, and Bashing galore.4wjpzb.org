90% of the time I hate the, manipulative!dumbledore and bashing of him and the Weasleys, and super!Harry fanfictions, but sometimes I like to indulge in the clicheness of it.

Anything is good except for harems, those are unreadable to me. Thanks!


** Just search for [Harry P., Hermione G.]

** There's always linkffn(harry potter and the manipulator of destiny). You have to admire the straightforwardness of the title - no one can claim they don't know what they're getting.

  Post OotP. Harry finds that Dumbledore has been less than honest or helpful with him, takes control of his own life and finds the training he needs from others. HHr, NL, no slash. COMPLETE

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** I parody the cliches and tropes without being actual parodies. Just look for the Harry/Hermione stories on my profile.

***** I've noticed you're rocking the hell out of that Ilvermorny story. First time I've had multiple chapters added on a sometimes daily basis. Make my boring job go faster for sure so thanks for that.

I'm enjoying the hell out of both fics so please don't stop them. I'm sure you've got your bases cover with both but I'd still like to offer any help if I can.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Four Heirs by Sink) The only conflict that even resembles a plot line is their destruction of Dumbledore. And it's definitely a super Harry seeing as his animagus is an 'Earth' Phoenix
