I really liked "Like Brothers" by Columbrina and am looking for a similar dynamic


** linkffn(Growing Up Black) has this but they don't meet until they're about 6 or so years old.

**** With one hell of a brutal cliffhanger. It's a great fic, very fun, but the stopping point sucks.

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.

** linkffn(Royal Ward) is also a very good story where they meet when they're 8 and start spending time together regularly. But it doesn't start until the third or fourth chapter.

The prequel one shot is linkffn(Hatal Fart Attack) but there's no Malfoys there.

  This is in response to a plot bunnie on how to give Vernon Dursley a heart attack. Rating to be on safe side. This story is a one shot and complete.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

** linkffn(Living with Danger) has Draco being added to the weird little family Harry belongs to when they are young children. It will take you a bit to get there, though.

Warnings:1. The story is not all to well written at the beginning, but the writing improves. 2. The story has several sequels and the whole of the "Dangerverse" will take you quite sone time to read through. 3. Things become very, very AU. (There came a time I read it as "decent YA story", not as "Harry Potter fan fiction" , if that makes sense.)
