Shenanigans, heists, posh cars and romance ensue. A mix of humour, adventure, and generally a good time, I was pleasantly surprised at just how well written this fic is. I just so happened to be in the mood for this type of fic. Hermione went to Beauxbatons and is the magical inspector at Europol charged with the Crimson Hare, the greatest thief of the century.

Apparently nearing its finale in a few chapters so a good time to pick this up.

The author wolfd80 also made a brilliant Star Wars crossover

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  'Theft. It is an especially sweet vice. More elegant than vandalism and more complex than simple robbery' Words to live by, and there are few in Europe as talented and driven as the Crimson Hare. A tale of a true gentleman master thief, and the Police Inspector hell bent on capturing him.
