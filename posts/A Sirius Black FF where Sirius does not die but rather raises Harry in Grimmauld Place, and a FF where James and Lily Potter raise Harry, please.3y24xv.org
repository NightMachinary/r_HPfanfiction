Hi! :)

Sirius Black is my favourite Harry Potter character and I've read a couple of fanfictions with him but I didn't like the narration. Could you make some suggestions, perhaps where Sirius never goes to Azkaban in the first place?

Also, I'd appreciate some suggestions of good FFs where the Potters never die in the first place. Perhaps, where Neville is the Chosen One instead of Harry.

The length of the story doesn't matter, only the quality of the narration does.


** linkffn(Innocent) - A story where Sirius escapes when Harry is 8, and raises him from then on. At some early points it seems like Harry might end up getting over-powerful, but that was (luckily) mostly nipped in the butt. Good Harry-Dirius interactions. Good characterisation of most other characters, too. Has one finished sequal and one which is in progress.

linkffn(Living with Danger) The first in a series of increasingly AU fan fics. Sirius, Remus and two others raise Harry, Hermione and two later additions together while in hiding. Begins relatively weak, gets better.Has some weirdness which does not gel too well with canon. It and all its sequals are finished, which is nice. This story has AUs, even and I prefer at least one of those to the actual main story... But reading it first would ruin some plot points from the main story, so I won't link.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

**** Innocent is amazing, finished reading it and it's two sequels (catching up to where the author is currently writing) in about three days.

** I really enjoyed linkffn(4062601) It's a story about Sirius taking Harry from the Dursley's when he was 8 and raising him. Pretty well written. There are some similarities that are similar to cannon, but the author took a different twist on it, like Harry thinking through the situation rationally as opposed just doing and not thinking.

*** I'll add it to my list, thanks so much! :) Imagine the outcomes if Harry had thought rationally in cannon... Sirius would still be alive!
