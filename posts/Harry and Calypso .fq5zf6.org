Hey guys, some time back i made a post about Harry being paired with a dark witch, it was a request about fanfictions whit it.

One of you guys sended me "Harry Potter and the boy who lived" and i loved because Calypso was such a good and charismatic character.\\
Then i saw some people talking about Calypso being paired with harry in other fics, with the same personality, as if she was a canon character that was being used in other fics, but i've searched and never found nothin.\\
So i ask you guys, do you know what that was about ? And if such fics exist can you send me some ?

Calypso Rosier is also a character in this fic, but I don't think she's paired with Harry.
