i find that severitus/sevitus seems to be a controversial topic- you either love it or hate it. i completely understand those who abhor the genre and snape as a character- he was a spinless, racist bully in canon. perhaps a complex bully,an interesting "grey" but a bully nonetheless.

however, as a lover of severitus- fanfiction is alll about self indulgence and what ifs. for people who lack a father figure , severitus is a comfort mentorship. some people cant understand that, and i get that you would be skeptical, but i hope that this put things into perspective, maybe. :p.


** I feel like part of the appeal people have for severitus is this idea that snape is proven utterly wrong and has to confront his own cruelty, giving Harry (and the reader) a sense of justice, and Snape an obligation to eat a bit of crow, usually. You know - it usually involves Snape finding out Harry has been through hell with the dursleys. He's usually indignant at first, then incredulous and maybe afterwards defensive of Harry. Harry often gets the opportunity to rub Snapes nose in it, then eventually gets to negotiate a relationship with snape on his own terms (where snape is typically eager to make amends).

This can be satisfying for readers - if you want to project yourself onto Harry, it involves a bit of righteous justice, a feeling of validation, social power over a wrongdoer and validation and care afterwards from a motivated and committed family member.

I think about this a bit because I've tried a few severitus fics but I can't find one that fits for me. Often times they rehabilitate snape and he becomes a bit out of character, and I like when everyone stays in character tbh, so would love any recs. But I don't drag anyone for their fanfic preferences and I think they can sometimes say a lot about the person who enjoys them. If anyone else wants to chip in who likes severitus I'd love to hear about it - does my analysis fit your enjoyment of the trope or is it off the mark?

*** I am not a fan of most fics with this premise because authors who write this trope tend to whitewash Snape too much. Its just not Snape to me unless he keeps his sarcasm and anger at everything and everyone. I just can't see his character getting over his hate for Harry without a long thought out redemption arc.

There are a few fics where the trope is done well though. Or at least fics that show that Snape would make a mostly terrible mentor/guardian. Some examples of those are

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2027554/1/In-Blood-Only][In blood only]] True severitus where Snape finds out that Harry is his bio son. This was written before all the books were out so some of Snapes character background is different. The fic has both good humor and a dark take on Snape who has more of a death eater mindset and is not a good person.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/Stronger-Than-Hope][Stronger than hope]] Snape guardian/mentor fic. I believe it's also written before all the books were written so some stuff is AU. Snape is really not a good person in this one.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][Harry Potter and the problem with potions]] Not a severitus since Snape is just a mentor but in a similar genre. This one is great because Snape is in character. Harry isn't affected by Malfoys or Snapes insults and keeps trying to befriend both of them to learn more about potions. Good humor in this fic.

** I think we ended up with the ‚ÄúSnape, but as a decent attempting functioning adult‚Äù in Steven Universe, but HP itself almost leans too heavily into the idea that Snape would have done a world of good as a Trusted Adult.

He's smart. Quick witted. Capable of lying to Voldemort's face for years. Has a history with the woman whose sacrifice allowed Harry to survive? He doesn't take bs from others? Holds grudges for literally years? Is TALENTED??

If he was just allowed to bond with Harry? Mature past old school grudges? He'd have easily filled in a spot Harry needed in his school years. An adult who can and does.

** I like it when it's done well. My main gripe is when they baby-fy Harry when he's older. You know what I mean? He's normal at first then he's just acting so childlike that it's easy to forget he's a teenager and it's distracting.

I've read some super cute stories about it so it's definitely a favorite for me

** I'm a hater cos Snape had the opportunity to be a good person to Harry but he threw it away. both Remus and Sirius are much better father figures to Harry cos they'll actually treat him nicely cos they care about him and not because they feel guilty and entitled

** I love it. Found a really good fiction on it on archives of our own. There's a malfoy/Potter pairing there but the severitus is just spot on. I was genuinely curious abt how the writer was going to pull off Snape is Harry's father and.. It was a great read. Thought it was pretty impossible and horrible premise at first üòÇ [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/990947/chapters/1955931]]

Found myself grinning at the end. üòä

I myself prefer one where he's either a mentor (without going all mushy on potter or all out abusively cruel and potter suddenly turning into a lil' kid) or potter's real father. Harry/severus romance pairing... Er.. No thanks. üòÇ

UPDATE:

The BEST one ever is O Mine Enemy on fanfiction.net It's REALLY awesome! It's realistic. Snape doesn't go all mushy or become an instant potter fan and it explains why Snape bullied Harry in Rowling verse. I'll not spoil it for you. Snape's more of a tcher/mentor and becomes a father figure as it progresses.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3514260/1/]]

And also a Year Like No Other.

Harry gets adopted here but the reason for it is legit. What I love about this is the suspense and Draco and Dudley too! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061]]

If u will only read 1, I suggest O Mine Enemy. But these 2 are a MUST read!

** Severitus is possible when his redemption story extends to the full length, from owning his sins, to admitting his guilt, to eventual (!!!) forgiveness by Harry (and whomever else he wronged). Which almost never happens, because the author is in love with the Snape's character already, and then we get disasters as in (otherwise rather good, although also oversexualized) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4876630][Becoming Harriet by Teao]], where Snape is ‚Äúthe only person who never lied to [Harry]‚Äù, who suffers by the unequal treatment of his beloved Slytherins, and similar BS.

** For me, those stories are not about Snape, but an OC with the name Severus Snape, and that's why I don't read it :) But everyone likes something different :)

**** Severitus was (is? his ff profile is still up) a fanfic author actually. In 2002 he issued the "[[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Severitus_Challenge][challenge]]", which was almost immediately came to be known as the Severitus challenge. It had actual rules even:

#+begin_quote

  1. Severus Snape must be revealed to be Harry's father (no..not James, though that would be interesting......MWAHAHA!!!)

  2. Remus Lupin must have returned to Hogwarts for some reason or another (unless it's a 3rd year AU, in which case he's already there.heh)

  3. Harry must undergo some progressive physical change starting on his birthday. No /tada!/ and suddenly he looks like Snape, at first anyway.

  4. The story must be based mostly around Harry and Snape

  5. (optional) if you want, feel free to take one of the conversations I've got posted here. Change 'em however you want, they're mere clutter on my harddrive right now, and I hereby bequeath them to you.

  6. Make note somewhere that it's in response to this challenge, so all the other nice people can give it a shot too, if they want, or be able to find the other challenge responses.

  7. PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I WANNA READ 'EM! Feel free to either email me or let me know in a review.

**** Never heard of that as a trope name. It's outside of my usual reading circles though. I mistakenly assumed it was a misspelling. Apologies.
