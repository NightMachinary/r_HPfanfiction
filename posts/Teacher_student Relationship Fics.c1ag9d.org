Preferably, if the Canon characters are adults, so THEY are the teachers. I would like if, lets say Harry gets a teaching position, whether it be as an Auror or just the Theory stuff. Maybe even DADA, dont know. One (or possibly more) of his students has a Crush on him (or simply finds him attractive) and flirts with him. However she doesnt want "better grades" for her actions but simply want to get intim with him, because he is a good looking Man. Harry would reluctantly agree at some point.

So yes, no blackmailing or "Sex for grades" stuff, although i think the latter is a more agreeable thing. I wouldnt reject Fics that have a real developing between Teacher and student.

It doesnt matter, if the Teacher is already in a Relationship (married or dating) with a Canon partner.

**** I am aware, I'm just saying that it might color people's view of your request.

And probably AO3. Search by tag. I don't read that genre, so I don't know any.
