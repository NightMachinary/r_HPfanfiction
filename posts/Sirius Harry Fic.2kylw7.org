I was wondering if anyone knew of any fan fiction where Sirius raises Harry after James and Lily died. Or some type of AU where James and Lily don't die.

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.
#+end_quote

This is the only one that immediately comes to mind. The writing is... alright.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** The Living with Danger series has I think one chapter to go in the final story, and I'm pretty sure it -is- the final story. Just in case anyone is put off by WIPs.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939304/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum]] is one that I've been following for a while. It's more than just Sirius raising Harry, and he goes to Durmstrang instead. I really like this one, and it updates fairly regularly.

** A good fic where Sirius (tries to) parent Harry is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118202/1/In-Which-Sirius-Can-t-Tell-a-Story-to-Save-His-Life][In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life]], a very amusing one-shot by SilverWolf7007. Sirius reads Harry a bedtime story. Sirius doesn't know any bedtime stories. Harry doesn't want a bedtime story.

** I gave up on /Innocent/ because it was solely pre-Hogwarts. It had a great Sirius/Harry relationship but I didn't care for a story just about that.

/Growing Up Black/ was my first real fan fiction read, and it's still one of my favorites. Sirius doesn't show up until later, but the Black family is great. Sadly abandoned.

/A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story/ is similar to Growing Up Black except it's also a Harry travels back in time to do things right this time fic. Unfinished as well.

** Sirius dosen't show up till later - but this is pretty long/good.

Only problem is the take on Dumbledore imo.

He's literally in the first chapter. Unless you mean it takes a bit before he gets proper custody in which case yes.

An excellent read though, I second the recommendation.

**** I think they referencing the fact that Sirius doesn't show up until much later in Harry's life, so its not a Sirius raises Harry from the beginning fic

***** True, I assumed the context meant "later in the story."
