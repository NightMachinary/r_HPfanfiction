I have this tagged as a discussion rather than as a prompt because I really want to gauge the interest of the community in the idea, and maybe have some feedback before I start planning in earnest. That said, if anybody gets ideas from this post, please feel free to run off with them and see where those ideas lead.

***********************************

First, a primer, for those who are not aware of what SCP is.

From Wikipedia: "The *SCP Foundation* is a fictional organization documented by the web-based collaborative-fiction project of the same name. Within the website's fictional setting, the SCP Foundation is responsible for locating and containing individuals, entities, locations, and objects that violate natural law (referred to as SCPs)."

The SCP foundation is probably the largest, longest-running collaborative writing project anywhere, ever. As the Wikipedia entry notes, in the SCP-verse, there are lots of things that violate the laws of reality as we know it. These things (objects, places, people, gods, Lovecraftian Horrors) are called anomalies. Anomalies can be...anything, basically. They can be as benign as a chair that teleports to anyone in a 50-metre radius who wants to sit down, and as hostile as a 200m tall god that would like nothing better than to eat all reality, and is barely held in check by a slowly corroding chain that no one knows how to repair.

The SCP Foundation's job is two-fold:

- maintain the illusion of normality for the general population while protecting them from these anomalies.
- contain anomalies and carry out research on their nature, to learn more about the forces that power them.

************************************

Now the idea. I have been thinking about the idea of Harry Potter tangoing with the SCP Foundation for quite a while, and I have some vague outlines in my head. I want the fic to be set post-Hogwarts, and I intend for Harry and Ron to stumble into the Foundation's operatives in the course of some routine Auror investigation or other. Obviously, the Foundation would know about wizards, because to the Foundation, the wizards are also anomalies, even if this anomaly kind of keeps itself contained. I intend to make it so that there is a link between the Foundation and the Department of Mysteries; they help each other out with research projects and provide help with containment of anomalies and such. As for where the plot would go, honestly, there is no shortage of ancient evils and terrifying phenomena in SCP-verse, it would be a matter of choosing which ones to use and then weaving those into a proper story.

Of course, since this is the Harry Potter fandom, not the Tales section of the SCP Wiki, I will have to make sure that the story doesn't borrow the in-Universe language of the SCP-verse too much, but that will be another great challenge: showing the SCP-verse through the fresh eyes of the HP characters, who would be complete outsiders. Plus I absolutely love researcher Hermione stories, and I think this story can give her full freedom to play to her heart's content.

Like I said above, I am primarily looking to gauge interest in the premise. If anyone has any suggestions, such as may be setting the story in the backdrop of a particular canon of SCP-verse (the SCP-verse has no central canon), please do let me know in the comments. Also let me know if you think the idea is bonkers and no one is going to read it in a million years.


** I'd definitely be interested. SCP is great. My only recommendation is not to let Hermione near the Wanderer's Library. Or do. Could be fun. :)

*** Hermione getting lost in the Wanderers Library and ending up god-knows-where in the multiverse could be it's own genre of fics. :):)

**** Well, if you enjoy writing this story, might be a thing to think about doing in the future. :)

** I'd be very interested but if you wanted a better gauge maybe a one shot or a set of one shots would be best. I'd love to see the hp world react to day-break. Or Snape to Scp-999.

** I read a crossover fic with HP and SCP once. It was more humor. This would be fun to read!
