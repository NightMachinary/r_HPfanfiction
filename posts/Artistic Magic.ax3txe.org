It was odd for me when I realized that, by accident, I was writing a story where Harry & Hermione's daughter found herself drawn to the visual arts and her experience with it was pretty much just what my experience has been picking up art the last couple of years. Any stories with an exploration of how the magical world explores the arts?


** None that I know of. Photography/painting is the furthest I've seen anyone take it (and the latter as a dig against either Dean or Seamus, since painting was considered a housewife's thing and not suited for men). There's definitely painters, spells to imprint paintings with someone's personality, and there are definitely photographers (even if I don't remember much beyond functional photography, i.e. newspapers).

Beyond that, though? I draw a blank. Maybe someone else knows.

** It's peripheral at best, but Saras_Girl's Turn!verse features an artist Harry (first as a wood carver, and then as a glass-blower. The art is explored, but more a plot point than as necessarily central to the world-building. Still, if you haven't read it, I definitely recommend it!
