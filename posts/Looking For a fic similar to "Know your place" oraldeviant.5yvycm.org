I'm looking for a story that is similar to "Know your place" by oral deviant because I think its a great fic and although it has a lot in it it never got finished and it really disappointed me so if anyone knows of any stories similar to it or if anyone did an adaptation to it I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks.


** Can you describe what the fic is about and what the themes are so that folks like me who have never read Know Your Place can still rec you stuff?

*** So the themes are adult, au, erotica, multiple partners. The story starts with Harry at 5 years old being taught by Petunia Dursley how to serve women orally. She uses and abuses him and he becomes trained by her then meets Andromeda Tonks who was sent by Dumbledore to watch over him and be the teacher of his class when he starts school. She starts asking him to stay after class and one day he asks if he can help with her stress unbeknownst to her what he means. She soon falls in love with what he does and becomes his mistress not only to use him but to obtain power and regain her name in the house of Black as well as love and care for him. Harry then meets Narcissa Malfoy by accidentally using the floo improperly and gets transported to the wrong place and he ends up confusing Narcissa for Andromeda. Narcissa then convinces him to tell her everything and he does and she falls in love him and wants him as well so she binds him to a contract that states she will have him for a set amount of time throughout the year. Harry then goes on to be trained by both of them not only sexually but in the ways of magic as well and influence. He begins performing great acts of power and increases his fame and influence as the years go by all the while befriending the girls at Hogwarts and being used by Narcissa and Tonks. He then figures out how to call magic to his fingers and other parts of his body to enhance his strength when needed and also learns parseltongue which Tonks uses for her pleasure. He is also very protective of his friends and often times dark when dealing with what happens to them like filling a room full of his magic when dealing with Draco and when playing quidditch he got revenge for a girl on his team by slamming into another player who had hit her with all his might and breaking a few of the other players bones. Kind of hard to explain everything but heres the link to it. [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B69LsNa8Giw2NHJEMkQxRE5mSE0/view]]. Thanks.
