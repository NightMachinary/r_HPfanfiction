I don't typically read bashing fics as I find bashing characters a bit puerile. How blatant is it in these? And who the deuce is CF?

** My major complaint is that the author pre-empt EVERY chapter with about a 1000 words of the same repetitive information, then goes into replying reviews. It's super annoying. That and the author must have ADD since he/she starts a new fic as soon as the other gets to like 10-20k words
