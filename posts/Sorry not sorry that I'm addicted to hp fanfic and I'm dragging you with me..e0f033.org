:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, it's JJ, I'm looking for a fic. It's a doozy as I only remember one flipendo of a ride. (yes I realize thats the knock back jinx. just trying to be witty, not really working.)

OK.

So it goes like this. Harry, and I think Hermione are soul bonded, bound, bounded (spellcheck?) and really powerful but have little experience or skill. Then they're brought to the backyard or a random country side, I can't really remember so please forgive me. They're taught a spell, I think it's the battering ram spell, most likely made up. The teacher, whoever it is, (might be Sirius, might not be?) expects them to make like a small little hole because it's so power intensive, they proceed to blow up a hill. Teacher is schocked. And the story continues.

If you find this fic I'll be astonished. In fact I'll bet my hat no one will find this so good luck on your quest.

As always.

Sincerely, JJ


** I'm pretty sure the scene you are describing is in Witches Secret. Chapter 7.
