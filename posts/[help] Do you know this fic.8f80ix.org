There's an HP/FSN fanfiction crossover where shirou inhabits Harry's body after a dementor sucked his soul out which leads to a series of events where shirou is forced to try and recreate the life of the boy-who-lived as best he can while avoiding the suspicions of his "friends" and "family" AND trying to keep his vigilante identity---given name--- "archer" from being found out. I'd appreciate it alot if someone could help me find this fic.

  Shirou Emiya managed to destroy a Fake Holy Grail at the cost of losing his life. As it was dissolving, he carelessly speak out loud his last wish, which was then granted by the remnant of an imperfect Grail. As a result, Shirou was pulled into another world, and ultimately, given a second chance to fulfill his wish. AU.
