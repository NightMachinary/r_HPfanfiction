Everytime I read H/G, I think Hermione Granger. Not Harry/Ginny.\\
Also, I have no idea what Severitus is.

Edit: Actually, I'll expand this. What abbreviations in general do you get wrong?


** It took me a while to figure out what on earth “Haphne” was. Not sure if that's the official ship name? Then it took me a while to figure out who Daphne even was. But I guess she is popular with Harry.

**** Turns out that Daphne Greengrass isn't featured in the books much because she's stoned off her ass the entire time. I'd read an AU where stoner Daphne corrupts innocent little (or not so innocent) Harry and walks around stoned all the time. Maybe it would even help perform magic?

** Severitus sounds like a Contagious Disease to me.

I'm abstract. I see H/Hr, and hope for Harry and Helena Ravenclaw, but that might just be my brain conditioned to automatically ctrl-w out of any Hermione pairings as Omnipotent Hermy-Sue makes for terrible fics

*** Severitus: Sev is Harry's biological father -- /actual/ biological father, not technical one due to blood adoption/similar. Originally based on a challenge called "The Severitus Challenge" which had several other rules, but in practice is merely just this nowdays.

Sevitus: Sev is Harry's adoptive father (meaning James remains his biological, dead, father)
