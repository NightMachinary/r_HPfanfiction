What if Dumbledore left Two paths to Voldemort's defeat? A rewritten book 7 where Harry chooses to race Voldemort for the wand. It's an idea I've been kicking around recently and I'm curious if there is anything out there like this or if this is a completely new idea.


** I remember reading something like this. Dobby survived the Malfoy Mannor event, Harry decides to go for the Hollows and steals it from Dumbledore's grave with Dobby's help right before Voldemort gets there.

  This is an AU. Would Harry still make the same choices in his mission without the example of a friend's noble sacrifice? Spoilers for DH.

** Race?

Let's say the trio doesn't forget about the DA coins. They write to Neville telling him to take Dumbledore's wand and replace it with a dud. Neville takes the wand and booby traps the tomb with a disillusioned mandrake. Voldemort opens the tomb, the mandrake screams and Voldemort dies, at the kind of hands of the other kid of the prophecy.

Then the entrenched Death Eater bureaucracy at the Ministry decides they are better off ruling Wizarding Britain without Voldemort and they take out the strongest Voldemort fanatics (so none revives him), leading to a Death Eater civil war

** I would also love to read something like this, even though it feels nonsensical, as the whole "Hallows vs Horcruxes" theme seemed to me when reading the book - Voldemort can't die without destroying his Horcruxes, so I don't see what choice there is.

*** Fandom tends to give the Master of Death some kind of extra power, so uniting the lot could just make him able to 'eat' the soul-bits in the Horcruxes without needing to set off sentient magical demon fire or feed it to a giant death snake.

*** Yes, my thoughts exactly. The three Hallows seem nothing more than powerful artifacts. I don't understand why Dumbledore drew the Trio's attention to them when he left Hermione his Beedle the Bard book in his will. Surely they could have been left out of the books entirely without any issues?
