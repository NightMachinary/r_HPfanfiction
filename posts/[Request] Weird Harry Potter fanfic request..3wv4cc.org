I am requesting a fanfiction in which Harry is a meth dealer. I can just imagine what he could do with that.


** Harry, or rather a very AU version of Harry, is a drug dealer in this thoroughly surrealist piece: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]])

#+begin_quote
  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

**** Lily being a drug dealer isn't a major plot point so far. It comes up occasionally, but mostly only in the summer chapters. Also she essentially controls a crime syndicate, she isn't like a street level dealer.

**** Neither am I usually. If it helps, a character who is probably actual Harry is also there, and his reactions to everything are great.

**** Just try it, its awesome. And a male harry exists too in the story, and is a major character, though he only interacts with Lily, one other person, and a rabbit.

  James Moriarty never existed-but Harry Potter did. With a single, split-second decision, the history and future of the world is irreparably changed beyond anything this fandom has ever imagined.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.
