:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fanfic, where I think, harry was adopted by Voldermort. And he was being treated well by marvolo. Harry somehow got hurt. And Voldemort visited him in the hospital. He also saw how Harry was hoarding food in his pockets. And he showed Harry his own hidden bag of food (because of his own childhood).

Does anyone know which fanfic this is? I can't seem to remember. But the scene feels so vivid to me.
