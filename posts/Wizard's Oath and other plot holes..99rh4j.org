I've been recently thinking of the pet peeves that I have, and one of the more egregious ones is the Wizard's Oath. It's used so often and it's one of the most terrible plot devices ever, in my opinion. It follows the same terrible idea that JKR introduced in HBP, mainly that of the Unbreakable Vow. Which was fun for the book, until you realized its implications.

​

The Unbreakable Vow by itself is an extremely powerful tool that could possibly make any treachery or duplicity irrelevant. Since Snape made one just to protect a snot nosed brat that he had, canon-wise, no obligation to do, meant that it can be made to mean practically anything. Some of the obvious examples are: Why didn't Lord Voldemort make every Death Eater swear a Vow never to betray him? Why didn't the ministry make wizards swear a Vow to say only the truth during trials... etc. etc. You get the gist.

​

Considering that, the Wizard's Oath, as is it used in many fanfics, is beyond ridiculous. It's a single person Unbreakable Vow that basically removes any and all judiciary proceedings out of the window. All that would be requires is for the defendant to sweat a Wizard's Oath that he didn't do the deed, and that's it... Perfect justice system. Hell, perfect system for anything. No way of cheating a business partner. No way of lying yourself out of anything.

​

It would make a very dystopian society. Where everyone has to be 100% honest, because your parents might make you swear a Wizard's Oath that you didn't steal the cookies from the cookie jar?

​

Is it a cut point for many of you? Since it is for me. If I see a Wizard's Oath, as it is used in fanfiction, in any fic, I will more likely than not just drop the fic altogether. It's lazy writing and full of inconsistencies.


** Again, this is another problem with the world that JKR has come up with. It's all too easy to solve something through magic, such as lying under oath. Why didn't the Wizengamot make Harry swear an unbreakable vow not to lie when he had his trial in OOTP? Why didn't Umbridge simply do the same when Harry insisted on talking about Voldemort being resurrected? Or when he came back from the graveyard at the end of GoF?

"Voldemort's back!"

"I don't believe you!"

"I'll swear an Unbreakable Vow to tell the truth!"

"All right then." /casts spell/

"Voldemort's back! You can find him at graveyard XYZ! If you go now, you can kill the shit out of him!" /doesn't burst into flame or whatever/

"Oh shit."

And then no HBP or DH or character growth or development. Because a wizard did it.

*** Actually your example may well show why they are not used very often.

​

Actually if anybody goes to the graveyard besides Dumbles, than the dozen+ Death eaters fighting on ground they have chosen and warded would easily prevent Voldy from being killed, and if anything slaughtering those who went. Even if Dumbles goes, he knows that only Harry can kill Voldy and only at the right time. So it should read...

"Voldemort's back! You can find him at graveyard XYZ! If you go now, you can kill the shit out of him!" /Harry bursts into flames since what he said is not the absolute truth and wizards for the next millennium understand why unbreakable vows are not a good idea. They can backfire if not very carefully done./

​

​

Allowing vows such as the one in the book can be done without opening most of the plot holes mentioned with only the addition of a few common sence ground rules some of which are implied in HP. See my other post in main thread.

** the oath is crap fanon. a bad idea for bad authors.

The Unbreakable Vow must have some reason to not be in wide usage, probably a heavy cultural stigma against it. Snape did it to reinforce the Malfoy's and Voldemort's trust in him which is vital for him since he's a double agent. If Voldemort tried to make his people take the vow as part of joining then his organization likely would never have formed in the first place.

There's also the case that overusing the unbreakable vow would basically result in someone devising a method to break it and thus make it worthless. It's only unbreakable until it's not.

This, a thousand times this. Just think about it: what does it mean to ask someone to swear an Unbreakable Vow? It means you are saying "I don't trust you. I don't believe that you will keep your word. Do this or die."

I absolutely hate the name of the Unbreakable Vow, because it leads to what I just quoted. It's one of the only things we learn about the Unbreakable Vow (from Ron in HBP): If you break an Unbreakable Vow, you die. It doesn't stop you from breaking the vow magically, it likely/probably doesn't warn you that you're close to breaking it (like we see in that travesty HPMoR). It's "keep your word or die," not "unable to not keep your word."

**** It's like the opposite of a fidelius charm - one is powered by trust, and the other sacrifices trust to make it work. I feel like the cultural stigma would be the fact that you are binding a person /with their own magic./ This must feel pretty wrong on a number of levels. For the rest of that person's life, if they slip up their /own/ magic will kill them. Because of the power of such a spell, my headcanon is that you can only swear it once. Similar story with fidelius, actually. With powerful magics like this I don't think cheesing it should be an option.

My headcanon is that the problem with the UV is that it is defined in language (words have multiple meanings, sentences can have multiple meanings, etc.) and thus if you know what UV someone has made you can kill them just by forcing them to listen to some logical statements that prove that they've already broken their vow.

"You swore an Unbreakable Vow to speak the truth at the trial and testified that you had breakfast at the Leaky Cauldron. But you ordered a mutton sandwich which is traditionally a lunch meal, not a breakfast meal. Did you ... oh, you're dead."

*** Well...

It must have some reason... that's strictly your fanon. There is no canon source to claim in the books as to why the Vow is not used commonly.

Since the Vow seems to rely on words, I can think of dozens of ways that Lord Voldemort could have used it and not compromise his followers in any ways. Example:

Do you vow to keep to the pureblood ideas, as espoused by Lord Voldemort?

Do you vow to never betray Lord Voldemort's secrets?

Do you vow to never betray Lord Voldemort's agenda unless to hide his secrets from other wizards and witches?

Off the top of my head. I'm sure we can refine them better, and I'm pretty sure Lord Voldemort could do that. :D

In mathematics, there is a concept of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof#Non-constructive_proofs][non-constructive proof]]: an argument that proves that something (like a number with certain properties) exists, but which doesn't provide a way to actually find it.

We do this type of reasoning all the time in real life. For a trivial example, you can be quite certain that the driver of the next bus you will board has a name (since this person is an adult who can function in society), while having no idea what that name is.

Your original post makes a very good argument about how useful they would be /if/ they didn't have any costs or limitations (magical or otherwise) that we didn't see directly in canon, so we would expect them to be used a lot. However, it is a fact of canon that Unbreakable Vows are used very sparingly. Therefore, there must exist some costs or limitations that cause Unbreakable Vows to be used sparingly.

We can only speculate what they are, and those speculations would be just headcanon (not "fanon", which is a social phenomenon); but we can prove that they do exist.

There is no explanation or excuse you can come up with that makes the vow a good idea unless your plot is "everyone is a bloody idiot for not using this vow when lives are on the line". If Snape deemed it acceptable to take one, there can't be any reason someone else wouldn't take or at least offer a vow when their lives are on the line. If the drawbacks were so great as to make everyone else shy away from the very notion, Narcissa wouldn't even have thought of demanding that from Snape.

********** If someone wants to propose a specific headcanon with respect to costs, limitations, and/or social context of Unbreakable Vows, one can test it against the specific circumstances in which we saw Vows used and the specific circumstances in which we saw Vows not used. I am not particularly interested in putting anything forth at the moment.

I don't think anyone is obligated to explicitly remove Vows from their fanfic setting; implicitly, whatever kept them from being used more in canon would almost certainly apply to whatever happens in the fic. If they want to do something with them explicitly, well, that depends on the implementation.

I am well aware of JKR's limitations, but for the purposes of discussing the canon setting, it's more interesting to pretend that it's internally consistent, even if sometimes, our very limited view of it appears not to be.

Perhaps. As far as the text of a fanfic is concerned, excluding Unbreakable Vows and pretending that there is an unknown reason they aren't useful makes for the exact same one, no? Either way, they don't get mentioned.

***** Personally, I like the HPMOR take on why unbreakable vows aren't commonly used. In that fic, binding an unbreakable vow permanently saps the binders magic. The more complex the vow, the more magic it takes. A vow that has too many articles could reduce the binder to a squib.

***** While you approach this subject with a very thorough analytical mind, you miss one key aspects, that is MAGIC. Magic in HP universe break the rules of science (of all science). So even Mathematics don't apply. And before you start quoting Arithmancy to me: Arithmancy is just Divination using numbers. That's the canon explanation.

Your argument about UV being used sparingly because it has to have a cost is an argument from behind. We know it doesn't have a downside. Narcissa Malfoy asked Snape on a whim and he went with it. So it doesn't have a downside, apart from the conditions of the vow. If you can find any proof why the UV are used sparingly, I will concede. But before then, I will just consider them a terrible plot device by JKR, that are abused by very bad fanfiction authors.

** I will avoid stories which use it without thought or poor phrasing, but if properly done I don't have a problem with it.

Actually with only a few reasonable extrapolations from real world law, and the books most of the examples of abuse would not be an issue, Yet still allow the vow between Snape, Narcissa, and Bella. A mixture of a few to follow will do it.

1. The spell is nowadays considered “Dark Magic” and thus would not be allowed in normal wizarding society (Contracts, weizengamut, etc) since it is Death magic combined with a compulsion. In essence two unspeakables rolled into one.
2. It is a complex piece of magic requiring all three parties to know the Dark spells involved. Thus only 10% of the Death eaters, Dumbledor, and Moody could use it. Oh, also Hermione, since it is in the “History of Hogwarts” first edition found in the Restricted section.
3. A common theme of magic is equivalent exchange, Thus the party who accepts the contract owes the other a life Debt. Narcissa would do ANYTHING to protect Draco so this is quite believable. Voldemort would NEVER want to be indebted so would never make a contract with someone.
4. A full meeting of the minds and equal understanding of the situation must be present in all three parties. Thus swearing to not reveal Voldemorts secret works only if Voldemort first reveals all of his secrets to the person. Likewise phrases like “/to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?/" would require both parties to be aware of the others abilities and what was meant by “harm” As an example If Snape subconsciously felt that broken bones were not Harm and Narssisa did then the spell would fail.
5. All parties must intend to fulfill the contract and must make reasonable actions to see that the contract is fulfilled. Loss of magic or even life is the penalty. Actively attempting to sabotage would equal death. Thus the minute he made it he was protected from Bella and Bella had to assist Snape. (“Bella Baby, can you take over the feeding of Nagini since I need to watch over Draco tonight.” (I would love to see this fanfiction))
6. All parties must be willing and feel no coercion to loved ones, health, or life if they fail to take the contract.
7. A contract will fail if it conflicts with any other magic, such as vows of love, fidelous, etc
8. 10% of the time the vow will not work for no known reason.
9. It can bite one or both parties in the butt real bad.

​

Because of #2, #4, #7 and #8 failure to successfully take one would not show guilt. A vow to answer every question Voldy asks with the truth would fail on almost every pureblood due to innocent family vows of secrecy such as to never speak of uncle John being a squib. Snape's hypothetical childhood vow to always look after Lilly would have caused many vows Voldy tried to press upon him to fail.

It's use is to try to assure that two individuals intent on the same task and the same frame of mind will see it through to the end, not to tell truth or generalized stuff.

​

Some of these rules could lead to some interesting story lines.
