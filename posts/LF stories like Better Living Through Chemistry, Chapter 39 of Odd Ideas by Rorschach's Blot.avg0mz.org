Basically, I'm looking for stories where Harry finds a science textbook and becomes obsessed with the science found in the textbook, and brings that obsession with him to Hogwarts.


** linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist) is a rather cracky version but he's all about that science stuff.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror
