Personally, I just like Harry in a Marriage contract. I know the stories are cliche, I know they are nearly all terrible, but... for the life of me... I want more. I have read all of James Spookie's fics on the topic, I have also read most of the common ones.

*** This was a good idea that was really poorly executed. Harry and Daphne are insanely unlikable, Harrys motivations don't make any sense, and the author is trying to show that the stupid as shit pureblood traditions aren't so bad after all.

** linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement) is most amusing, even though it is only one chapter.

  'Don't think of it as a marriage contract, I don't! It makes it easier- think of it as ... an amalgamation agreement. Makes it sound less complicated.' Harry/Daphne. EWE.
