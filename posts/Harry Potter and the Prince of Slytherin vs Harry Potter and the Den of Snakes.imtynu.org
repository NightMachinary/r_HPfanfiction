Both are similar fics, and the later I think, was inspired by the Prince of Slytherin fanfic.

Having read both, I can honestly say, objectively, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is pretty fucking bad. It's over the top, gets lost in tangents, and kids acting like forty-year-old nobles in a secret organization trying to take over the world.

The Den of Snakes, however, is far better. It's a toned-down version of the PoS fanfic, and kids are acting like actual kids. Yes, the fanfics are a bit dated, since it came out so long ago, but DoS holds up pretty well even today.

The best part, however, is how different the Harrys are in these two.

Also, PoS has a Lily that is just so unlikable. I mean, just wow. I can maybe understand James acting like a dick and abandoning his kid, but Lily? Now that, I find, is hard to swallow. The idea that she would toss one but keep another for the greater good? Makes no sense.

â€‹


** The author of Den of Snakes said that it wasn't an intentional take off Prince of Slytherin, but that they had read the first book before writing so it could have been unconscious inspiration. They also said they were holding off on reading the next POS until they'd finished writing the next DOS.

I like them both but for very different reasons. They're not telling the same story even though you could summarize the plots identically. I'm not looking for realism in POS, I'm looking for the new ideas and new takes on old tropes. The scene with Lockhart's first day of class? My jaw dropped. I'd never seen anyone rewrite that canon scene to make sense before. POS Harry acts like an adult at age 11, yeah, and I wave my hand and keep reading because I didn't come here for realistic, age-appropriate children.

And in POS Lily's defense, she didn't send Harry away for the greater good, she sent him away for his own good. I agree she's unlikable, though. Canon Lily's characterization boiled down to 1) House of the brave 2) died for her kid. Versus the first thing we learn about POS Lily is that she's too much of a coward to face up to (i.e. try to correct) her parenting failures.

Den of Snakes, though. Second the recommendation. Amazing characterization. Kids acting like kids, and seeing them develop their "40yo noble talking politics" faces over time, actively studying it and practicing it on the other kids, makes it much more reasonable when we see them use it for real.

And DOS makes me /believe/ that Harry might turn away from Dumbledore and the Order without changing the canon characterizations very much or at all. Because yeah, one of JKR's biggest flaws is where she assumes a Slytherin Sorting makes 11yo's inherently evil. The bit in DOS where Harry sits between Draco Malfoy and Theo Nott and announces /we are not our fathers/ just hits me where it hurts.

*** DoS has the best natural progression of Harry taking control of the other kids over time. His natural charisma, intelligence, and initiative ability in both magic and social cues really shows how he grows into his role as a major player in the future. The other kids listens to him, /follows his lead./

I have /never/ read a fanfic that showed this kind of Harry so naturally. I didn't even notice it until others' POV scenes showed their perspective of Harry. Most of the time, it's always Harry powering through others, kicking ass and taking names in fanfics. It's very rare that Harry ever takes control of the house of snakes just through sheer charisma.

*** That's not the reason. What's the point in comparing an AU-character to his Canon self?

The point here is that no rational, normal-intelligent person does that. I go as far as sending a squib away, if you write a character as adhering to pureblood standards. But for one, in WBWL stories, they typically are supposed to be on the /opposite/ side, and then coming up with ludicrous excuses of why they "didn't realise he wasn't a squib" or "forgot to check" just hands out IQs of 20 all around.

I once read a story where they /literally forgot he existed/. Just slipped their mind. No magic.

/No one does that/. They don't not work as incarnations of their Canon traits, they don't work as realistic human persons.

** I don't think PoS would be bad if it could get to the f*cking point already! We're at 1 million words and we've yet to reach the prologue, which (as I saw it) will be the point where things get interesting.

The usual criticisms don't apply, if I can suspend my disbelief for magic I can do it for the precocious political pipsqueaks, Lord Potters, etc. It takes some effort, but whatever, at least it's not "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches." Or any of the "Angry Harry" kind of fics where he steps on a soapbox and spends pontificating for hours without any of the people interrupting.

However thanks for recommending "Den of Snakes," I'll definitely check it out.

** Well, I on the other hand found Prince of Slytherin very engaging (the first two books, haven't read the third yet), and the Den of Snakes quite offputting in the later chapters.

Your criticisms of POS are certainly valid. But if you ignore the characters' supposed age, it is and engaging mystery with interesting plans and exciting twists. And honestly, while I like the Harry Potter universe, I often don't actually want to read a story about genuine middle schoolers, so that's not a problem for me (it would be if some characters acted 11 so they can be bashed, but that's not the case here).

Den of Snakes started pretty well, but started making me very uncomfortable in the later books when they started dealing with "pureblood culture" in a very uncritical way - with Harry, and especially Hermione, accepting every detail without questioning and objections. And the purpose of some of those traditions was clearly to preserve the power of the old families, lock out people (especially muggleborns) without connections, etc.

*** DOS started out well on that front, with Harry going "well, my experience of Muggles is that they're awful people, but clearly Hermione and Justin have had different experiences." I liked how the tension between Hermione and her parents came from ignorance and how Hermione solved it by finding a way to "translate" magical subjects into Muggle terms.

But yeah, in the recent parts DOS has started drifting decidedly to racist apologism. I'm holding out hope that this is just an educational detour and that the series will have Harry continue to carve out a third (fourth?) side to the war.

In particular, my pet peeve is when authors try to claim that "mudblood" is a cultural slur, not a racist one. Look, your characters might only use the slur on those who don't behave white - I mean pureblood - but the slur itself literally refers to blood and literally calls Muggles "mud". If you're so enamored with your anti-immigrant racism, have your characters come up with a new slur to use on Muggleborns who /gasp/ keep some of their birth culture. /rant

Which is precisely what makes it great writing, because writing is all about getting me to feel things, and also getting me out of my comfort zone.

This is what PoS doesn't do, and can never do, with its ridiculous crack-y trope use (or "suberversion"): Be serious, and be taken seriously, and make you a hella lot /uncomfortable/ when stuff hits too close to home. It's in those instances, it's also there e.g. when dealing with the Death Eater kids; when you realise there are Death Eaters, and there are students, and suddenly the Death Eaters are also parents, uncles, aunts, relatives and you have to reconcile the two.

It's not an easy feat to achieve, and the mark of an author of talent. It's one of the reasons I consider S&S on another level entirely and never really get the comparison; aside from sharing bits of (early) plot, the two stories (or one story and one treatise) couldn't be more different.

*** Mate. PoS has Harry dishing out his abuses to anyone and everything without even prompting. Who the fuck does that? If anyone has a shitty abusive childhood, they either air it out in an anonymous setting, or not say anything at all in public, unless said people were close friends or family.

Harry seems keep going on and on and on about his terrible childhood, that it lost its impact on the story overall. And the paragraphs... jeezus, the paragraphs are long and not at all read worthy. Half the time I'm skimming through it just to have it get to the point.

** Both are pretty awful ngl. I've read both and I know that PoS is supposed to be a trope inversion but it really doesn't actually subvert anything. It does the trope and then writes it with a faux explanation that makes you want to vomit in its convoluted and frankly obnoxious nature.

The author admits that most of the kids are written a bit older. But then goes and writes them like parodies of aristocrats that British people laugh at in Monty Python.

And Den of Snakes also has much of the same problems, with Harry getting a sort of inverted Slytherin social circle where everyone acts as a supporting friend and confidant. There's no conflict in any of these stories in terms of social settings other than the typical big bads or annoyances.

Somehow Hermione; the annoying Muggleborn that even Harry and Ron couldn't stand also weasels her way into both fics. And everyone calls Theodore fucking Nott, Theo.

Imagine for a moment that you've been raised all your life to believe that Muggleborns are usurpers of not only Magic but your culture. They come in, they attempt to change things to their muggle rational and get angry with any wizards that attempt to say they know better than someone that has only been in their society for half their life or less (in Hermione's case far less).

If I was Theodore Nott, or if anybody was Theodore Nott, they'd give Hermione a wide berth even if they were the nicest Slytherin of the bunch. Harry's Slytherin friends shouldn't be Teddy bears, they should be vicious at best, and amoral sociopaths at worst. He'd only be a tool to anyone of them. And while child politicians is a trope, having a friend for "clout" as the kids say nowadays isn't.

I'm going to be honest, the guarded and secretive Harry that is also just a crazy extrovert doesn't feel real and it is a lazy trope that needs to be done away with.

*** Interesting. I didn't think DOS Dumbledore was that far off from canon. The biggest divergence is that he broke the law when he knowingly sent an innocent man (Sirius) to prison. While that is a pivot from canon, it's not that big a stretch. Canon Dumbledore has a great deal of disrespect for the Ministry's laws (admittedly, with good reason for some of it). And he canonically sends Harry back to an abusive home because he believes the bigger picture of Petunia's blood protection is more important than the smaller picture of Harry's health.

Various fanfics explain it away - Harry really would have died away from Petunia, calling the Aurors to investigate the basilisk would have escalated the petrifier to commit murder, he didn't actually have the authority to get a fair trial for Sirius, and so on. That's fine and there's nothing wrong with that, but that's still not canon.
