** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is by far my favorite HP/Sci-fi crossover. According to its author, the story is already finished, only waiting to be edited and uploaded.

--------------

Other noteworthy HP/Sci-fis:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643565/1/Blue-Magic][Blue Magic]], linkffn(8643565): Really good Mass Effect crossover, unfortunately abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942): The prequel to "The Stars Alone", so obviously.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): They have tech stuffs that were plainly impossible to make today.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354): A HP/Battle Star Galactica Crossover. Adama sucks in this story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10211577/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Alteran-Gift][Harry Potter and The Alteran Gift]], linkffn(10211577): This one is not a good fiction, and feels more like a manual to SG universe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370121/30/Harry-Potter-and-the-Illusions-of-Reality][Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality]]: Both magical and muggle worlds were illusions created by the Matrix.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix

  This is an AU cross-over from Harry Potter with Stargate SG1. This story starts near the end of the final battle at Hogwarts and the vanquishing of Voldemort-HP is all AU from there. Stargate Atlantis never happens, HP preempts it. Other SG1 events happen per canon unless HP and company preempt it. Pairings: Harry/Ginny/Hermione. M for safety.

*** Yeah, there are only a few science fiction universes I have seen with a decent volume of (readable) HP crossovers. Star Wars, Stargate, Star Trek (to a lesser degree), Mass Effect, and Firefly because Browncoat, Green Eyes.

Probably my favorite outside of those is linkffn(3983128), just a shame there isn't more of it.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.
