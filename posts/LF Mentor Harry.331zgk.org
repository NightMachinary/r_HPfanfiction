After reading another post on this sub, I'm in the mood for a Mentor Harry fic


** You can argue that canon Harry is mentor!Harry seeing that he teaches half the school.

If you want specific mentoring, then try [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325749][Clash]] by Shez. Harry and his son Albus have the most fucked up mentor-student relationship ever.

#+begin_quote
  For the past couple years he had frantically scrambled to revive it from his otherwise photographic memory, every instance, every lesson with his father in order to justify his hatred. It came in fragments in the dead of night--- the cold sweat on his forehead, the hardness of the ground, the pangs of pain shooting through his middle as the result of his father's conditioning--- but in the end, he couldn't save it all.

  /“Crucio.”/

  The convulsions, the fatigue, the extraordinary amount of willpower his seven-year old self summoned to keep his mouth from screaming while his body felt as if it was tearing itself to pieces--- but most importantly, mixed with soreness afterwards, it was the indescribable pleasure of meeting his father's approval.

  /“Now, son, remember that this pain is nothing but a mind trick. The ultimate manipulation of this curse, you see, rests in the recipient. Rather than deflect, I want you to control your emotions, make your hardness your strength, never allow for doubt to invade the security of your mind, and you will be stronger, much stronger, than anyone else.”/

  Slowly he had learned to love it, the sadism, the torture, the taste of success, disguised in bitterness and blood, that marked his endurance. His mind repressed the worst of it, but all that he remembered he found to be indefinitely useful.

  /“And if you find someday that you cannot trust in me, trust in my teachings, and most importantly, trust in what you know...you know that I love you more than anything, Albus.”/

  /“I know, Dad.”/ His voice would echo, like a broken recording.

  Everything became so much easier once you stopped feeling.

*** That's more abuse than mentoring.

If someone truly believes that this describes mentoring they need a checkup imho.

**** The author has good reasons for it, regardless of how it sounds out of context, and given all the mystery and plots-within-plots in the story, it is surprising, but hardly implausible.

This is the author's note in chapter 2, where Albus is introduced.

#+begin_quote
  Note 2: Some of you may find Harry Potter's characterization in this chapter questionable and OOC. Good. Question it. Challenge it. Theorize. I assure you that this is intentional and integral to what's going on; it will be explored further in the story. That's all I can say without giving too much away right now, but yes, it is important.

** Define mentor Harry.

Harry gets mentored or Harry does the mentoring?

*** The fic that OP got the idea from is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6519436/1/Criminality][Criminality]] so I'm assuming he wants a Harry-does-the-mentoring fic.

** Not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9466617/1/Fighting-without-a-cause][Fighting Without a Cause]] has Harry helping train someone. It's not the focus of the fic, but it does play a slightly major part in it.
