** I read through the comments and was shocked at the lack of healing spells. I mean, Episkey can instantly heal a broken nose or other injuries. Brackium Emendo (when cast by someone more competent than Lockhart) can heal broken bones. Vulnera Sanentur can heal deep gashes. There are probably other healing spells we don't see since they weren't relevant to the plot. Rowling has said that there are magical solutions to all muggle diseases, so cancer, heart disease, stroke... I'd load up on all the healing spells I can.

Maybe I'd also have to have Obliviate so the muggles I heal don't get me in trouble with the Statute of Secrecy.

** Lots of HP spells which would be considered superpowers on their own, especially at maximum potential. So I use my first set for some superpowers.

- Apparition (teleport)

- Disillusionment Charm (invisibility)

- Legilimency (mind-reading)

- Locomotor Charm (telekinesis)

- Fire-Conjuring Spell (elemental)

Next I will sort out my basic self-defence and other general utility:

- Shield Charm (protect)

- Stunning Charm (attack)

- Vanishing Spell (dispel transfigurations)

- Finite Incantatem (dispel spells)

This leaves me with one spell with which to secure some economic advantage. I'm assuming that since this is us appearing within the HP universe, using magic to get rich in the Muggle world is out because the Ministry would probably lock me up. So I need some legal way to use magic to be well off in the wizarding world. Ideally something relatively safe.

I'm going to go with:

- Voldemort's silver-limb conjuring spell.

This seems like it would be a good skill to have among wizards. It's a rare ability, but unlike a lot of rare magic it is also very useful. There are plenty of wizards with lost limbs who might pay handsomely for a rare magical prosthetic. I reckon I could live fairly well off it - people would probably come from far and wide for me to heal them.

** We need more information? Am like I a muggle who can inexplicably use 10 spells and nothing else magical or more like a wizard cursed in weird way to only use 10 spells. If I'm stuck in the muggle world my spell choices differ dramatically from being in the wizarding world. Access to enchanted objects also changes things substantially. What about non-spell uses of magic like potions or some fanon depictions of runes and rituals?

** This really depends on what sort of purpose I will need those spells, but I'm going to assume that I will be using these spells in day to day life. Maximum potential, hovever, makes this much easier than normal.

Apparition: This is a no brainer, maximum potential apparition means that I can travel anywhere. No more waiting for a bus, no need for a car, no need to pay to fly anywhere.

Accio: I'll never have to lose my keys or anything else really. Useful if I want to be lazy. Also doubles as a potent combat spell, at maximum potential, I reckon it'd be easy to summon body parts.

Leviosa: Levitation is just useful in so many ways that it also seems a no brainer. Also has combat potential.

Reparo: Self evidently useful house hold charm.

Scouring Charm/Cleaning Spell, whichever is more generally effective: Again self evidently useful house hold charm. Creative use might also be an effective combat spell.

Protego, or any other better Shield charm: Obviously combat focused. Assuming the scenario involves me living in the magical world, it makes sense to have a shield charm of some kind. With maximum potential this could probably be modified to produce numerous effects and shield geometries.

A general purpose Transfiguration Spell: This might be stretching the rules a bit, but I honestly refuse to accept that there is a different transfiguration spell for every possible (or known) transfiguration. A general spell must therefore exist. This has obvious useful applications.

A general purpose Space Expansion Charm: At Maximum Potential a Space Expansion Charm could theoretically last forever and could theoretically contain nearly infinite space. At the very least being able to create my own bag of holding would be very useful. Not to mention increasing my living space.

Featherlight Charm: Obvious numerous useful applications.

Finite: Useful for cancelling the featherlight, maximum potential makes it useful as a defensive combat spell, at the least.

That's 10. If I'm not living in the magical world, then I'd probably replace the Protego with a Reducio, as making things small would probably be more useful, even with a bag of holding.

*** I'd suggest making portkeys over apparition. You could take more people with you as well as send objects and people on their own.

A lot of uses of the featherweight charm could be covered by levitating the object so I'd probably use that spot for something else

**** With Apparition, and maximum potential, the only advantage that portkeys have is that I wouldn't have to personally transport objects and people. Maximum Potential could mean that I'd be able to take an arbitrary amount of people and stuff with me, and based on descriptions of each I'd honestly prefer travel by Apparition than by Portkey.

They're mostly a wash really, Apparition would be faster, Portkeys might have more utility. Given that I'm already hypothetically carrying a bag of holding anyway, the only real advantage of portkeys would be being able to send people elsewhere on their own.

As for the Featherweight charm. I consider levitation an active spell effect. Whereas a Featherweight charm is something I could cast on an object and forget about it. It also has extra utility when you consider them both being 'Maximum Potential', and casting both spells on the same object.

** Well this is my list for if I get spawned in the warzone

*Not Categorized*

- finite -to stop an ongoing spell
- obliviate -just in case
- apparition -kinda a spell
- reparo -i break a lot of stuff

*Defensive Spells*

- protego -shield
- episkey -to heal some minor injuries

*Offensive Spells*

- stupify -stunner
- incendio -fire spell
- aguamenti -just spamming it, drown people
- defindo -my personal fav, the cutter upper
- +If we're aloud Unforgivables, imperio in place of aguamenti+

~In Battle~

"Defindo, incendio, defindo, incendio, defindo, incendio, defindo, incendio,"

"Aren't you gonna use any other spell besides- oof-"

Person 2 got knocked back. Person 1 just shrugged.

"Can't, it's the only spell I can use."

"You sure i ain't the only spell you know? Ow-"

"Uh, defindo, incendio, defindo, obliviate!"

** That's actually a really interesting question.

1.  Obliviate, can be really useful in certain situations
2.  Stupefy
3.  Protego
4.  Accio
5.  Can I use unforgivables? Then I'd add imperio
6.  Wingardium Leviosa (because I'm really tiny)
7.  Repello muggletum
8.  Silencio (yes, I have siblings...)
9.  Reducio
10. Engorgio

With this list I could definitely make my life easier. There are some other really neat things, I'd like to cast but I don't think fiendfyre is that useful...

** Useful spells

- Accio- be able to summon lots of things
- Compulsion charm- mind control
- Reparo- Fix things
- Apparition- teleportation
- A transfiguration spell/charm- great for just about anything, even with law of conservation of mass
- Finite-spell removal if I do something wrong
- a cleaning spell- would save me lots of work
- a good healing charm- so I can heal quicker and help others.

Fun Spells

** Spells for like, general life?

The Summoning charm, “Accio”, to get things. The Locomotion charm, “Locomotor”, to make moving things more convenient. The Healing charm, “Episkey”, because that's /useful/, similar to the Mending charm, “Reparo”, and the Scouring charm, “Scourgify”.

The Shield charm, “Protego”, because *CONSTANT VIGILANCE!*

The Fire charm, “Incendio”, and Water charm, “Aguamenti”, because those two elements pop up a lot in daily life. The Light charm, “Lumos”, because light, yo.

Apparition, cuz screw airlines.

** - Expecto Patronum (Communications, manipulating things at a distance, light source, ID verification, and keeping my soul. I like having a soul.)

- Portus (Portkey spell. Dropping someone in the middle of the South Atlantic is effective, and I can save a fortune on transportation.) Also I don't think Apparition is technically a spell; pretty sure it's a skill like occlumency.

- Protego Diabolica (Fiendfyre with target selection capabilities, and no threat to me.) During blood war II there seem to be too many points this would keep me alive. Less dangerous times I'd probably replace with /Gemino/, depending on how/if the degradation thing works.

Agreeing with [[/u/sineout]] interpretations for the next two.

- GP Transfiguration

- GP space expansion charm

- Finite Incantatem

- Protego (or some other shield spell)

- Vulnera Sanentur (heals most dangerous injuries, lesser ones can be handled normally)

- Petrificus Totalus (Harder to get rid of or dodge than stunner, but basically same effect.)

- flipendo/depulso (diff betweent the two is a little vague in canon, but it's a good combo with transfig and PT)

** Things that violate our understanding of physics seem like the priority. Like water conjuration, /Aguamenti/. Unless it turns out to just be condensing water from the air, or is just a temporary construct, or something like that. If it's actually creating matter /ex nihilo/, it could enable things we haven't even thought of.

Apparition has been mentioned, but I think I'd actually prefer the spell that Dumbledore uses to create a Portkey. More flexible when bringing passengers and cargo, for starters. Who knows what might be possible if you push its limits. Stargate, anyone?
