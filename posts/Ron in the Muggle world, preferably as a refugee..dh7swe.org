There is a fairly common notion of Hermione up and leaving for the muggle world. Usually with her ambitions taking her back where Ron and Harry can't follow.

There is also a pretty common plot with Harry getting fed up with wizards and going muggle.

But how about the third member of the trio. Any fics about Ron going muggle?

Setup would be pretty simple. (Have Harry/Hermione/Rob make contingency plans if things go to shit. Then, when Voldemort wins and Harry/Hermione die/get captured, Ron is left to execute (stumble through) the plan by himself. Maybe his family/support network is shattered by Voldemort's victory, so the only path he has is to follow an old Hermione plan...


** Okay, not exactly your prompt, but in my story ( [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13105802/1/Singing-Crying-Laughing-and-Fighting]] ) Ron does and will heavily interact with the muggle world, particularly the world of music, after he gets a job in a record shop.

Only 3 chapters published, and it's not exactly what you asked, but I figured I might as well.

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.

** Not exactly your prompt, but check out Exile by bennybear on FF. It is about Draco trying to survive in the muggle world after the wizengamot prohibits him from using magic for 5 years as punishment for his actions during the war.
