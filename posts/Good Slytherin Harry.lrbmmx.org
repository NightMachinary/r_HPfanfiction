Are there any fics where Harry is sorted into Slytherin, but he still fights for the Light side?

I feel like a lot of people write Harry into Slytherin so they can write a Dark character. Dark characters are not good for my mental health. Besides, not all Slytherins are evil.

I really want to read a Slytherin Harry fic, but the only ones I can find are Dark!Harry. So, any recommendations?

I don't mind if he's Grey. Slash is fine, but no Harry/Snape or Voldemort. I'd prefer if he had a new set of friends and if the plot diverges from canon. No Harems. The more words the better. I'd also prefer if it's not romance driven. Edit: No bashing.


** The more words the better eh? Prince of Slytherin then. 1.1 million words atm and the author's just getting started on 4th year.

**** There's some bashing of James/Lily & Harry's twin to start with but it dies out as the characters & plot are developed. The author's basically writing this to twist all the traditional tropes (wbwl, slytherin!Harry) on their head. It can get somewhat overly complex at times, but that's why I love it, just as you think you've figured something out there's another twist. There's also no pairings/romance as of yet, although some minor pairings are hinted at.

** I have a Slytherin Harry fic series, though it is also female Harry (just want to let you know up front). It's gen and the primary focus is on friendships with a multi-House friendship group, and on family (it's a Snape adopts Harry fic). They are entirely on the side of the light and with Dumbledore. No bashing.

Linkao3(Swiftly Falling Snow)

Another good Slytherin Harry fic where he's on the side of the light is Leo Inter Serpentes, but that is a Harry/Draco fic series, though the relationship isn't the main focus. He also has a Slytherin friend group.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.

***** It's thematic (themes including recovery and coming to terms with things) but not explored in graphic detail. The basic gist is that it did happen, but any discussion on it is lacking in details (I don't have the characters describe it in any more detail than a man was there and it was frightening and painful). I totally understand if you don't want to read it, please take care of yourself.

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/261823/chapters/409958]]) This is also a great series, sadly abandoned in year 6 but still well worth the read. Pretty sure it ends up as Harry/Draco, but it is very fun to read!

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276]]) Similar to cunning and ambition in that it is a series rewrite, it's a WBWL so expect some potter-bashing, but it has a lot of slytherin politics and Gray!Harry. Abandoned during book 5 (sadly) but, again, worth it!

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836?view_adult=true]]) This is different but excellent, standalone oneshot. I would also wholeheartedly recommend the rest of the series - all au's written in the same style but with different premises.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated. And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.

** Linkao3(A very Slytherin Harry by geoffaree) is a still ongoing huge series. Haven't looked into it for a long time since I'm waiting for it to be finished because I prefer to read stories in one go.

It's a severitus story and IIRC the author said relationships aren't going to happen till the later years and the series starts as Gen and I think goes up to Teen later. But I'm not entirely sure.

I don't remember any bashing but Dumbledore gets criticized for his decision not helping Harry with the abuse.

The series starts pre Hogwarts with linkao3(Amethyst by geoffaree).
