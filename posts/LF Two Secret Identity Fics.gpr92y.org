:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking or two, maybe one fic about going to a different school or different identity.

In the first one from what I remember, Harry has several vampire friends who think his blood is rare because it is powerful. I remember Harry attends this group meeting with his vampire friends and both Voldemort and Dumbledore attend and they both take an interest in him.

The second? is where Harry has multiple identities to hide himself. He doesn't tell anyone until the end who he is. Even then, the person, Dumbledore, dies after fighting Voldemort. I remember little about this one but I'm sure Harry has a crazy amount of secret identities. I'm also sure it's finished. Sorry, it's not much.

#+begin_quote
  Abandonned by his guardians, Harry Potter vanished from existence. Years later, a young man graduates from one of the most elitist and secrete Magical schools and makes his way through Magical societies. Fate or Fatality? Ancient Greeks called it Anarkia.
