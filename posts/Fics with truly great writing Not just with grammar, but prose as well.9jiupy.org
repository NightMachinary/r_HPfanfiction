My standards have reached pretty high for some reason so I'm looking for those fics that have the absolute best writing, especially with good prose.


** So, this question [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9gx6cj/whats_the_best_writing_youve_ever_seen_in_a_harry/][comes up fairly often in this subreddit]], and I've always wanted to respond to it with excerpts. And, screw it, I'm bored, so here are my recommendations (I may add to this post later when/if I have more time):

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4316181/1/Thrice][Thrice by lyin]]

#+begin_quote
  Lily looked over her shoulder, to the flowers on the other side of the door, and noticed that the ones that looked like daisies were matted down and not springing back up. There was only an almost solid haze, though she could see through it, as if heat were pouring off some fire and weighing on the air.

  An invisible someone was standing on the chamomile.

  She should have been frightened, but she merely turned her wand and jetted water at the heavy-looking air. It framed a cloaked shape for a moment, pooling over stooped shoulders and a bowed head, and then Severus Snape, only slightly wet, pulled off an Invisibility Cloak.
#+end_quote

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12768058/1/Pot-Kettle-Black][Pot, Kettle, Black by the Divine Comedian]] (IMO, everything she writes meets the criteria you're looking for)

#+begin_quote
  Remus says, "Is the Veritaserum still working?'

  "Yes." The answer is out before Sirius has had a chance to think about it. "Thought it'd be over by now."

  "Alcohol prolongs its effects, genius," says Remus. "Thought someone with an 'Outstanding' Potions N.E.W.T. might know."

  "Wasn't thinking."

  "You're generally not," says Remus. He sighs.

  Well, Sirius has certainly expected more sympathy and less disappointment.

  In fact, the whole conversation doesn't go like he's imagined, pretty much like the wretched interview, but how could it, when he doesn't even know what he's going to say until he says it, with Veritaserum seeping around in his brain, creating voids that suck up words and explode them out of his mouth. No, not creating voids. Creating truths that somehow come into existence because he says them out loud.

  Until today, he hasn't even known what a panic attack is. He's just sort of assumed that it is normal to curl up and hyperventilate on the Hogwarts Express when it's chugging towards London, given what's waiting for him there.

  Maybe he is more like Remus after all, destined to try twice as hard as everyone else and still never catch a break. Or maybe he's like Peter, destined to be pathetic.

  He doesn't realise he's expressing all this out loud until he sees the look on Remus's face. "We can just stop talking until it wears off," offers Remus.
#+end_quote

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12919788/1/The-Cactus-and-the-Toad][The Cactus and the Toad by mirrormarie]] (the scene below is when Snape attempts Legilimency on Frank Longbottom in an attempt to heal him)

#+begin_quote
  Ragged fragments. Cuts, savage and raw, gouged into thoughts and memories. The mind writhed at his presence, and he held himself still, calm, unmoving. He observed.

  Swathes of gray. Webs of thought torn apart like cobwebs, their gossamer strands tangled and frayed, their perfect architecture no longer discernible in the soft, weak tatters that remained. Emotions clung to those tatters, billowing and brief. With the slightest pressure, Severus could have destroyed everything in his path.

  And yet, somewhere in that maze of of webs, Severus could feel Frank Longbottom, swaying like a spider from the ruined threads of his mind.

  Spiders were resilient. They were used in potions as an element of balance, the balance of a perfect web, of blood and air, of life and death. They created to destroy, and destroyed to create. In an elegant universe, their elegance was supreme.

  Severus, though far from considering Longbottom elegant -- he was, after all, the father of /Neville/ Longbottom -- nevertheless acknowledged that there might be more strength to the broken man than the ruin of his mind suggested.

** linkffn(the shadow of angmar) is very good imo. It takes a lot of cues from the Silmarilion and it shows. Steelbadger does a excellent job of making Harry fit into Tolkien's world

#+begin_quote
  The Halls were silent. A distant shaft of light split the darkness and the only sound to be heard was laboured breathing, and a distant rhythmic thunder. His own breathing, Harry realised through the haze of exhaustion and pain. Each beat of his heart heralded a new roll of thunder. Fire, invisible in the darkness, ran across his entire body, and he felt his skin blister at the touch. The light wavered as if it were unsure, besieged by darkness. Harry took a slow, painful step towards it. Then he stepped again, and again. Each step was as slow as the motion of continents, an entire age of the world streaming by. His own personal world was filled with the smell of brimstone, and the thundering in his ears.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** This isn't an easy request because we don't know what kind of writing you like. What one person sees as beautiful weaving of words is dismissed as purple prose by others. Or rejected if they don't like the general idea (eg I wouldn't touch a Draco story with a ten foot pole).

Just take "Dignity in fear" as an example. In my opinion, it is by far the best depiction of emotions I've ever read, bar none. Yet other people can't get past the lesbian pairing, or the fact that in one scene the author inserted her views on body hair (which isn't great, but I can stomach one bad sentence in 40k words).

So could you please give us an example what you want to read?
