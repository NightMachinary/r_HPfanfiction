Okay, so I've got a few stories going on right now but am planning out a big one. It's going to focus of Herpo the Foul, as I'm sure you've guessed; this gives me a great amount of leeway even if I want to make it canon-compliant (and I do). So, this post will be for feedback on my musings, as well as info on ol' Herpo.

- He was in ancient Greece, a couple hundred years before Christ. I have picked 400 BC as his birthdate and about 150 BC as his death. That gives him a lifespan of about 250 years, certainly reasonable for someone with a Horcrux.

- He was a Parseltongue: considering that the snake language is hereditary, and it was over a thousand years before the time of Slytherin, he could well be Slytherin's ancestor. In fact, in my story he will be.

- He was the creator of basilisks. This is pretty straightforward.

- He had one horcrux, and was the first to successfully make one.

We know /nothing/ else about him. He was clearly pretty badass; breeding an XXXXX-class creature, being the first to create a powerful Dark object, etc. But we know nothing else. Now, here's my speculations so far.

- He conquered Greece, successfully, basing himself around Athens. This would be Magical Greece, incidentally, with the wizards and witches being members of families known to muggles as the Greek Gods and Titans. So other characters will be families like the Hepheastus family, or the Zeus family.

- He fell due mainly to the pushing of Roman wizards, which lead to the push of Roman muggles, conquering Athens and leading to the fall of Greece.

I have other plans for Herpo, though; accepted fanon says, as far as I know, that he felt remorse for all he had done and destroyed his own horcrux, leading to his death as his unnatural age struck him. This implies that horcruxes also grant agelessness, dependent on their existence. This could well be, but Voldemort continued to mature and age after he made the Diary horcrux. I think that they don't grant agelessness, and a wizard would have to do soemthing else for that. But if he did indeed age unnaturally after the horcruxes destruction, then that agelessenss came from whatever he used as his horcrux.

I've decided that his Horcrux was a modified time-turner, which halted the passage of time for his body. With its destruction, all of the time that should have passed for him would've caught up, and aged him to dust. This all seems fine, and is more background I have already than the main substance of my post.

Now, magic, in this fic, will be similar to music; no magical cores, nothing like that. Skill is what would determine the strength of a spell, the Elder Wand just making all your spells perfect. So no magical exhaustion (just physical and mental), none of that stuff. You could have natural talents towards certain kinds of magic, in the same way that someone might be naturally better at guitar than piano, and you could naturally be talented or untalented; but with work anyone could become perfect. This got me thinking, though; over time, musical styles have changed, so why wouldn't magical styles change? And, furthermore, different parts of the world have different styles of music, so why wouldn't different countries have different types of magic? We know that British wizards were using wands even before the Ollivander family, but that doesn't mean that Greek wizards were. So here's my idea for what kind of magic Herpo would've used;

/Blood, breath, and will/. Basically (continuing the musical metaphor), instead of using the wand as a drumstick to beat out your magical rhythm on the air to make music with your mind, you'd use your body as the drum /and/ drumstick /and/ music. Your blood represents your body (the drum the magic is played on), your breath is your life (the drumstick used to play), and your will is the music itself. This may be somewhat confusing, so let me put it another way. When a modern wizard casts a spell, they wave their wand (beating the drum) while saying an incantation (guiding the music). The greek wizard would instead expose their blood (the drum), breathe on it (beating it), and focus their will (guiding the music). This would result in a more primitive seeming, ritualistic sort of magic. Of course, powerful wizards can do without parts of this triad; wandless magic, of course, simply your willpower (wordless is just saying the incantation silently, with your mind instead of your mouth). So a powerful wizard might focus their magic with no more than their will power. I think that this kind of magic would be quite cool.

And worry not; this won't just be an original fic using an HP character. It will lead up to the modern day. No hints, though.

*TL;DR*: Screw you, if you're too lazy to read all that I don't need your help.


** Horcruxes absolutely do not grant agelessness. They simply prevent the soul from passing on. The simplest way to avoid having a crypt-keeper type character in your story is to have them use some sort of potion that temporarily maintains vitality (like the shrinking solution that was used on Trevor the Toad).

Another way I've seen it done is through the use of simulacrums / humunculi.

Or I suppose you could just not give a fuck and say Horcruxes don't allow you to age past a certain point.

*** Right, which is why I said his horcrux would be a modified time-turner halting the passage of time for his body.
