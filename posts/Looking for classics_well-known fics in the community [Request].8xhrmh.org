** Master of Death is an actual thing in canon, not just a trope (though it is mostly just a title).

*** Canon "Master of Death" has no special powers, whereas it's buffed to godlike in fanon.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** I would say that the incomplete crossover with the Dresden Files universe "Master of Death" is fairly memorable.

** Okay. All other stuff aside, looking for classic/well-known fics is a misnomer. Lots of fics are classics/well-known and they range from mediocre to cringe-worth. Here are some examples:

- Harry Crow
- Dumbledore's Army
- Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness

And many others, often with poor writing and unbelieveable characterization (that makes me question the 1-2% statistic for schizophrenia in the human population). These are not good fics necessarily though, so you need to be more specific. There is no master list of tropes, although the TV Tropes page on HP fanfiction might speed things up for you.

*** I have to disagree. There are plenty of 'greatest hits' fics that people recommend all of the time on this sub.

**** No I think you misunderstood. It almost seems like the OP is asking for two different things. One is the fics that exhibit common tropes, the other is a set of classic fics that we all know of, at least by reputation.

Thats what I was trying to point out.
