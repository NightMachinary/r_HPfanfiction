Kinda like [[https://i.imgur.com/28wzffL.jpg][this]] where he teaches Harry and Neville how to shave or otherwise acts like a "dad".

** Hold up what about Seamus? Doesn't he have a magical dad? Or is he the one with the muggle dad amped magical mom? Or was that Dean?

*** Me dad's a muggle, mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.

*** Dean's father was magical but he died when he was very young and his mother remarried. Not sure if the stepfather was magical or not. Sheamus was the one who had the magical mother and the Muggle father.

But I get your point. The picture I linked talks about them too all trying to get lessons from Ron on shaving.

***** I think there are very few muggleborns in general in Harry's year. There's Hermione, Justin Finch-Fletchley...and that's it. They're a very small, but vocal minority so it seems.

***** Just make sure to include a lot of little dadisms like "close that door! Were you born in a barn?" and "Go ask your mother" (Hermione probably, I can see her as The unofficial Gryffindor mom).

Maybe add in some dad noises too like little grunts when he gets up and down from his chair.

****** honestly, i wouldn't say hermione would be the mom. sure, by the time they're old enough that they care about looking out for younger students/are established figures of authority in the house, Hermione has developed her emotional intelligence, but I would still say that one of the other girls would be better. hermione is an only child who got her first friends at age eleven, one of whom was an abused boy who never really was a child, and the other whom is the aforementioned dad. my point is, Hermione wouldn't know how to communicate with actual children, especially since everyone her age or older is a war baby with a semi-broken family at best, or a muggleborn experiencing a new culture for the first time. honestly not sure who would be gryffinmum though, i'd say lavender or parvarti but I'm not to keen to label them as mother types just because they are more traditionally feminine than the other canon female characters. That said, given the common fan characterization of lavender as a fiercely feminine woman, who refuses to reject her femininity just bc it doesn't fit with other people's views of being a valid individual, I could totally see her as the mama-bear (or rather, lion) type who will fuck up anyone who so much looks at her babies in the wrong way.

******* Yeah you know what... I like that a lot better. maybe one or both of them has a big family already so they're used to watching over the little ones or something.
