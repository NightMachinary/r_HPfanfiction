So you know those wrong boy/girl who lived stories where everyone thinks that it's Harry's brother or sister and it ends up begin Harry all along ( Gasp; who would have thought).

Are there any stories where they think it's Harry through out the story who is the Boy Who Lived and it actually ends up being the brother/sister all along?

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash. Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.


** linkffn(4641394) I think this is the closest thing you will find in english, I think this is a common trope in russian fics. And it depends on your definition what siblings are. Harry is still the boy who lived, but not the chosen one.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

**** They're mostly in his fic linkffn(The Cauldron) Where he posts his ideas for future stories. linkffn(Neopolitan and the Goblet of Fire) is a fully-formed story that fits this category.

  (Based on, but not an answer to, DZ2's 'Silence Will Fall' challenge! WBWL! James Potter and Sirius-bashing! Female Harry!) When blown off the Atlas airship, Neopolitan was saved by a power from the world she came from. For Neo is actually Rose Potter...and she has been entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Now, Roman Torchwick's partner is on the ascendancy in Magical Britain...

  Welcome to The Cauldron, a melting pot of archived chapters from my abandoned fics, as well as initial chapters from fics yet to come. Mostly crossovers, but there may be sample chapters from pure Harry Potter fics. Rating for stories up to an M rating. Character tags added for most common non-crossover characters.
