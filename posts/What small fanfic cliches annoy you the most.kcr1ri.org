I'm not talking about big umbrella tropes like Dark!Harry or Evil!Dumbledore or Slutty!Ginny etc but very specific minor cliches.

1. If there's a scene of wizards going into the muggle world, they're always surprised by pizza. Pizza was invented before the statute of secrecy was enacted. Why do people think Italian wizards don't make and eat pizza? And for british wizards going to a pizza shop in Italy is either an apparition away or an apparition/portkey/apparition away (depending on how you headcanon long distance travel and wizarding international border control). If you really have to have a "wizards surprised by pizza" scene pick New York Slice or Chicago deep dish because those are invented later.
2. Closely related to the above. Wizards getting surprised by movies. My headcanon is that the best and biggest wizarding cultural events are better than the best and biggest muggle events. No muggle light show or surround sound speaker is going to compare to magic. Their big events make a Taylor Swift concert or Ultra Miami feel like your high school talent show. But the muggles have the wizards beat in the sheer number and variety. For example, a wizard could be surprised that muggle movie theaters regularly show 10 different movies at around the same time.
3. Whenever Hermione and Ron's relationship falls apart it's always Ron's fault. This falls into the bigger trope of Perfect!Hermione and Ron bashing but I'm specifically annoyed by this cliche because it is common even in non-bashing fics.


** 1. That all purebloods except the Weasleys are super rich and own multiple great houses.
2. That everyone can name their entire extended family no matter how many generations you have to go back to find a common ancestor.

*** To be fair, it's not that hard to remember a family tree, if it's already written down for you. It's literally three bits of information per-person (Name, relationship to you, and birth-death dates). And nobles and posh people did/do record that stuff, so if you're just reading names off a paper, you'll remember 'em pretty easily. Doubly so, if you're prompted to recall them properly.

Plus, if they're living, you can technically remember the names and faces of about 150 people at maximum, so that's lots of space. :)

Whether or not they would care enough to bother is another question entirely. Especially if it's just written down to be easily referred to whenever you need. :D

That is quite common for nobility. In Germany, it was required even for higher-ranking, but common-originating Nazi folks to prove their "Germanic" blood back to 1750, the "[[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariernachweis#Gro%C3%9Fer_Ariernachweis][Gro√üer Ariernachweis]]".

*** The house-thing is crazy to me, especially that most of them seem to just be perpetually empty. In an /actual/ economy, free real estate is dead estate - Every manor, castle, etc would be rented or leased out in ironclad, generational contracts.

I.e: It may very well be that Harry has three manors, but two are leased to other families while one is completely ruined and in disrepair. It makes absolutely no sense for a bunch of pristine estates to stand around empty.

The same is true for "shares". Anyone who knows how shares actually work knows that the number of shares grows constantly - there is no way to maintain a stable fraction without actively putting in work.

Doesn't that say more about Hermione than her parents though? I admit, I always saw it as her seizing on this 'great idea' to protect her parents and not really considering the whole 'doing this to human beings' aspect with a dash of 'not asking just in case they say no'.

It's also a sign of how much she loves them imo, she'd rather take away their free will temporarily than run any risk that something would happen to them

Oh and as an aside, can people stop saying she obliviates them? She doesn't. She confunds them into believing they are different people who are childless and want to move to Australia. Obliviation removes memories permanently. What she did was ensuring that a) they got out of the line of fire without argument and b) they'd not remember before she went to get them.

*** I'm sorry, abusive Lucious Malfoy? I've always imagined him as someone who just can't say no to his kids, like he's an awesome dad, at least from Dracos perspective. It sucks that Dracos drinking the cool aid as far as taking on his father's biases, but that is unfortenalty an relatively easy thing to happen. I can be a bit dissapointed in myself when I look back upon the opinions that I adopted just because my parents had those opinions. It's an easy trap to fall into, especially when you aren't exposed to anything else (Draco probably lived a pretty sheltered life).

*** Lucius depends on what you consider canon. Jason Isaacs specifically crafted his representation of Lucius as a "bully" to Draco. Supposedly to win the character some sympathy for Draco's character, but also as an explanation for what circumstances would create a "slimeball" like Draco. So if you take the movies as canon, there is significant hints and indications that Draco was emotionally if not occasionally physically abused.

Even in book canon, Lucius Malfoy is shown as brutally abusing Dobby, and as a high-ranking Death Eater also a murderer. It's not a far-fetched call to suggest he doesn't abuse his family too.

Domestic violence is real, and Draco's (as well as Dudley's, while we're at it!) behavior shows a child mirroring learned abusive behavior. Take any random schoolyard bully and you'll find domestic abuse or at the very least domestic stress (e.g. fighting parents, nasty divorces) in their life.

Regarding "abusive!Vernon" fics... Vernon locked Harry, even in book canon, in a fucking /cupboard/. For days. Now if that's not extremely abusive, I have no idea what else is!

Nah I disagree. Lucius Malfoy abuses those he sees as his inferiors. His wife and his son are his "prizes," and he would never harm them because they're /his./ Why would he attack pureblood wizards, members of his own family? But Dobby is less than nothing to him, and Harry is his boss's greatest enemy.

I agree with your point that Draco imitated the abusive behaviour modelled to him, but that behaviour was not necessarily directed at him. The behaviour his dad models is "treat your inferiors like crap, oh and by the way the whole world is your inferior, they can all lick Malfoy boot leather." He spoils him, teaches him to bribe and buy his way through life and abuse and bully those who stand in his way. The same as Dudley, absolutely the same as Dudley. Both are abused because they're spoiled and frankly not taught the social skills to live in the real world, but they aren't abused the way Harry was or the way Dobby was. It's different, and much more difficult to prove or even acknowledge.

Because in Hogwarts, this was done routinely prior to Dumbledore's tenure as headmaster. Doesn't Filch even dream about "ye olde days" where misbehaving students were hung in chains, and Umbridge enjoy outright torture?

When society sees it as acceptable-ish to inflict physical punishment on children at school, it's not far-fetched to assume that this is also valid at home. (For what its's worth, at least the Weasley family is known for such punishments - Fred and George got beaten up for trying to trick Ron into an Unbreakable Vow)

Physical punishment of children was widespread and acceptable in the Muggle world until the late 90s (IIRC it's /still/ legal in some places in the US, the /only/ country who hasn't yet ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child of '89!) - why should the Wizard world be ahead of the Muggle world there?

****** I'm not saying some people don't abuse children in both the world's. Obviously they do. However I think Filch and Umbridge are meant to be outliers. None of the other teachers, even Snape, do physical punishment. And wizards other than DEs don't tend to attack kids - and the DEs only attack Harry and co...

I'm saying Lucius values his son and spoils him, but with that teaches him to treat his "inferiors" badly. Of course Draco is abused, but not in a recognisable physical way.

Plenty of people are awful and abusive to those they /don't value/ yet lavish affection and gifts on those they /do value./ Lucius strikes me as this sort. Draco doesn't get physically abused because /Draco is a Malfoy./ Draco represents the things Lucius values. Dobby and Harry represent the things he does not. As long as Draco behaves in a Lucius-approved manner, Draco is safe. That's why Draco spends all his time trying to be like Lucius. He knows that for as long as he has dad's approval, his luxury life of no consequence for his bullying and his material luxury will remain. And Lucius knows that by spoiling Draco in this way, he is molding him in his own image.

That's why he wouldn't hit Draco. Draco is his prize. It's pure materialism. You wouldn't smash a Ming vase. It's the same principle.

**** In the sixth book, casting spells nonverbally is a major component of the sixth year curriculum. Snape calls it out as a major failing on Harry's part that he still casts spells verbally in combat instead of silently when Snape is fleeing with the Death Eaters.

Silent casting is at least something I would expect NEWTs graduates to have learned. Of course, just because they learned it back when they were 17 doesn't mean they still use it as adults. Silent casting is very useful in combat situations but probably a lot less relevant for most witches' and wizards' day-to-day lives, so it wouldn't be surprising if many of them let that particular skill lapse after graduation, much like people in our world forget a lot of the things we were taught and tested on in high school. And of course, not everyone ends up taking NEWTs.

** Don't mean to offend anyone's opinion but what really bugs me off is when the story includes made up balls at Hogwarts. Especially because it often becomes the main focus of the whole story and sometimes it's just an excuse to dress up the character in a fancy/slutty way. Plus what I have read was also poorly written, maybe if I find something well written I would like it.

In a way related to this there's the clothing. I can understand why muggle-borns would wear muggle clothes in their free time, it makes sense, but I don't get why pure-bloods are often described to wear them. Unless they're pure-bloods who are very close to muggles (and even here I would have my doubts) they should dress in wizards robes and clothes. For this reason my headcanon is that younger generations dress in wizard robes that are feeling the influence of muggle clothing, as if the newest fashion are robesthat resemble muggle clothing (and here one should also consider how much of a conservative wizard one character is).

Completely agree on the Ron thing. It feels so refreshing when you find a fanfic where they break up in a healthy and reasonable way. Then sure, there could be some little drama and awkwardness (they're still two people who broke up and have to re-establish a normal friendship) but I believe it should be reasonable.

Plus we have to consider that Fudge and Crouch work at the Ministry so they could be required to wear certain clothes. But if I'm not wrong I remember teachers worn wizard robes, students also had robes and I think also other characters. Idk but I wouldn't imagine a pure-blood wizard, working and living in the wizarding world, wearing muggle clothes, regardless of their sympathy for muggles. This is also one of the things that bothered me in Fantastic Beasts for example. We met Dumbledore as a wizard wearing long wizard robes and suddenly in those movies everyone wore 20's/30's styled muggle clothes.

This matter applies mostly to those fanfics where Draco or Pansy wear a leather suit/dress. I find that very odd and very non-canon.

***** Fair point. They definitely did struggle - the open bathrobe at the Quidditch World Cup was a thing, IIRC. :D

Though I do still think Muggle Clothing would likely have something of a smallish presence among the Purebloods, even if it's just a dash of fusion of the two styles. It'd be in a similar way that modern styles include little elements of things from around the world as cultural transmission (in the Magicals case, as their regular crop of immigrant Muggleborns enter and bring their cultures with them) happens. It wouldn't even be hard - there are like two or three British clothing shops mentioned in canon (ish), so all it would take is one Muggleborn somehow wangling a job at one of them and pulling the "Oh, all the finest Purebloods are wearing these! They're this season's new thing!" routine. A little word-of-mouth later and muggle-magical blended things are in fashion. Plus, I imagine Pureblood women would absolutely love the more flowy Pantsuits - little bit of Muggle, lit bit of Robes. :D

I would be interested in seeing more old-timey formal wear though. Imagine the Yule Ball, but everyone is in Doublets and Breeches. Just brocade absolutely everywhere. :D

**** Still doesn't seem quite canon to me in general, but here I'm talking specifically about fanfics; when it's the common rule to make the characters wear muggle clothes, even in situations that would require wizards clothing (and here I'm talking for example about school environment, exemption made for leisure time of course).

To be honest, the fact that this characteristic was justified by the books makes even less sense to me, to the point were I don't agree with the main work itself (on this particular subject of course). It seems a bit odd to me that a pure-blooded wizard, firm in his purists beliefs, would wear muggle clothing. I personally consider this a hiccup in the original books, which is understandable considering it's really a less significant aspect in a huge complex and articulated work.

Anyways, I wouldn't close a fanfic just because at a certain point Lucius wears a pair of trousers, I'm not that dramatic ahahah. First, I could imagine it (as I said earlier) to be muggle inspired wizard clothes, and if it says that those are specifically muggle clothes I would accept it, especially if there is an explanation for it.

Hermione sitting around in the library, studying intensely, suddenly hears a polite, but emphatic cough. She looks up, finding herself /surrounded/ by Slytherins. For a moment, her heart stops. Is this it? She'd read about what happened to Muggleborns in the last war...

She shuffles about, subtly reaching for her wand, muttering a mental apology to the books for the damage the poor things were probably about to suffer, before one of them steps forward, the words almost exploding out of them-

"Teach us how to Muggle!"

"...What?"

Another steps forward, elbows the one who talked in the side. "It's a noun, not a verb, you dunderhead."

"Oh, right. Teach us how to be Muggle!"

"Right."

Two dozen Slytherin faces suddenly swivel to stare intensely at her and Hermione sets down her wand. Whatever this was, it wasn't going to be dangerous. Just weird. Really, really, really weird.

I'm always annoyed when wizards seem to have absolutely zero knowledge of anything muggle, even to the highest levels. If the wizarding world didn't keep up with tech like CCTV or satellites, then the gig is up and they're detected.

At the bare minimum they'd need someone to scout any new developments, at the most reasonable there's a department in the ICW that specifically exists to counter any new muggle technology, and then distributes these counters to the world at large.

Honestly, the muggle and magical worlds are set to collide in the near future. Our world is becoming more and more surveilled, and this will continue and continue on until it becomes functionally impossible to hide the existence of magic. If the wizards are smart, they'll start the process of disclosure well in advance, but which politician is actually forward-thinking, so it would likely culminate into an accidental exposure that tears the secrecy away.

Where it goes from there is anyone's guess.

  1. If there's a scene of wizards going into the muggle world, they're always surprised by pizza. Pizza was invented before the statute of secrecy was enacted.
#+end_quote

That is, at best, barely technically accurate. There were flatbreads that were called "pizza," but not anything that any modern person would be likely to consider a pizza. The traditional margherita pizza was not invented until the late 19th century. Various American styles of pizza, which are probably what they're eating in those scenes anyway, came around a few decades after that.

#+begin_quote
  Why do people think Italian wizards don't make and eat pizza?
#+end_quote

They probably do. But that doesn't mean that British wizards do. With the exception of the food during the Triwizard Tournament, I'm pretty sure that most, if not all, of the food mentioned in the books is traditional British food.

#+begin_quote
  And for british wizards going to a pizza shop in Italy is either an apparition away or an apparition/portkey/apparition away (depending on how you headcanon long distance travel and wizarding international border control).
#+end_quote

Maybe they could do that, but I don't think there's any indication that many do. As I said before, the evidence we have shows that most British wizards mostly eat British food, even if other options are available.

#+begin_quote
  If you really have to have a "wizards surprised by pizza" scene pick New York Slice or Chicago deep dish because those are invented later.
#+end_quote

Why don't you think that's what they're eating? If the author was American, that's probably what they were thinking of, even if they didn't say it. But even if they're eating traditional Italian pizza, that would still be very different from anything before the Statute of Secrecy.

#+begin_quote

  1. Closely related to the above. Wizards getting surprised by movies. My headcanon is that the best and biggest wizarding cultural events are better than the best and biggest muggle events.
#+end_quote

I don't know why it bothers you when fics don't match what you admit to be your headcanon. That being said, I disagree with your headcanon.

Magic can certainly do a lot, and it probably could put on some interesting shows, but they'd be completely different from muggle shows. Magic is great for flashy lights, controlling the elements, and animating objects, but that's about it, as far as visual spectacles go. Illusions are not actually canon. So a magical play would have more impressive visuals than a muggle play, but a movie would still be a very different experience.

I also think you're underestimating the effects of the size of the magical population. Now Rowling is very bad at math, but most estimates of the British magical population fall around 10-15k, which is the size of a very small town.

I live in a small town twice as big as that. We've got one small theater troupe, made up of part-time volunteers, that does about two plays per year. The only bands are all hobbyist garage bands and the high school band. The artists are almost all hobbyists. Even if magic can produce some cool shows, there just aren't going to be enough people making those shows for them to be a regular part of magical life.

The widespread use of super fast travel means that globalization happened way earlier. Wizards are a very global community.

So consumer base for all Wizarding products and services should be the entire Wizarding population instead of just the population of a single nation.

The only times we see foreign witches and wizards are during the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament, and both of those are unusual circumstances.

In Harry's year of about forty students, there are only four students with names that point at them or their ancestors being foreign (Su Li, Blaise Zabini, and the Patil twins, who probably shouldn't even count separately). That seems not unreasonable for a muggle class. But if magicals had a more global society, you'd expect more immigration and a wider variety of nationalities. And again, all the food served at Hogwarts seems to be traditional British food.

So yes, it's probably not a huge inconvenience to travel across the planet, but that doesn't mean it actually happens very often. I think it would actually be more reasonable to imagine that the shows would be the ones traveling to different countries.

Anyway, the point is that you are free to headcanon however you want when you're writing stories. But you shouldn't get annoyed when other fics don't match that headcanon, as long as they also match canon information.

Now change "lesbian" and "gay" to "straight" and you know how we feel. Everything in the world is boring het shit. It's all just heteronormative mumbo-jumbo I can't relate to at all. And I love fics that turn it around, and just make everyone gay.

And even then, most of the time the ratio is just the one it is irl - you just think it's weird because you're used to non-straights being nonexistent in media.

**** I honestly have no idea why you are being so, well, condescending. I am unsure of you meant your post to be, whether I nicked a nerve or something, but it is seriously throwing me off. I am not an errant toddler who does not understand why I cannot have a toy in a store. I know that not everyone in the world is heterosexual. I mean, it was the entire point of my post, really. However, the fact is that the vast majority of the world /is/ heterosexual. Looking into it, the percentage of homosexual people, gay and lesbian, is most less than five per cent of the world population. This was most likely even smaller in the 90s.

The point I was making was that just because the main pairing is slash, does not mean that every other pairing that is in the story has to be a slash pairing, too. I was not saying that there should not be any homosexual pairings at all, just that one pairing should not be a proverbial switch for everyone else, too. The main pairing, sure, maybe even one or two other couples, sure, but then there are stories where everyone is literally homosexual for no reason.

Straight couples do not bother me. Why would they? I am not upset that my parents are in a straight relationship. Hell, every character was often born of a straight relationship. I do not understand your line of thinking.

Where is this ‚Äòwe' you are speaking of? I myself, as much as I hate to throw my sexuality around, am gay. I feel nothing about it. I simply do not care that the bigger percentage has a bigger prevalence in stories. It makes sense. Also, a lot of the ‚Äòeveryone is gay' is written by straight females. A lot of gay stories or gay literature is actually written by straight women. Think of Yaoi in Japan. It is /for/ straight women.

In this day and age, I often see more pandering to LGBT than straight. Everyone is shoehorned in. A gay man here, a lesbian there, a transgender person here. None of it matters, but it is mentioned. It was not like this in the 90s, which is when most of these fics are set. If a gay couple walked down the street holding hands in the 90s, they would be beaten up.

******** You have succumbed to a degree of arrogance; and logical insecurity. As in you've gotten so used to the assumption that any criticism of homosexual depictions in media are to be from a bigoted perspective; that you have become incapable of actually considering the argument as valid.

The previous statement made about Homosexuality being generally overrepresented in the works of specific authors is a sound argument; and ties into the importance of Authors to maintain sound characterization is the face of their own preferences.

Unfortunately due to your own insecurities on the subject of Homosexual representation you created issues with the opinion, when none needed to exist to begin with. I called you out on this utilizing the same composition as your previous refutation.

Or, in terms that actually make sense the guy was right; having like 10 gay people come out of nowhere from what was assumed previously to be 10 straight people is kinda weird; and pretty lazy writing. You gotta admit.

Also who cares about social groups from the 90s. Collectivism is just weird cultish behavior really. Your you, who cares what happened to people who have nothing to do with you two decades ago.

your attempts at psychoanalysis are lacking and basic. You didn't even reference my mother, like a true apprentice of Freud would have done.

Implying that my statement is invalid because you think I have made a fallacy is, actually, also a fallacy! It's called "the fallacy fallacy". Note how you in no way refuted my argument, only gestured at imagined character faults on my part.

It is not a sound argument, purely for the reason that it is invalid. There is no code or guideline that states gay people can only be realistically represented, especially because previously, they were not represented at all. The argument is flawed, because it assumes that anyone gives a shit about what the statistics say in reference to how many gay people they write.

It is only "kinda weird" because you are used to us being invisible. The straights don't like remembering that we exist, they don't like thinking about how they fucked us for most of history, so now they claim the victim by saying "oh no, but there's too many gays!". It's hilarious watching them flounder.

Because, once more, nobody gives a shit.

This, but unironically. I can see what you're attempting, next you were planning to draw a false equivalency about how those same people made today what it is. Well, it's called false for a reason.

The idea that any story which does not include the disgusting bigotry inherent to the past or today is bad is shit, and bigoted. The idea that stories need to cater to cishet people is shit and bigoted. You're right! Nobody gives a fuck about what society accepted in the 90's, because for anyone except white heterosexuals, the 90's were fucking shit.

********** Just because everyone around you pats you on the back everytime you say the word gay, or oppressed; doesnt mean your pseudo- intellectual arguments are valid in the slightest. Some Writers having potential fetishistic opinion on gay relationships has nothing to do with supposed bigotry, it's just an opinion on bad literature. Get over yourself.

**** I love gay ships, but making literally /everyone/ gay is no more realistic than them /all/ being straight. Not everyone has to be attracted to the same gender. You /can/ put a few het relationships in there, just for variety. That's basically all I'm looking for here - variety. That's a very shallow way of putting it, but I don't really want to explain to you why everyone being paired with the same gender in fics is, in fact, monotonous and unrealistic. At least when everyone is, paired off with opposite genders, it's believable, because there is a much higher percentage of those than same-sex couples anyway, and I can always imagine that there were/are same-sex relationships that haven't been mentioned yet anyway. It makes me feel better when I do that >> bisexual

I have two friend groups, one in school and one in orchestra, both of which are /overrun/ by gay/bi people. We kinda just gravitate together, I guess. But remember that Hogwarts is, for all intents and purposes, a /small/ school. Not as in size of the actual building, but the size of the classes themselves. There is around 40 people (maybe more) /per year/ there and most of them only interact with those in their own House anyway. This leaves you with a /very small/ pool to pick your friends from, meaning, you're probably lucky to get one gay and one bi friend in the entire group. There's probably an average of only one trans person at the school every ten years.

** I'm pretty against people making named spells up. Not because canon is sacred and no new spells can exist, or anything. Fanfiction duels would be somewhat repetitive if they were limited to just the canon spells. It's just that every time a writer has someone use an original spell with a name it pulls me right out of the story. I have to go check if that's a spell from canon or if it's new. When they just describe the spells effects, I'm fine.

** Well, one thing I always hate is how in fanfics where Harry for some reason leaves Great Britain, he always ends up coming back to Hogwarts either with getting a letter and going there himself or by being hunted down by Hogwarts teachers

This goes to the extimes when in crossovers that Harry somehow ends up on another galaxy or even another universe, they still manage to hunt Harry down!

This isn't just on Harry, there are cases where teenagers/adults (either OCs or characters from crossovers) get forced to attend Hogwarts just because they were taking a vacation in England. And, even worse, they always get their electives chosen for them (which always is the same ones Harry and Ron took)

There is also the case where in majority of crossovers where Harry is leaving Hogwarts, he takes Hermione with him and acts like Ron doesn't even exist!

There is also the thing where in crossovers where there is universe hopping involved, Hermione always knows about the personal lives of people from other universes in great details!
