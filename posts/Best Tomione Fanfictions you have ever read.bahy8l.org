** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/]] Probably this one linkffn(unsphere the stars by cocoartist). Title's a bit pretentious yeah, but the story is interesting in that neither Hermione nor Tom are forced by the author to change their core personality. They change of course because of their impact on each other (who doesn't change after being around someone who ends up really important in your life?) but their essence remains the same. Also how the author handles the time travel part as well as how horcruxes affected Tom (particularly his psyche) was really well-done.

It's a breath of fresh air after the countless fic where either Tom is made to be this supremely misunderstood, virtually harmless kitten, or where Hermione throws away all of her ‚Äútroublesome‚Äù morals and joins the evil dark side.

**** Uh can't remember, so probably not. If anything it's probably fade-to-black... I read this for the character development. There's a bit of suspension of disbelief necessary (mainly how Hermione gets sent back) but it's worth it.

** I may be new to this pairing as I just freshly discovered Tomione this year. That happened after I had recalled one remarked in this site about Voldemort being an icky pairing with Hermione while digging for more HP fanfics. It sparked the curiosity to know how would their dynamic work?

I discovered that was freaking explosive!

I am currently sticking with stories of Hermione paired with Tom Marvolo Riddle than his stunt as Lord Voldemort.

This one is my first fanfic of them that completely nailed my craving for their pairing.

‚Ä¢ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of A Feather]] by babylonsheep. Currently WIP. Childhood Friends AU. After reading this, I do think that this is a better intro course for anyone who is hesitating to read this pairing. Kind of mild level.

The rest of my list is what I recently read:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185107/1/Stepbrother][Stepbrother]] by cherrycup. Another WIP. Even if the author is crazy slow with the updates but also crazy good with showcasing the adventurous side of children and the magical world. There is also a pleasantly WTF moment with the sorting ceremony .

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13140902/1/A-journey-to-hell][A journey to hell]] by Perhentian.en. WIP. The author is more active in updating this story. This is straight up Hermione and Voldemort pairing with Voldemort wins!AU setting. It is dark and noooot so healthy. I find it interesting that Hermione started as totally clueless of the magical world until she got introduced to it the extreme way by Voldemort.

Currently I am going gaga over [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12020392/1/School-Days][School Days]] by Meowmers. Complete. Muggle!AU. Childhood friends turned lovers kind of thing. Technically, any Tomione works that is penned by Meowmers is crazy good (and check this author's [[https://meowmerson.tumblr.com/][tumblr]] for more one-shots) as the characterizations is spot on. Even the abandoned WIP works of this author is worth it.

** It hasn't been updated in a while, but ObsidianPen's ‚Äò[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10643571/chapters/23549517][Blood and Gold]]' is excellent. The character interactions are great.

'The Anti-Heroine' is Tom/Harry/Hermione, but it's my favorite of the type.

*** Pretty good (interesting perspective on the mirrors between Tom and Hermione), but somewhat frustrating that it doesn't go on (expected, as it's a one-shot, but still...)

** I don't read much of that pairing, though I did enjoy linkffn(tempora abducto) - it may be a bit basic though. I'm curious to see what else ends up suggested; I do think it's a very interesting duo.
