A different thread got me interested.

Basically Hermione goes back in time to when Snape was about her age, and HG/SS ensues.

Mods, please flair as I am on mobile.


** So you're not looking for a specific fic, but recommendations with this premise?

Try these:

linkffn(Thirty-One Days by keelhaulrose) I haven't actually read this one, but it's on my to-read list so someone must have recommended it sometime.

linkffn(Vanity by wartcap) I really liked this one, though I felt that the characterizations were a bit OOC.

linkffn(For All Intents and Purposes by RhiannonoftheMoon) I really liked this one, too. Hermione goes back and forth a few times, and each time the future is a bit different due to her actions in the past.

linkffn(An Unwritten Future by Aurette) I haven't read this one either, but I skimmed the first chapter to make sure it actually is a time-travel fic (the summary's a bit ambiguous) and it definitely just jumped to the top of my read-next list. Aurette is one of my favorite HG/SS authors (and one of the most prolific!)

linkffn(The True Story of Sybill Trelawney by rhitmcshanm) This one's short, but has an interesting premise. I find myself coming back and re-reading it occasionally, and I've never seen another story similar to it.

  In the midst of the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione is given the opportunity to help save Snape's life. Little did she know it would require visiting Hogwarts twenty years prior. She has thirty-one days to befriend the sullen Slytherin, and perhaps save his life. But, as always, things don't always go as planned. HG/SS, time-travel, EWE

** I'm actually working on my first fic, which is sort of along these lines.

Hermione goes back to 1979 but (for plot reasons) has to remain hidden until 1996 comes around again. So she's only a few years younger than Severus. She ends up anonymously helping him while studying the Dark Arts (for defensive/countering purposes, not dark!Hermione).

Later they concoct a plan to defeat Voldemort that will mean Severus' death, and /then/ they admit their feelings for each other. Tragic smut ensues. ;) Then the rest of the story continues (I'm not sure what the etiquette around spoilers vs describing an unfinished fix is, so I'll leave it there for now.)

**** Thanks for the interest. It means a lot to me!

As a reader, I /hate/ abandoned stories. I don't want to do that to my own readers. And since this is my first fic, I don't want to "overpromise"... so I'm going to wait until it's done before I start posting it.

I'll let the sub know when it starts to go up. I'm planning to use NaNoWriMo as motivation, so look for it at the beginning of December. :)

***** Sure, just PM me when you have it up. I can read it over before you publish too, if you want.

Personally, I feel pretty anguished when I find out a fic is abandoned, but I don't feel bad for reading it in the first place if it is good.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
