** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) has this in spades. Well, the political parts, and Harry is certainly powerful. There is technically a pairing with an OC, but the romance is hardly in focus.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** linkao3(1149623) - Not quite sure if this is what you're looking for, but it's a good read nonetheless. A bit of a revenge tale, if I recall correctly, told in the form of a thesis written by Hermione. It definitely fits the criteria of "[changing] magical Britain to his own liking", so to speak.
