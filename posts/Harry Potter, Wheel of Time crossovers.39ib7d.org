I'm currently smashing my way through WoT and I'm feeling a bit burnt out from it (first 3 books in a week) and I need a little motivation to keep going. Are there any crossovers with Harry Potter that are worth mentioning? If so please tell me about them without massive spoilers as I am only just starting book 4 out of 14. If there are any that are safe for me to read right now that would be fantastic but if they're not I still want to know about them to give me an extra reason to push through the [[/spoiler][Nynaeve]] chapters.


** Protip from a longtime WoT fan: When you get to book 8, don't feel bad about just skimming it.

*** I skipped books 5-9 and I barely missed any plot. IIRC the only important thing that happened was [[/s][Spoiler]]

*** I'm already skim reading Nyneave and Egwene's chapters. Do any of the books follow the previous Dragon and the falling of the forsaken or is their story just dotted about in pieces?

**** Just dotted about mainly.

There is a supplementary reference book called "The world of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time". Which has a lot of information about the forsaken and the age of legends that never gets expanded on in the novels.

Worth a read if you can find it. It has spoilers for events that happen up until about book 7.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6137687/1/A-Darker-Shade-of-Light-Part-I][A Darker Shade of Light]] by st122 is good. Part 2 is unfinished and hasn't been updated in a good long time, but it's a great crossover up until that crushing disappointment.

*** To be fair, I once re-read the entire series in about a week (was when Memories of Light came out), so it's not too unusual.
