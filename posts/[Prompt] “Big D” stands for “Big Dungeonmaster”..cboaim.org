Dudley Dursley gets really into D & D with his gang. Dudley is the Dungeonmaster and hides the fact that he plays fromhis parents, because D & D features magic. He uses Harry's accidental magic as inspiration for his campaigns.


** It'd be interesting if he thought Harry was a wild magic sorcerer.
