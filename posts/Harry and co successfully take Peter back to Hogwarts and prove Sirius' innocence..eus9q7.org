Maybe Remus had taken the potion, or maybe he had enough time to run off before transforming, or it just wasn't a full moon that night, something.

I strongly prefer if it Peter doesn't somehow escape soon after. He gets executed or put in azkaban until Voldemort breaks all the death eaters out (if he manages to).

What are some good fics where this happens?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Changes)

Its a much older story and probably a influential one at that as it touches many of the tropes but at the time it wasn't as played out

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

*** I just read the first couple of chapters and it doesn't really make sense to me.

They apparently go back to give Remus instructions, but at the same time, they also dont go back. So they couldn't have given Remus instructions. It seems like a good premise, but it starts off messy right off the bat. So I dont really know what to make of it ^^

  -Ron will not be a big part of this story. He will fall out of touch with Harry and Hermione. I will not bash him overly obscene but I just don't enjoy this character.

SMH. But I'll give credit where it's due: at least there's a warning.

  This is a AU where Harry and Hermione use the timeturner to change one more thing and it makes all the difference. It changes the course of the world to a better turn. A lot of politics and also Fluff.Of course, this is a fan-fiction. I don't own Harry Potter in any kind or way and I don't make money with this story.
