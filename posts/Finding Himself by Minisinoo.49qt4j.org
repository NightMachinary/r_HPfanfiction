In light of the mild uproar about JK's Pottermore article regarding Native Americans, I thought I would rec my favorite fic.

Min is a Native writer whose background definitely influences her work, even if Native topics aren't present. Her work in X-Men fanfic is more specifically Native-centric, but in Finding Himself Cedric has a history with Native Americans and a pet raccoon. It's also a good look at living with disability, and a decent Cedric/Hermione story. Min's Umbridge is even more convincingly horrible than JK's if you can believe it.

Min is a wonderful writer in general, and I can't recommend her work enough.


** Such a good story. Sad she didn't finish the sequel, but I'll take what I can get.

*** I've considered finishing it myself, I love that story and I was also heartbroken when she stopped. I helped beta one of her Aorist Subjunctive stories back in the day and I'm fairly certain she would be happy/not against someone finishing it. Maybe I should contact her and see if I can get her notes....

** I loved Finding Himself. I'm so sad that Min never finished the sequel (though she did post a plot summary) and that she stopped writing fanfic (last I knew).

** Hey, Finding Himself has been on my to-read list for a while now, this just reminded me to read it! I'm pretty not-up-to-date with Pottermore, do you have a link to a summary of what the uproar is about?
