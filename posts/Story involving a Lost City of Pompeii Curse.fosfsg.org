The Pompeii Curse: An AOE (Area of Effect) Curse which spreads a magical ash which vaporizes the people trapped inside its coverage. It leaves only the outline of their bodies as evidence. It's regarded on about the same level of ðŸ˜± as Fiendfyre, only there is a built-in application to the curse which can be employed (or disregarded) to contain it (or not).
