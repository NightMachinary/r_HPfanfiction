Hi everyone, forgive me if this question is a bit stupid. I've just started to read more HP fanfiction and always see "!" between two words i.e. Dark!Harry or Ravenclaw!Hermione.

I haven't been able to find an explanation on this subreddit. Could someone please enlighten me as to what this means?


** The ! separating a character name and a trait is a trend designed to indicate that the character will have that trait within the story. Its also a loosely standardized way to assist those searching for stories involving with particular things.

** The best I can offer is that it can facilitate searching for results more easily. To use your examples, searching for Dark!Harry yields a more cohesive & relevant set of results than searching for Dark Harry. Something about matching the search string exactly.

*** Yeah, but then you see fics with descriptions like:

#+begin_quote
  Dark!Angsty!Severitus!Indy!Heir-of-Griffindor!Heir-of-Slytherin!Hufflepuf!Azkaban!WBWL!Harry
#+end_quote

How are you supposed to keep all of those words in the proper order? /s

**** You don't. Simply said that's a use of the format by someone who doesn't know the format.

** The first part is a trait, the second part is the character. It's typically used in fanfic to separate an author's version of a character from the canon one. So Dark!Harry is a Harry that is... well dark, and Ravenclaw!Hermione is a Hermione who is part of Ravenclaw house

** [[http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/moonbeam/terms.html][This link]] has a full list of fanfic terms and meanings, and the answer to your question is the very first one they list. But basically, it's just a way to say that a character has a certain trait that is featured prominently in the story - for example, Ravenclaw!Hermione means that her personality will be more stereotypically Ravenclaw than Gryffindor.

Technically, that should be e.g. since you're presenting an example. The Oatmeal has a good [[http://theoatmeal.com/comics/ie][comic]] on this.

I interpret this as a short hand for "X who is Y" or "X who is more characteristically Y in the story", written as Y!X. So a Dark!Harry story would be one where Harry is portrayed or written as a Dark oriented character, instead of the 'Light'.

#+begin_quote
  Dark
#+end_quote

It's interesting how a lot of authors use Dark as a classification of Magic rather than morality. Canonically Dark is closer to "The Dark Side" which is traditionally evil (corrupted). I personally like to think of it as a spectrum. All magic requires some amount of 'sacrifice', in some form or another. Most 'Grey' or neutral magic simply requires energy, concentration, time, or some spiritual equivalent. 'Dark' magic is the sacrifice of blood, limbs, senses for benefit. I therefore think that blood is a relatively neutral sacrifice since it is easily replenished. In contrast cutting off limbs, severing neural connections, or killing are more major sacrifices. (This would potentially include sacrificing memories!) Note that these sacrifices can be for personal gain or communal gain. On the other side, Light magic would probably be more Prayer oriented, or would draw from (positive) emotions.
