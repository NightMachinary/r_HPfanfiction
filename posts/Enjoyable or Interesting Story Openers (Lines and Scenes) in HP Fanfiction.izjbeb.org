So, our combined inspiration (the Harry Potter series) has one of the most quotable opening lines in western literature. It sets the tone of the first book perfectly, tells you absolutely everything you need to know about Harry's starting situation and the Dursleys and just... it's real good, that's what I'm saying. A good opening line/scene is incredibly important for getting readers interested and setting up the 'introduction' to the rest of the story/world/characters and really can be the difference between selling a book's internal reality and not.

I'm curious to see what the community has come up with.

So, what fanfiction openers have you seen that you've enjoyed or found interesting? I don't care if everything after chapter/act one is completely awful, I'm just looking for the opening lines or scenes, that's all.

EDIT - And why not, let's add a discussion section to this. What do you think makes a good opening line or scene in a story? What makes one grab your interest?

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** "I am Lord Voldemort, and I was one step away from conquering Wizarding Britain.

October 31st, 1981 began as a fairly normal day -- arranging raids, crucioing incompetents, lazing about on my throne -- yet it seemed that everything my followers did irked me.

Bellatrix crouched at my feet, sneaking glances and occasionally emitting dreamy sighs -- exactly the sort of behavior that caused me to turn myself into a nose-less snake. Rabastan Lestrange was playing a game called Curse the Recruits, the recruits were screaming, Nott was paging through one of my Dark tomes, and Lucius had disappeared to go brush his hair or something. There were worse ways to spend Halloween, I supposed"

In every 'best collection of words in a certain order' type request I've seen, Seventh Horcrux always pops up.

** From my favorite WBWL fic, *Subversion* by Myricle. It tells you all you need to know about the story in three paragraphs. The entire fic is superbly written; such a shame it's abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  When the World Cup Disaster began, I was sitting in the Top Box with the Minister of Magic shrieking in the seat beside me.

  On my left, Draco Malfoy followed the game with an intensity and enthusiasm that he rarely allowed himself to display. Beyond him, Theodore Nott had barely taken his Omnioculars from his head since the game began, though he seemed to divide his attention between the players and the crowd, enjoying the opportunity for unrestricted people-watching. Theo was never as into Quidditch as most boys our age seemed to be, and I had worried beforehand that he might get bored. When I noticed the amusement on Theo's face, a part of me relaxed.

  In the lowest seats of the Top Box, my twin brother Jim was screaming up a storm, and the Weasleys and Uncle Padfoot were cheering right along with him. I liked the Weasleys well enough, and I loved Uncle Padfoot, but four years after being Sorted into Slytherin, I knew my crowd. They understood.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

*** Ooooh, you're right, that is /good/. Strongly 'tell'-ey, but with a good layer of 'show' around it that expands the implications and gives you plenty of stuff to infer.

I also haven't read the fic, so thanks for that rec! :)

** The Eyes by Shadenight123

The faces smiled. The glassy eyes looked. They watched. He gripped the long sleeves of the overly portly muffler and covered his face to hide his self from the eyes. The eyes always watched. The noses breathed in and out. He didn't understand their words. He remained quiet. His corner was his. He looked through with his bright green eyes from the crack in the door. The door wasn't his. It belonged to the portly man who always screamed when he saw him. He heard the voices. The voices always talked. One man was different. The people talked some more. There was something different about that man. He didn't look at the portly owner of his door, and yet he looked. The man looked at him. It looked at Harry. Harry Potter looked back.

Lovecraftian Harry Potter story gripped me from the start

*** Oh, I do adore that fic. One of the best examples of Lovecraftian Horror I've ever read. The intro is definitely great. I love the cadence of that sentence structure, it really sets up the disjointed-but-horrifyingly-real way Harry sees shit and the whole 'eyes watching' motif. Love it. :)

**** Aghhh Finally someone else who enjoys Lovecraftian Horror !! What I also like about the beginning of this fic is the ambiguity of it all. A lot of authors start with an info dump that will really deter me from even trying to read it. But explaining just enough to entice and holding that bit of mystery throughout the story really is the thing that really makes me stick with a story. Showing less makes the imagination go wild and I wish more people did that. I want to be just as curious as the protagonist of the story be confused, gripped, excited, nervous. But when the narrative structure just explains everything in great detail in terms of exposition it makes me stop right from the beginning. The monsters are vaguely explained in the story “Eyes” but never enough to actually draw a clear picture. Always just out of reach in the shadows but still overbearing in its presence. So indescribable that it transcends. Which is what I like about Lovecraftian horror and why I prefer it to Gothic or slasher stories. It's so vast and awe inspiring that you can't even explain it.

***** Indeed. That's the delight of Lovecraftian Horror, and kind of psychological horror in general. To paraphrase Alan Wake (who IIRC was quoting Stephen King?), it's the unanswered questions in the beginning that keep us reading in hope of finding the answers, not the Lore Dumps.

That's kinda part and parcel of the Cosmic Horror genre, and definitely a reason I love it too. The utterly alien is fascinating to try investigate like that, really grabs hold of my curiosity and intrigue. And the surrounding universe always interested me as well - the sheer expanse of it all and the integration and dynamics of it into the greater whole, filtered through our limited perceptions and understandings. Especially the old Victoriana Psychology stuff the older-setting stories try to integrate - that interests me on a professional standpoint too. The idea that there's such a thing as too sane. Quite odd to contemplate. :)

I do enjoy the opposite end of Cosmic Horror too, actually. Things like the Fallen London series or the Laundry Files series, or even Welcome to Nightvale. The kind of 'daily-grind'-ification of the abstract weirdness is utterly fascinating too. Like not having an Elder God hiding in your toolshed is the weirder option. :D

****** Wow now I want to steal your reading list! You explain things so eloquently! I love Night Vale but haven't heard of the “fallen London series” and Laundry files series so I'm excited to check it out! If you like cosmic horror or even horror in general I would really really recommend you the podcast the Magnus archives it's absolutely fantastic and everything you explained that you enjoyed is definitely in there! Even my username is named after on of the characters.

******* Thank you! I volunteer in a lot of roles where explaining stuff is a vital skill, so I'm glad to hear I still got it. :)

Fallen London is a series of Video Games (Fallen London, Sunless Sea, and Sunless Skies) about if Victorian London got stolen by bats and dragged into an underwater cave where things are Weird. They're incredibly good Weird Fiction. The first one is a free interactive fiction browser game, the latter two are more actively interactive in the traditional video gaming sense.

The Laundry Files is a published novel series by Charles Stross that basically asks what it would be like if the British Civil Service had a department to deal with Cthulhu. It does turn incantation into mathematics and technical science a bit too much in places, but it also has pentagrams made of electricity and lasers because of it, so I forgive it that indulgence. :)

You have good taste, The Magnus Archives is great, though it really requires you listen to catch everything and get the atmosphere and I haven't been able to find the time to stay caught up. I'm still somewhere near the end of Season One. Life shit, y'know? :)

I've actually met Jonathan Sims a couple times at the Edinburgh Fringe - he was part of a Steampunk Storytelling band called The Mechanisms. Basically, they took old myths and folklore and turned them steampunk (eg. the tale of Ulysses becomes a film-noir-ish interrogation about the passcode to a vault by shadowy minions of powerful families ruling a planet-city), then sung about them in a very burlesque sort of fashion. I'd thoroughly recommend you youtube them, they're fantastic if you're even vaguely into Steampunk.

******** Oh my God you're so cool and lucky! Honestly I'm pretty much open to everything! I don't know everything about steampunk but there is a book called Mechanique: a tale of the Circus Tresaulti by Genevive Valentine it's about a steampunk dystopian future were a mechanical circus is at war within. It might interest you. Also do you like sci-fi specifically authors like Philip K Dick? Because if you like stuff like cosmic horror and the transcendence of reality. I think you will really really like the book Ubik which deals with the crumbling of reality as we know. Anyways thank you for taking the time to write all your insightful comments Now I have so much to check out and I'm very excited!

********* I don't know about the first, but I definitely agree with the second. He was such a delightfully nice guy to a heavily fangirling teenager.

I have not read either of those things, but they both sound right up my street. I'm a big Philip K Dick fan, though I've only read Man in the High Castle and Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, so I'm pretty sure I'll like that. Genevieve Valentine is such a cool name, too. Definitely sounds like the sort of person who'd write stories about a steampunk circus. :D

** “Tom Riddle first met Death on the train to Hogwarts, although he did not know it at the time.” This is the first sentence from the story October by The_Carnivorous_Muffin Again there is this sort of simplicity to it that grips you and eases you in to more complex parts of the story. In my opinion being able to explain and write things in a simple way is an art form and very difficult. But if you're able to attract the readers attention with a short and simple beginning everything else is secondary. This doesn't mean that I don't love descriptive or flowery language in fact I love it. However, in my opinion even if you're going to be descriptive in your story the reader should be able to tie things up in their mind, meaning that however absurd your world is there should be a few loose rules to not divert the attention. Idk does that make sense?

*** Definitely makes sense. That's actually part of what makes good Weird Fiction. Keep it simple, otherwise it becomes too weird for people to get their head around and relate to. The Fallen London writing advice basically boils down to 'simple and specific'. Though that's a tangent I can ramble off onto for days, so I'll cut it off there. :D

Conciseness and simplicity are some of the hardest Writing Virtues to learn, you're definitely right there. I like the way you put it though, that simplicity 'eases you into the more complex parts of the story'. It's like layering, right? You start off with a simple foundation, then build more and more onto it until you've got a house that Edith Finch's family would be envious of.

** “I remember waking on the day before the end of the world.”

The story is called Countdown by Silens Cursor and it's a one shot. How can this first sentence not intrigue someone?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5090849/1/]]

“These are the last words of a dying universe. My name is Harry Potter and I just destroyed everything; space, time, space-time, matter, dark matter, anti-matter, all twenty-six dimensions of our fragile little world in the twinkling of an eye. The fabric of creation peeled apart, cut to ribbons under the blade of my will, wrenched apart particle by particle. They gave me a universe and I reduced it to dust. Accidentally, of course.”

Also this story called The Sun Dog written by enembee The accidentally of course part really does it foe me with it because it reminds me of hitchikers guide to the galaxy.
