I see Creature Inheritance mentioned a lot, and I was hoping if someone could explain it to me please?


** Pretty sure it's when Harry is part magical creature and has certain traits because of it. Possibly traits that don't show themselves until a certain age.

** In general, at least one of Harry's parents wasn't completely human, and Harry is now finding himself changing to resemble the non-human portion of his heritage.

Technically all the crossovers where he's part Asgardian or Kryptonian should count. However, it's usually limited to those who are more noticeably not human. Veela, Fae, Demon are probably the most common. Tamaranians get the same treatment in cross overs.

How he gets treated for the change varies wildly. In some purebloods are fine with crossbreeding, and muggleborns are too uptight about that sort of thing. Others he's treated as an at least borderline abomination.

Tends to get used a lot in ultra-rapey MPreg a/o harem stories.
