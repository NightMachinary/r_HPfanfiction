** Harry ground his teeth in frustration. How anyone could see this as anything other than beyond the pale mystified him.

"Ron, how can you not see it?"

"See what, mate?"

Harry pointed at the subject of their argument. It was Professor Snape; he was dressed in a school shirt and ---to Harry's utter disgust--- shorts that left little to the imagination. A rather obnoxious and colourful propeller cap completed the horrendous parody of a school student. Snape was currently working his way through a comically large lollipop.

"What in all the Hells is Snape doing!?"

Ron jumped out his seat and looked around fearfully, "Snape! Where?! Oh no, I haven't finished the essay on Wolfsbane he gave us last week!"

"You're having me on, aren't you? He's right there!", Harry roughly grabbed Ron by the shoulders and forced him to look at the object of his discontent.

Ron just looked baffled, "What? Him? That's Barney. He's an exchange student."

"He reeks of potion fumes! They're coming off of him in literal stink lines!"

His ginger friend looked at him with disapproval. The expression would have been more natural on Hermione's face. "That's not very nice. I mean sure he doesn't smell all that great but it seems a bit much to point it out like that. That's cold, mate."

"He's taking points off of Gryffindor and shoving Neville into a locker! I didn't even know we had those?!"

Ron merely tutted, "Prefects can do that to their own houses. Plus, I'm pretty sure it's been in the school rules that Neville needs to be bullied for at least twenty minutes a day. Been that way since first year...or wait, maybe it's the opposite, I was never super clear on that."

"HE'S IN SLYTHERIN!"

"Maybe he switched houses...then switched back."

"You can literally see the Dark Mark on his arm!"

"Hey, not all Slytherin's are evil?", Ron had an uncertain look on his face. Admitting as such would spit in the face of everything he believed in.

"...And now he's destroying all the Shampoo that the twins sent him and frothing at the mouth!"

Realisation slowly dawned on Ron's face.

"Harry...do you think Voldemort's disguised himself as a student?!?"

Harry began beating his head against the table while sobbing violently.

**** Yeah, I'm writing a story at the moment though it's horror/drama inspired by Stephen King rather than comedy.

** This strikes me as extremely out of character for snape, which makes me very, very interested in reading how he gets in that situation while remaining true to character.

** Why would Snape use polyjuice to pass as a student if he want to avoid a meeting ? Wouldn't not going achieve the exact same effect, anyway he doesn't have a justification for his absence.
