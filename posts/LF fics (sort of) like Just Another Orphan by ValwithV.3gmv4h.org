Having just read this story, I'm really interested if anybody else has explored a Harry that:

1) Has more violent tendencies and a dimmer view of muggles due to his upbringing

2) is dark, without being evil. (ie. Not a minion/ally of Voldemort, but still super interested in the more restricted aspects of a well-developed magic system.)

3) (optional) Has a decent relationship with Hermione.

4) (optional) Is not the BWL.


** I haven't read the new JAO update, but I recall Harry was kind of a bitch in the earlier chapters, which is why I don't really feel like reading more of it.

I recommend Malachite Gift by Lazov (and its sequels), Ravenous by Edelrost, and Traitor's Son by Sesc (could be read on DLP).

*** Last two chapters was rewritten, he's much less of a whiny cunt now. I rather like it.

**** Yeah, just read the update, it's certainly an improvement without him being exploited by Malfoy, though the story still feels somewhat stale, and Harry a rather boring character.

You can find the story in the WbA (Work by Author) section on the DLP forum. Haven't been published on FFNet yet.
