Luna Lovegood is playing with magic she doesn't understand and in a flash of bright light the world fades from her eyes. When she comes back to consciousness she looks to be in a police hiding cell and sitting in front of her is an odd man with white hair and glasses but he doesn't look to be that old. He holds out a plate of cookies to her and says "Miss. Lovegood you have silver eyes".


** Her semblance creates the crumbled horned snorlack and any other creature she imagines
