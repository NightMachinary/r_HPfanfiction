** Speaking of Kathryn518; are they still around anywhere anymore?

Been over a year now since they last updated anything of theirs.

** Check out linkao3(C'est La Vie) which was /the/ dimension travel fic. I enjoyed it 2 years ago on the initial read, but not as much the 2nd time around, so YMMV

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
