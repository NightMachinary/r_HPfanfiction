I absolutely LOVED linkffn(Harveste), and the entire series proceeding it, but the author just stopped updating suddenly with no explanation. I'll consider anything you think is similar, and give my thoughts.

Thanks so much!


** I haven't read Harveste, but if you're looking for a neat HP/Addams crossover then I recommend linkffn(11674317)

*** This is one of my favorite fics. So much fun to read, and the dark!Harry and manipulative!Dumbledore tropes are done in a way I've never seen before.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

  He's done it. He's just five years old, but he's finally done it. The Dursleys are gone. And now he's with a new family who seems just as twisted as he is. How strange.

** If you're looking for a good Addam's family crossover... It isn't Harry Potter crossed, but I'm pretty fond of this one:
