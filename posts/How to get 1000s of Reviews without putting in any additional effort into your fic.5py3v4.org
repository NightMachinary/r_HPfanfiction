Just write a normal story at about 50,000 words long, and then split it into chapters that are 500 words long. You will have 100 chapters, that you will update every day for 100 days. A minimum of 10 reviews is guaranteed per every chapter, so by simple math, you'll get 1000 reviews MINIMUM. If you want to take this to the next level, then just do one of those fics where you do only one line per chapter. Because that is apparently the brand spanking new trend here, and even the most reviewed story on FFN has followed that trend of splitting off bigger chapters into smaller ones to get massive amounts of success. If YOU want that success, well you have the formula in your hands now. And what is the payment, you ask? Well, it's FREE!

Except you know what? It's not. Pay me in cakes or I'll Obliviate you and your fic will forever be barren of reviews despite however much hard work you put into it.

****** Tens of thousands of people may use reviews to find fanfic, it's not less a bad way to find fanfics.

The number of reviews don't give you much insight on the quality of a fanfic. I've seen uninteresting fanfics with no coflict whatsoever, no idea that wasn't in the books or already used the exact same way in hundreds of other fics getting a fair amount of good reviews. And you don't even look if those reviews are good, you're just looking at the number.

** This is why I always sort by favorites on ffn. Number of reviews is just not a reliable metric. With faves, one reader gives their input once per story and its a binary good/bad. With reviews, one reader can comment every chapter and number of chapters can vary wildly, and reviews aren't necessarily an indicator of a fic being good as their content can consist of anything.

They have 2,400 and 34,000 reviews respectively, and the first one could have been written /entirely/ as a oneshot and the second one is almost forcibly cut into chunks so that it'll last for a large number of chapters.

**** Hi. :). Rebuilding was written and published daily, without missing a single day, for 9 months. It was very much written to be read episodically by the people who enjoyed the experience of getting a short addition to the story every day. There's an author's note on the first chapter explaining the structure, and I still get messages from people almost weekly telling me they miss the daily updates. The structure certainly doesn't appeal to everyone but one of the beautiful things about fanfiction is there is something for everyone.

***** Depending on what you write, 1200 might be quite appropriate a word count. In books you /generally/ get 3k--6k per chapter, but there are always exceptions and there are novellas that only have a few pages per chapter (which might very well be 1,2k--1,5k words per chapter). Also, “a bit higher than a thousand” word count per chapter is well-accepted in NaNoWriMo.

So really, look at your chapters and think about it. If you think that bundling them together into longer chapters is in some way justified when sure, go for it; if you don't or if they are simply too thematically different to work as parts of a single chapter, though, then don't bother.
