** I would love to check your grammar for you! It's one of the few things I'm decent at.

You're on your own with snektongue, though.

Just, you know, don't expect me to give a ten paragraph indepth review, please.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.
