I've read too many harry potter fan fics that don't really have magic in them. It's just hinted too or assumed. I want fics where magic is used and discussed. I don't want to read "Harry and Tom fought and it was epic." No I want to read about the actual magic used. I don't care about the characters or the time frame. Fighting and action are always welcome. No slash please.

Would prefer longer stories that are complete. Please nothing that has been abandoned.


** One of my favorites that made me consider magic in a different way than I'd ever seen before is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6364608/1/Slippery-Seduction][Silppery Seduction]] by Fireroc9 on fanfiction. It's a Hermione/Draco story that's rated M for plenty of sex so be forewarned about that, but a big part of the story is how Hermione uses arithmantic calculations to try and predict the possible outcomes of the war.

We never learn too much about arithmancy in the books, but Fireroc9 creates a really fascinating visual side to the calculations, where Hermione's equations form a 3D image with different colors for different people, dynamic and changing with each new development. It's really brilliant and unlike anything I've read elsewhere. As a math person myself, it made me think and consider how things like graphs and 3D renderings of equations and formulae for us muggles, even complicated ones, could be so much...more, with magic thrown into the mix.

Another facet of the story is Snape trying to figure out what's going on with Hermione and/or Draco, which includes a really interesting and insightful analysis of Slytherin behavior amongst other things, and is humorous and really well done.

A really interesting new take on arithmancy, Earth magic, wandless magic, muggleborn vs. pureblood magic, joint magic, it's all in there. There's a scene early on where they're working together in Potions that's really quite beautiful.

It's not complete, but is not abandoned--chapter 34 was added just last month. Maybe it will fit the bill for you!

*** Since you like the arithmancy try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer]]. It's not complete but it actively being written.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]], which is pretty popular around here, has a lot of focus on magic that you might find interesting.

** I've made a [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L42j8DtQjwikqv0ggbwA-W25Ccl77V1E2nO96fThTyI&authuser=0][*review list here*]] - just about every fic there goes into magic, in depth. I plan to write a review for every fic I've read on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5409855/xvectorhttps://www.fanfiction.net/u/5409855/xvector][*my favorites list*]].

Check out the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][*Dark Lord Potter forums*]] for other great fics with a lot of magic.

** The Arithmancer is brilliant about this.

** I like how [[http://hpmor.com/chapter/1][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] dissects magic. If whole chapters of figuring out the foundational principles of magic appeals to you, I'd recommend this one.

*** The downvotes are probably because there is a rather large portion of the community that dislike Less Wrong.
