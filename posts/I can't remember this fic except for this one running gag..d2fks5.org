Lucius would constantly use a paternity test-like spell on Draco to confirm that, yes, that failure really was his son.

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.

** Ooh! Ooh! I know this one!

I believe you're thinking of Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion, by Driftwood1965.

linkffn(5483280)

Harry learns that if he is too sick or injured to serve as champion, then he can pick a substitute. So Hermione injures him and he picks Ron, thus allowing Ron to shoot for wealth and glory.

If I remember correctly, Draco keeps getting caught in Ron's problems, which causes Lucius to question whether the boy could possibly be related to him.

And everyone lives happily every after.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
