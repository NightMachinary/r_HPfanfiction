In Deathly Hallows, when Harry is hit with the killing curse and wakes up in King's Cross, Dumbledore explains that Harry didn't die because Voldemort took his blood during the resurrection in Goblet of Fire.

  "But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse," Harry started again, "and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?"

  "I think you know," said Dumbledore. "Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.

  Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

  "He took my blood," said Harry.

  "Precisely!" said Dumbledore. "He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!"

Does this mean that from the end of GoF to the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry couldn't die so long as Voldemort was still alive? Does this only work once or is Harry immune to death for three years? And if so, are there any fics where Voldemort kills Harry in the graveyard, only for him to come back?


** Depends upon what is the true cause of his return. If the blood in voldemort really did cause his return, than assuming voldemort body is destroyed and harry's blood no longer runs through his veins, than it would be a one time thing.

However, we know that Dumbledore doesn't have qualms with telling people what he thinks they need to hear over the truth. If the return to life actually is a side effect of the deathly hollows being united, than he would be unable to die as on as he held the title of Master of Death.

I personally like to think Harry never truly died, and just went into shock when being hit by the killing curse and the whole scene in the train station is just a hallucination. A.K. from voldemort killed the soul piece in harry (or just failed for the same reason it failed when he was 1 if you don't like the accidental horcrux) and bobs your uncle. Which would mean he never did die

** A one-time thing, and even that was only because the elder wand refused to work against its master if it could help it. Had it been any other wand that Tom used, it would have killed Harry and destroyed Tom's horcrux that was Harry both, but the elder wand just about managed to concentrate on the horcrux, destroy it, and “only” bring Harry to the brink of death; from there, he could return because of what Tom did during the graveyard incident.
