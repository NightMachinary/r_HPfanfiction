I'm currently working on a fic but I would like a beta reader to help me through the process, any idea's where the best place to fine one would be?


** Would you post or PM a link to some of what you have so far? I'm already betaing one fic, but if it's interesting I might take on another.

** fanfiction.net has a beta reader community. I've been thinking about joining it and becoming one, actually. What is your fic about?

*** It's quite a big sprawling fic, heavily influenced by ASOIAF, set in 1890 loads of fueding families plus their children at Hogwarts. Mostly OC's with some canon characters as well.

**** I've never read ASOIAF... Is the focus more on the characters/interactions there, or is there an overarching plot?

***** Both really, I try to keep to the idea of the HP world even if I can't be 100% accurate.

*** How do you ask for a beta on ff.net? I can figure out how to become one, but if you have a story, how do you ask for one?

**** Hey, me neither. But I've found that a preliminary set of eyes can catch a lot of the easy stuff. I'll pm you the link for my fic later today. I have a dropbox set up. Do you have something similar?
