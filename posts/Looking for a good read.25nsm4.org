I finished reading The Life and Times a couple of weeks ago and since then I wasn't able to find something at least nearly as good as Jewels' work. I'm dying for a good read and I hopefully I'll recieve more than few recommendations. As far as my interests go, I prefer Marauder's Era/First Wizarding War, but I'll be satisfied as long as it is a high quality piece.

Thanks in advance!


** BajaB's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]] is an obligatory rec. 13k words, complete.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

*** It's a great one-shot, I've already read it. "The loss of Lily finally pushing the trio over the line between light and dark they had walked since birth." Awesome work.

** You probably know it, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3954448/1/Questions-and-Answers][Questions and Answers]] is a pretty good piece of work. 94 chapters so far, with really interesting characterization and a very possible view of the Post-War Era.

Hope you'll love it!

** My story is not Marauder's Era, or First Wizarding War, but readers and reviewers have said it was high quality. If you like Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione and Time Travel this might be one for you. It is very long if that is something you want. It also has quite a bit of Sirius and Remus in it (not slash). Harry Potter and the Bonds of Time Saga So far it is one complete story (91 chapters), one WIP almost complete story (91 chapters, probably will be 100-105 or so. And I'm going to do at least one more in the series.

*** I'm not very fond of the idea of them returning to their eleven-years-old bodies, otherwise I'd be delighted with your work since post-Hogwarts is one of my favourites also and as you said, your writing truly is high quality.

** Every Other Midnight by Kathryn's NomDePlume.

It's not finished, but the author IS working on it (ever so slowly), is active on social media, and it's 900k+.

Slightly AU in the age of the characters, and some OC here and there
