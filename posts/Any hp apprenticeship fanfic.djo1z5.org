I'm searching for hp fanfics in which Harry is Snape's apprentice. I've already read "Harry Potter and The Masters", "Apprentice" and "Snape's Apprentice".


** There's [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/][Apprentice Potter]], and its sequels [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Journeyman_Potter/index/][Journeyman Potter]] and [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Master_Potter/index/][Master Potter]]. Fair warning, though, the third is abandoned. In fact, it's exactly one week away from being ten years since its last update.

**** It's been years since I've read them, so take this with a grain of salt, but I remember the first one having an ending definitive enough that I was genuinely didn't see any point to it having a sequel, so if I'm remembering right, it can definitely be read as a stand alone. That said, I think the sequels are worth reading, and while the third one doesn't come anywhere close to ending conclusively, it at least doesn't cut off on an cliffhanger. *side eyes Rent a Hero*

*Edit, 'cause I don't think I phrased this very well:

The sequels absolutely have a point and meaningfully continue this Harry's story, and they do it without needlessly tacking on some new, unrelated conflict. It's just that the first fic in the series ends in such a way that it's not immediately clear how a sequel could do that, and it's kinda impossible to explain how it works without just straight up spoiling it.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

***** Indeed it does, and the exposition of the missing scenes is done in a fun way. Still, it is jarring to reach the fifth year with everything proceeding largely as usual. I felt the same when rereading the Arithmancer series.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  AU Harry is abused by the Dursleys. he hopes to be able to save himself somewhat through the use of potions since underage magic isn't allowed, so starting 4th year he will try much harder to get good at potions. Will Snape help or sabotage him? Set after PoA - Snape as mentor - no slash - Abusive Dursleys - No Triwizard tournament and Horcruxes are not a thing. COMPLETE
