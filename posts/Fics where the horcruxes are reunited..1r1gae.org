I saw and enjoyed the Best of LV post, but was looking for more specific stories where Tom's horcruxes are reunited into one complete soul. I know I've read one or two, but it must have been a long time ago as I can't remember. Thanks!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2772010/]["The Power" by Darth Bill]] I'd say /sort/ of counts, though the method leaves that up for debate.

[[http://www.thepowerspoiler.com][Hover your cursor here for the spoiler of how the hocruxes are reunited, eventually into a single soul]]

Fairly good fic too, though the ...I suppose satire of it? comes off a little strong at times and the epilogue was vastly disappointing, especially the last sentence before "The End." Still I'd say it's well worth the read overall.

*** I'm a bit wary given I tend not to like Harry/Multi, but I will check it out with an open mind. Thanks for the rec!

**** Actually, there really wasn't that much dating/romance (and absolutely no slash) in it at all. I think the author just put it up as a cautionary and forgot about removing it when it didn't pan out that way. Nothing major involving harry in a relationship but that fabled last sentence of the epilogue, summing up his future and tossing in marrying someone for apparently no reason (Since him and the person barely spoke to each other during the whole fic)

***** That certainly is good to know. I confess that I did go and look at the final line (and I normally /never/ skip ahead) because I was so intrigued. I agree that it is a bit, I guess... immature? Unnecessary? Clearly the author /hated/ the epilogue and wanted to "fix it," which is fine. I like Harry/Ginny and I liked the epilogue, but I can certainly understand why many do not and I've read plenty of fanfics by authors who want different endings. I just don't think the anger that I believe motivated this author is really necessary.

But anyway, I have a bit of a guilty fondness for powerful!Harry so I will definitely give this one a shot, especially since as you said romance is not a big factor.
