** I already posted this in another thread, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/][Equal and Opposite]] pairs Harry up with his female self from another dimension.

** If you think Voldemort/Harry is odd, then Death of Today by epic solemnity. (On Fnet) it's also a very violet and dark story, but it's one of my all-time favorites.

Also, if Cedric/Hermione is odd, then Finding Himself by minisinoo (on Fnet). It's not dark or violent, but it is really really good AU where Cedric is crippled rather than killed in the maze. And where he (believably) falls in love with Hermione.

** Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother-In-Law's Love]] has Harry and Molly Weasley in a soul bond. The same author wrote a HP/Highlander crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7165521/1/Don-t-Disrespect-the-Queen][Don't Disrespect the Queen]] which has Harry paired with [[/s][Spoiler]]

** If you consider Harry/Bellatrix to be odd, then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] might be the fic for you.

Be warned, there is a lull around chapter 30 where things slow the fuck down for 5 chapters or so.
