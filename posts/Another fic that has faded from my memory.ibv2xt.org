:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok so the only thing I remember about this one is that Harry is immortal and he has been sent back in time to like the very beginning and is found by a tribe of cavemen and the rest of it is his journey through time all that way to the present, and if I remember correctly he sired A LOT of kids. So if anyone can find it that would be awesome.


** I believe this is Voldemort's last spell.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?
