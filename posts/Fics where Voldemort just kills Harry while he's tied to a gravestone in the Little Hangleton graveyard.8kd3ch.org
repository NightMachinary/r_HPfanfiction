Presumably any such fics would generally be a one-shot parody, though. Unless it's one of those dramatic ones with Harry having a twin brother or something like that.


** It would be neat to see this. Then have the rest of the story from a different character's POV. Could be Neville gearing up to kill Voldemort, or have the prophecy be fake just because Trelawney wanted a job... There are lots of possibilities.

** "Avada Keda..." Voldemort stops before he can finish casting the death spell and looks at Harry intently.

"That spell didn't work out so well last time and I'd rather not have to wait another fifteen years for a new body."

"A /Sectumsempra/ to the neck should work just as well/"/ As soon as he finishes Harry's head falls face first to the ground while his body is kept held by the rope to the grave post.

*** But Harry could not really die since Voldemort used his blood in the resurrection ritual. The result would be Harry's turn to spend some time as a wraith.

As opposed to Voldemort, who didn't trust any Death Eater, Harry would immediately seek out Dumbledore and report what happened. It might take some time, but they would eventually get Harry a new body and train him in earnest, now that Scarcrux was gone.

**** Nice plot.

I still get confused by it though so please help me understand.

Voldemort (V) shoots Avada Kedavra (AK) at one year old Harry, who has just received Lily's protection. This forms a shield which causes the AK to rebound on V. The rebounding AK splinters a portion of V's soul, which attaches to Harry thus making Harry an accidental Horcrux.

At this point, I presume that the reason the Horcrux doesn't take over Harry is because of Lily's protection.

Years pass by, V and Harry meet again. But Quirrel/V can't touch Harry because the protection remains. In fact, Harry uses this as a weapon to keep himself safe from Quirrel/V. I presume that it is also the protection that keeps V from recognizing that Harry is an accidental Horcrux.

V flees and for the next few years comes up with a ritual that will enable him to share Harry's blood. The ritual is carried out in Harry's 4th year. This enables V to touch Harry without experiencing burns. At this point, I think V underestimated Lily's protection. He thought that he had overcome it simply because he could touch Harry. But the protection was more complex than that. For one, V still didn't recognize that Harry was a Horcrux. He couldn't possess Harry completely without feeling immense pain as shown in the Order of the Phoenix (battle in the ministry). And finally when he fired another AK at Harry in Deathly Hallows, Lily's protection acted up and recognized that a part of Harry was still tethering him to life on Earth. This was the blood in V's veins.

That last part was what has been really wonky to me. I thought that Harry lived because V killed the Horcrux in Harry. But in trying to understand how Lily's protection worked, I presume it was that protection that enabled Harry to get transported to the dream dimension and make a choice. Otherwise, if it was simply V killing the Horcrux, then he and Harry should not have both temporarily died. I'm imagining that they would have both remained standing but Harry's scar would disappear. Now with Lily's protection:

V shoots an AK at Harry which does kill Harry. However because of both Harry's blood that flows in V's veins and the Horcrux, V gets killed, too. Harry gets to choose whether to ride the train or go back to life in the dream dimension. He chooses to go back to life. The Horcrux is left behind. Both Harry and V live again because of Harry's blood. At this point, I wonder what if Harry chose to ride the train? I imagine V wouldn't be able to get up. The body he formed in the Triwizard Tournament would have died. However he still has Nagini as a Horcrux. So he would probably have turned into a wraith again that could easily be destroyed once his last tether to life, Nagini, is destroyed.

After having written all this, two things have popped into my mind: 1) If all of the above were true, then the Deathly Hallows were unnecessary additions to the story. 2) Lily inadvertently turned Harry's blood into a Horcrux-like thing.

  “But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and nobody died for me this time --- how can I be alive?”

  “I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”

  Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”

  “I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?”

--------------

Regarding this matter, I think the original DH has answered well enough. Lily's sacrifice and Voldemort's maliciousness had indeed turned Voldemort into the functional equivalent of Harry's Horcrux. "Neither can live while other survives" had really a double edged meaning, which was that if either survived the fight against the other, they would lose the ability to live (forever).

Yes, the Deathly Hallows were mostly unnecessary, but Voldemort's quest for the Elderwand distracted him from what happened in Britain, and most importantly Hogwarts. If he had been paying attention, Neville, Ginny, the DA, and Snape would have never gotten away with what they had done. Finally, the Elderwand ownership shenanigan provided an easy plot device to kill off Voldemort.

I'm thinking, maybe it would wake up the hero in Ron.

***** His job /was/ to protect Harry. Dumbledore made him swear to this because it was the easiest way to secure his loyalty. Snape's primary aim shifted to beating Voldemort in the years after, even if that meant not protecting Harry.

Snape continued to follow Dumbledore's orders even after he accused him of raising Harry like a pig for slaughter. He spent his final year trying to protect the students of Hogwarts, and he claimed to save every life he plausibly could. Snape's morality and purpose might once have been beholden to keeping Lily's son alive, but that is no longer the case during the time of the second war.
