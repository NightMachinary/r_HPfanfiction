** I don't have a fic recommendation because SS/LP isn't a particular pairing that I search out, but I just have to comment.

It seems really out of character that Lily never forgave Severus, to me. I'm not suggesting they would have made an OTP or that Severus is somehow a better man than James - those are patently false. But they had an interesting friendship, even if the feelings weren't quite requited.

I'm not even saying that Snape necessarily /deserved/ forgiveness. Just that it seems out of character that Lily, taking his circumstance into account, couldn't find it within herself to forgive him. And not to taint the relationship between Lily and James, but the fact that she, the following year, started going out with the guy who she had up to that point literally despised and who bullied her best friend for 6 years seems... almost like spite. I'm not saying that those were her motivations at all, just that it was an interesting piece of storytelling by JKR that I'm wondering if there was more to.

As for James being a bully (shit, did my rant really end up here?), a lot of the counterarguments are:

1. Snape is obviously a biased source regarding the severity of the bullying.
2. Remus Lupin says that Snape gave as good as he got.

Now while those two statements themselves are true, I can't help but notice the hypocrisy between those two arguments being used. I'm confused as to why Remus Lupin seems so much more "unbiased" while defending a long-lost friend to his son who's having an identity crisis than Snape.

Regardless, we know for sure that James and Sirius went so far as to hoist Severus upside down and show his undergarments in public. I've heard a lot of bullying horror stories but there aren't /many/ things that could top that kind of embarrassment without drooping pig's blood on him during prom. The treatment that Snape went through was easily more than schoolyard bullying and bordering on illegality, depending on how modern Wizarding Laws are.

And it's during THIS, this most embarrassing humiliation that Snape has likely ever gone through, that he's saved by a "mudblood" in front of his extremely racist "friends", THIS is when he snaps and calls her, presumably for the first time, a calls her the dreaded racial slur.

(I'm going to completely ignore the fact that Snape was literally almost murdered by Sirius, because that doesn't technically have anything to do with James and, although James was the one who saved him, it seems fair to me that Snape would group them all in together, given how close they were)

Now, again, I cannot iterate enough that I'm not arguing that Snape /deserved/ an apology or that Lily should have given him one. I'm not arguing that this is the only time Snape ever did anything worthy of concern. I'm just saying, again, that it seems out of /Lily's/ character to have not accepted it. After years, despite his /obvious/ remorse and immediate attempts to apologize, she never forgave him. It's just... weird. For her. To me.

Then again, he did become a Death Eater, so what the fuck do I know.

*** This doesn't make sense. As we learn later, it's not just the fact that he called her a Mudblood. He believed all that crap about Muggle-borns, he just tried to carve out an exception for her because the were childhood friends and he was in love with her. Snape wasn't a good person, he thought people like Lily were inferior and ought to be subjugated at a minimum and only had a problem with Voldemort murdering a child because it turned out to be Lily's child.

**** Beyond that, even, Lily is portrayed as this perfect teenage girl who always follow the rules, but at the point where Snape calls her a Mudblood, she would've been 15/16. Now, I don't know about you guys, but I wasn't the kind of person I was then as I am now. So, it is entirely possible that Lily simply /did/ start dating James out of spite, like a rebellious phase or something.

Of course, adding on the facts that you just put down, it isn't all that unlikely that Lily had no interest in continuing her friendship with Snape, what with his beliefs.

***** I'm not even entirely sure Lily is presented as perfect. It's more like we don't see her presented much. Outside of Snape's Worst Memory, we just get fond remembrances. Maybe Lily could have been stuck up (unlikely I suppose, especially if you take Lupin's movie lines). We know she would give Slughorn cheeky responses when he told her she ought to have been in Slytherin. Who knows.

*** Lily didn't drop Snape because he called her a mudblood - it was just symbolic of everything wrong with him. The dialogue makes it crystal clear that Lily had been on the verge of dropping him anyway because he wanted to be a death eater.

You'll also note, that despite the fact Lily straight up told Snape that she was dropping him because he was a death eater wannabe, he did not change his behaviour. He went straight ahead and kept on becoming a death eater.

Lily dropping Snape had nothing to do with failing to forgive him. As she said, she just accepted that they had chosen different paths. She didn't want to be friends with a death eater anymore, and Snape never made any indication that he would give up being a death eater for her. He was desperate for her to forgive him, but he wasn't that desperate.

If he hadn't called her a mudblood, their friendship would have inevitably collapsed anyway. Lily would not have put up with his political opinions, and Snape was not going to give them up for her.

Remus makes a comment in the Half Blood Prince about how everyone was using that spell on everyone else while he was at school. The bullying was certainly bad, but I don't think it is as catastrophic as you are making it out to be. I think the difference in popularity and the spectacle of it were the worst part - not the actual methods used.

  Snape was literally almost murdered by Sirius
#+end_quote

Snape chose to sneak out at night, to go to a place where he suspected there was a werewolf. Sirius didn't 'almost murder Snape'. All Sirius did was give Snape some information that he had been trying to steal anyway.

The worst interpretation of Sirius's actions was that he gave Snape the means to almost kill himself.

*** I see your point but technically we don't know anything about Lily's character outside of Snape's very biased "she was perfect" mindset and her friends in the order (Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus) who could be romanticizing someone who was overall a good person and died too young. So I wouldn't say Lily not forgiving Snape was necessarily out of character. HOWEVER, she may have forgiven him in her heart years later, and had no way or desire to contact an alleged death eater to tell him so. Or maybe she didn't have the chance to mature and forgive him. It's possible Remus trying to make peace with Snape in canon was because he got the chance to grow up and wise up, whereas Sirius had his maturity stunted by Azkaban and Lily died before she could.

Anyway, sorry for the rambling. I enjoy both Snape/Lily and James/Lily because they give more depth to Lily's character than pretty, talented, nice witch who loved her son and died young which is basically all we get from canon.

Okay this kind of interpretation of the "Mudblood" interaction is weird to me. To me it's always been clear that this was more like a final straw or maybe just something that Lily found to be revealing about his true character. Of course Snape was agitated and blew his top, doing something that he otherwise wouldn't have done (because presumably he was trying to hide his racist nature and favorable attitude towards Voldemort from Lily).

Since I see Lily in a positive light and as a good person I assume she would have made lots of excuses for her best friend over the years, when there were rumors that he is "dark" and "evil". Can you imagine the betrayal she must have felt when she not only witnesses Snape using a racial epitaph under which Muggleborns are murdered, but uses it against her?

It's perplexing to me when people frame this situation as some kind of "political correctness" issue where the guy just made an innocent mistake and didn't really mean it.

You must have been extremely sheltered. I've witnessed *much* more humiliating things in my school time (for example they forced a girl to run across the school yard in her underwear). What James did there strikes me as very typical school yard bullying. Equivalent to pulling down trousers, which is like, almost banal.

*** You bring up some good points. Lily's actions in this regard do say a lot about her. I think there is more than meets the eye when it comes to their friendship.

With what we know about his childhood, Snape's personal experiences may have led him to dislike Muggles and feel that they are inferior. In SWM, he is in a very humiliating situation and took out his frustration about the situation by calling Lily a Mudblood. Another thing to note is that the slur may be commonly used amongst Slytherins with whom he hung out every day. While Snape calling Lily a Mudblood is reprehensible, there are other factors behind this action other than pure racism.

*** Now I really want a deep analysis of her character. I honestly don't believe that Rowling has a solid personality for her like most of her present characters, she has a vague outline but she isn't as fleshed out as Harry or Hermione. For example, she shows her as forgiving in the first few memories but later refuses to hear what Snape has to say for himself. Of course, a lot of character development would have happened between her being only nine and her being sixteen, so it's not solid enough.

Lily is there to be the symbolism of perfection and she was constantly shown throughout the books to be that way. Even Petunia, who hates her, builds up on her perfection by demonstrating how jealous she is. She and James are even literally raised on a pedestal as we see in Godric's Hollow, which is very tragic, considering just how young they were we they died. However, she's human so she's obviously not perfect but a lot of people base her flaws upon Snape's memories of her as a kid so I don't think that's fair to Lily as a character since she was only eight or nine at the time. We just have so little about her that basically any overall 'good' representation of her is valid that doesn't contradict her few canon qualities. However, the obvious explanation is that Harry met people who hate James but didn't meet people who hate Lily.

Worse yet, people take her perfect imagine in canon, forgetting that she's dead and exaggerate her good qualities and not adding anything else on them, resulting in her being perfect in most interpretations as well. I'm pretty sure had we not seen Snape's Worst Memory and how savage James was, he would have been written the same as Lily and the 'perfect' guy just like she's the 'perfect' girl. That's being unfair to both of them because ridding a character of any flaw is just as bad as bashing them, in my opinion.

"Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)
