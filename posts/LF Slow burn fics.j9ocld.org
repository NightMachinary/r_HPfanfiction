I'm looking for fics similar to "Isolation" by Bexchan and/or "To begin with" by RZZMG.

I don't like Over powered characters.

Any pairing or no pairing works.

I prefer story with a good plot, where they focus on the Wizarding life under Voldemort's rule and how they overcome it. However I will read just any fic until its not Over powered Harry.

Bonus point for Draco as main character and a complete fic but not necessary.

Thanks!!

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** I finished a long one last month. Readers loved it.

Its a post war dramione but its under the heros winning. Gets a tiny bit dark sometimes but not dramatically. Really it is just about relationship building.

  They need each other unfortunately. Hermione has tricked Draco under her tutelage, arrogant attitude and all. But she would be simple to think he would accept it quietly. They have both have secrets to hide, old wounds better left to fester, and a world full of mermaids, dragons, and magic to explore.
