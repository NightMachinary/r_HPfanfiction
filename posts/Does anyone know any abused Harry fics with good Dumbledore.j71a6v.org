I'm getting a little tired of “evil” Dumbledore who drugs Harry and pays the Dursleys to abuse him or whatever.


** This is a female Slytherin Harry story (updates once a week) with abused Harry and a good Dumbledore (though he only has a minor role).

** I love Albus in this, I want more Albus like this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4015026/1/My-Dark-Protector]]

Note: The abuse Harry faces is more extreme, and it's not caused by the Dursley's... though indirectly it is.

** Linkffn(the mind arts) It's basically abandoned and it definitely fades off near the end in terms of quality, but it does this particular thing very well. Linkffn Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) kind of. Dumbledore seems to have good intentions, even though he seems a bit of a dick to Harry at times. But he definitely hasn't paid off the Dursleys or any such nonsense. He just didn't really realize how bad they actually were. When he finds out, his reaction is sort of like “Oh shit, change plans immediately!”

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
