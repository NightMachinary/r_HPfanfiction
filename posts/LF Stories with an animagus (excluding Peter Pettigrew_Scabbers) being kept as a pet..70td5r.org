I know [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6741846/1/Wolfsbane][Wolfsbane]] has Sirius hiding as Harry's pet during the events of Prisoner of Azkaban, and I remember a one-shot that involved Gabrielle Delacour turning into a bird and getting herself shipped to the Dursleys...

Anything else that comes to mind? Excluding Peter Pettigrew, obviously, since that covers canon, and therefore the million fics or so that rehash canon in some way.


** "Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents"

"Growing up Kneazle" (though the Kneazles would disagree with being called pets)

*** Well, if Trevor were Umbridge, she would have had to have found a stand-in of some sort during 5th year when she was at Hogwarts as her normal self. And she would have had to juggle spying on the Gryffindors (why else would she be there) and doing her job as Undersecretary.

***** Also known as the device every bad guy and good guy should use but don't, the tool Manipulative!Dumbledore should be using to mess with Dark!Harry, the tool magicals should be using in muggle-vs-wizard wars or exterminations, the thing Aurors should be using to discreetly witness crime scenes, the means by which Ludo Bagman cheats on his Quidditch bets, and overall right up there with Felix Felicis in the list of things that you never see in fanfiction but should.
