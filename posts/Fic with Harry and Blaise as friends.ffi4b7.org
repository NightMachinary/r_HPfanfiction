:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think it starts with Harry and Blaise Zabini in a train compartment playing some sort of memory game involving potions ingredients (think they list each ingredient within a specific category or something). I'm pretty sure, they became friends and Blaise is trying to help Harry make Snape like him as an end goal. I think they're trying to get Snape to like him so that he can get Harry away from the Dursleys or something. Think Hermione bursts in and there's an argument over him leaving to be with a Slytherin(?)

I think it's like fifth/sixth year, but I could be wrong about this.

It's almost definitely completed, but I can't remember for the life of me whether it's on FFN or AO3.

I'd really appreciate any help... Thank you :)

  HP&OP. The professors no longer can scare Harry with talk of lost points, detentions or Quidditch suspensions. He's been beaten down for far too long, and he finally has reached his limit. Severus mentors, maybe guardian. Abuse, non-con, AU, evil!Ron
