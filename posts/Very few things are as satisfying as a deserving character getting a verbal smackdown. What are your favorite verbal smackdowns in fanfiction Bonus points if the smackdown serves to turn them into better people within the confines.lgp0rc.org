** From the Harry Potter fanfic "Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal And Other Morals," written by [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]], is the best "Reason You Suck Speech" for Severus Snape ever. It's a Self-Insert fic, so YMMV:

#+begin_quote
  "And now to the last question of the day. Why do you possess such venom for Severus Snape?" Dumbledore demanded.

  "Because his redemptive arch was the most hackneyed, cliche ridden, idiotic mess I have ever read in my entire life." I declared. "No, don't interrupt me yet. I am perfectly willing to admit I have a huge grudge against the man. The first is this: he abuses his position and power to torment and bully children who are given into his care to nurture. I don't know if it's because he's the worst teacher on earth, or because he's just a bitter asshole who gets off on it, or because he suffers some misguided delusion that it's his obligation because the supposed act makes him a better spy. Personally, I think it's all three. Whatever the cause he is a disgrace to teachers everywhere and tat alone earns him a place on my permanent naughty list.

  "Next," I continued, ticking off the points on my finger, "what he thinks is love is nothing more than a one sided unhealthy obsession that plays into the love redeems trope and is 100% pure unleaded bullcrap. He never loved Lily Evans. He loved the idea of Lily Evans, especially the idea of HAVING Lily Evans. Of possessing her. Of using her for his own self gratification. If I ever, even once, treat my own wife like Snape treated Lily, I hope she slaps me upside the head until she knocks some sense into me.

  "And who could forget that he is perhaps the most vindictive asshole around. The man was bullied as a kid. Hey, I get it. I got knocked around a bit and teased for being fat and farting due to lactose intolerance. Life sucks, then you grow up. But Snape never freaking grew up! He stayed the same juvenile punk his entire life, never willing to admit that maybe, just maybe, he should forgive the actions of people who were punk kids at the time. That is also, by the way, a bone I have to pick with Mr. Black. It's amazing how similar the two idiots are. But we're talking about Snape, and the man was happy enough to have someone's freaking SOUL sucked out just to repay an old grudge."

  "I see," Dumbledore said once my rant wound down. "Are there any future grievances you like to air against Severus?"

  "He's ugly, smells funny, and needs to learn what good hygiene is," I snapped. "That last bit might be petty, but come on man! You're supposed to be an example to these kids! Show them what good grooming looks like!"

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** linkffn(The Sermon) by Rambaud is oh so good ! It's Snape taking the time to explain to Harry why flying a car from kings cross to Hogwarts was definitely not his best option in his very acerbic way, and by God it's a good read ! I do hope I'll be half as effective as him (although maybe not such a bastard) when reprimending children, because it looks like it's effective and Harry might have learnt something and improve later on.

Quick excerpt to give you an idea of the tone:

"I don't care why you weren't on the train! No one cares why you weren't on the train. When the Headmaster and your Head of House finish up with their welcoming feast and join us, they won't ask you 'why weren't you on the train?', they'll ask you 'what went through your pathetic excuse for a mind when you decided to fly that car?', because although there are thousands of perfectly logical scenarios that would lead you to not be on a train on time, there is absolutely none in which flying to Hogwarts in an enchanted car is a good idea. There isn't even a single scenario in which flying a car to Hogwarts is even a mediocre idea... "

*** It's a pretty good smackdown. Flying the car to Hogwarts was a profoundly dumb idea.

I suppose that Harry might actually have more justification for distrusting authority figures than just McGonagall in his first year, considering Snape himself took points away for breathing too loud(This Snape is a lot more reasonable than canon Snape), and his whole life with the Dursleys before Hogwarts. I mean even if he wasn't physically abused outside his cousin's gang beating him whenever they caught him, he pretty much spent a decade living in a cupboard. I wonder how many authority figures in his life caught on that something was wrong, and how many failed to help him for him to still be there all the way until he got his first Hogwarts letter.

***** To be honest, I get why Snape was so mad. The reason is his exact quote lol Harry and Ron are impulsive and they needed to get a smackdown in this situation. The only smackdown I think would be great to read is Harry finally snapping at him, because Snape is always calling him spoiled and spoiled. I think Harry should be like:

"I lived in a cupboard for 11 years because the second room belonged to my cousin's toys! My aunt and uncle never buy me any clothes, or anything for that matter - the only clothes I wear are oversized because they are old and were Dudley's and those bitches didn't even feed me properly! I'm so arrogant I even use my own money just to buy essential things instead of showing off with all sorts of unnecessary fancy stuff! It's really spoiled of me to be happy whenever I'm back at Hogwarts because my cousin likes beating me for fun and my uncle indulges it!"

Oh and this just reminded me of something else. I wanted Harry to smackdown Petunia so much when she said she lost a sister in Godric's Hollow.

"Yes, I can tell you miss her, since you treat the only link you have let with her like dog shit. I can tell you're sad about her death, since you pretty much call me and treat me like a burden. It makes sense that you wish she was alive."

  Severus knew it was only a matter of time before Potter did another stupendously idiotic thing, but he didn't think it would be so soon in the year... Fortunately, this time, Albus isn't there to reward the little brat for his rashness and arrogance, and his means that Severus can actually do his job for once.

Also "C'est La Vie" by cywscross where Hadrian basically reads the entire great hall the riot act about thinking BWL-Neville would insert his name into the Goblet of Fire for the sake of money and fame.

Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool by The Mad Mad Reviewer: Andromeda's Howler to Sirius Black!

And a completely different one, of which I sadly don't remember the title just now, where someone (I think a time- or dimension traveling Harry) sees Walburga's painting ranting as usual, and mildly interjects how unseemly her display is, and that he knew the good old days where women of her standing showed their displeasure by slipping something in someone's tea..

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.
