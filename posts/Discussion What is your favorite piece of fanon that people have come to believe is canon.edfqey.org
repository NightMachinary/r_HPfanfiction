*** Yeah that makes no sense. Snape's a weird half-blood & Lucius is Lucius.

If I was going to write a godfather for Draco, I would probably choose Mr. Greengrass (Daphne & Astoria's father) or Rodolphus Lestrange. The first because it would set up Astoria x Draco pretty well and the second because I've never actually seen him get time in a fic, especially after Bellatrix x Voldemort became canon, and it makes sense for a brother-in-law to be a godfather.

And no one ever mentions Draco having a god/mother/. Just because Lily was a loner and James had no female friends doesn't mean the Malfoys were the same way.

He is shown sort of taking Snape under his wing while they both attend Hogwarts and Lucius is a prefect, as revealed via Snape's memories in the Pensieve in DH. But I agree that they wouldn't necessarily be friends.

If anything, it would be closer to a Mafia-style relationship where Lucius would consider himself Snape's mentor and benefactor and would expect favors (e.g., good grades for Draco) in return.

I mean, it's not a lot to go on. Basically just Malfoy being happy when Snape was sorted into his house, which everyone does. And that's in his sixth year, so they probably didn't spend much time together.

I agree with how you characterise their relationship, but that would come after the First War. And I doubt it would be enough to name Snape as godfather, even if the timing was right.

*** But, we never know how long it takes to become an auror (via the books, not via wikipedia or something). I'm gonna try to finesse some math without doing much research here.

Lupin was 12/13 years older than Tonks. We just barely missed seeing Tonks while Harry was in first year, so she is 7 years older. That means in PS she is 18. Let's say she immediately does auror training after Hogwarts (like the military or college). Tonks and Lupin meet in OOTP when she is roughly 22 and already an auror. That means the process is 4 years or less. If Alice and Frank are the same age as the maruaders and have Neville at the same time, they would have been 21 when they died meaning that the auror program is either 3 years long (or less), or that you are correct and they are older (a year or more older).

** Ancient Runes is the study of magical runes used for wards and enchanting. Arithmancy is the study of the magical properties of numbers and the foundations of magical theory.

Both are far better than a useless foreign language class that's really just a foreign, dead, alphabet class and a math class that vaguely has something to do with predicting the future with numbers.

Also, I reject the fact of Arithmancy having anything to do with numeric divination as later stated by Rowling to be canon. If it had anything to do with divination then Hermione's rants about actual Divination would have certainly included references as to how Arithmancy is a far superior method of divining the future rather than calling all of divination a wash.

***** That's kind of a bs argument given that you also made a value judgement between the original and newer meaning, but seemingly without knowing the historical context. Accepting that language changes doesn't mean I can't like some language shifts and dislike others. "-mancy" as it pertains to these terms is derived from the Greek "manteia" meaning "divination." I don't mind if someone uses a newer, fanon version of Arithmancy. (I could easily see the field of og arithmancy expand over centuries into the fanon arithmancy. That'd be a really cool bit of worldbuilding, of the kind fanfiction writers don't use very often.) I took exception to your "reject[ion]" because the evidence you used to support that view was false and because I like the original version of arithmancy and I wanted to make a case for more people using it more.

Yes, that's the quote. Remember, Arithmancy as numerological divination is canon, as you noted yourself. Thus, in that quote, Hermione is directly comparing the merits of two divination classes, Vector's Arithmancy and and Trelawney's Divination.

Every book that uses runes I check how the rules for them apply. Then try and break the universe as hard as possible. Usually it's not hard at all. Just finished writing a fic where I played with their godlike power without Harry realizing how OP they are.

**** Yeah, I was trying to write a Rune Prodigy!Harry fic and I had to try to work around the sheer opness of it. I went with changing the activation process of runes. Instead of wands like in the usual fanon, you have to like, load them up first, which can take a while, and then they activate as a reaction to a pre-determined action.

Now, I think this makes them more balanced because it's much more convoluted, which can explain why almost no one will be using them. But it also can be convoluted in a writing sense, so I'm not sure if I should discard the story tbh. But I think it might be neat to have like a mad genius Harry planting what are pretty much magical bombs everywhere.

The only way I could see to make runes magic and not easily broken it to make them harder to use, less effective and only have a limited charge to them compared to spells. We know spells can be made permanent somehow from enchantment.

For me it came down to either they are so convoluted and restricted they served no purpose or they could be used as game breakers. So I just have cut them entirely.

**** Completely agree on Arithmancy, especially calling it JKs headcanon. She has stated that she was intentionally vague about it in the books and that she didn't know what it was at all. The idea that it might be a form of divination came later, probably at the promoting of someone that knows the historical meaning of the word. As such, within the realm of Harry Potter the historical meaning doesnt have any relevance to me, both because it was clearly written without it, and because it isnt as interesting or internally cohesive.

With Runes I think the well established fanon still has strength. Yes Hermione cast defensive wards around the campsites, but the part of fanon that really works with regards to wards is their use as "anchors" something that makes those spells stronger, sturdier and more lasting. Also, Ancient Runes in this fanon totally works as an elective in my opinion. Runes as the basis for enchanting would be like a magical shop class, teaching kids to make things. I would imagine that warding would be a seventh year or mastery level application of the subject. Building walls instead of cutting boards.

****** No need to say that all enchanting and warding require runes. I personally like them for a couple of reasons, one being permanence. Not mentioned in Canon as being a thing, and in a couple of places actually disproved, but as fanon I like to believe that most charms and, depending on the fic, spells in general, are temporary. Anchoring a spell to enchant a toy in a rune sewn on the back gives it permanence. Similarly, going back to the shops class idea, just because you can make a container to hold something out of wood (runes) doesnt mean you can't also make a bowl to do the same thing out of clay (transfiguration or something) different ways to do the same thing. I like to imagine that Runic magic is heavily centered on the relationship of things and symbolism. A protego charm is a charm that makes a shield, but a runic array that shields a home is based on the individual meanings of each rune, their meaning together, and what or if they spell, given that they are a system of writing after all. All shaped and powered by the intent of the witch or wizard.

The other reason is to avoid Anglo/Eurocentric views of magic. Ollivander and family have been making wands since like 300 ad or something, and the name could be seen as Greek. (I fanon an Olive wood wand for Ollivander). Assuming the wand and incantation method of magic to be a Greco-Roman invention would explain its adoption throughout Europe and America. It would make sense for other cultures to have their own methods of magic that may have been lost during Roman conquest. As such, Runic magic could have been the magic system used by Germanic tribes prior to the Roman conquest. After the conquest it becomes deemphasized in magic studies in Roman conquered areas, though maintaining relevance in Scandinavian areas that didn't fall to Rome and adopt the wand.

I know others have said that Hermione casts basic wards in Deathly Hallows. I say yes *temporary* wards. I would love the foundation of more permanent enchantments and wards to be runes.

It's also important for fanfics because it keeps fics set in that era much more compact by reducing the number of 'OC lite' characters that have to be introduced in terms of the families of the Blacks and Potters during the Marauders era. It not only gives you an excuse for James and Sirius to know each other before Hogwarts, but gives a Black family relative to Sirius other than his parents without adding another OC

They only give the watches when they come of age because of tradition. You know magicals, they have to keep up with tradition. Like riding an archaic steam train to hogwarts UNSUPERVISED all the time. Instead of using the faster magical transportation options available. It's probably cheaper too.

***** People use "Tempus" for time travel? I've never heard of that. Even so, I'm definitely anti-both of those.

I'm a fan of neither Cursed Child's super Time Turner nor the typical fanon send-adult-mind-back-to-the-past potion, but I'd take both of those in a heartbeat over a "Tempus" time travel spell that is presumably a base form new-timeline-creating time travel method to contrast with canon's self-consistent regular Time Turners. This level of power and precision to time travel like this shouldn't be given to a mere spell. It should be given to either a potion, which canonically allow wixes to achieve effects commensurate to much higher level spells, or a specialized device.

My main gripe with "Tempus" as a time-telling spell is that it deals with arbitrary, manmade units. No canon spell does this. Even protections spells are cast on objects or locations, not arbitrary and predetermined areas.

Xylomancy is divining with stick, aka dowsing, this is canon. Medical diagnostic charm is an information spell, hence divination.

Divination to me is not some mystical inner eye stuff mostly. I would say the majority of it is analysis spells and similar.

Picture a Quant company getting hold of magic and learning about spellcrafting. The resulting spells would likely be similar to extremely refined market analysis programs.

Toss in the fact that the potters have been around since the 1200's? Gringotts opened in the 1474. I find it hard to believe that the Potter vault is 687.

It's an interesting story usage when they are /trying/ to be like their relatives in my opinion. And then dealing with the depressing reality of not quite matching up/they are in fact different people with their own differing personalities. In one of my personal favourite next-gen stories Rose has spent her whole life trying to match up to Hermione and not quite making it (lower scores), and dealing with her forging her own path.
