I would specifically like fics that focus on Harry being the first DADA professor after the curse is lifted, but feel free to recommend him in other positions too.

Any pairing is fine, but I'm a sucker for Neville and/or polyamory

Bashing/salt is okay, but warn me first


** In this one he teaches Divination and has a pretty interesting take on the subject, though sadly the story seems abandoned:

** Linkffn(Laughing All the Way to London), Harry post DH is sent to another universe along with baby Teddy Lupin. Ends up in a Marauder era world (i.e when they were in Hogwarts) and becomes the DADA professor. It's actually a pretty well written fic and has quite a good plot.

  Harry is a single father trying to raise his godson, Teddy. Unable to ensure his son's safety in the wizarding world he goes into hiding in the muggle one. But one trip to London will undo all of his precautions. Thrown back to the past, Harry finds himself falling into the arms of a woman who once spared his life. No paradox, Light/Badass Harry.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

linkffn(Wind Shear), the classic.

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool), first few chapters are a bit disturbing, contains traces of wbwl, bad!Dumbledore (but not for long), and also fem!Harry, and Transfiguration not DADA, but I remember enjoying it so you may too?
