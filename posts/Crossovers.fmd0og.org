Once read a crossover with SPN where Hermione was Dean/Sam's godmother and had a part in raising them, at least until John found out she was a witch... soooooo, I'm looking for crossover stories where Hermione raises someone,, or is a mother figure to them. Either SPN, Avengers, GoT, Spiderman etc. You know, the usual suspects.

Also just looking for good crossovers with Harry or Hermione as the MCs that's come out lately (as in the last year). 40k wording please

Thank you! :)


** Sadly fails at your "recent" criteria, but was my intro into the crossover world. More of a comedy/parody.

  During the final battle Harry is hit with a luck spell... but who exactly got lucky? Harry finds himself in the future fighting a new war when all he wants to do is have a nice and easy life. So he decides to have fun instead.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22460467]]) is a Hermione centric crossover but she doesn't raises anyone as far as I remember. I think the fic is not bad but not particularly good.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21812065]]) is a refreshing ASOIAF crossover with good writing and potential but word count is currently 38K
