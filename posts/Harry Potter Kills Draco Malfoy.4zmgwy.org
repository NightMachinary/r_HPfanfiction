I'm looking for stories set in 6th year, where Draco dies from the Sectumsempra spell.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][This]] story isn't quite what you're looking for, but it does have a rather wonderful way of killing Draco. It's set in 7th year and is rather AU though.

I didn't use FFNbot so as to avoid spoilers for other people.
