I remember them working together at the ministry of magic, sharing an office. I remember they had only a sexual relationship and Snape wanting more but he knew that she would dump him. I remember they were together for a few years and she tried to break up with him because she wanted a baby and he gave her the baby she wanted. Harry came In Their office one day and said that things would be easier for their kid when it get to school if they were married. By the end I remember they put their last one on the train and he finally told her that he loves her and babe said it when they were having sex on the couch.
