Just thought I'd let you all know that fictionhunt has renewed the registration on their domain name and so the site is up and running again.


** Hmm, down voted questioning comment instead of answering, this is the only post ever made by this user, was given reddit gold out of the blue, Ah Self promotion on throwaway account.

And yes, Im bored and actually want an answer, having too much trouble finding a good story on fanfiction that I haven't read or am interested in.

*** First of all, I did not down vote your comment, I don't know who did but it wasn't me. Second of all, I honestly have no idea how I got Reddit gold since this is literally my only account and the only post I have ever made. I don't even really know what Reddit gold is. I created the account to make this post because I knew that I was interested in the status of fictionhunt so I figured that others might be as well. No self promotion on a throwaway account here. Honestly this was probably going to be the only post I made because I don't really care for Reddit all that much in the long run which is also why I didn't answer because I didn't care to get into a fight about the site.

But since you want an answer to your question, yes fictionhunt is essentially the copy pirate site that doesn't post original content. I realize it's existence is controversial and I don't really agree with the creator's policy of not asking the authors for permission to post their work, but I've also discovered that's it pretty much the only place that still has online copies of any HP reading the books fanfiction which is a fad I didn't get into until well after all the stories started getting deleted by fanfiction site mods or whatever. So yes, I realize that what the creator does is a bit of a dick move, but at the same time I can't fault him for it completely because it let me read stories I otherwise would not have found. Hopefully that answers your question and explains why I like the site without making it seem like I don't care about the authors themselves.

** ? Wasn't fiction hunt a copy pirate site that only stole from other story sites and didn't have any of its own author submitted content?

*** It's an archive site that preserves content on FFN in case it goes down. It complies with takedown requests from authors that don't want their content there.
