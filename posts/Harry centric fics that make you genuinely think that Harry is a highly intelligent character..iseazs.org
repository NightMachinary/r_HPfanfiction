Probably my favorite.. trope, I guess, is a more capable Harry. Specifically, having him actually be the Dark Lord's equal - a genius of Voldemort/Dumbledore's caliber who would eventually grow to match them or even reasonably but not excessively surpass them.

Thing is, it's really hard to write a super intelligent character. Some fics will dumb everyone else down, which doesn't work. I find most fics that do this sort of thing just portray Harry's intelligence by making him really good at magic and having him get good grades. Which, yeah, those are things that I like to see in such fics, but to me that alone doesn't make the character feel like a genius.

Any recommendations?


** Despite the downvotes I agree with [[/u/aldonius][u/aldonius]] that you should check out HPMOR. At worst you'll hate it. It won't melt your brain or anything like that. Its Harry is very annoying but definitely convincingly smart, and he gets somewhat less annoying (most of the time) after the first 1/4 or so of the book.

** The obvious recommendation here is Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. People tend to either love it or hate it, fair warning.

(As an aside, it would probably be helpful if you can list some fics you've already read and found wanting...)

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
