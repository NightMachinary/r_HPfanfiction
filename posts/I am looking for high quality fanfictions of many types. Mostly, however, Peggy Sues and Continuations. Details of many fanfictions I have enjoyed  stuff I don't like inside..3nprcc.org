Straight up, I'm going to list many of the fanfictions/authors I've enjoyed.

Backwards With Purpose: Always and Always is simply the best. Fanfic. Ever. It's bloody amazing and it's such a shame that the last book of the series is incomplete.

HP Nightmares Of Future Past is also damn good, but similarly incomplete.

Oh God Not Again was pretty great, big entertainment value.

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time! Pretty good story, a little too much Dresden Files topping for me to really love it.

On to stuff that's not Peggy Sues.

Continuations: The ones I liked most are Hogwarts House Divided and basically everything by little0bird(The First Day; Questions and Answers, other smaller fics). Really looking for cool stuff here.

Other: HPMOR, of course. I liked it a lot, it's not the top fanfic IMO but I can easily see why some consider it to be. I'll Fight For You, a Lily fic, was cool, though I felt the writing style tended to drag a lot.

Okay, now you have some general idea of what kind of stuff I like.

As for stuff I don't like...no bashing of characters pointlessly. I mean, nothing like characters just turning into bitches for /absolutely/ no reason, it's OK if it's justified like what some consider to be Weasley-bashing in BWP.

No slash, please. I've got nothing against it; it's merely...not something I personally like, that's it.

Shippings are weird. Normally, I'd say mostly canon ships, but like I also like a couple ones with non-canon...I guess I'll leave it as stay fairly close to canon ships and avoid Harmione because, meh.

So now that I've written an essay...[[/r/hpfanfiction]], what do you got for me? I'm itchin' for reading the 10% worth taking a Killing Curse for.

**** Very big on FF: Harry crow. It has some good elements in it with the goblin world they built but honestly? It's such a major crap fest. It's more than sappy and cheesy. I feel dumber for having read as far as I have ( much farther than I should've) The harmony stuff was just so ugh. There was no real conflict. Good things happened to good people and bad things constantly happened to the bad ones.

** The /Alexandra Quick/ series is one of the best works of fanfiction ever conceived and written, if not /the/ best. It starts off with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], which itself is very well-written, and then it steps it up several notches with books 2, 3, and 4. Book 5 is currently in the works, though experiencing some delays. You may recognise the author as the same one who did Hogwarts Houses Divided (Inverarity).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is a rockin' good read - enormously fun, hilarious and clever and erudite and thought-provoking at turns. Highly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] is one that DLP doesn't like, but when have they /ever/ liked angsty stuff? This fic is a gorgeously intense and evocative piece of Bellamione - give it a go!!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118152/1/The-Scientist][The Scientist]] is ongoing, and while it is a bit clunky at times, it's great if you like some good femslash. It's a slow-burning Hermione/Narcissa.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906518/1/Ron-El-Greco][Ron El Greco]] explores the "mature" side of Ron/Hermione, and involves Ron being a diplomatic Auror in a rogue Middle Eastern city-state. It was recced below by another lovely personage.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] is written by our very own [[/u/wordhammer]], and it's one I'm currently reading, but so far, it's been an interesting read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] is the last one I'll rec. It's basically "What if Ginny were sorted into Slytherin?" and continues from there. It's *good* - nearly professional-grade.
