Hello all, I'm looking for fics that encompass the entire 7 years at Hogwarts, but are less than 100k words in length. They must be completed, with no slash please. Thanks in advance.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6807742/1/][Just the Three of Them]], linkffn(6807742): Cute canon rewrite with romantic Trio. One shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620): Only 25k words for all 7 years, but very good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Most popular fic on this sub and my top favorite, goes through all 7 years plus a little more in 104k words.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU
