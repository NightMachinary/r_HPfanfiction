What is one way of destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes without destroying the container? For instance, the diadem. Removing the soul whilst keeping it intact.

I'm writing a fanfiction in which the Hogwarts founder's artifacts would wanna be restored and stored at Hogwarts.


** I believe the commonly accepted fanon method is hitting it with the Killing Curse. Item has a soul, so hit it with the soul killer spell and boom. Item doesn't have a soul anymore.

*** Unfortunately this doesn't work for several reasons (for a canon-compliant universe which I think may be what the OP wants).

The killing curse, not a soul killer, does not remove someone's soul. One, it does not replicate the effect of the dementor's kiss. Two, Fawkes dies because of the curse. He survives because pheonixes can be reborn from death. Fawkes retains his soul afterwards. Three, the concept of death differs greatly from a "soul killer".

Indeed, horcruxes are notable because of the last reason:

  *‘But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,' said Ron, ‘why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?' ‘Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.'* Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, *‘Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all.'* ‘Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,' said Ron. Harry laughed. ‘It should be, actually! *But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,' said Hermione. ‘But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it.'* ‘That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,' said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort's soul as it vanished. ‘And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but, obviously, it came back good as new.
#+end_quote

It's the destruction of the vessel that destroys a horcrux. The creation of a horcrux demands the destruction of the vessel and soul to prevent its functionality. The killing curse may kill someone, but it leaves their soul intact.

** Rituals.

Grab a few items/ingredients, throw in some symbolism, and you have a ritual.

Vulture eyes, raven's claw, animal skull, elder branch, and two knuts.

Vultures and Ravens are often referenced with death. Skulls are symbols of death. The knuts are for the ferryman. The branch? representation of Death from the deathly hallows.

Something something "The Vulture has found a coward" place the eyes on the horcrux, the eyes rotate to "look" at the horcrux. something something "raven brings forth the agent's tool". Place the claw on the branch (it melts into it). "All are equal when Death comes knocking". Knock on the horcrux with the branch, ghost claws comes out and grabs the soul piece in the horcrux. "death always wins" tap the stick onto the animal skull. The claws insert the soul shard into the skull. Place the coins on the eyes and stomp on the skull. The skull and coins disappear. ( I low-effort pulled this out of my arse in like two minutes.)

​

The scarcrux is the easiest of all. It's more of a leech than anything, as Voldemort didn't add any of the protections or rituals to it to cement the horcrux status. It could be removed relatively effortlessly.

** Canon-wise? no method is elaborated, the Horcrux is a curse that lodges permanently a piece of a perverted soul into the afflicted item/being, therefore utter destruction is the only way. Thus, I believe you should develope further your own take into how Magic works in your universe, I for instance believe that China and Africa have a completely diferent way of casting magic, therefore using a complex ritual there might be a way to sever the link those soulshards have to their containers.

** If one is following canon, there isn't a known way.

However. It makes sense that if one can put something INTO an object, one can take it out.

It's just not something that Rowling wanted to think about. I'd personally think if anyone knew about such things, the Egyptians or Sumerians would, as they have myths about such things, and magic is based on myths.

As others said, some sort of ritual spell should be doable. Probably dangerous for HARRY as he's got two souls in him, though.

** There's probably no way to do this while remaining canon compliant:

  ‘Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as Basilisk venom, and they're all dangerous to carry around with you. That's a problem we're going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing or crushing a Horcrux won't do the trick. You've got to put it beyond magical repair.'

  But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,' said Hermione. ‘But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it.'

#+end_quote

The curses and enchantments on the horcrux safeguard it from destruction. The container has to be destroyed for this to work.

One theory that's prevalent is that horcruxes can be destroyed with a killing curse. Ultimately, the reasoning behind suffers from the fact that Harry is not a horcrux and has not been protected through magic and neglects to explain contradictory information as provided above.

#+begin_quote
  So, because Voldemort never went through the grotesque process that I imagined creates a Horcrux, with Harry, it was just that he had destabilized his soul so much that it split when he was hit by the back-firing curse. And so this part of it flies off and attaches to the only living thing in the room. A part of it flees in the very close-to-death limbo state that Voldemort then goes on and exists in. *I suppose it's very close to being a Horcrux. But Harry was not-- did not become an evil object. He wasn't-- he didn't have curses upon him that the other Horcruxes had. He himself was not contaminated by carrying this bit of parasitic soul.*
#+end_quote

The only way for the vessels to remain intact is for the creator to wish it:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Isn't there any way of putting yourself back together?' Ron asked. ‘Yes,' said Hermione, with a hollow smile, ‘but it would be excruciatingly painful.' ‘Why? How do you do it?' asked Harry. ‘Remorse,' said Hermione. ‘You've got to really feel what you've done. There's a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can't see Voldemort attempting it, somehow, can you?'
#+end_quote

Of course, this is very unlikely in a world with a canon Voldemort personality/character. Thus, my advice is to change something about the rules to make it possible. It's fanfiction!

** Well according to what's given in canon, the only way to destroy a Horcrux is to damage its container beyond means of magical repair. And even in the Avada Kedavra's case, there's no magic of bringing back the dead and a dead body will rot and eventually turn to dust in time. Now it's up to you to explore whether Avada Kedavra would work on inanimate objects the same way it works on living beings without the rotting in time.

Edit: actually in OOTP during the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, it's mentioned the killing curse would explode or set inanimate objects on fire. But you could go with the whole concept of severing the soul from the body without physical damage in the case of Horcruxes.

*** I've detailed elsewhere why severing a soul via the killing curse would not work in the case of a horcrux, which, by nature, differs from a body in terms of concept and functionality.

The idea of the killing curse destroying a horcrux by destroying the object is an interesting one. However, I think this idea contradicts canon as well.

#+begin_quote
  But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort. The [killing curse] merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry.

  The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backward, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both.

  Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor,
#+end_quote

From this, we see that Dumbledore protected the statues with enchantments. The potent power of the killing curse means that it is capable of overcoming the enchantments occasionally.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Yes,' said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, ‘because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.'

  the receptacle is prepared by dark magic to become the receptacle of a fragmented piece of soul and that that piece of soul deliberately detached from the Master Soul to act as a future safeguard or anchor to life and to safeguard against death.
#+end_quote

It's pretty clear that enchantments on a horcrux are on another level compared to other objects. The killing curse is already not enough to consistently destroy objects protected by quick enchantments (nor does it even consistently damage objects). Along with the fact that it's never mentioned as a plausible method for destroying inanimate objects and horcruxes, I don't think that this would work.

In short, I think this method fails because the enchantments would protect against the physical harm caused by a killing curse and we know the conceptual harm (of death) doesn't work on horcruxes.

** Canonically there's no known way.

In fics I've seen dripping some vampire blood onto the item, destroys the soul and the item is intact.

One had the idea that if a horcrux is a perversion dark magic to gain immortality, maybe a Light magic could counter it - a philosopher's stone. Maybe soak the horcrux in elixir of life, or somehow sacrifice the stone to remove the horcrux.

Chuck the horcrux into the Love Room at the Department of Mysteries. THe horcrux wont survive pure love!

Tossing an Avada Kedava at the horcrux is always popular (it worked with Harry).

And the old standby, call the goblins. They'll either remove the horcrux or transfer it to something you don't mind destroying. For a fee of course.
