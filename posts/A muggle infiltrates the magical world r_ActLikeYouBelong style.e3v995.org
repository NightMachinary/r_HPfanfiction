After a botched obliviation coverup (someone skipped the seminar on how to wipe electronic records), a muggle finds out about magic and visits the magical world. Nobody notices that he's not supposed to be there.


** That's pretty similar to linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12901407/chapters/29473305][12901407]]) where a muggle has enough odd tendencies that when she moves to Ottery St Catchpole, there's a few misunderstandings and everyone just assumes she's a witch.

** There are couple of these (aside from the one mentioned above, which is awesome, but unfortunately unfinished):

- linkffn(3743602) ... actually I have it downloaded, but I cannot remember I have read it. Weird, so no comments on that.
- linkffn(2053712) ... a pretty decent story with the finale which is kind of obvious and kind of surprising

  When a Muggle girl penetrates wizarding security at the Quidditch World Cup and meets the one Weasley she ought to be avoiding if she wants to escape detection, a memory charm should be in order. But not all things go according to protocol... Please R&R!

  It is absolutely impossible for a muggle to find her way into Diagon Alley, visit Hogsmeade, see Hogwarts and play a pivital role in the magic world without having any magical abilities. This fanfic proves it all wrong. COMPLETED.

** Closest I have is this. Very well known, but it has the kind of shenanigans you would expect from this kind of stories. Wizard from a DnD campaign is summoned to Potterverse and starts attending Hogwarts. Very good story.

** The closest one I can think of is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418][In The Bleak Midwinter]] by TheLoud. Hermione Granger travels back in time to give baby Voldemort to Tom Riddle Sr. so he can take care of him. She informs him of the wizarding world and he decides to use that knowledge to advance himself by pretending to be from an ancient pureblood family, much to Hermione's chagrin. It's fun!
