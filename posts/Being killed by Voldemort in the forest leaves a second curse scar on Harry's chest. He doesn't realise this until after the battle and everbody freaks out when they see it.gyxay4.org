  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on. Join the various members of the extended Weasley family as they struggle to rebuild and cope with the consequences. And of course there are still Death Eaters left to find.

** Better yet, Harry gets a new Horcrux stuck right in his heart, but Voldemort goes to afterlife, which means the test if him is mended over thousands of Universe Lengths, and then sent straight back into a decade after his death. By that time, the Horcrux#2 has merged with Harry's very Soul, unable to ever be retrieved.

Harry has to fight a now half-sane, powerful Voldemort alongside the darkness of his Soul.

Epic journey of angst, hatred and slow, painful acceptance that he will /never/ be rid of Tom Riddle's Soul, however small the piece, coming to acceptance of the fact that he cannot die, and Tom Riddle's journey of learning how to love and how to /live,/ the redemption arc we all wanted in the depths of our Soul but never dared to put into words.

** Mentioned in almost all post-War stories:

- certainly Harry in linkao3(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) had one, not sure which one previous Northumbrian stories mention it.
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]] mentions it as well
