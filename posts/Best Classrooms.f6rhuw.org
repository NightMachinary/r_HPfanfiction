So, I'm reading Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein at the moment and found myself really enjoying the classroom scenes. For those of you who don't know, Starship Troopers is a (really, really) militaristic sci-fi story of a guy called Johnny Rico moving up through the military during an interstellar war between the military-ruled Humans and insectoid aliens. Stargate meets Gears of War, basically. It's interesting, but it's pretty generic at this point as the tropes have been done to death. It's a pretty old book, so it sort of did for Military Sci-fi what Tolkien did for Fantasy - and is the thing most attributed to have caused the surfeit of militarism in sci-fi generally.

Anyway, what really interests me about the book is that, between segments of the plot, there are these classroom scenes where the characters debate moral philosophy around the events that happen and generally 'stan' (Am I using that right?) for Heinlein's ridiculously militaristic moral viewpoints. It's a really interesting conceit and a way of tying the book together. And it got me curious.

First, are there any fics that do a similar thing, having classroom scenes between the setpieces of the plot? Not necessarily moral stuff, magical concepts work too, but just any classroom discussions relevant to the plot.

EDIT - to clarify, I'm looking for the classroom stuff over the moral philosophy stuff, but any topic being talked about in a classroom is okay. Like that one where Voldemort and Quirrel are sensible and actually talk the class into semi-agreeing that Muggles are dangerous with firearms and stealing magical items and such.

Second, what are the best classroom scenes you've seen written in fanfiction? It can be from a teacher perspective or a student perspective or both, or even from Hermione peering through the window to ask about homework like Annie Edison did for Chang's class in Community.

As always, any pairings, slash or femslash or het or gen (which I've recently learnt is a term for no/low relationshippy stuff), any weird stuff, all tropes and cliches welcome.


** I know some that are at least noteworthy:

- linkffn(Victoria Potter): there are a lot of good things about this fic, but as per your request there is a lot of nuance and subtext that comes in the classrooms, both for understanding the "mechanics" of HP magic and the wider wizarding world/culture/history. Highly recommend.
- linkffn(Forging the Sword): focuses heavily on Harry, Ron and Hermione's interactions both in and out of the class, and what that can tell you about the world.
- linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): there is a /lot/ in this fic I realize, but many of the class scenes (such as the pagan religion classes) are fairly memorable in the ramifications and world-building. Mostly its about Harry, Snape and Voldemort's interactions overall, each of whom are personally standouts in the fandom.
- linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff): mostly its Harry trying to find the minimal effort he can make to do anything, while everyone else tries to theorize/rationalize the how and why he wants to do what he does. Has some hilarious innovations at points.
- linkffn(The Changeling): arguably one of the best "if-X-character-was-in-Slytherin" fics, most of the story focuses on the subtext and character interaction that often occurs between Ginny and others, both in and out-of the classroom. There is an especially relevant section in Year 6 (or Deathly Hallows in this storyline), where Ginny is learning from Snape.

There are more, but its somewhat dependent upon what you think personally about each individual scene rather than as a whole. I think you may have trouble finding good moral philosophizing like in ST as the Hogwarts students are pre-teens and teenagers rather than young adults regularly interacting with the outside world. You might try something like On the Way to Greatness though if you want some discussions about that.

*** I really need to stop writing so much in these things. Apparently I'm just not good at getting my points across well - it's not about the moral philosophy. The whole thing about Starship Troopers was just what motivated the request. All I was looking for was good classroom scenes where people learn stuff that's relevant to the world or plot. For Starship Troopers, that was moral philosophy, like you said for Victoria Potter, that's mechanics and the wizarding worldbuilding. Not like canon, where he just learns spells that he uses later (mystery solving format), but like fleshing out and exploring details about the world and plot.

** They're not necessarily in classrooms, but there are quite a few such philosophical debates between characters in Methods of Rationality. Some readers like them, others consider them deadweight. Personally, I find them thought-provoking.

Chapter 87 has quite a good one, where Harry and Hermione disagree about whether Draco Malfoy is inherently and irredeemably evil, or whether that is more properly attributed to his upbringing. And there's an ongoing disagreement between Harry and Professor Dumbledore about taking a hard line vs picking your battles and compromising.

MoR definitely does do philosophy... not spectacularly well, but pretty well for HP fanfiction. I haven't read the whole thing because it's a lot to read when it stars a character I utterly abhor, but I'll take another look and poke around for some of the philosophy stuff too.

*** I really, really hope that the point of this fic will be to show how absolutely atrocious the ministry decree is. Besides being a complete invalidation of what is generally considered human rights (literal thought crime? What exact definition of "Sympathetic" is it using) it's also a complete atrocity against the rule of law (Innocent until proven guilty, you don't have to prove you're innocent in court, the opposition has to prove you're guilty).

Gonna keep reading for now, but I will so disappointed if the moral lesson at the end isn't : This law is a complete atrocity against humanity.

Eh, I liked all those shows except Blacklist. I'm not sure I worded my thoughts correctly. Its less that "oh, evil protagonist, I hate it" for me, its that the story presents their actions as a moral good. Breaking Bad never pretended Walt making meth and murdering people was right. Game of Thrones had the Lannisters as objectively villainous as possible, yet still be the focus of the show in certain ways. They never pretended they were righteous. Either the characters in the show (Hank Schrader) or the meta narrative itself pretty much objectively spelled out "This is immoral". I found none of that in this fic. To me it reads like the author noticed no moral qualms about this law. To me all the good characters talking it up as a good thing threw me off. The dissonance was what made me dislike it.

It's about narrative meta-honesty. Villains having some angelic tendencies is fine and a villain pretending to be an ally is fine, but claiming their villainy is angelic is a bit too much. Like claiming The Party in Orwell were the good guys doing good things.
