** Yes! But the problem is you are going to have to take away Harry's knowledge if his parents if you want to go the full Naruto route. And what would replace Hokage? I mean that is if you are going to go down the full Naruto route. I mean it would be a good crossover. Hogwarts is a school and if your perform badly you gets kicked out, sorting Hat sorts you into teams.

Again this is if someone went down the Naruto route which is a rare occurrence in the fandom that is not a crossover, but that I mean take Naruto's points and translate them into Harry Potter, usually it's nothing like that.

This has a potential to be a great fix, an AU that I would say if written decently would rival cannon die to the endless story points, you could go anywhere.

And I'm curious who would be the first to turn away from our "Team 7"? I mean Ron? Their could be a Uchiha clan massacre but with the Wesley's. The Atsuki is obviously the Death Eaters, but Madara, Obito and others? I guess that's Shipudden but still.

I know you asked for a recommendation, but the chances of a fic like this is very slim. And if there is chances are its unfinished or unreadable. Not my grammar but by it probably being in another language.

I feel like if this was written it would be either more of a comedy or more of a indy powerwank Harry with a harem with 900 titles that defeats Voldmort by using the 9 magic tailed beast which was the key inside him all along.

Again I would live to see a fic like this but sadly not many fics start straight from first year and build up relationships. They try to change too much too quickly to get to their story divergence.

Sorry for the long essay, but I had too. Naruto is a passion of mine along with Harry Potter :p

I mean the typical wants to be the best shonen style you see.

***** Fate By TheTrueSpartan has elements from what your requesting. Even a 9 tailed fox but very different, and the main character is Ron. And he wants to be the best for a slight difference than Naruto wanting to become the best depending on your views on him.

I dont actually know how to link as I'm on mobile bit a quick Google search comes up with it. Hope this helps!
