:END:
This is simply a request borne of curiosity. I have always wondered about Wizards having the ability to mess with the muggle world, or at the very least take advantage of aspects of it. From committing crime, to sleeping around, to building businesses, to economic/financial gain..... it feels like a smart wizard could take advantage of the muggle world quite easily, without altering the authorities.

From what I understand of cannon, while magic used around muggles who dont know of the magical world is illegal and apparently traceable... it would not be hard to use magic for gains without muggles seeing, or nearby. Or to utilize it to help complete work or projects in less time (think... you make $100 per page of work, but magic allows you to do it in 1/100th of the time as a muggle). It also doesn't cover potions or potion making. Example: love potioning a muggle

So the question is, what are peoples thoughts about using magic in the muggle world to take advantage of it in some way, and are there any Fics that explore this?

Well you are packing some interesting metaphysical assumptions into that statement. What does a Wizard experience when they encounter a stone or a rock? Sure, they can touch it and look at it, but does it really give them any deep meaningful understanding to conjure stone (some kind of deep knowledge about the essence of stone)? Do they even know which particular mineral or mix of minerals they are conjuring? Or is it just enough to think "stone" and you get some random thing that would qualify as a stone? They don't appear to be conjuring base elements but very abstract concepts.

Why then isn't it enough to think "anti-matter" (if you have a rough understanding what that is supposed to be... after reading a physics book your understanding of anti-matter is probably much better than the average wizard's understanding of 'stone') and get something that would reasonably qualify as anti-matter?

** I'm somewhat disappointed that people in this thread have thus far been so modest with their suggestions. Imagine, just for a second, a wizard's potential to affect politics!

I don't mean things like confounding the Prime Minister---which the Ministry might find out about (though I will point out that Kingsley guarding Blair in HBP was implied to be a wartime measure, and I do recall a fanon suggestion about Grindelwald having used a confundus on Chamberlain in 1938). No, think smaller and smarter! For instance, suppose you are running for parliamentary seat. No matter how you campaign (though I guess a few discreet compulsions cast whilst going door-to-door cannot but help), all you need to do on election night is disillusion yourself amongst the vote counters and carefully modify just enough ballots to give you a comfortable majority of several hundred. Then, get to work on your parliamentary influence...

With the help of the occasional potion, confundus, memory charm, or even temporary imperius, you will soon develop a reputation as a /very persuasive/ backbencher, capable of swaying almost any vote for your party. Of course, it would not do to imperius the entire house and get them to vote unanimously---that would give the game away somewhat---but it shouldn't be difficult to sway enough of them to get a realistic majority whenever required. This influence in turn allows you to climb the party ladder, enter cabinet, and potentially become PM within a decade or so. If a scandal comes up (though why would it---see, the beauty of the thing is that you won't /need/ to use bribery, blackmail, or anything like that, when magical methods of "persuasion" are more than sufficient), the relevant enemies can be obliviated or else killed and transfigured into dead rats, thus rendered undiscoverable by muggle police.

Now, many may argue there are probably wizards monitoring for such behaviour in canon, but that's not what I see in the books. I understand that the normal peacetime protocol is for the Minister for Magic to talk to the PM annually, if not even more seldom, and it is only after Voldemort's return that magical protection is given to the highest echelons of the muggle government. I cannot see why wizards would react to a takeover as the one I described, if it is carried out slowly and carefully enough!

Legally, I think breach of the Statute of Secrecy could be used as a pretty catch-all, flexible offence (not unlike public order offences in England and Wales) that allows the Ministry to prosecute any use of magic on or around Muggles they consider illegitimate. Such flexibility is legally useful as of course you can never predict neatly all the possible categories of behaviour that you want to punish.

We know, for example, that even covert assistance given to Muggles via magic can be prosecuted as breach of the Statute of Secrecy.

Do we? I don't recall any reference to the Statute being used for anything except, well, secrecy.

It's also worth nothing that the Statute is international law, with each ministry responsible for enforcing it in their own domain. The British MoM can prosecute whatever they want according to their own laws, but it technically wouldn't be under the Statute proper.

1. Probably nothing new or creative, wizards have interacted with muggles for millennia and I'm sure more than one muggleborn wizard has tried to use magic for their own gain.

2. Gonna face serious obstacles from the government. The Ministry is a bureaucratic mess precisely because of how many rules and regulations it has to enforce to keep society under control.

BUT, Arthur has a tendency to get personally involved in raids and confiscation of illegal goods, and when that happens people aren't above trying to hex him, see Mundungus Fletcher.

So at some point in the recent past, some wizard who wanted Arthur to forget that he had illegal muggle artifacts, tried to Obliviate Arthur; he fluffed it up a bit, resulting in Arthur having some memory trouble when it comes to muggles. Hence mucking up the word 'electricity' and wondering about the function of a rubber duck.

In addition Britain has had more general struggles than some other countries in cannon due to an extra dark lord in recent history and so perhaps there has been little in the way of training and exploration of subjects that are not something that would be obviously useful in wartime or too/against a dark lord.

So I take it as more an example of the general incompetence in Britain due to the various issues PLUS the fact that the wizarding world is behind the times.

**** Oh yeah what I meant was that wizards doing business with muggles is nothing new or unique. By the time the Statute of Secrecy was implemented Muggles had a globe-spanning economic system, which wizards were almost definitely involved in. So there were likely extensive efforts to regulate the use of magic in business dealings with muggles afterwards.

Like you say it's hard to enforce, but that's why the MoM has such a bloated bureaucracy - it has to constantly track and regulate magical interactions with muggles to prevent exposure. Mistakes do happen and stuff probably does get overlooked. But you've still got teams working daily to keep an eye on stuff, which makes it difficult to get away with illegal business dealings in the long run. In the real world it's easy to make money off crimes but a lot harder to make that money look legitimate. I'd imagine the DMLE would be VERY suspicious if a muggleborn wizard with no known employment suddenly started cashing checks at Gringotts.

Actually that might be a fun fic idea. Maybe a series of oneshots about the DMLE section in charge of investigating financial crimes.

  In the Magical criminal justice system, financial crimes involving muggles are considered especially complicated. In the British Ministry of Magic, the dedicated wizards who investigate these crimes are members of an overworked squad known as the Business & Finance Unit. These are their stories.

** I suppose there's a special division of the muggle government that handles these cases. The prime minister and muggleborn parents knows of magic after all.
