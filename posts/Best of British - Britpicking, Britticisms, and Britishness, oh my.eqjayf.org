I was reading a post today about how a person's enthusiasm for Harry Potter fics was causing them to start using more British English terminology rather than their native US English. It made me think that a thread on British Culture and Language could be interesting. Like the words Shall or Fortnight, or how tea is so popular that there's TV-Pickups during the breaks in certain television shows because so many people are putting on a cuppa. Or even the fact that the way we drink tea tends to link to our geographic region.

So, what are your best Britpicks, Britticisms, and examples of general Britishness to help the Colonials write proper fanfiction? If you know any good resources, feel free to link!

If you have any good fics that are particularly British, feel free to link those too. :)


** Something I keep seeing lately is characters going out to sit on the porch. British houses aren't built like American houses and wooden porches as you're imagining aren't very common here, and most houses are not raised. A porch in the UK usually refers to a very small, cold room just at the front door where shoes and wellies get dumped.

Something more British would be a patio - just a paved area usually in the back garden with perhaps a garden table and chairs and a bbq or something.

It's a small obscure one and I'm sure everyone else will chip in with the usual things of pancakes and mom and sidewalk and all that but porch is annoying me a lot at the moment for some reason.

****** Yes, I'm in a terrace as we speak! Traditional associated with low income, though not always - London and various seaside towns have sweeping Georgian terraces that are highly sought after. These may include a basement, and nowadays they are usually basement flats.

A more typical terraced house may no have a garden, or if they do, it will be a small, walled in yard perhaps with a narrow back alley running behind the row of houses. This style of housing was very common in mining or industrial areas and might have originally been built specifically for workers - if you lost your job you also lost your right to that home. Obviously not the same now!

The more rural you get, the more likely you are to have a detached house, with a garden. Semi-detached, where it is terraced only on one side, is common in the suburbs or in small towns and usually come with a garden.

****** Yeah. A lot of our houses were built during the Industrial Revolution by Factory Owners wanting to get as many people crammed into as little space as possible, so the terraced houses (also called 'Two Up, Two Downs' because they had two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs) were the cheapest way to go.

A general pattern on cellars (though this isn't absolute) is that some rural houses sometimes have a small cellar (called a coal cellar, and used for storing coal), but mid-range houses in bigger cities would be more likely to have a bigger cellar for servant-rooms and the like.

Also, a 'yard' here in the North of England is more of a dirt-filled area where you run horses or livestock. Not sure what it'd be down south, though.

***** Just to nail down the distinction: a back yard is small and paved, and usually found out back of a terraced house. (No idea what they call those in other countries, but basically a row of houses that all share party walls with the houses to either side. Range from tiny cheap houses built for mill-workers up to fairly opulent townhouses.) A back garden is larger and is, well, a garden.

***** Mmm a terrace is very similar to a patio and theres probably an overlap, but Brits would assume a terrace is somewhere warm and probably raised - like a roof terrace or overlooking part of the garden. A patio is literally just a paved over part of your garden, perhaps just a corner. Like this - [[https://images.app.goo.gl/qTGkxNt7Y9B9fWWr7]]

** One that came up for me the other day, was clothing terminology.

Oxfords are shoes not Shirts, if you want to refer to a dress shirt, it's just a shirt. I was reading a fix last week that referred to hogwarts students as wearing White Oxfords, which makes it sound like they're in the middle of the 1920s.

As a speaker of Scottish Gaelic, please for the love of god, don't say Plaid. Plaide means blanket. In Scotland and Britain the general term is Tartan. “Plaid Skirt” is not a term we use. At my old Independent (Private) School, the uniform was for Kilts.

Swearing is an art form here, especially in Scotland, Ireland and the North of England, the south also has some absolute belters. Don't shy away from creative swearing. I've already commented about the use of the word “Feck”, it's not a replacement for the word “Fuck”

Hogwarts, specifically, is supposed to pastiche the government funded education system, and its also a co-educational boarding school that lacks supervision. Don't be prudish and shy away from blue comedy or Lads Humour.

Alcohol Culture is different. Its legal to drink at home, at 14 and in a restaurant at 16, but illegal to but until the age of 18. We are no strangers to drink on this Island. Most parents will allow their children to taste alcohol at younger ages. In the books for example, Harry is freely given firewhisky at 17, and drinks butterbeer which is mildly alcoholic at 13.

Hogwarts is free, hearing about people struggling to pay fees is very odd, it's more of a Posh state school than an independent school. Don't refer to the term “Upperclassmen” or “Lowerclassmen” these terms don't exist, just refer to sets of year groups instead; First and second years, seventh years etc.

Wizarding Society is meant to imitate British Society, so no complaints about hospital bills either.

Other small things include the Mum/mom difference, and referring to “blocks” as a means of navigation. Cities in Britain predate the Victorian grid iron street pattern, and haven't been upgraded since. When giving directions say “down the street, second on the left” or something.

That a one shot Tumblr thing (drabble I think you call them) is where you get the gin cabinet or the Ginny&Tonic stuff, just exists as another chapter or scene alongside the Christmas party with Hazel no different to the other non-linear chapters.

As to the style thing I don't read enough slice of life stuff to really justify that call, but it does feel like you're specifically highlighting that the characters drink. Like it's something we're meant to notice. I'm not trying to say it's obnoxious or feels non-canonical or anything (eg I like that it's not just firewhisky... Rowling seems averse to mentioning alcohol in canon imho) just that it's very visible.

I guess what I mean is that just because it's realistic that doesn't mean it's not a stylistic choice too.

******* Yeah it is, but yeah I don't think the existence of a drinks cabinet is that much of a choice - virtually all middle class families have one anyway? It's just a piece of furniture. It doesn't mean it gets used nightly or anything.

It's definitely just a cultural thing - I write stories based on things around me and anecdotes I hear from other people, and the UK has a bigger drinking culture than other places. So what's perfectly unremarkable to me is clearly standing out to others. It just becomes really exasperating to me when people put their cultural norms onto me and react with shock - especially for things like Harry getting drunk as a young man or people getting drunk at a wedding or family members going for a quick pint together. All of that is perfectly standard in the UK, and I'm only reflecting that. I don't think Rowling is averse to mentioning it at all - we see characters like Hagrid get drunk frequently, Marge gets drunk in POA, the students are drinking light alcohol from 13, Winky has alcoholism etc.

In my headcanon he has a job as a magical astronomer but I haven't written much about it.

My wife was commended for going to work to sleep and opening up the shop absolutely plastered. She doesn't even remember the first few hours. Almost every other branch of the chain in the city failed to open on time.

I do think people TALK about getting drunk more openly at work in Scotland than when I lived in England though.

On the topic of schools, my head of year went to a board school and told us how they crept into the woods and drunk until one classmate with an eating disorder got alcohol poisoning at which point they were terrified to get help and ran away.

If it wasn't free then surely the Weasleys wouldn't have been able to afford to send seven children there, and Ron would've probably mentioned it.

As I've said earlier, Wizarding Britain Is meant to reflect Britain at the time it was written. In fact it makes the most sense for Hogwarts to be termed an Academy than anything else, meaning that it is state-funded, but relatively independent from outside control.

It's far more likely Hermione would see the inside of a church on a school trip to learn about religion than every sunday.

Also, the purity culture thing. Strange body hang ups that come with the psychological abuse of religious purity culture. Really strange to see it in a fic, it's actually incredibly jarring to suddenly have a female character worrying about her virginity and if she should be kissing someone. It's honestly very American and not British at all.

Your entire grade/marks came from your final exams. There is no such thing as "extra credit", nor even normal credit.

He made me love science, taught me "the beauty of a softly simmering cauldron," if you will.

However, if you were shit at the subject and didn't pay attention, he was pretty mean to you. Made kids cry on the regular, though usually for doing something dumb/dangerous like sticking your head out a sixth floor window or playing with the outlets on a lab bench.

I can see how Snape would be a caricature of that teacher from a student who didn't get along with him. I bet if we saw him from Malfoy's perspective he'd be portrayed totally differently. I liked that essay for making me see that perspective, but it could have used a +little+ lot of nuance.

- In America people "say grace" before eating dinner; in the UK we thank the Queen.

- When Americans say they have "biscuits in gravy", it's a savoury scone-like thing. By contrast, in the UK we have what Americans would call "cookies" in our gravy.

- A common phrase for sex is to "cover his teapot". This is based on an old tradition: when a boy turns 18, he is given a teapot to commemorate becoming a man. When a girl turns 18, she is given a tea cosy. Traditionally, when a couple would get married, a part of the ceremony was placing her tea cosy over his teapot.

- In Britain, the Superman-inspired habit of wearing your pants on the outside never caught on; unlike our American cousins, we still wear our pants beneath our trousers.

That's a southern thing only, though. Here in the north, a girl gets given a ferrent to take care of at about the same age that boys make the transition to long trousers. One of our fine old wedding traditions used to be that the bride would put her ferret down her new husband's trousers, as a sign of his commitment to the coming wedding night.

In general the political structure of Wizarding Britain has somewhat interesting implications. The word /Wizengamot/, for example, has rather clear anglo-saxon roots (deriving from irl [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witenagemot][Witenagemots]]) and would definitely have been disbanded or at least renamed during Normanization. Probably the easiest explanation is a second renaming during a period of anglo-saxon cultural nationalism in the 1700s -- say, perhaps Wizarding Britain came down hard on the anti-Catholic side during that conflict, and evoked the concept of the Norman Yoke on a much greater scale than on the non-magical side. Taken together with the indications that England and Scotland have been in union since the middle ages, an alternative explanation could be that the Norman conquest only happened on the non-magical side, or even that the Wizengamot separated from the British government on legitimist grounds against William the Conqueror.

TLDR I think too much about the etymological implications of words JKR most likely just randomly scribbled on the back of a napkin.

I admit, I had to google what this meant - for those equally not in-the-know, this means to swear rapidly and without pause. Essentially, a rant of swearwords.

I mean, we all swear a tonne and use a joyously exclaimed 'aight, cunt!' (here in the North, anyway) as a way to greet friends, so I don't think so. Our closest equivalent, I believe, would probably just be 'swearing like a sailor' or 'their swearing would make a sailor blush', but that generally has more 'creative swearing' undertones than ranty implications. Could also call them an 'Essex Girl', if you're writing in a post-TOWIE era, I suppose (TOWIE is our version of Geordie Shore).

That's also a thing. We don't say 'cussing'. We might say 'cursing', but we'd pretty much always call it 'swearing'. So we might, in some places, say 'swear a blue streak', but I've never heard it where I live.

EDIT - Oh! I forgot there's also 'swearing up a storm'. I've heard that a few times from my Irish relatives and I'm fairly certain that's not just an Americanism we've picked up.

** I have another one for you... what about hoodies? Did you wear them in the 1990s? And if you did, what would you call the garment? Or is there some other garment that Harry would have worn when he was out and about as muggle instead?

*** I know the term originated in the 90s, so we'd definitely've called it that. I personally have never owned a hoodie and wasn't born until '96, but I asked my father about them and apparently they were worn generally in the 90s, but they were mostly popular with Chavs back then.

In case you're unaware of what a Chav is, they're basically young people of low social class who're prone to violent outbursts (stereotypically, and typically stereotyped by older people, I will add. One of my best friends is cosmetically Chav and she'd quite literally struggle to hurt a fly) and swagger about in packs, commenting on their physical strength and intimidation factor by proclaiming how 'hard' they are. They're also known for wearing designer clothing and paying attention to that sort of thing - kind of a prequel to the modern Fuckboii, I suppose, being obsessed with hair and ridiculously overpriced trainers and such. Always made me laugh, given the other meaning of being hard, but they insistently use it to boast about their toughness nevertheless. There's also a female subset of 'Essex Girl' that's leaked into the stereotype a bit, often to be found caked in foundation and being particularly concerned with the shape of their eyebrows, but that's more of a 2000s and later thing.

Harry definitely wouldn't be a Chav. He's a little too posh for that. He might wear one in a gym-going situation, but other than that, he'd definitely go with a jumper or a v-neck of some sort if you were looking for him to wear something other than a jacket or coat.

**** Thank you! I realized while I was editing my story that I had used the word hoodie... which is definitely what all the young people wear around here even when the weather merits a down coat, hat, and gloves. The hoodie really became a thing of its own and a universal symbol of solidarity after Trayvon Martin was killed in Florida in 2012 for looking menacing (aka being black) while wearing his hoodie and walking around a white neighborhood eating skittles and drinking a soda.

So, Harry's wearing Dudley's cast-off clothes... would Dudley be considered a Chav?

***** ...I don't actually know. He's definitely a chav when he's out and about with his mates - that gold chain and t-shirt combo he was wearing when the Dementors attacked is peak Chav.

When he's with his parents and being 'respectable', then he's more... I think the American term is 'Preppy'? We don't really have an equivalent here - the 'traditional' vibe of the Preppy is more tweed suits and flannel and brown oxford shoes (think non-Magical Slughorn, basically) over here. I think our closest alternative would be a 'Sloaney', after Sloane Square in London, but that's more Nouveau Riche than a Preppy is.

Anyway. Yes, when he's with his mates he is very much a Chav. So, I suppose Harry could get a hoodie from him, if Dudley was willing to part with that side of his wardrobe. We only ever really see Harry in shirts and such, so I always expected that Dudley was giving away his crappy Sloaney gear that he didn't really care about.

If it's any consolation, I do the same for Americans when I'm writing Life is Strange. No dictionary though, but I have a little commonplace notebook where I write all the information I have about your peculiar nation. China may eat bats and scorpions, but America is the only country that would name a pastry something like 'Bear Claw'. :D

********* Thanks! I'll likely take you up on that in future. Right now, I'm mostly working on a Sci-fi blend of Dead Space and Life is Strange, so contemporary American Culture doesn't come up too much, but I suspect some of my other stuff will necessitate an ask or two. :)

Agreed. It's so distinct a thing, culture, and by nature it's really difficult to consider properly. Unspoken social norms and all. It always makes me laugh when people say that white people/white Americans have no culture. Because a five minute conversation can prove that you clearly do. :)

I've tried a Rattlesnake once, and I can tell you it wasn't very chickeny. Could've been chicken, but with the toughness of badly cooked octopus and the blandness of badly cooked steak. I think the Chicken is just because it's often Chicken-fried (a uniquely American sacrilege).

*********** Exactly. You don't see what you see all the time. It just becomes the background. It's why I think the statute of secrecy would actually outlast smart-phone cameras. We're all as oblivious to the day-to-day as New Yorkers are about their neighbours.

Not as bad as I'm imagining it sounds, but yeah, it wasn't the best. I figure that's why they chicken-fry it. Softens it up and gives it a decent taste. I haven't been to Barcelona myself, but I imagine most of what you ate there was seafood, right? The Iberian peninsula in general is really good at seafood.

Basic overview (though only of the first two games, the latter two are a spiritual sequel that I don't write for) - Telltale-style five-episode game about a teenage murder mystery in a twee, slowly-declining fishing village in Oregon starring a socially anxious artsy-hipster protagonist who attends the improbably well-funded local art college and has wholly unexplained time-reversing powers alongside a mood-flailing bestie with a troubled past. Kind of Twin-Peaks vibes to the whole thing, really.

Quite a lot of reviewers of the game found that best friend incredibly annoying. She's very clingy. I really enjoyed the characters myself, but if you're not into listening to Young American Teens navigate their social drama while poking into a surprisingly well-constructed murder-mystery narrative and casually playing about with the fabric of spacetime, then you'll probably not like it. If that appeals, then great! You'll probably enjoy it and there are a bunch of good letsplays on Youtube that'll let you check it out before buying.
