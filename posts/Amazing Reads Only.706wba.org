Hiya, everyone!

The title really speaks for itself - I'm looking for the absolute /best/ written HP fanfiction out there. The stuff that should forever be savored because it's so awesome, and one's you hated to see end. Comedy, war, angst, horror - you name it, I want to read it! As long as the quality is assured. Preferably Harry centric, but it doesn't have to be.

Couple of things I DON'T want, however! No slash, no gender bending, no cross overs, HAS to have good grammar and has to be complete or actively updated. No dead or abandoned stories too.

That's about it! I just want to read great stuff, no matter how different it may be. I really prefer long, door stopper length stories, but that's not a must. Any length will do - just has to be an awesome story.

Also - read all the suggested stories on the intro page. Loved them all.


** It's not Harry-centric, but this story has the best written Snape and Luna I've ever seen.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** 100% the best harry potter series on ff.net? well, there can be none other then the pretense series, by murkeybluematter. linkffn(7613196)

It is hands down the most well written, interesting, often witty, occasionally dark, but always exceptional series on ff.net, and is a MUST read for anybody with a passion for fan-fiction. (or if you familiar with Tamora Pierce's works)

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** This is one of my favourite fics and another one (like After the End, which I still think is the best ever) that I very rarely if at all see recommended! H/G post-Hogwarts fic (AU post-OOTP) that wonders what would have happened if Harry thought Ginny, Ron and Hermione were killed in the final battle.

I think it's very well written and the characters are well constructed and eminently believable. Like After the End I think it's a very mature fic - which I think is something you rarely find.
