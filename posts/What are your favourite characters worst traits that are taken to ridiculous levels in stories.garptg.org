** I don't know if I have a single 'favorite' character - but let's see, some that I do like a lot...

For Hermione, her traits tend to be played up either way. For a negative view of her, her negative traits are taken up to 15, she's bitchy, she's dumb, she's overbearing. Her positive fics can also be a pain, though.

For Fleur, her worst traits tend to be snobbishness, veela-nature/allure, and a bad version of being French that the author imagines. She's a character I don't /really/ like the canon interpretation of, but really like the idea - it's a pain that most stories featuring her are basically unreadable :(

Fred and George get their stupidity/randomness turned up to 11, with 'pranks' that aren't funny.

Ron is already covered.

Harry gets used a flimsy stand in for the author, and gets his power level, arrogance, and all around asshole-ness turned up to 100.

Dumbledore gets his manipulativeness and calousness turned up, and his intelligence turned /way/ down.

Snape can get turned into either a perfect angel, or an evil iredeemable asshole.

** My favorite character is Snape, but he is usually portrayed rather poorly. And I don't mean it like "how dare people say bad things about Snape", but more that fics either portray him as a saint screwed over by pretty much everyone in his life, or second in command on the scale of Evil right after Voldemort. He is a right bastard a lot of the time and you can't just ignore the fact that for several years he was a legitimate Death Eater, but at least later in life I always felt that when it truly mattered, he did the right thing. And I've always been a fan of fics portraying a younger Snape actually ending up better off, either because of doing something slightly different, or something/someone causes him to get his shit together and leave the junior Death Eater recruitment camp.

It's still the same old Snape, a dick to almost everybody he meets and strict to the core but also not so much as book snape and not as hurt as what movie snape and fanfictions seem to think that he is.

For example, an extract:

“I do not claim any talent for the Second Sight, Potter, but I have had a vision. In this vision, you did something so monumentally, blazingly stupid that even I, who expect very little of you, would have been shocked.”

Harry was so overwhelmed by the sheer Snape of this comment that he could think of nothing to say.

**** Hah, that comment made me laugh. And yeah, that version of Snape is the one I like the most -- not a needless huge focus on how hurt Snape is, but at the same time, not the needless cruelty of Snape from early books.

I actually prefer movie!Snape for this reason. Not because of Alan Rickman (allthough I do think he portrayed him pretty well), but because movie!Snape, while still a bastard, doesn't go as far as book!Snape in being needlessly cruel to his students.

** Dumbledore. Like, literally. The aspect people bash is apparently how he "manipulates" people, and how he apparently believes in the "greater good".

Both of which are complete bullshit. Not only was the Greater Good Grindelwald's ideology, which Albus very vehemently opposes as a major part of his backstory, the situations he supposedly manipulates into existence require so much random chance it's ridiculous.

The ONLY thing you can put at his feet is not taking Harry from the Dursleys once their cruelty was revealed, and we don't know when that was, if ever.

- Sirius was sent to azkaban without a trial, because he confessed and laughed about "his" crime on the scene.

- James and Lily did not have a will to "seal", whatever that means.

- Albus has three very prestigious jobs, he doesn't need to steal anything from anyone. Not to mention that the Goblins don't like thieves very much. It's only stated hmmm... about every single time they're mentioned in the books.

- The weasleys are shown to always be extremely late to the train, and nobody knew when Harry was left there. Don't forget that Hagrid was probably supposed to tell Harry how to get through the barrier but didn't.

- Both Ron and Hermione were ready to die for Harry, and he for them. They were not "paid to be his friends".

- The gauntlet was a sham, yes, because the true test was the mirror. It served to delay a thief long enough for Dumbledore to be alerted, and to prevent them from bringing anyone else. Voldemort wants to use the stone, so he can't get it. If he can destroy the mirror, then the stone is gone. The protection is perfect. The only reason it was broken is because Harry foolishly went into the room that had the dark lord contained.

- The basilisk was undetectable, and Dumbledore was ousted from the school for most of the year. Don't forget that "maybe killing eyes petrify when seen indirectly" is complete speculation on Hermione's part. Also, Dumbledore likely knows a great many magics whose purpose is petrification. He would not have speculated on some random extinct magical monster.

- In third year, he directly helped them by suggesting highly illegal time travel. As for why he didn't go himself - he didn't go himself. Time Turning is a closed loop. If he'd gone himself to save Sirius and Harry, then there wouldn't be a stag patronus and the universe would collapse. fun. Don't forget that everyone believed Sirius to be a murdering backstabber and he trusted them enough to believe he wasn't.

I could go on. Dumbledore Bashing is the worst kind, because it's built on absolutely nothing. Ron Bashing can be extrapolated with a lot of mental gymnastics, but Dumbledore Bashing requires actual brain damage.

***** Dumbledore probably wasn't in a big hurry anyway because his absence was the perfect trap. Dumbledore knew that Voldemort would jump at the chance to steal the stone while he was gone- but he had to lay the trap because he wasn't sure exactly how Voldemort was going to get into the school. I doubt he knew Quirrel was possessed, he probably only suspected Quirrel was acting on Voldemort's behalf. So you have a gauntlet of challenges designed to delay a thief without being too dangerous for a nosy student, with a perfect defense at the end. Plus, even if he can't get back in time, the rest of the staff is present- and McGonagle and Flitwick alone held their own against a full powered Voldemort in Book 7. The plan was foolproof.

Then Harry and Friends bungled into the trap, got the stone, and messed everything up.

** Dumbledore being manipulative is the obvious answer here. Very few people manage to get that right while also having Dumbledore be the flawed but still morally good character he tries to be. In fairness Rowling herself muddled this in the first place so its hard to blame people, since its difficult to square his actions with his good intentions and almost godlike ability a lot of the time.

Honourable mentions to stressy Hermione shouting at people using their full names and Ron being jealous to the point he's no longer Harry's best pal. Ron rarely gets the nuance he deserves. He gets a bit jealous once or twice, but he's also loyal to a fault, very capable at magic when he wants to be, and is the one person Harry cherishes above all others. In a lot of fanfiction he is readily portrayed as a fool holding Harry back, as too jealous, or too willing to sell him out or stop being his friend.

The other big one is Sirius acting like a child. I've no idea where this idea of Sirius comes from, since he is never portrayed as immature in the books. Reckless, half mad, almost fanatically loyal to James and then Harry, but never ever all that silly. He's deadly serious after Azkaban and before it, what we know of him suggests he was more likely to be a bit reckless, dangerous and cutting in his pranks and humour rather than running around joking with everyone and calling Harry 'Prongslet'. Its bizarre how such a dark character is portrayed as a jovial fool so often.
