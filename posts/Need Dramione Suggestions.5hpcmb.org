So my classes are about to end for the semester and over the Christmas holidays I have 3.5 weeks before my college courses consume me again. I am looking for some amazing Dramione five to fill that void.

I have remand and enjoyed Isolation, Hunted, How the Other Half Lives, and just finished Aurelian which is by far my favorite to date. I am also caught up with a WIP called Mugglefied.

I prefer a completed fic and one that portrays Draco realistically. I also prefer longer fics, at least 50k words but I will gladly read one that's over 200k if it's well written. I have searched and searched but have really only found abandoned fics, ones with OOC Draco, and WIP's.

So... any suggestions?

Thanks is advance!


** I loved Aurelian!

A few other ones I liked were:

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=212][A Pound of Flesh]]

#+begin_quote
  Becoming attached had never been part of the plan. Neither was falling in love. One night out on the town, Hermione comes face to face with Draco Malfoy--Memory Charmed and living as a Muggle--and an opportunity too good to pass up. What starts as revenge quickly grows into something more, and as Hermione delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding the man who can't remember who he is - the man everyone thought was dead - she might discover more than she can handle.
#+end_quote

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=582][An Aversion to Change]]

#+begin_quote
  After his failed attempt on Dumbledore's life, Draco seeks refuge at the Order of the Phoenix. Sent back to Hogwarts with suspicious title of Head Boy, he is forced to share a dormitory with none other than Hermione Granger. But with war looming on the horizon and sinister happenings in Hogwarts itself, their seventh year together is anything but ordinary.

#+begin_quote
  In a whirlwind of pleasure and angst, can Draco and Hermoine end up happy and together? Or are they destined forever to keep their relationship physical and above all secret?
#+end_quote

Also, [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dmtabf/MTK.html][Meet the Kids]] has a trope similar to Aurelian. That one is more light-hearted than the other fics.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione and Malfoy come across a mysterious Time Turner while patrolling the dungeon one night. When its accidentally turned over, they find themselves in a situation they never could have imagined with people they have never met . . . their kids.

** [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout by everythursday]] Hermione learns about growing up through the redemption of Draco Malfoy.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1034][When the Bell Tolls by everythursday]] As a Dark revival begins to rise four years after the war, Hermione Granger is placed on the assignment of putting an end to them -- and her first task is to recruit the Ministry's best hope and last option in the form of Draco Malfoy.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=832][Finders by everythursday]] An alliance is formed when Hermione begins seeing things, as a dangerous magic threatens to overtake Hogwarts.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=367][Parade of the Sun by everythursday]] Floralis Fati is a plant with the power to control time, hidden in the wild, and protected by a magic that strips people of their own while seeking to kill them. Hermione wants it to save the world. Draco wants it to save himself. Sometimes what we want can destroy us - and sometimes it can build us new again.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=57][Heavy Lies the Crown by Floorcoaster]] Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude, And in the calmest and most stillest night, With all appliances and means to boot, Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down! Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. // For seven years, Draco has carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, and just when he thinks he'll be released, something happens that will make him seek help from the last person he could have imagined.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=718][Thirteenth Night by Nelpher]] When Hermione is assigned to keep tabs on a memory-charmed Draco, she is faced with a decision that could change her life forever.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=14][The Fool, the Emperor, and the Hanged Man by ianthe_waiting]] Ten years after the fall of the Dark Lord, Hermione Granger leads a life of self-imposed obscurity, that is, until the day Headmistress Minerva McGonagall is murdered and a certain 'hero' is responsible.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1412][The Observer by Powerofthebook]] Who is behind the skyrocketing trend in illegal potions abuse? The Ministry of Magic wants to know. Of less importance to most - who thought it would be funny to pair up Investigators Malfoy and Granger and put them on the case?

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=22][Tender Vengeance by Margot Le Faye]] Setting out to capture Ginny Weasley, the Death Eaters also take Hermione Granger. Instead of killing the Muggle-born outright, Voldemort subjects her to an insidious bit of dark magic which turns her into a prize for one of his faithful.

Some long fics for you... All complete except for the last one, but it is still getting updated. I tried to read Aurelian and failed every single time. Take that as you will...

I would say these are fairly/somewhat realistic portrayals of Draco. If nothing else, his attitude or thought-process is explained. He's no prince charming by any means, and he isn't one to spontaneously fall in love, so there's that. Personally, The Fallout is my favourite and follows more along the lines of Isolation. I find it to be a bit more grittier though.
