** The answer is Hagrid. Treat Harry like a XXXX creature and give him good love, good food, and a good dose of understanding. It might take time but I believe Hagrid could tame Harry and socialize him to approachable levels.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Now that's something you don't see everyday. No idea if there is already something like this. But Harry going wild or obscurus should make everyone question Dumbledore about his stupidity. He never thought what would happen with a suppressed powerful wizard kid in Muggles care after what happened to his sister? (Apparently his biggest regret in his life)

***** Yes I've read the books. Harry Potter is average, and is only really good at defence. Each of his victories weren't by power alone but by being clever and lucky. Quirrel : Strange magic from his mother. Basilisk : Sword of plot convenience. For the dementors, one could argue that he managed to do it because he saw himself do it - then the patronus couldn't fail, because it was set in stone. Yes, he learnt it at a young age - but because nobody else saw any point in learning the patronus, and he did it after several months of training. The patronus isn't a hard spell because it needs power, but because it needs trully happy memories.

Fourth year : he's just good at flying with his broom. Sure, he managed to accio his broom, but it's not like it was that hard. The lake, he did nothing to show his amazing power, and the maze was rigged. He didn't defeat Voldemort, but barely managed to escape with his life by pure wand lore bullshit.

Fifth year : again, his only feats are training a bunch of students, and surviving a battle against people that couldn't afford to kill him. And his friends also survived, so it wasn't "him being ultra powerfull".

Sixth year : Once again, no proof that he's more than an average wizard. He learns about Voldemort's life and protect Dumbledore long enough so that the old man can use fire to get the undeads to stay in the water. Once back at Hogwarts, he is shown how mediocre he is against a dark wizard in the form of Severus Snape humiliating him.

And Seventh year, let's just skim through everything until the battle of hogwarts. What saved the day ? Not his amazing power of awesomness, but the same thing than seventh year : wand lore bullshit.

****** I think you're confusing skills and power? It's always been inferred that Harry is reasonably powerful. But he is incredibly average in skills (outside of Patronus, protego, expellimus, and stupifey)

Ps sorry if I misspelled the spells. There's a pun in there somewhere.

****** Well if whatever â€˜small' thing he does is not hard and practice for months is normal then there is nothing to argue. Teaching is not hard. Fighting a full grown death eater and getting defeated is weakness. That's what I'm trying to say. He is not trained for that stuff properly. If you know he is gonna face voldy, don't treat the eminent threat as future problem. Take that seriously.

If 1st year was luck, make preparations for rest of them to be handled properly.

2nd year voldy came again. You don't scold him for his reckless behaviour in 1st year and make teacher take the boy more seriously, and the boy went to fight a basilisk without asking teachers for help

3rd year Harry has to ask to learn patronas when he should be trained for that after 2nd attack promptly if 1st was considered accident. And he is surprisingly good at it. Scarred and scared for 10 years in muggle world the boy can still find happiness and do magic above his age and corporal patronising at that. What can't he achieve with enough training.

He may be average but since Dumbledore went to lengths to believe in the prophecy, he should train this average boy so that with hard work he can properly defend and fight on his own. Not plan to slaughter him at right time like a pig.

**** Average? I think getting Outstanding in all required subject for Aurors job qualifies him to be above average if not elite. Training students above his age against dark arts at an age of 15. I have been part of groups in school and college and that kind of leadership and strength alone is rare. Morality and clear headed even when whole school has turned against you thrice for some bullshit reasons. I don't know how a school kid handles that but he is way more mature, forgiving and shows above average control of emotions. You don't have to be the most powerful wizard by the age of 17 and defeat voldy. Train Harry to have more experience, more magical power, practice of many more spells than just expelliarmus. At least let him defend himself properly instead plot armors like golden flames and priori incantatum.

Also Dumbledore hated his father and his brother hated him for whole life. And he knows how awe full muggles can be ( his sister's condition for example)

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".

** Oh, there's one from years ago that I can't remember the title of that's kind of like this, Harry's raised in a secret magical forest that has dinosaurs and creatures like that, during the triwizard tournament some dragon handlers mistake the eggs for dragon eggs and take them, Harry goes and interrupts the first task to get them back, it's set up to be a Harry/Fleur I think, but it wasn't ever finished
