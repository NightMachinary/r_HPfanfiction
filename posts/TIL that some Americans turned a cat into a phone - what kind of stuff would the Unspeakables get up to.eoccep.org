I don't think we can link PDFs here, so I have to make do with a link ([[https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/princeton-cat-experiment/]]).

Two lunatic American scientists from Princeton essentially wired a cat's brain into a telephone system. Weird enough start, but it actually worked! Talking into the cat's ear acted just like a phone and their words could be heard in the actual telephone receiver.

This got me thinking. If this is what publically funded scientists did, what kind of weird, mildly fucked up experiments like this would a secretive group called 'Unspeakables' get up to? Is there a fire elemental locked up in the DoM that acts like a floo? Did they find out that squishing a muggle brain and frying it with lemons made for better inferi? What are the weirdest magical-science experiments you can think of or have seen in fics?


** Bro that's kinda fucked, reminds me of how scientist were able to keep alive a decapitated dog head and it ate food.

*** u/Efficient_Assistant:
#+begin_quote
  students seem to either get high marks on everything, or are mediocre at everything
#+end_quote

I would like to point out that there is at least one student that this doesn't apply to: Neville. We know that he's really good at Herbology and and 'E' student in charms (and I think defence too) but mediocre in Transfiguration and Potions (although one could argue that the last one was more due to Snape than anything else).

That said, your general idea is something I do find interesting :) I definitely see where and why Arthur would fit right in to this version of the ministry.

*** Yep, this is now how the ministry works. Sound so much more interesting than the normal incompetent and corrupt ministry.

*** I like the perfect music one. Reminds me of a cross between The Long Reach and Layers of Fear. The former is thinky sci-fi horror, the latter is weird existentialist 'going-insane-alone-in-a-room' horror. Both fun as heck.

Your latter suggestion is SCP as all hell. I'm fairly certain that's how Containment Breach started, isn't it? Either way, you've got an interesting collection of ideas here! I like it.

** Ever seen Warehouse 13? I get the feeling that Unspeakables everywhere are perpetually on the brink of failing to save the world from any manner of eldreth horrors. From dimensional travelers to the Old Gods, from Vacuum Decay to alien invaders, they're constantly being confronted with apocalyptic things, and you never hear about it, because they're That Good that their job.

*** I have! Great show, though it meandered a bit towards the end there IMO.

That would be a cool fic idea, actually. I can totally picture them in a tired British civil service sense towards all that (a la Laundry Files by Charles Stross) where the paperwork is more of a nightmare than the horrors they fight off. I wonder if there are any fics with it? If not, prompt time! :)

*** That would be cool. And fits with that fic idea that all magical races were offshoots of the creations of ancient Wizards. Some old guy made centaurs because he couldn't be bothered interviewing cavalry to ride his horses, etc etc.
