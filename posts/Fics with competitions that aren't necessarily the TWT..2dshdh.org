I don't mind changes to the TriWizard Tournament (such as seen in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591005/1/Champion][Champion]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3759227/1/The-TriSchool-Tournament][The TriSchool Tournament]]) but [[https://www.hpmor.com][HPMOR]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Battle School]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven][Wit of the Raven]] are the first three that I think of, to give you an idea of what I'm interested in. Lack of any romantic pairings is preferred is allowed if it does not overshadow the plot in any significant way.

It should go without saying that I'm looking for LONG, completed fics, but WIP or abandoned stories work too.


** The Lie I've Lived by JBern.\\
Temporal Beacon by willyolioleo (wip) heavy HHr though.\\
Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs (wip) multi pairings are a major plot point.\\
pretty sure Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart (abd) has one but it's been a while. also it's HHrLL.\\
Honestly Harry Series by Captain Compass is just getting into year four but I think his TWT is going to be new or at least I hope. it's HHrGW.

most of those are ship focused unfortunately. JBern will be you best bet.

***** I'm not sure if it is abandoned (although it has almost been a year). However, right at the top of chapter 1, it says: "Don't expect this story to ever be complete. It'll keep expanding indefinitely as long as I keep getting ideas."

So, while a good story, it doesn't really have a proper ending, and likely never will.

******** Well since you're here, allow me a moment to continue the praise!\\
Hallows and Pathos was one of the first Master of Death fics that I really enjoyed and actually kicked me off on opening up a bookmark folder specifically for them.\\
I giggled and laughed my ass off throughout India, Life of Brian, and Anagram.\\
I bought the first three Dresden Files books the last time I was in the US, but they got packed away when I got deployed the first time and haven't come back out. Once I get around to picking them up, I'm looking forward to reading Lost Soul. I could probably read it without the background, but I'd rather be able to appreciate all the references I'd miss without it, so that's sitting in my To Read folder for now.

But yeah, I love your work. Keep it up!

********* I'm very flattered to hear that you enjoyed my stories. Some of the ones you mention are some of my less read (though most favorite) pieces.

/Anagram/ was actually the result of a bet (I forget with whom--probably jbern, nonjon, or SomeGuyFawkes).

While I have a couple of fanfiction stories on the back burner (a sequel to /Whispers/ that's nearly complete; also, I have a novella length HP + Hunger Games/Battle Royale fusion that's nearly complete--were it posted, it'd be topical for this thread as well), most of my writing time of late is being spent on original fiction and watching my novels languish in slush piles and agents' Inboxes. I will get back to it though.

Edit: sentence got cut off. oops.

***** The writing is competently executed and the concept (as far as I know) remains unique for the fandom.

Unfortunately, after a promising start, the story was left incomplete. This is a pity, as it's one of those tales I would have loved to have seen played out.
