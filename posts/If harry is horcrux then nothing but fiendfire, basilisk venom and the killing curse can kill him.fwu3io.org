** This is a misconception; the protections which make Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes impervious to all but Fiendfyre and Basilisk Venom (and there is no confirmation that even the Killing Curse would work on one of the "object" Horcruxes) are essentially separate enchantments, even if there's some textual evidence that they're added to the objects as part of the Horcrux ritual.

What I mean is that becoming almost invulnerable isn't an automatic effect of being the vessel of a soul-shard, it's a different magical effect. So Harry Potter, as an accidental Horcrux, probably /isn't/ invulnerable; Voldemort's broken soul-shard happened to attach itself to him, turning him into what is /functionally/ a Horcrux, but no ritual was performed.

*** Exactly.

  ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, ‚Äúbecause it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.‚Äù

(DOH, chapter 6)

Dark wizards *have to make* [additional] *enchantments* on them. Which makes for my one of my plots: perhaps what Harry had in his head was true Horcrux (or perhaps not), but certainly Voldemort had no opportunity to make these additional enchantments when he was semi-dead after hitting Harry with the Killing Curse. So, perhaps, this was the only Horcrux which could be removed from its vessel without its destruction?

*** I could be mistaken but just touching the philosopher's stone wouldn't do anything. You can use the philosopher's stone to make the Elixir of Life. It's the Elixir of Life that rejuvenates you and extends your life. Also from canon you need to periodically drink the Elixir of Life to continue living. So it isn't a one shot and you're immortal.

**** Considering how old and frail Nicolas Flamel was portrayed as in Crimes of Grindelwald, it probably doesn't even rejuvenate you.
