Hello everyone! I'm looking to read some Dramione fanfic, but I have a pretty specific list of Dramione tropes I /don't/ want to see (and a few that I do). I know Dramione is not popular on this subreddit, but I'm curious to see if anyone has found fics that match what I'm looking for.

*Tropes I'm Not Looking For*

- Hermione is not raped by anyone (esp. not by Draco!), no "rape play" either

- No Ron bashing (Ron never uses love potions, cheats, turns out to be a Death Eater, etc.)

- No BDSM (please do not make me read one more sentence about magical ropes, chains, straps, etc!)

- NO A/B/O

- No whitewashing of Slytherins that completely contradicts canon (they can be redeemed or change sides in the fic but they can't just actually have been good all along or were "misunderstood")

- No Pureblood!Hermione

- Draco never chokes, maims, tortures, or is otherwise viciously evil towards Hermione, in a way that puts him on the level of other canon Death Eaters

- No magical soulmates (includes Veela!Draco)

- Half or more of their relationship is sex

- No Prisoner!Hermione or Slave!Hermione

- First Person Narration

- Evil!Gryffindors (Harry, Ron, Neville, etc suddenly bullying Hermione)

- Forced to have sex because of Reasons

- Raising a Child because of Hogwarts Lessons

- No whitewashing of Lucius' actions or character (I could accept a fic where he grows to change his views, but I've yet to see one down realistically)

- No Evil!Hermione

- Hermione has not been secretly in love with Draco since First Year

- Out of the blue romance

*Things I'd Love To See*

- Harry and Ron are still Hermione's close friends

- Well-paced relationship development, or already together when fic starts

- Preferably plot beyond romance (but pure romance is fine if it's really compelling)

- Draco apologising for what he did during their school years

- Draco changing his views NOT because of selfish love for Hermione, but other factors

- Preferably post Hogwarts, but I'm open to Hogwarts or Eighth Year fics

- Preferably no Marriage-Law, but I await seeing one done well

- I don't really care about the side-pairings, but bonus points if Harry/Luna is in it as well!

*Dramione fics I love:*

*Dramione fics I've already tried and* */didn't/* *like:*

Isolation

Any of Colubrina's stories (Green Girl, etc.)

Any of SenLinYu's fics, /especially/ Manacled

We Learned the Sea

Howl for Me

The Alkahest

The Deadline

The Right Thing To Do

I believe there are fanfics out there without these tropes! I like Dramione but I just can't stand most of the cliches or turning Draco into an evil rapist scumbag etc for Hermione to "mend". Thank you for any help!


** What your list of not wants and wants comes down to is wanting to see normal human beings acting like human beings then? xD Which seems to be a rare thing in fanfiction, sadly. I'd LOVE to read a fucking dramione fic with just normal fucking people too. But sadly I've never found even ONE.

*** It really is! It is ridiculous how pretty much every top-rated highly recommended dramione fic is basically along the lines of "Hermione is captured/tortured/goes completely evil/Draco's one true love and he/she will DIE otherwise, while Draco is straight up evil to her, and despite Hermione being the brightest witch of her age, she just goes hmm, guess I'll shag that despite him being a murderous psychopath 50 points for me". I mean, really, you have a pairing that opens itself up for so much emotional exploration, and you decide to do write that?

**** Exactly! It has actual dramatic and interpersonal potential there, but fucking nobody wants to explore any of it and just wants to make the most unrealistic, abusive fantasy bullshit ever.

I mean shit, Draco getting to KNOW Hermione as a person, becoming her friend, realizing his views are wrong, that he has to change them...and then maybe later that turns into love, because Hermione admires him for being willing to change for the better and improve himself as a person! Instead it's just rapey torture bullshit.

** Have you ever read/heard of linkffn(Apple Pies and Other Amends) ? I haven't read it in a while, but I'm pretty sure it contains almost nothing on your bad tropes list. I think it certainly does a better job than many others.

For example (light side-plot spoilers with no details) there's a bit of Ron-bashing in that Ron acts kinda stupid for awhile, but he does get some redemption.

** You've got a lot of requirements there. Unfortunately developing a friendship between Hermione and Draco is really difficult without fundamentally changing a few things such as making Slytherins (or at least Draco) not quite as bigoted, or changing Hermione into one herself.

*** I disagree that you'd need to do that - I think it would be possible if it were after the war, where Draco was in the process of trying to make amends, where they could eventually become friends. Cursed Child, despite its...quality, suggests that Draco becomes cordial with the Trio eventually. It's not impossible, but it's rarely handled well in fic imo. It's usually extremely rushed on Hermione's end, or it gets handwaved and Draco never REALLY has to own up and apologise.
