:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically Draco notices that Harry is lacking his normal flair and decides to step in. He discovers that Harry's under glamours and spends time with him when Hermione and Ron won't. Harry has a tumor which he's reluctant to treat because he has 50-50 chance but ends up treating it anyway when it gets too bad. No Bashing (I think)

I believe the summary had something like 'he's dying because of his muggle blood'? I read it yesterday but I can't seem to find it anymore.


** A million years later, but it sounds like the fic where Harry had a magical disease called succorbentis?
