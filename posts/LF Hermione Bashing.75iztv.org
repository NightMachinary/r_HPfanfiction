Give me your best Hermione Bashing fics. I'd prefer no Ron bashing, but I can take a little.


** I don't know if I'd call it bashing but linkffn(The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville) is quite hard on Hermione.

** I'm curious - do you actually dislike Hermione? Could you explain why?

I mean obviously you don't have to answer, it's just...I'm really super curious because she's been my favourite character since Book 1 and I can't imagine not liking her.

*** Oh boy, here we go.

I don't /hate/ Hermione. Personally, I like her in canon. Canon Hermione, I'm cool with.

It's /fanon/ Hermione that I hate. Fanon Hermione, who is practically Einstein levels of intelligence in First Year. Fanon Hermione, who can come up with an immunity to the Avada Kedavra. Fanon Hermione, who is a beautiful Goddess, sexier than any Veela. Fanon Hermione, who is Harry's only REAL friend, not like that bastard Ron who rapes kittens and is just a Death Eater in disguise.

I hate Fanon Hermione because she's just so damn /perfect/.

I mean, don't get me wrong. I /understand/ why so many people make Fanon Hermione like that. Guys like her because she was played by Emma Watson, so that's the image of Hermione in their heads.

But that doesn't mean I have to like it.

It seems as though every fic I read, Harry becomes best pals with Hermione. Dark!Harry? Hermione is right there getting dark with him. Squib!Harry? Haha guess the name of the Dentists he starts going to. Harry runs away from home? Where else would he run to but the Grangers? Racist Harry calls her the magical equivalent of the N-word? Naturally Hermione forgives him because she isn't like that bitch Lily.

It's a fucking cop out. I'd love to see /other/ characters get the damn limelight for once. Maybe Harry winds up meeting Dean before Hogwarts or something? Just stop it with this home at the Grangers crap (the next time I see Dan and Emma Granger I'm going to kill).

And I haven't even gotten /started/ on how H/HR seems to be shoved into pretty much everything, often including Ron bashing.

So tl;dr I don't hate canon Hermione. It's what fans have done to her that I hate.

**** Ahhh okay, I get it.

I think I've missed out on a lot of the things that annoy you because I read mostly in my own ship, but I have come across a few fics that I wanted to give the stink-eye because /nobody is that perfect/. I guess I've just been lucky :)

Personally I like Hermione because I was almost exactly like her in school, down to the big teeth and the bushy hair and the nose in the book (but sadly, without the excellent marks because I had better things to read than textbooks) so I tend to get annoyed when people disappear her more annoying traits and paint her as this perfect angel, because she wasn't. I mean she was a fantastic friend to Harry (and going by the evidence, she probably /would/ have forgiven her best friend for calling her a slur in that situation, but I digress), but she was bossy and she had a temper and tended to think she knew better than everyone else, but that's part of her charm for me.

Re: the Ron-bashing, I don't really understand the level of hate for him in some parts of fandom. I mean, I don't particularly like Ron Weasley, because I think he's a berk, but he's not this completely evil character he's often painted as. He's insensitive and has a temper and could really stand to work harder at school, and I think a relationship between him and Hermione would end in murder sooner or later, but he can be a really fun character as well.

(I confess I'm guilty of mostly cutting RW out of my own TWD/HP fic, but my excuse is that I'm having enough trouble writing Snape, Hermione, Harry, Narcissa, Eileen and Draco together without accidentally leaving someone out of a scene - earlier in the fic I accidentally vanished Hermione's mum between the elevator and the zombie holding cell, so I'm trying not to have too many characters in each scene lest I forget one)

Anyway thank you for taking the time to explain - I think I need to go over my own writing to see if I can avoid any of these sins :D

***** Well when I say "Racist Harry calling her the N-word" I mean a Harry who isn't her friend.

And I don't ship R/Hr either, but I don't understand how people think the only way to get Ron not to hook up with Hermione is to kill him or butcher his character.

Thanks for being so understanding about it; last time I talked about why I despise fanon Hermione, I got called a Pureblood apologist.

****** Oh okay that's a lot more clear about the word - I can see her holding a grudge about that for a long time lol.

About R/Hr - I don't understand it either. I mean they're completely incompatible in every important way from their interests to their attitude; you don't have to make Ron some kind of slavering demon to make them not date.

Thank YOU for not taking offense at my question - people do rather take that kind of question the wrong way occasionally - and I'm really sorry that you had that experience. I guess that would make me a Pureblood apologist for disliking Lily too...

***** The problem with "Her Highness" is that she can do no wrong (many women write fanfiction and they idolize the female characters, even their less than flattering traits like Hermione not knowing what boundaries are and her bad social graces (not to mention that while she's certainly intelligent she's not a prodigy - Dumbledore and Voldemort however are!), while making the men out to be bumbling whipped fools ("Yes dear...of course dear...I will do that, dear!" etc.) that need those women to help them make half way decent decisions! Also: If you write a supposedly more independent and intelligent Harry, then have him set boundaries, damned canon Harry only didn't because he was still suffering from his abuse (he let Ron shit on their friendship twice, when most of us would have probably told him to "get lost and never show me your face again!"!) and was thankful that someone would be his friend, not to mention that he depended on Hermione like a damned computer depends on external storage for information!)

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller
