So basically what the title says. Take the idea of Harry being in a video game, but instead of how most gamer fics usually go have it instead that a Youtuber is playing Harry and trying for a world record speedrun to kill Voldemort.

This could allow 'glitches', so if Harry continuously crouches in a corner of the cupboard for a few minutes he might end up glitching through the walls or getting teleported etc.

A fun part of this idea is that since its a speedrun, things like laws or the Statute of Secrecy mean literally nothing to Harry. Stealing wands, breaking into Gringotts, arson (fiendfyre), doing magic in front of muggles and murder would be compltely acceptable - all in the name of getting a few precious second of the time.

This would probably be a one-shot idea, but it could be quite funny.

*** "Pausa! Pausa! Pausa!" Harry shouts. Voldemort blinked as the boy-who-lived began to spin in a stuttered circle, his wand drawn but pointing toward the sky.

Honestly the dark wizard was so taken aback he couldn't do anything but watch for the approximate minute. Finally the child slowly lowered his wand toward Voldemort. There was a moment of silence as his gaze met Harry's.

"Pausa."

The next thing he saw was a teenage boy flying toward him at breakneck speed before the wand drove through his skull, killing him instantly.

***** Haha legend of Zelda windwaker used to be ran in Italian. There is a glitch that if you pause buffer while you spin on outset island you gain momentum, stacking until you release it and go flying across the entire map in approximately 17 seconds.

While running this it's about 1min of straight up pausing and unpausing the game. At GDQ there is an audience and as such they don't like staring at a screen so them and twitch chat just shout PAUSA the whole time and then the speed runner counts down to release and everyone cheers.

It's a fun time.

****** It's definitely as much of a leap away from Harry Potter as fanfiction can really get, both in terms of scope and writing style. I've found it hasn't aged particularly well, but I like it simply because it is so different and unique.

There aren't many fics like it in the fandom and I try to treasure the ones that do go above and beyond, even if the execution isn't perfect. I'd rather see more like than yet more derivative drivel that runs through canons stations with the good old "the character has a completely different past, driving motivation, friends, family - but yet *nothing changes*"

** One morning as Hermione descended the stairs from the girls' dormitory she was witness to a very strange sight. Her friend Harry Potter, wearing a bright green skirt paired with orange high heels, was... humping a wall. Hermione had of course read that teenage boys were driven crazy by hormones and a certain amount of... self-gratification was to be expected. But this was ridiculous. Shaking herself out of her stupor she confronted him.

"Harry James Potter, what are /you/ doing to this poor wall?" Harry looked completely unrepentant as he answered with a large grin.

"Oh, hi Hermione, didn't see you there. Well, I already got my Skirt and Heels and destroyed all the Horcruxes. The Heels are a bitch to find by the way. They spawn randomly in a 7th Year Girls dorm between 22:00 and 04:00 and sneaking in is no fun. So now I'm trying to clip through this wall so I can get out of bounds in order to Apparate outside Voldemort's headquarters and smother him in his sleep." Hermione's eyes narrowed dangerously.

"You better start making sense soon, mister" The unspoken "or else" went over Harry's head who was still energetically trying to... clip through the wall. Fortunately, Harry still found time to answer her.

"I am trying to speedrun the main quest of killing the Dark Lord by wearing the Skirt of Reasonable Comfort, which gives a +75 bonus when sneaking and the Heels of Ouch-My-Toes which muffle footsteps. Clipping through this wall and Apparating while out of bounds is faster than walking down to the castle gates and Apparating there. After that, it's just a few minutes of sneaking past Death Eaters with my Skirt, Heels and Invisibility cloak. RN Jesus willing I'll get an easy guard rotation and be able to kill Voldemort before you can say "antidisestablishmentarianism".

Hermione was able to say "antidisestablishmentarianism" since she was 8 and had done a rather brilliant and in-depth presentation on the Church of England for her History class. Sadly, and in hindsight expectedly, the presentation was unappreciated by her classmates. Ignoring the stupidity of any high heels being able to muffle footsteps she started dragging her clearly deranged friend to Madam Pomfrey. She was surprisingly strong and Harry had to briefly wonder if she wasn't wearing something to buff her Strength before protesting loudly.

"Hermione, what are you doing? We are wasting time. I need to beat Neville's record. The lucky bastard somehow managed a sub 2 hours time."

"You are clearly in need of help so I'm taking you to the Hospital Wing." Came the curt reply.

"But Hermione, there is no point in going there. The glitch with the endless potions that increase speed was fixed two patches ago" But Hermione was relentless and Harry resigned himself to another lost run. Although... "Actually, please ignore everything I have said. I do need help"

***

Madam Pomfrey was surprised to see students needing medical attention before the first lesson of the day. Suspecting a late-night party she steeled her resolve, hid the Hangover Cures and prepared her loudest, most obnoxious voice. This proved unnecessary as the two students seemed sober. Well, miss Granger did at least. Mister Potter seemed to have more coffee than blood in his veins.

Without a word, Harry ran directly to the ingredients and potions cabinet while Hermione tried to explain the situation. Before she could Harry had already swallowed several poisons.

"What the hell is wrong with you?" Screeched Hermione. Before he fainted Harry tried to explain:

"If you're in a bad enough condition madam Pomfrey will get you to St. Mungos. From my POV it will just be a few seconds of loading screen." What Harry didn't have time to explain was that this strategy was not often used because there was a 50% chance of the game crashing. Hermione was pulling off her hair, while Pomfrey carted Harry off to St. Mungos.

***

Harry awoke in St. Mungos in a room with several very angry witches. He immediately jumped from the second-story window to save time and ignored the fall damage as he planned to stab Voldemort in the back and not fight him so he wouldn't need much health. Hopefully. During this time Voldemort was supposed to go about his routine torture of Muggles in a London suburb and Harry planned to take full advantage of the chaos. It wouldn't be as easy as smothering the bastard in his sleep, but Hermione had wasted too much time already and now he needed to take greater risks. "World record, here I come" Harry thought as he summoned a broom from... somewhere. Being Harry Potter had its perks and overpowered Summoning charms was one of them.

The End

***

BTW on a totally unrelated note did you know that 100% Ultra Nightmare speedruns on Doom Eternal are a thing? Someone did a sub 2 hours run recently. It's crazy and awesome. Search for Xiae on youtube if anyone is interested. (It's not me, obviously.)

Harry wondered what that meant. It didn't look good,

‘Loading Objects... done.'

‘Loading People... done.'

‘Loading Tasks... done.'

Harry had a sudden, sinking feeling in his stomach.

** What fics like /The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited/ can anyone recommend? I enjoyed it but was abandoned early on.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

** I would propably try to write it in a way that how a real HP game would work, but with added speedrun clitched and other things, like Harry wouldn't have acces to things that are not programmed into the game (like doing damage with other things than spells and maybe objects physics that he could pick up and move etc), but he could clitch himself through walls and outside of the playable area to skip ahead to next area. I watch lot of speedruns so I would propably incorporate things from what I know of them, then add HP series into it, made in into game from year 1-7 (one game), maybe something RPG like, doing crazy clitched through muggle areas, as you said, to get through the area quicker, but maybe the player has to avoid some certain triggers that make sure that you don't do magic in place you shouldn't.. Tbh I'm thinking of Dark Souls/SKyrim/Fallout/Doom/BOTW speedruns and how glitches work in them and then on top of that things like game has potion mini game that cannot be skipped, and there is some super neat strategy to get through that part fast...

But it might take a while to write it up, as I'm thinking that the speedrun would be little longer, because it would be longer game (open world RPG with big areas and all 7 years that you might not skip over like from year 1 to year 7, but could skip over events within a year), but I will credit you for the idea and I can tell you, if I ever write it up, since not sure when I have time to write it.

** I remember reading a oneshot where Harry cheeses a bunch of the plots by clipping into rooms he's not supposed to have access to yet (clipping into the Chamber of secrets early which triggers the death of the basilisk cutscene). Also, every time he finishes a year's story there's a loud voice echoing through Hogwarts that announces it. This oneshot was from Hermione's POV and she was super confused about Harry's behavior. I can't for the life of me remember what it was called. I found it from this subreddit a while back but couldn't find it again after a preliminary search. Hopefully this jogs someone's memory though.

** I did a fic in this kind a few months ago. Harry mostly use “glitches” to skip part of the “story” and go right away to the end. It does start taking itself more seriously toward the end however. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13709724/1/The-Glitch-in-the-Memories]])

Edit: Also Harry can't skip whole years in the story and the barrier between Platform 9 and 3/4 and Muggle King's Cross is the “checkpoint” between each year.

  Harry is struck by the Dark Lord Amethyst with the Memory Rewind Spell, a spell used to force someone to relive a certain memory in real time. Amethyst forced him to relive his seven Hogwarts years but Harry doesn't want to stay in a coma for that long so he decide to take inspiration from Video-Games Speedrunners and finish his memories as fast as possible.

** Not sure... I'm not a big fan of speed runs in general... I'm definitely a completionist who almost never actually completes the mainline quest because I'm too busy looking for "eastereggs" and seeing what other side quests i can do...

Think I would love a good "Gamer" fic that has him exploring all his options... maybe seeing different colored "!" and "?" above heads or piles of paper?... Suddenly, Harry sees a glowing question mark above Ron's rat 'Scabbers' head and wonders what it means.... Or, somehow, he gains access to customization options like "skins" or "limited edition upgrades".... can just imagine the silliness that could occur if he finds "Appearance sliders" and starts making changes.

** You should read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]]. It operates under the rules of a speedrun. Harry will fail in something and will die, then come back to it again with a different result. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. I'm rereading it now and it's very good.
