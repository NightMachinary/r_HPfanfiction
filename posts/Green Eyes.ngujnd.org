How common is Green Eyes in the Magical World? I know Lily and Harry have them and most likely at least one of his kids has Green eyes. I read a fic not too long ago that Hermione says only powerfully, people have green eyes. What is your opinion on it?


** I imagine green eyes, such as the ones Harry has, are exceedingly rare, just like in the real world.

**** It is estimated that only 2 percent of humans have green eyes. I believe /emerald/ are probably rarest of the rare.

***** I feel that is misleading, as light eye colour is far more common in northern European countries, along with 'brighter' hair colours, hence the 'blond hair, blue eyes' stereotype.

According to a quick Google, green eyes are actually the second most common colour in the UK after blue, although a particular shade of green may still stand out.

****** Well, I certainly did not know green was so common in the UK! You learn something new every day...

I googled green eyes, and 2 percent seems awfully low. Still, it makes sense, because around 16 percent of those who have green eyes are of either Celtic or Germanic descent.

Brown, bllue and green are the three most common eye colours, with between 55-79 percent of humans born with some variant of brown.

Turns out only around 1% have grey eyes, which make it the rarest eye colour. But like you said, certain shades may stand out.

******* And the only character with grey eyes, by my recollection, was Luna Lovegood.

** Or they could be envious. After all envy is called "the green-eyed monster".

**** I mean she's the envy of Petunia. We're told that much in the books. But I meant that they envy someone else. I don't know who Lily envies but Harry could envy Ron for his family or Hermione for her brains.

***** I don't think Harry is envy of Hermione brain because the hat says he be good in any house. I do believe that he's envy of everyone with a better family then his.

** I always assumed that it wasn't green being a rare color but that his particular shade of green was unusually bright/vivid/whatever. As has already been said, green isn't that rare for the UK.
