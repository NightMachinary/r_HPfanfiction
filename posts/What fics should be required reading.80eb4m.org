** None, because taste is subjective. If you required someone to read stories they don't like, you turn people away. Looking through this thread, I can't stand half of the recommendations and most people wouldn't like half of mine. Some people want to read romance, others action or thrillers. There's no universal fanfic where everyone agrees that it is good.

** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) and at this point probably linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild) in the humor category.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is kind of its own unique thing, and while long and not for everyone it's so influential I think it /does/ need to be mentioned here. If nothing else, the fact that it more or less has its /own/ fandoms (with tons of fanfanfics of it) speaks for itself.

Which you pick is up to you, but I think one ought to have read some White Squirrel (my pick would be linkffn(The Arithmancer)).

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

*** Why woud you suggest such a horrible story. It's way too gary stu, and has so many tropes it makes my head hurt. If it had about 99.9% less bashing, and didn't keep trying to show just how cool/smart/powerful Harry is it could have been such an interesting story, but sadly for such stories(and most of robst's work) it fell so flat it's in the negatives.

Thanks,

Warryn.

**** I suggested it as a joke, actually. I know this Reddit doesn't like robst as an author or his stories so I wanted to see how many down votes I could get. I'm disappointed that I only got -3. I wanted more. I haven't read Harry Crow. It's way too long for me and I have no interest in read stories longer than 500K words. However, whether people like it or not, robst is a very popular author on FanFiction.net. He must be doing something right.

*** Basically any story that is good enough (or bad/funny/whatever enough) that you think everyone should read it.
