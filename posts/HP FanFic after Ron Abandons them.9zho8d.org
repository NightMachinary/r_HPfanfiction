** Abandon seems to be the wrong word when Ron tried to return immediately... He left after Harry yelled at him to leave, and then tried to find them again afterwards, he did not abandon them.

*** Ehh, I would say the dividing line is more 'rapid tent sex / instant comfort relationship' vs not.

Course 99% of the first type of fic start at the abandoning and 99% of those are h/hr.

**** There are a few (bad) ones where Hermione leaves as well and then Harry gets a Harem. I remember one where Harry did some dark ritual which regrew the hymen of a few women so that he could break it. It even included Tonks, who could do that whenever she wanted to by simply thinking about it.

  Something had happened in that tent. Something had happened to Harry. He wasn't sure why or how, but he longed for those days when it was just him and Hermione against the world. Somewhere along the lines Harry had done something he had never intended to do. Harry had fallen irrevocably in love with his best friend. Takes place directly after DH. Harry/Hermione
