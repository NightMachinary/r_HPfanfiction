Of course, it also gives me the mental image of harry's patronus being locutus of borg.


** Whyever would there be a different incantation? /Expecto Patronum/ creates a corporeal patronus and -- although I'm not sure canon states this explicitly, it's at least strongly implied -- they can be induced to send messages.

Unless you're talking about /conversational/ patroni (completely non-canon) then, hm, what about /expecto gibberi patronum/?

*** It always seemed weird that they cpuld deliver messages, to me. They were introduced as an anti-dementor spell.

*** Implication isn't confirmation, since we don't see the standard spell cast to send the speech variant it is possible it requires a different incantation. But i do love the idea of someone with a gibbon patronus with the gift of gab.

** I would just assume that since it was a Charm you got to change the purpose of the spell through visualisation. I mean, we see with Incendio and Aquamenti that spells can come out differently with the same incantation, so it's not too hard to imagine you being capable of making your Patronus a messenger if you just think it hard enough before the spell.

*** Now that i think about it, expecto means 'I expect a' allegedly while 'patronum' is protector. Which means the more likely variant would be expecto locutus. Imagine harry's having just seen that episode in reruns before remus begins tesching him the spell and variant. His patronus appears before hermione as she's sitting with her parents at the dining table and it says "I am Locutus - of Borg. Resistance - is futile. Your life, as it has been - is over. From this time forward, you will service - us" then some sort of message. her dad dies laughing as hermione explains harry's idiot sense of humor.

Wouldn't this just create a different spell in general? Modifications for spells usually rely upon on the base incantation with something extra added, or just changing the spell in your head but not your wording. From what we see in canon at least.

***** Perhaps but it could still use the same mechanics(the spirit animal form) but not be a protector/incapable of driving off a patronus in the locutus form.

** In my fic, the method of producing a messenger or "talking" patronus starts out the same as a normal corporeal patronus (happy memory and /expecto patronum/), then to morph the guardian into a messenger, the caster uses the incantation /expecto nuntium/, which is rough Latin for "I expect news" ......or something like that, I'm not a Latin scholar or anything

** I've never really thought about it having a different spell. My head cannon (boom!) was having patroni be able to do all sorts of things like intercept spells and carry messages and whatnot.

White Squirrel's Lady Archimedes has the messenger variant as 'Expecto Nuntium' in chapter 51, though.

** Expecto Patronum. I like the idea that spells can be repurposed or altered if you have the knowledge and skill to do so. Magic should be flexible.
