:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello, I'm looking for a fic I read a few weeks ago. I'm pretty sure it mainly focused on Hermione being in a house other than Gryffindor. She and Harry were friends and Hermione was also friendly with Filch because of their cats who have kittens together. I think she also had a small snake she could talk to as well.

Thanks in advance!


** Are you thinking of linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll) ? both Harry and Hermione are sorted into Slytherin, Hermione has an exceedingly ugly cat, who does indeed have kittens with Mrs Norris, Hermione herself is a snake animagus. Hermione exhibits a lot of sociopathic traits and they end up in a threeway relationship with Diary!Tom Riddle.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
