** Yes, yes, yes! You put into words these ideas that I've had for years, but never knew how to actually verbalized. I appreciate that and agree with what you said 100%.

** Wouldn't judging a whole fandom comprised of a million individuals because of a subset that actually bashes other characters qualify you to have the emotional range of an atom? Sorry, a bit mean.

You probably needed to rant and now you have done so. As I usually recommend, take a deep breath and maybe edit your post to put across your point in a nicer manner. Thanks.

** What is this supposed to accomplish other than making you look like a prick?

You went to tumblr and got triggered and then came here to tell everyone they just don't get "it" like you, in your infinite "intelligence" do.

Congratulations, I'm sure your wall of text will convince everyone they were just too dense to write nuance into their fics and that they have now seen the light

** You're right, but it's human nature to want to see things in black and white. Simplicity is comforting and bashing is cathartic - that's why people do it and why a lot of people online treat the whole world that way. It always disappoints me when it comes from good writers (and intelligent people in general) though.

*** I'd probably be way more scared if the world was actually as black and white.
