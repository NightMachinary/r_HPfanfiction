As the title says Eating different types of food affects a wizard in certain ways. Lemon drops give a short term boost in magical power Sugar is what make wizard illogical, since hermione eats very less sugar, she is so intelligent. Meat is what gives wizards startergising skills like ron Mcgonnagal's biscuits are what make a wizard proficient in transfiguration Cooked sherry is what gives wizard minor seeing abilities And so on


** ... Now I'm imagining Voldemort sending his DE all around the Isles thrice a day to find fresh food of all varieties known, obscure and unknown plus forcing them to learn cooking so they can make enormous feasts for him at all meals -problem is, the guy has a sweet-tooth a mile wide and absolutely no self-control, so half of all he eats has sugar in it and considering that he tends to eat his weight in food daily...

By the time the Battle of Hogwarts rolls around /Voldemort/ also needs to be rolled around, needless to say his dueling skills aren't up to its old standards anymore, neither is his sanity.
