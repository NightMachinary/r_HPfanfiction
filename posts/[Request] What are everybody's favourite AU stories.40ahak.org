#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

My favorite Harry Potter non-crossover AU would be the Unbroken series. Link for the prequel: linkffn(4881348)

My favorite crossover would probably be Through the Eyes of Minerva's Owl linkao3(940292) Merlin in HPverse

#+begin_quote
  When Albion calls Merlin, he returns to puzzle out why. Meanwhile, two years of peace are shattered when Harry Potter is attacked and left badly beaten, the Elder Wand stolen from his grasp. Then a sword appears in front of Buckingham Palace and a dragon escapes from Wales. As the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix scramble for answers, Merlin gathers his allies (both old, new and unexpected) as he prepares to greet Albion's Darkest Hour. Morgana declares war in a single, devastating blow that leaves England's wizards stunned beyond words, making it clear that the time of the Once and Future King is upon them... if only they knew where he was. Will wisdom learnt through the eyes of Minerva's owl be enough to prevent disaster? Mostly cannon-compliant for both series.

  #+begin_example
      Before I get to the story, I'd like to send out huge thanks to LittleBouce for betaing and britpicking this story for me\! And for her cheerleading and help along the way, not to mention the endless supply of patience with my inability to spell Kingsley Shacklebolt's name right\. Also thanks to theGlaistig for betaing and catching everything the two of us missed\. And, of course to the\_muppet on LJ for organizing this year's Big Bang\. It's my first Big Bang and it's been tons of fun and quite the learning experience for me as a writer \(most notably, that I do really well with a deadline \- who knew?\)\.Make sure you check out the fanvid made by xcuri0sity for this story  on Tumblr

** This was the very 1st AU fics that I ever came across when I first started reading fanfiction back in 2009. And to this day, it still remains one of the greatest fanfics that I've ever read. It is currently being redone, and posted up on the HPFF site now. But I started out reading/reviewing this story years ago when it was posted up elsewhere, and then over time I actually became pretty close friends with the author. He is such an amazing and passionate writer, and this story definitely deserves WAY more love & attention than what it is getting on HPFF right now... So please read and show this wonderful author some much-needed love!! <3

  While Luna simply smiled and nodded, Harry couldn't seem to wipe the expression of shock and disbelief from his face. Finally, he spoke. "And...if this plan goes wrong, and we all end up dead?" Michael rubbed the back of his neck. "Well, there's worse things you can be in life than a cautionary tale."
