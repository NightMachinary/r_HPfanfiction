Kind of funny that a lot of dark or lord Harry fanfiction always change Harry's name to Hadrian. Reminds me of Voldemort that thought himself to good for a common name like Tom. The authors of these fanfiction have the same way of thinking, harry is subconcious i think not a good enough name for them.


** The worst part is they don't even change it to Henry, a much more likely name for Harry to be short for. Henry's certainly an aristocratic enough name, Prince Harry's birth name is Henry.

** Lets not forget the ever popular Harold in those same genres, and some of the more cliche Indie! Harry fics. I always got the impression that they thought Harry wasn't regal or aristocratic enough, and thus too plebian for Lord Slytherin-Hufflpuff-Black-Potter-Minmax Wank Fantasy. I found it kind of cringey and eye rolling myself.

**** I've read some /really/ terrible Indie! Harry, Lord! Harry, and Super! Harry fics where it seems like the author gets off on how powerful he can make Harry. The level of power, number of titles, the amount of money, and the superior attitude in those fics is obscene. It really does seem like the author gets his or her jollies from stupidly and ludicrously overpowered they can make Harry.

** Henry would imo be a better fit then Hadrian, the Dark Lord Harry fiction are a sort of guilty pleasure for me, but that's one thing that irks me, the name Hadrian, just doesn't fit Harry at all.

** It's also a sign that the author isn't British. Because if you name your kid Hadrian in this country (rather than the native form Adrian, which doesn't take Harry as a diminutive /at all/) the first reaction you're going to get is "You named your baby after the */Wall?/*"

** There's a /lot/ of parallels you can draw between Death Eater/blood purist ideology and the usual themes you find in indy!Harry fics.

I don't want to sound like I'm moralizing here - it's never wrong to enjoy stuff in fiction, and exploring alternative themes is one of those things that fanfic is great for!

But there's just /so much/. Noble and Most Ancient Houses, "Lord Hadrian Potter-Black", family grimoires and secret House magic, powerful ancestry like Merlin or the Hogwarts founders, magical cores so that some wizards are Just Better than others, manipulative!Dumbles and the Weasels stealing from all the secret family vaults Harry knew nothing about, magic that's "classified as Dark" but really just misunderstood, the barbaric noble-savage Goblin Nation that welcomes Harry as one of their own after he remembers Griphook's name or something...

Any of these elements can be done well, but taken together in the usual way, they paint a /very/ Death Eater-sympathetic view of the wizarding world. It'd be cool to see a fic where some in-universe fiction books are written this way, the author is one of those Death Eaters who claimed Imperius, and Harry has to deal with the misconceptions, getting more and more exasperated at the ridiculous propaganda. (I think White Squirrel had one that would have been like that, but it never got more than a chapter in)

Nothing subconscious about it here. I consciously don't like the name Harry at all... not that Hadrian is an improvement or anything.

** TBH I think Hadrian is a really good name. I agree I see it a lot though. I'm working on my own fic and I'm trying to set it up to avoid that reasoning specifically and offer a logical alternative as to why Tom did it.

** Henry Potter does sound much better if you execute it well, but otherwise keep Harry. I kind of understand it can sound awkward, if a 37 famous guy with a couple lordships to his name, Harry sounds too plain.

*** That doesn't matter - yes, the name origins are different, but that's besides the point. For instance, when I look it up, the most suggested nickname for Hadrian is Harry.

Henry, while used by the nobility, doesn't invoke the same sense as Hadrian in terms of showing that Harry would be from a different class. It's kinda like Louis vs Charles in the French monarchy - both very common over the centuries, but if I were to want to emphasize a character as being derived from said royal line I'd choose Louis as a hidden name, feeling more aristocratic/associated with it.

In addition, a Roman name can carry connotations in magic as well - I've seen a lot of fics saying that the Romans introduced the wands to Britain, for instance. If power fantasying Harry, I can see how connecting him to Roman aristocracy could be a good way of emphasizing his power and whatnot.

In any case, I'm not a fan of any fics where he immediately changes the way he refers to himself to that name. Even if he had a secret 'real' name, he should still think of himself as Harry.
