** Here is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1763262/1/Program-12][Program 12]], joining us all the way from the distant past of 2004. It's one of those rare fics from when I first started reading fanfiction that I still remember by name.

*** This one is very good- I read it before hunger games came out, and it actually encouraged to buy Battle Royale (which I still haven't read...). Dark, but realistic.

**** Well you might as well skip BR now. No point in reading both of these unless you're looking for a happier ending.

*** It's pretty good, although I think I would have preferred something that had some magic as that could have been any set of characters really.

**** Yeah this was my problem with it. Also it's exactly like BR.

*** Just finished this story. It bothers me. Maybe I haven't read BR in so long that I'm glossing over the differences, but aside from the primary divergence, this is /exactly/ like Battle Royale as I remember it. Might as well have just taken the text from that and replaced the names. Personalities, injuries, deaths, locations, weapons are all the same. I know you're not the author, but seriously: what was the point of writing this at all? Ugh.

**** Yeah that really bothered me too, other than vague references to Voldemort and the epilogue there's nothing new about it...

*** This is actually what inspired this post, I did like it but the lack of magic and how closely it follows BR turned me off a bit.
