Whether it's reading it or writing it, which era is your favorite? 1920s America with Newt & co? Marauder's era with moony, wormtail, padfoot & prongs? Era with the golden trio of Harry Ron & Hermione? Or Next generation with Albus and the kids?

**** I don't know what you have read before, but here are my favorite post Hogwarts fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot after Voldemort's fall.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Extreme AU. Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore after Halloween 1981, but Dumbledore would have his revenge almost 20 years later.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Extreme AU, even in Muggle world as nuclear weapons were not developed. In magical world, James and Lily survived Halloween 1981 and fled Magical Britain, so Harry never went to Hogwarts. Most of the story took place after 2008, and when Statute of Secrecy fell in 2009, chaos ensued...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): It's actually part of a big 80+ fic postwar series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], but works perfectly as a standalone story. It's also fully canon-compliant, and shows Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Harry is the Frank Underwood of Magical Britain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Things went very badly for Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna, until they arrived in an alternate dimension by accident. Very emotional story.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Personally I really enjoy the ancient era. Exploring the map, finding ruins, trying to found a pantheon, and fighting off barbarians while they are still threatening to me are some of the most fun points in the game. That said, once you advance a few eras and get your UU and/or UB you can really expand and start to shape your civ the way you want. I personally like to rush theology so I can get Borobudur and spread my religion across the land (the Celts are my fav Civ).

I will also say that getting a butt load of tanks/panzers are racing across the landscape, crushing all beneath your heel and and razing the cities of your foes to the ground is amazing, especially if you go autocracy and select Clausewitz legacy.

So I guess it's more the midgame I find boring. Trying to get enough votes to push through the policies that will help you, teching up while not exposing yourself to AI invasion is pretty boring when it lasts 200ish turns.

** I think you can write an interesting story set in any time period (and lots of people have done), but in terms of canon, as Sirius is my favourite character there is a fairly narrow period between PoA and OotP to explore. But since canon tells us next to nothing about what Sirius was doing when he wasn't with Harry (which was most of the time), it is a very rich vein to explore. Otherwise, I think anything post-canon has lots of potential and I have discovered to my surprise that I quite like adult Harry and adult Draco.
