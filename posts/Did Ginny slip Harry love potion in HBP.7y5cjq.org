** This all has been discussed to death, but quick recap:

- If you chose to interpret it that way, go ahead, I can't stop you

There are easy other explainations:

- Which crushing 15yo girl wouldn't be at least a bit intrigued by love-potions, if only for protection or a daydream?
- Amonortia smells like Ginny because Harry already likes her. JKR also said that Hermione was about to (more or less) say she smells Ron, before she stopped herself.
- Teenage love and jealousy can manifest in many different ways, when I read it "chest monster" was an apt description for my own feelings when I saw my crush going with someone else.

None of these are far-fetched or unlogical, and definitely not harder to justify than the other way.

However, some interpret it differently, but I feel like it doesn't fit in any narrative that Rowling would create.

** No. On several levels, this does not make sense: logically, thematically, character-wise and plot-wise. Here are some reasons why not which have not been as of yet mentioned:

• It's against Ginny's personality to do that, especially considering that Ginny knows how it feels to be under control through evil influences, with her experiences with Tom Riddle in /Chamber of Secrets/. Why would she want the one she loves to be controlled, even by her?

• Why was Harry still so much in love with Ginny in /Deathly Hallows/, when they hadn't met for months, such as when he spends hours looking at her dot on the Marauder's Map? Was Ron or Hermione in on the plot? Ron was gone due to the Horcrux, Hermione was crying her eyes out because he was missing. And it wouldn't be in their personality to do this either.

• Ginny was very sceptical of whether Weasley's Wizard Wheezes's love potions were working in /Half-Blood Prince/. Why would she use one if she didn't think they worked?

• It goes against JKR's message about the series and about love in particular. In /Half-Blood Prince/, she very clearly distanced the Merope/Tom (showing a fake relationship that was conditioned by love potion) from Harry/Ginny (showing a relationship with true feelings). Why would JKR promote a relationship, calling them soulmates repeatedly, if it was fake from the start?

** Despite what people on here seem to think, it is possible for 15 year olds to magically start liking someone out of the blue. That's kind of what 15 year olds, and most other teenagers, do. So it really isn't that weird for Harry to like Ginny without there being a three book preamble to their relationship.

And let's be honest, if any of us had access to actual love potions, we would all totally be fantasizing about using them. I for one would be concocting ways to get Tom Hardy or Idris Elba to take some.

He is a big guy, so make sure to use extra.

** 1) /Something flowery he might have smelled at the Burrow/. There is the proof that the love potion does smell like Ginny. Love potions smell like your heart's desire. The potion in Weasley's Wizarding Weezes smells flowery to Harry already.

So why is it that you are saying that Ginny smells like love potion, when in Slughorn's class, Harry smells something flowery.

2) JKR was exaggerating teenage hormones. That was not a love potion taking effect.

Edit: [[/u/fflai]] answered better, just pay attention to him.

**** In fairness the first account was making nasty posts about a member of our community, if I remember rightly.

** Wow, I am so tired of people downvoting premises they disagree with. Argue against it, but don't just downvote posts to oblivion unless they're obviously trolling or spam.

The point of that smell being in Amortentia is that it /would/ smell like Ginny, and he hasn't realised it until that moment. It smells like other things, not itself. So it's actually canon support for his love being real rather than potion induced.

/Otherwise/, the premise is plausible and your examples do indeed support it. Though they also support an awakening to sexual interest and love as puberty hits. Crushes during puberty are often crazy-strong in any case.

I've obviously ended up siding with it being actual love after an excellent essay I can't find that details why Harry/Ginny is supported all the way from Book One in canon, through his noticing her over others, to shared glances of understanding, to the words used to describe her from Harry's PoV, compared to words used to describe other witches.

However, I won't condemn anyone who decides that the entire thing was cemented with potion later on. Just not with that particular example as support.
