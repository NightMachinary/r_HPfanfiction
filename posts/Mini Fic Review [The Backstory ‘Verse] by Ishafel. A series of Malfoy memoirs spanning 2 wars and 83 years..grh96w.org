Short fic recommendation today, so short form review. Relatively speaking.

The Backstory ‘Verse is a compilation of 18 short stories featuring the complicated history of the Malfoy family over the course of nearly a century. It clocks in at only 32k words altogether, so it can be read and digested in short order, and it is written in present tense. Trigger warnings in the story (not the review) for rape and mentions of childhood sexual abuse -- I will not be linking directly to the fic for this reason.

It's canon compliant, a feature which I tend to love about fanfiction. Since joining reddit I've read many more AUs than I normally would have due to what gets recommended around here, but my default used to be seeking out stories which found a way to be told around the canon rather than overwriting it. Part of that was probably because when you make an effort not to break the canon, you generally have to know it very well, and I feel that characterisation tends to be done better in those types of stories, which makes me feel more like I'm still immersed in the Potterverse.

The Backstory ‘Verse maintains its characterisation in places where it's required, but the central figure woven throughout each of the stories is one we don't see in canon; Draco's grandfather Abraxas Malfoy. As the only thing we know about Abraxas is that he is dead by Draco's 6th year and that his name carries weight in high social circles, there is a lot of room for interpretation of his personality. Here, he is an extremely cold man, who once in his slightly passionate youth fought alongside Grindelwald in Europe. We begin here and move slowly through his first marriage and first two children, all of whom he outlives, eventually remarrying and raising a third son -- one Lucius Malfoy.

The stories give a deeply intimate look into the minds of the POV characters, but all of them are heavily jaded by the world they grew up in, so it feels a little detached at the same time. It's rather like watching a documentary on medieval royal scandals in some places, for brutal, passionless murder and sexual indiscretions are everyday occurrences. Slytherins seem to be universally bisexual and sexually opportunistic, which again brings to mind an ostentatious aristocracy caught up in mindless debauchery, but also sometimes just seems like a valid way to interpret Slytherin house. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Most of the stories were written across 2010, some in 2009 and one in 2013, but they were not written in chronological order, and sometimes this lets the larger picture down somewhat. They are snippets taken to describe something which happened during a particular year, but when you put the whole timeline together it doesn't quite add up. Abraxas' age is the biggest one for me. He seems to be an adult fighting alongside Gellert Grindelwald in 1913, but is 80 years old in 1982, so....he was 11 years old in the first story? Severus Snape is also apparently the Dark Lord's right-hand man in 1974, when he would have been only 14/15 years old. It bothers me a little because the stories are structured as a sort of intimate history lesson. The dates are important, so it frustrates me when they don't match up.

However, there is poignancy to the narratives, which holds up well in spite of the technical issues. Lucius Malfoy reads very true to the Lucius we know in the canon. He is not braver or kinder for us seeing inside his head, but not entirely unsympathetic either. Like Draco he is a product of his environment, but a much more brutal version of it than Draco's. By contrast to Abraxas he looks like a fantastic father actually. The stories all add great texture to the canon Slytherins, and I like that Abraxas Malfoy looms as this bleak and undeniable force pulling all the little stories together like a planet pulling its moons into orbit.

All in all an interesting read and something easy to slot in as a headcanon. I'd give it a 6.5
