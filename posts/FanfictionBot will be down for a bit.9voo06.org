Looks like the bot got banned from fanfiction.net. They seem to think our bot is some sort of robot. Ridiculous, right!?

It seems to be an IP ban of some sort. It'll take me some time to reprovision the IP. If I had infinite time, I would make it so the bot uses a VPN/proxy and rotated through using all of the VPN/proxy servers throughout the day, but I don't have infinite time. (Feel free to add something like that/submit a PR!)


** Did you try to get in contact with them to maybe approve the bot? I'd be better than to go behind there backs and use VPNs. There's nothing harmful about the bot.

  Email received from ffnet support, 2013-10-22 04:34 UTC: Steve, Unfortunately we currently do not allow any exemptions in the site policy The policy applies to everyone even if there is some value added service provided by the automated bots. If our policy changes or if a formal API is released, we will let you know. Regards, James Please help us spread the word. James

*** 100% This. Not sure how responsive the admins over there will be, however.

Another simpler workaround could be to make it serverless? I am not sure how many requests it actually handles every day and whether it would be costlier or cheaper?

*** /Probably/ it's just some software on the ffn servers that detected the bot as a bot and then banned the IP address of the bot from accessing the ffn website , and it will be sorted out soon.

** Hey now, it seems that the bot's queries for description and stats are being blocked, but the downloading site it uses, ff2ebook, is still working fine. What does ff2ebook do differently from our ffnbot when it can download a whole story without being blocked while ffnbot gets banned from fetching this comparatively small amount of data?

** I know that you've been inundated with messages already, but if you have $5/m to spare, you could create a DigitalOcean account and simply host the bot from there. If you ever get IP banned again, just make another droplet, delete the old one, and presto - new IP address.

You can even save the image of the server directly after installation of the necessary dependencies for the bot so that the process doesn't demand you to constantly be setting up the new machine(s).

If $5/m just doesn't work in your budget (hey, man, shit happens), you could probably pull in /at least/ that much with some kind of Patreon page for it which would cover the monthly costs and, maybe, even a cup of coffee every so often.

** Hardly surprising. Weren't they doing some kind of security audit because of the recent issues? They were probably paying much more attention to unusual behaviour...

You should try to get in contact with them in order to get the bot approved. I'm quite sure that they are totally in favor of something like this that almost exclusively promotes their website.

Using the bot removes ad-revenue while still taking up bandwidth. I doubt they'll allow it, to be honest.
