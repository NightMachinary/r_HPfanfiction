**** Well, the author invited people to write one and I know at least four different people actually did start on it, plus me (mine is not up). Then she said that she would write one. She also writes Naruto and she's started 2 other Harry Potter stories since then, and she got a lot of flak for the awesomely abrupt ending and her slight meltdown in the author's notes.

So I'd say she's having more fun with ongoing stories and a sequel is not a priority but she's definitely still writing and she may get to it someday?
