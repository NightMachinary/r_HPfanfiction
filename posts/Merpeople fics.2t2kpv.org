** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time to Spare]] has a university run by Merpeople, if I remember correctly. Somewhere in the second half of the fic, I'd guess.

** The first in Shezza's Denarian trilogy involves merpeople in the second task, much more than normal fanfiction/canon.

It's a bit of a read to get there, though - but it's worth it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][*Harry Potter and the Denarian Renegade*]] - /By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power./

 

/Magicks of the Arcane/ has Harry interacting with merpeople for more than canon.

That said, merpeople interaction is very difficult to find, and both of those fics only have a chapter or two with them. Still more than canon, and still enough to be recognized as a semi-important plot event in both fics, but nothing that spans the entirety of the book series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/9/Magics-of-the-Arcane][*Magicks of the Arcane*]] - /Sometimes, all it takes for a man to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Harry isn't satisfied with his life, and the Goblet of Fire gives him the perfect excuse to change it./

** I read this one; [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327648][When a Siren Calls]] a while ago. It's based in the marauders time period an it's about this girl who's father is a merman and there is a merperson civilisation in this story if that's what you're looking for. I think it was a good read.
