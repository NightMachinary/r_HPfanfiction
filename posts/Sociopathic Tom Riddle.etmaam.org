Not looking for redemption, not opposed to it either. I want to see a young Tom Riddle who is observant and cold, but acts as though he's not for manipulative purposes. Basically close to canon from what I remember.


** AO3 Deal with the Devil by FreyaFallen. Canon-compliant and Tom-focused.

Also: Dangerous Professions by Darklordriddle

Blood is Thicker, AbsintheDreams

Birds of a Feather, Babylonsheep...

AO3 just errored out on me, but I'm sure there are tons more.
