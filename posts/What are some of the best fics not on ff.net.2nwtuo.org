My favorites are actually on Mugglenet, from MagEd/monroe'slittle.

She has a few fics on FF.net, but most of them are [[http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Ffanfiction.mugglenet.com%2Fviewuser.php%3Fuid%3D46901&ei=3PF7VMjXE6yZsQSv3oLIDw&usg=AFQjCNE12fsc6QuzHLVxdQ2GbuNBXL5Hlw&bvm=bv.80642063,d.cWc][here.]]

There's are two different multi-chapter J/L fics with actual plots, and some excellent one-shots.


** [[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]: "Go teach your children, eat your candy, preen your bird and bury me. But we were brilliant together, Albus, and not even you can change history."

Also if you want to read some pretty decent powerful!Harry stuff, anything by Jeconais on [[http://www.fanficauthors.net][www.fanficauthors.net]] is worth the read, Especially [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] which is Harry/Gabrielle and [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/][White Knight, Grey Queen]] which is Harry/Pansy.

*** 35 owls was very well done

edit: the "answer me, do you understand what you do to people" was especially poetic in light of harry's struggles in dh

*** +hope, on the other hand, uses the phrase "cro magnum" in the first chapter. i'm not optimistic.+

edit: worth coming back and mentioning that hope was hard to put down. good characterizations. author thought ahead and made a cohesive narrative.

*** Hope is one of those stories that people seem to love or hate. I'm in the latter category. 8 years ago, it was fresh and the writing was decent. These days? It's cliched, the writing is stilted at best, and anyone who uses the phrase

  “When Gabrielle realised that she had been saved by ‘Arry, she immediately decided that ‘e waz ‘er mate, and let herself be mated to ‘im.”

***** Was too silly for me at chapter two, when Harry can spontaneously sense an "assassin ring", and uses the chance to show how uber awesome he is.
