** I just read that one and now the name fails to come to me... The main thing I remember about it was that Dumbledore was acting crazy an that the animate chicken/food fight was a yearly thing. I believe it was some sort of dark lord Harry? I'll go look for it and will update if I find it.

EDIT: The one I remember was a Harry Potter + Naruto crossover. Hopefully, this is it. linkffn(11634921)
