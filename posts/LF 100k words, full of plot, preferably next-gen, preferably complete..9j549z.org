I'm looking for long, well-written fics with exciting plots, something along the lines of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][the Tea Time series]] by frombluetored or the James Potter series by Lippert. I like: humour, good characterisation, lots of references to canon; and I dislike: angst, excessively dark/violent fics, excessive character bashing, non-magical AUs, student/teacher relationships.

I also really enjoyed Fernwithy's Shifts verse - have reread it multiple times - so I would be glad to read anything set in the same time as the books, as long as they don't interfere with canon.

Thank you!


** If you want long-running (but not CC compliant) fics with next generation, you can try the Albus Potter series.

Here is the first in the series of seven books linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation).

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
