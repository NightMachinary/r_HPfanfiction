Forgive me if it's already been asked here before. Please redirect me if there's another thread about this somewhere.

Hypothetically, what would have happened if Harry got a hold of Riddle's diary and poured his heart out to it?

Would it be able to possess him like it did Ginny? Or will Lily's protection make that impossible? But Lily's protection didn't save him from a part of Voldemort's soul latching onto him did it?

Thoughts?


** Only God knows but logically given enough time, both the dairy and scar would merge and take over Harry. This new Harrymort would then attract and absorb the corporeal Voldemort that flew away at the end of the first book.

I'd say given how the dairy and the scar were unaffected by whatever Lily Potter did, it is fair to assume that protection only fights against physically present Voldemort. Horcruxes are high-level meta things, aren't they?

But the soul should feel remorse to merge together again, shouldn't it? And that's highly unlikely of Voldemort.

I think this is true. It protected him from physical attack but that's it.

That's a good point you make. But also consider this. Why would Voldemort spread his Horcruxes if he was so sure that no one will find them or get past his defenses? I'm thinking that these soul shards are volatile and have a tendency to merge together into one Horcrux. [Now he might have to feel remorse to have them merge into his main self. But this is all our speculation] Yes, I know the other reason is to have multiple redundancies in case one fails... but Tom Riddle has always been arrogant.

** Quite possibly he would have been posessed. Interesting would be if young Riddle would recognize the horcrux within Harry.

*** That's what I thought too. But when I think of that scene in OotP and how Voldemort couldn't possess him because Harry was so full of love, it stumps me.

Wasn't Ginny a good person too? And she could be possessed inspite of it. Why is Harry's scenario so different?

**** Good point. But he was strongly affected by Sirius' death at the time. So that too might be a factor. Generally I'll try not to speak badly of Ginny, but I don't think she is nearly as strong as Harry is.

That is considered to be a plot hole because by all logic, the shard should have been BBQed.

*** well it kind of was. The result he is some sort of mangled baby like thing. I think without the protection the horcrux would have been far stronger and possibly even taken over.

***** I think they're talking about the shard in the scar. That was a weird baby thing.

Not really a plot hole. It's perfectly consistent with the rest of canon.

Harry touches many horcruxes without anything happening.

Harry's protection in PS burns Voldemort's physical shell, it does not attack the spirit of Voldemort itself.

Voldemort makes himself immune from the blood protection by placing a protective power into his blood, a physical, bodily protection.

In short, the blood protection manifests itself against:

A) Only Voldemort himself, not his horcruxes, and

B) Only Voldemort's physical shell, not his spirit.
