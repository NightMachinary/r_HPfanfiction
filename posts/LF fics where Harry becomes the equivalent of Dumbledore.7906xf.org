  Time-turners and age potions shouldn't be mixed, Harry accidentally finds out. His luck holds steady, though, and he finds both love and pain in the strangest of times.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

** I've never read a good fic with this premise. They all tend to either over-exaggerate his age and power, or start (at least) as cringe worthy stories with a third grade writing level. All the ones I've read also send him back in time to fix something-or-other, and I think that defeats the purpose of the old and wise premise.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
