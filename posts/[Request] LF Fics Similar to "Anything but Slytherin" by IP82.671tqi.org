I haven't been able to find anything in the same vein, really. I'm not really looking for bad "Good Guys" and good Voldemort/Death Eaters, but an AU where the war led to the Good Guys becoming cruel/evil themselves like in this fic. Preferably a dead or otherwise displaced from power Dumbledore, as I couldn't plausibly imagine him condoning this, [[/spoiler][which was one of the few things I disliked about this story]]. I don't like bashing at all, although if characters are portrayed with different, perhaps unlikable, personalities than in canon (such as Ron being Malfoy-esque), that's cool.

Ideally, I'd like to read a story that is essentially just a novel-length continuation of IP82's story, but anything similar would be awesome. Thanks!

Also, if anyone here hasn't read it yet, I'd definitely recommend it; it's a fairly short oneshot and pretty fantastic. linkffn(4269983)


** linkffn(Dark Marauder by BajaB) sounds like what you're looking for.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I am considering writing something like this. Basically Harry is evil, but ostensibly good. When I say that, I don't mean lovable broken antihero that Dark!Harry fics seem to adore, I am going for full on Robespierre, executions and all. Neville is a Dark wizard but still good. Harry is protagonist, Neville is antagonist, and they both go back in time and fuck up the timeline fighting each other.

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

** I just read it and, on top of the Dumbledore thing that you mentioned, *what about the damned hat*. Nobody's thinking while they're under the hat "don't let them take my magic" or "they'll bind my magic if you put me in Slytherin"? I suppose in the format of the five minute thriller it can't be helped, but I need this explained before I can get the chills everyone else seems to get.

*** Yeah I thought of that too. I guess it could be reasoned away that either they aren't worried because they know they won't be in Slytherin, they're panicking and the Hat thinks it's just because of normal social stigma, or the Hat makes it's decision quickly enough that there isn't time to find out, like with Malfoy.

But it is a bit of a plot hole.

**** A reasonable explanation, but I still think that surely, in the years they've been carrying on like this, one of the 3 or 4 hundred kids that have been sorted has mentioned something to the hat. Also I've just realized that it's never stated in the story that Dumbledore condones what happens it's just "out of his hands". That makes me wonder if he has much influence at all in this alternate universe.

***** For sure, the chances are pretty high. A longer fic exploring the same idea would have to somehow address the Hat.

As for Dumbledore, I just couldn't imagine him losing so much influence and still being headmaster. Also, McGonagall and the rest of the Order of the Phoenix would still listen to him unless he were dead and a martyr or somehow so thoroughly disgraced that they were no longer loyal to him.
