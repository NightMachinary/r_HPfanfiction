Whether it's a one-shot or a full story, I'll read it as long as they recover (I don't expect them to be jump up and immediately continue their career as aurors, but you know what I mean). I felt that they and Neville deserved better :')

** There's an AU where Harry and Neville's fates are swapped. Harry obsesses over healing Lily and James. Would you be interested in a story like that? It's long, but healing the "mentally demolished parents" characters is the protagonist's main goal.

I know it's not exactly what you're asking me for, but it's very close, and a really good fanfiction. Even if you don't want it, I'll link it for anyone else who might be interested in a realistic Powerful!Harry AU.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

The most common way is to use the number of a ffnet story. For example, the one you linked, after the /s/ is 12813755. Since its from ffnet you'd choose linkFFN. So it would be linkffn(12813755)

The easier way is just to put the title in and hope but with the millions of fanfiction stories written some titles have been used across multiple fandoms, I think ties that bind I've seen about seven of.
