Looking for a fanfic that had two self inserts. One was a ravenclaw that noticed harry potter was acting like he was in a bad fanfic (11 yo politics, wandless magic being all about intent, acting and dressing as a pureblood).

  A collection of plot-bunnies from various fandoms that I'm mostly putting here for my own reference, but figured maybe one or two might get an intrigue out of a person. If someone happens to see one they want to adopt, though, feel free to ask me about it. Some of them I plan to continue, but most of them are just ideas that aren't all that fleshed out yet.Any crossovers will be marked as such in the chapter titles.Fair warning, some of these cut off in weird places, because they aren't at a realistic stopping point yet.Tags and fandoms will be updated as works are posted.

*** Chapter 5, for reference. It really is a delight to read, although I think it's a shame Hyliian never continued it.

  Enid Prewett dreamed of becoming an animagus and studying under the greatest Transfiguration Master of her time, Minerva McGonagall. It Would Happen.Eleanor Flint was here to learn magic, play Quidditch, and eat all the food. She was also absolutely, definitely, totally, a proper Pureblood Lady. Finally having reached the auspicious age of eleven, armed with (somewhat spotty) knowledge and additional life experience (less useful than you might think), these two witches were finally going to Hogwarts. With no idea that the other actually existed.Nothing could possibly go wrong.
