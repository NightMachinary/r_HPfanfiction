So this question suddenly popped into my head. How come people don't use the glamour charm to change their appearance instead of drinking polyjuice potion?

I know that if they were changing into someone to break into somewhere (Ministry of Magic and Gringotts) they would need to look exactly like the person; but why couldn't they use a glamour charm on Harry when he was at Bill and Fleurs wedding? All they needed to do is change his face and eyes and give him red hair; they was no need to go through all the trouble of getting a redhead muggles hair for a polyjuice potion.

I've noticed that fanfics don't use the glamour charm more often. I've tried searching the charm on the fandom wiki but it's not there.

Is the glamour charm even a real charm? Or was it made up for fanfiction?


** Yes, glamour charm is fanon invention

** Aside from the fact that the glamour charm is a fan invention, I can see it taking a lot more artistic skill to do convincingly. I can see Lavender or someone rolling her eyes at badly-done glamours, which look totally fake. But if you have polyjuice, the results look perfectly real.

** Like [[/u/InquisitorCOC]] said, glamour charms are fanon. However, canon does have other forms of altering your appearance. The best example is Hermione disguising Ron for the Gringotts break-in:

#+begin_quote
  It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.
#+end_quote

Hermione's teeth growing and shrinking and Harry regrowing his hair via accidental magic are other examples that come to mind.

So why use polyjuice instead?

The biggest reason is, like you said, because polyjuice is much better at making you look exactly like a specific person.

The magic might be too hard to be practical. Yes, brewing polyjuice is also hard, but it can also be bought or made in bulk by a competent brewer and stored for later use. If you want to transfigure a disguise, you need someone good at the magic right then.

Related to the previous point, it's probably a lot easier for something to go wrong when transfiguring someone. With polyjuice, the worst that can happen is that you grab an animal hair, but that should be pretty easy to avoid if you're careful. And while magically altering hair is pretty harmless, I'd be very reluctant to let anyone adjust my eyes or bone structure or anything else important, because any mistakes could easily have serious repercussions.

Finally, it's harder to be sure you look different enough. In the quote above, Harry could still barely make out Ron after Hermione's changes. Admittedly, it helped that he knew he was looking at Ron, but there is clearly still a higher risk of discovery than with polyjuice, especially it you're trying to hide from people who know you well. And not everyone is as thorough as Hermione, especially if you're disguising yourself.

It's made up.

That said,Tonks mentions acing a Concealment and Disguise exam of some sort that she had to take as part of joining the Aurors, which she attributes to being a Metamorphmagus. So there /do/ exist spells that can serve a similar function of "make a person look like someone else," but the implication is that they're rather difficult to perform. (Or perhaps difficult to perform to Auror standard, or maybe they're easy to detect or dispel and the real difficulty is blocking /that,/ or something else. Point is, it's not something most people can do.)

** Glamour Charms are fanon.

Usually, they can be undone by a powerful enough Finite, but Polyjuice can only be reversed by the Goblin waterfall, as far as we know.

If you are imitating someone, then it's better to use Polyjuice potion, because things like exact skin shade are hard to recreate on another person.

And, as the glamour charm seems to be an enchantment to change one's external appearance in fanfiction, the cheekbones, nose and chin will stay the same, unless you are applying Transfiguration on top of the glamours.

Human Transfiguration is hard, so a wizard with average abilities is likely to avoid using it, less he damages the airway trying to change the structure of his nose (does it even work like that?).

Also, the tell-tale signs of Glamour charms, applied by wizards inexperienced in this field of magic, are slight blurriness and smudged features.

The glamours are usually used when one doesn't want to be recognised by every passersby and doesn't particularly care that the application of glamours is obvious. It is better to use glamour charms than to brew polyjuice for a month(?), all for a single walk around Diagon.

All of the information above is what fanfiction authors use the glamour charms most often as, and it is likely I'll do so too, as it is more or less an established piece of fanon.

Well, that and time, because it only lasts for an hour after ingestion.

** Canon is inconsistent on the power of transfiguration. If Krum can turn himself into a half shark and McGonagall into a cat then there really is no reason for some small facial rearrangement to be impossible.

** Well a glamour charm could be dispelled by a finite in most fanfic. Polyjuice is a far more secure method.
