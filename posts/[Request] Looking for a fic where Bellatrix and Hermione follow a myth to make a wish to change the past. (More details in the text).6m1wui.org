Looking for a fic where Bellatrix follows an ancient (pureblood?) myth (which turns into an obstacle course/race) to hope to grant a wish to undo the past (or forget her devotion to the Dark Lord, something along those lines). She forces Hermione to go with her. Long story short, they develop feelings for each other. Hermione is able to cheat the system and allow them to retain the memory of their love or something like that. Sorry for the hazy details, read this a long time ago and would love to revisit it. Don't remember the name of the fic nor the author. Hoping someone can help me out. Thanks!
