**** If your a doctor who person I read linkffn(That Which Holds The Image by RubbishRobots) last night and it was fantastic. I don't normally read crossovers but this was genuinely terrifying and funny. I chuckled and mutter "Oh no" out loud. Twice. Really good.

Linkao3(Sisyphus by esama) was also great. Groundhog day Harry Potter. I think it's only a oneshot but I enjoyed it.

Linkao3(All the Young Dudes) is a cult classic at this point but it's genuinely brilliantly written, with an excellent story and character development. The Werewolf side-stories are fab. People say this is romance but like? It isn't. No one is happy in this story at any point ever. It's less romance and more desperation. But I like it anyway.

I also love linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) is also fantastic with a great look at how werewolves are treated by society. It's Remus and Sirius in the 12 in between years. No smut. Lots of angst.

Linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian) is a great horror/mystery story and I will love everything that author writes till the day I die. Age of Lies is also great.

Linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) is another often recced story about Harry going back in time that is great fun and a good romp. I really liked it.

You said preferably no or minimal... But no or minimal what? I'm assuming romance/smut/slash since that's generally what people don't like. All the Young Dudes and Break are Wolfstar but not fluffy romantic anything. I can't read that it makes me throw up. Angsty, self inflicted pain because the person you love has betrayed you. That I like and if there's a pairing in a story I recc to people, it's probably going to be that sort of pairing üòã the others I've reccommended don't have a pairing as far as I remember.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
