I'm looking for Harry fics where he acts more like a marauder. The events can still be canon. He doesn't actually have to be raised be a marauder, I just thought the concept would be interesting, and I wondered how canon events would play out if Harry had a marauder streak in him.

I've tried looking for these fics but unfortunately I can't find any :(. Hopefully someone else has better luck!


** A lot of crackfics are along those lines. I vividly remember one where Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville were pulling constant pranks while bullying the everliving shit out of Draco, probably the closest you can get to the OG marauders but I just can't remember the name. I think it was on FFN though.

** There's Potter Club on ffn. It's been a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly Harry gets sent back in time and decides to live up to the Marauder legacy by starting a secret pranking club.

** Trolling The Toad is all about Harry channeling his inner Marauder to make Dolores Umbridge's life hell.

  If his life at Hogwarts was going to be a living hell, then so was hers. She wouldn't know what hit her.

** I remember reading a fic where Harry is sent back in time. He is a auditor, and audits the shit out if Hogwarts, Death Eaters etc. With Percy W. That us the close to a marauder like Harry fic that I've read. For some reason, prankster Harry fics are very rare.(As far as I know.) I dont remember the name of aforementioned fic, though

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!
