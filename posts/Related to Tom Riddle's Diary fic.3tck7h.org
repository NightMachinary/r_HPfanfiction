Okay so...what I'm looking for is:

Poor Ginny never gets possessed by the diary. Neither does anyone else. Somehow it gets figured out fast. IDK.

OR Ginny or whoever is possessed gets therapy. I'm tired of fics never fucking addressing this. She went through a lot of shit. Hot chocolate ain't going to fix it.


** Ginny in post diary trauma/therapy is really a popular theme:

*Remember*, linkffn(4936039)

*The Ties That Bind*, linkffn(6497669)

*A Retelling*, linkffn(11454917)

*The Bonds of Blood*, linkffn(5435295)

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382)

Then there are some stories in which the diary is neutralized in less dramatic fashion (no time travel though):

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), has a very hilarious take on the whole diary incident

*Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), Slytherin Ginny had her diary confiscated by Snape

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), technically a time travel story, but what happened to the diary is completely unique in all fanfics I've read

#+begin_quote
  Set after the COS. See how Harry Potter's story will change, with Ginny being Sorted into Slytherin. A Ginny who is not going to be a victim, and a Harry who realises those closest to him may not have his best interests at heart. Major Molly/Ron/Dumbledore bashing, some Hermione bashing. Rated for later chapters.

  My take on a Soul Bonding story. It is set slightly AU. Harry and Ginny forge a Bond when Harry saves Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets but it doesn't manifest strongly till they start becoming closer.

** Not sure if it's quite what you're after, but Identity (3rd in MarauderLover's Innocent series) really shows what Ginny goes through when she's with the diary/possessed. Not sure yet if the author will have her go to therapy, but she's definitely not recovered after hot chocolate and so far I've liked the way it's been handled in the story.
