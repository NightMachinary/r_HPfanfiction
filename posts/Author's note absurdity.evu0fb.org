** I agree, AO3 is great: you get optional dedicated space at the begining and end of every chapter /and/ the beginning and end of your fic for notes, and it doesn't count towards your word count. And it lets you reply to comments in the comments section, like a reasonable person. üòÅ

** And then they get longer and longer every chapter.. sometimes a third of the chapter is AN's and review responses.. and sometimes the author goes full retard and has a chapter JUST for an AN or reviews.. thats when i wish i could downvote a story.

** My favorites are the review replies.

That are 30% of every chapter length.

*** I don't really understand why people use the fic space to reply when they can just reply to the person who wrote the review (unless they are a guest... and then you can reply by making a comment on the chapter). I guess they want everyone to see the reply?

I did read one fic that did review replies at the end of chapters that I actually enjoyed... because she did it well... it was a bit of a dialog with the readers that offered a bit more insight into the characters and gave hints of what was to come. Most of the time, I just skip them.
