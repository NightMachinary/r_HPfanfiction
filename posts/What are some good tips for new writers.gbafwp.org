It could be suggestions, writing techniques, things to avoid or be wary of, other useful life hacks for new fanfiction writers, or just general information that you've noticed from writing and/or reading.

Make sure to include as much detail as you can!


** My biggest tip from personal experience: if you're writing a more serious chaptered fic, write up a plot outline. You don't necessarily have to outline every single scene of every single chapter, but if you are planning a long-fic, especially if you are planning something that will span multiple years, you are going to want that outline. At the very least, you're going to want to include the major arcs and important plot points within those arcs. If you can make these story arcs correspond with character arcs, even better, because you don't want to neglect character arcs. You can go more detailed, of course, though I'd caution against making your outline too comprehensive, as you might get stuck in a rabbit hole. The key is having something to help keep you on track, or to guide you when you get stuck, which is why it's crucial that you actually write it, rather than just having a mental map of your story. It should also help with pacing, which is something a lot of fanfic writers struggle with.

To back track a little bit, let's talk characters. Balance is something that is often lacking in character portrayals. Obviously, people have different interpretations of characters and their actions, so what is in character to one person might seem out of character to another. But if a character is at least a major character in a story (or maybe a even secondary character, depending on the nature of the fic), portraying them with both realistic flaws and strengths (both in terms of personality and magic) is important. Bashing fics tend to amp up the flaws of a character while discarding anything remotely positive about them, but that just makes for poor writing and character building, and it's not something you would want to carry into your own work, if you like writing original stories as well.

I have a few more tips, but these are more general:

- Reading your work aloud will definitely help in editing. You can't always trust your eyes.
- If you aren't sure how to spell a character's name, Google it. Granted, some of these names are difficult, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen Lily continuously misspelled as "Lilly" in fics.
- Avoid tense and pov changes in the same section. These tend to be jarring and can pull a reader of the story quickly. In general, it's best to maintain the same tense throughout the story, but pov changes can work when done with care. While I have seen fics with two different povs in the same chapter, the sections were distinct enough so that it wasn't jarring. General practice for pov shifts tends to be from chapter to chapter.
- Making a regular writing schedule for yourself will really help in the long-run. Even if you can only write 100 words one day, that is still better than not having written anything.
- Write down your ideas if you have a lot of them. You never know when they might give you new inspiration, or when you might use one as writing practice if you can't work on your main project.
- Reading more will help with your writing, though I would advise against using fanfics as your primary reading material.

And finally, last but most important, I think:

- Write for yourself. Write something that you want to because it's of interest to you, not because you think that's what other people will want to read. I know it can be hard not getting any traction at times, but it's a lot easier to keep going even when people don't seem to be reading it, or you aren't getting reviews, if it is a project that you actually care about.

**** For the first thing you said, I'll give an example. This is just a random character with brown hair. The brown haired boy walked into the girl with ginger hair. John walked into Jane. Both sentences are equally bland the first one has more words in it and is a bit more confusing. Probably a bad example but with any character the reader already knows just use their name. Even for characters without a stereotypical description don't use their hair colour or whatever instead of a name or pronoun generally. Seriously if you've read any stuff with deku as a character you'll be sick of all the stupid nicknames the writers give him. Don't make characters illogically mean without good reason. Don't use clichéd bullies to big your main character up. Flaws should be a big aspect of your main characters, even if they are part of already established cannon. Idk what else I can tell you have you got any more specific questions.

** I know it's already been mentioned before, but take care to avoid bashing and Mary Sue-ing. Those things can happen unintentionally simply because the writer particularly likes or dislikes a character. Even if you've written your PhD thesis on all the reasons why Ron Weasley is the worst character in all of literature, don't let your personal feelings about him show in your writing. You can make him an unsympathetic character/antagonist while still portraying him as a multi-dimensional person with positive and negative qualities. The opposite goes for a character you love. They have flaws, too, and they can still be a likable, sympathetic character without their negative qualities being glossed over or justified because they had a Terrible Childhood ™.

*** On the contrary, as someone who seems to enjoy bashing characters, I'll say that you can definitely bash characters, but it isn't a simple thing to do.

Make sure that if you're gonna let your feelings show that you provide reasons for your hate, and don't let it be so blacks and white. Don't just make someone out to be a stupid, gluttonous dumbass, give the character more depth than that. People will appreciate it, really, and it's a great show of good writing skills.

You're always gonna have torn opinions on characters - even the villains that you'd think everyone would hate, but especially in HP, characters can be developed so damn much to the point that they may start hating or liking a character simply due to a piece of writing that shows reasons for the characters actions. Myself? I used to like Dumbledore, but now dislike him after reading several fics. I used to be neutral towards Tom Riddle, but now I absolutely adore him after once again, reading several fics that showed me exactly why I should like him.

If you're very aware that your fic is going to contain bashing, then give the readers notice. Tag it, give a one line comment at the beginning of the story/chapter. Heck, I'm sure some readers, such as myself will go surfing and start reading your fic if we such a tag. More importantly, it's just polite. Some people are deeply uncomfortable when seeing a character they love being hated.

**** My understanding of bashing is that, by definition, the hate is not properly justified within the fic; i.e. out of nowhere, or in a very forced way, Ron (to use my example) is revealed to have been manipulating Harry for years and being friends with him just for the fame (or something like that), when there's no real justification or buildup to it.

If, on the other hand, a writer uses Ron and Harry's fight in Goblet of Fire to develop Ron's jealousy into something more, and he slowly and gradually becomes an antagonist that way, I don't really see that as bashing, as long as he's still written as a real person and not a puppet that exists for the sole purpose of spewing the authors opinions.

Most writers don't manage to do that well, so I generally avoid bashing fics. However, I'm actually reading a fic right now where the author actually did it very well, because it made sense within the story and fit the character's personality to do what he did. In this case, I don't see it as bashing; it's just a realistic consequence of the divergence from canon.

** 1. Stephen King put it best, "Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open". Meaning you should write your first draft before you show it to ANYONE. Get your ideas on paper. Put it away for an allotted time (King recommends a month, but I feel thats a little long) and then come back to it. Edit it and have others look at it. When you've made your edits, THAT is when you should post your first chapter. If you do so before, you might get stuck and end up not finishing the work.
2. Criticism in reviews are not those of professional writers, nor necessarily by other writers, so I would advise taking a majority of it with a grain of salt, but there is some legitimate criticism out there, so always keep your eyes open.
3. Write for YOU! Write because it makes you happy, not because you feel like you owe anything to anyone. You don't. That being said, it does really suck when a writer decides to abandon a story just when it was getting good. (Trust me, I know. I've been on both sides as the author who abandons their story and the reader who gets figuratively blue-balled) Though you probably won't run into this problem if you follow 1.
4. You will ALMOST CERTAINLY receive hate of some form. Be prepared and understand that responding to them in any form just makes them do it more. Ignore them and move on.

** Make sure to proof read and edit! Also let the story flow at your pace, do not feel rushed or harassed into writing a chapter for the sake of just putting one out, your story will be watered down and have issues if you do not take you time and think through what you want to write. Most important of all though is to remember that it is your story and not to take any negative feedback too seriously. Constructive criticism is good, but those that are downright rude, just ignore them.

** Make sure the spelling of names is right. Too many times have I read a story that had Hermione's, McGonagall's, or Lucius' name as completely different spellings.

Don't have characters so one-dimensional.Even if you're doing the typical Weasley and Dumbledore manipulates Harry type of stories, there should be something extra there.

Don't go too crazy with describing the settings and areas that the characters are in.

Look through other fanfictions, trying to come up with a new idea is difficult, but making twists from previous stories can be fun to do. Don't try to write something that's been done before, or if it has been done before then try to do different things with it.

If it's a multi-chapter, I suggest having multiple chapters prewritten before starting to post the story, it'll help you out, as well as get you further in your work, and have some sort of "schedule" of sorts.

** In addition to the information that people provided below, make sure the grammar is good. Look up how to properly format dialogue, and remember to vary your dialogue tags. Also, not every line of dialogue needs a tag!

I think improperly formatted dialogue is probably the most common mistake I see, and in several cases it's been enough to make me drop a fic.

** Honestly, the best thing you can do is have fun. "Well-written" is completely subjective. Even a tropey, cliche, grammatical error-filled story can be Amazing to read if it's about something the reader and the author care about. That kind of passion shines through.

Write what you want to read, I guarantee other people will want to read it too.

** -_-

tip number one: look for previous threads on a topic before making a new one.

In brief however:

- Descriptive language is good, but much like cinnamon, it is best in moderation. Don't go crazy with describing the setting or the characters, it's boring and weird. (I have done this)

- Try and have at least a basic idea of what you want to do with a story or drabble when you start writing it. Do you want a romance? Do you want to explore a specific character or idea? etc.

- Please for the love of god: spell check, grammar check, and formatting check. It is an extreme turnoff to constantly come across misspelled or misused words, or solid walls of text with no paragraph breaks.

- Writing is a skill. Like any skill, it requires practice to become good. The first thing you write will always disappoint you in retrospect. This is normal. Learn from it. Copy what worked and change what didn't. If you get honest criticism, try to use it.

- Read more. Learn what has already been done: even if you are going to repeat it you can compare what did and didn't work in the other fic to improve yours. Learn what good and bad grammar looks like. Learn what good and bad character dialogue looks like. etc.

- No idea for a fic is good or bad but that the writer makes it so. Even if you're planning on using some horrible or annoying cliche, if you write it well enough you can make people love it. But, you should probably try to avoid those cliches when you're starting out.

- Write for yourself. Do it for fun. If you have an idea that you want to see in the world, just fucking go for it.

** When I sit down and want to start writing a chapter, my plan is simple: write, write, and write some more. Do NOT stress over every line as if comes out, just let it go, and don't expect it to come out perfectly the first time. Being too much of a perfectionist will make you stress and ultimately, the chapter will come out much more slowly. Edit after you've written a good chuck, and THEN you should go back and fix all the minor errors.

** Look up 'show and tell'. Show your story by describing it rather than telling everything that's going on. Don't have one full page of just telling Harry's (or whoever the main character is) back story and what has happened (unless your story is a sequel, and you need to summarise the previous story, and if so, do it /briefly/, don't go on forever).

Also, personal pet peeve: make sure you spell correctly, especially names and terminology from the HP universe.
