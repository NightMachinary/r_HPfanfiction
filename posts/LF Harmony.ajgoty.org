*** Starfox5, I'm convinced people downvote your comments/replies just because you're Starfox5. Not sure why some users do that.

**** If you have controversial positions, you are bound to get a few people who downvote you by default, no matter what you post. In Starfox's case, it's his Hermione characterisations, which some people dislike for being too positive.

***** You sometimes have that problem too, with controversial positions? But in the [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] section of Reddit the other day, someone suggested a story of his and it got downvoted. And here, before the upvotes came along, he was in the negative, not that he cares or anything but still.

****** If you call the Death Eaters (war) criminals, you are bound to piss some Malfoy and Snape fans off, especially if you argue with the legal side (eg Malfoy would get no milder punishment because most of his crimes do not accept being underage or coerced as excuse). And some people think that wizards and witches should be exempt from universal, international laws because they have magic, even if they live in the UK and not magical world (eg the Malfoys in Wiltshire).

It comes and goes, although Starfox's haters seem to be more persistent than mine.

** Romantic fluff and humour, Lavender/Ron in the background and Lavender is somewhere between friend and annoyance to Hermione. No bashing.

  After leaving Britain to continue his education, Harry tries to bring the British Wizarding world into the 21st century. Author's note: This was written before the seventh book was published. Character-driven drama with a lot of introspection.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play
