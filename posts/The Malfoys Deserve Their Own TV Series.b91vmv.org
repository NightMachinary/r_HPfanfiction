  I know they're dysfunctional and have issues, but whose family is perfect?
#+end_quote

May be the most reductive sentence ever written. To paint them as a family 'struggling to survive war' is crazy to me as well. They weren't trying to survive, they were one of the main instigators and causes of the atrocities that were happening. You could argue that Narcissa and Draco were trying to survive Lucius' horrific behavior but that's about it.

Dean Thomas was struggling to survive the war. I'm sure other Slytherins were struggling to survive the war. The Malfoys reaped what they sowed and weren't punished enough for their actions.

***** Eh, there are people still supporting /actual/ nazis, even at this date. Making excuses for merely fictional criminals doesn't seem to me either surprising or nearly as bad.

****** The actual Nazis have been smoked out by the Red Army andaAllied Air Forces some 75 years ago. How do you support something which has been ousted three quarters of a century ago? Nevermind finding some actual Nazis who are still alive and want support.

******* It does. You are trying to depict people who were war criminal, fascist terrorists and traitors as ideal family. And given that the Death Eaters are pretty obvious Nazis with magic and you are blatantly ignoring that, you are associated with the people who are equally blind on the right eye.

**** I didn't say anything about whether the Malfoys would be a good subject for a tv show and I never said they weren't written well written by JK, nor did I mention politics?

I simply stated that I disagree with *your* portrayal of the Malfoys as victims equal to the others who suffered in the HP series. I will say that I would have no interest in watching a TV show based on your rose colored glasses version of the Malfoys as it wouldn't be realistic or compelling based on how repulsive they were...particularly Lucius and Draco before he realized his actions had consequences.

****** At the risk of being called 'passive agressive' again (I thought I was fairly direct in my tone) may I make a suggestion? Going forward maybe cite specific fanfiction portraits you are referencing for context. In your original post you mention nothing about fanfic interpretations of the Malfoy's, only the writing and story beats (Narcissa saving Harry's life) JK came up with.

I think the Bellatrix Lestrange character portrayed in Delenda Est is human and very sympathetic. JK's version on Bellatrix... not so much. In the end the fanfic interpretations are not JK's characters...they are versions of her characters...many times wildly different.

******** You're absurd. This is a fanfiction thread but your post referenced nothing but Canon. So anyone who assumed your desire for a Malfoy TV series based on the Canon characters and not fanfiction depictions of the characters is completely understandable. How are we supposed to know what fanfiction based portrayal of the Malfoy family you mean? Yeah all Harry Potter fanfiction is based on her writing, but that doesn't mean most of it is any good

Your immediate reaction tells me you aren't all that interested in an actual discussion based on the fact that because people don't necessarily like the idea that they are "bitter" or "haters". If you're looking for an echo chamber where everyone can pat you on the back for your wonderful ideas and have no counter opinions at all then the internet really isn't the place to go to looking for discussions.
