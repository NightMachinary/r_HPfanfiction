** My question has always been why distract at all? Creating a diversion just supplies a chance for others to realize something suspicious is happening around them. He should just go in the middle of the night on a night when Dumbledore isn't in the castle, no muss no fuss. His master could attempt to grab the stone and if his master doesn't need to be in Hogwarts afterward I see no reason why Quirrell would have to stay after he's taken the stone.

If I HAD to choose a time for him to do it where he has a chance of being caught by Snape/Trio I'd probably do it during Quidditch. A majority of the students and some teachers go to watch the games leaving that stone sitting there ripe for the taking.

** I mean, the Halloween feast itself is a pretty great distraction. Without the troll incident interrupting them, they all just would have stayed in the Great Hall eating. Quirrell could just fake illness, not attend the feast, and use that time to attempt to steal the stone.

** during a quidditch match

enchant the giant squid so that air temporarily works like water for it

also enchant it to know that voldemort is a danger to the students and that voldemort is in the castle

for purposes of the story lets just assume that it has animal level intelligence and tries to get into the castle to attack voldemort

from a spectator perspective this would look like the squid is attacking the castle.

** Fiendfyre or mustard gas in the Gryffindor tower (I doubt that a bubblehead charm would do much good here), the Basilisk, werewolves or razing the village where the Weasleys, Lovegoods, Diggorys and so on live.
