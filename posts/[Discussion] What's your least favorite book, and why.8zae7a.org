I'll start off with HBP. This one was a real let down for multiple reasons, but mostly because of the romance. It was awful, plain and simple, and Ginny, whom I loved in OotP as she /finally/ got some characterization, just... degenerated. I also could have done without the 'monster in the chest.'

PS: New here, so sorry if this has been asked before :)


** DH, because of the shitty/anticlimactic ending, camping scenes, plotholes, and Deus ex machina they pulled out of their asses.

That, and the fact that Harry is a retard who decided to challenge the most feared and powerful wizard in the entire Britan, without any plan.

** HBP and it's not even close. I'll pull parts of two recent comments I've made in this sub to give the details of my answer:

#+begin_quote
  However, HBP was such a DRAMATIC shift in tone from OotP that it felt, at least to me, like it was more of a left turn. OotP was dark, and it was gritty, and it was emotional. It had powerful moments of characterization and emotion, and it showed incredible depth to many characters in the books.

  HBP simplified a lot of things. Sure, it's teenage romance which isn't exactly suave, but the descriptions of Harry's "feelings" were gag inducing. (Christ, please keep the dragon inside Harry.) After the incredible depth and emotion of OotP, HBP which started only a few weeks after Sirius' death showed Harry essentially shrugging it off. He had none of the expected inner turmoil over losing Sirius that people expected, and the only real inner emotions the book went into was the awfully written romance between him and Ginny.

  It also kind of dulled what was supposed to be the emotional fulcrum of the whole series: Dumbledore's death. The rest of the book had been so childish and annoying that reading the last few chapters it just didn't feel like I was actually invested in the story in the same way. I read Dumbledore's death in a much more detached way than I did Sirius', and basically thought "Oh, well I suppose that will make Book 7 a bit different."

  JKR didn't take any time to give Ginny the proper depth either. She essentially played the part of the uterus for the stories. If JKR had wanted to make that work better, some of the roles she gave to Hermione she should have given to Ginny, like the Christmas scene in OotP. In fact, after Hermione cancels her vacation and makes sure Harry is okay, Ginny basically tells Harry, "hey, I'm one of the only people in the world that can uniquely relate to your fears of being possessed by Voldemort, and I wanted to explain this to you all along, but I was annoyed that you were being broody and ignoring me".

  Like... seriously?

#+begin_quote
  In my mind the main reason for the dramatic shift in tone from OotP to HBP was how JKR had been writing the series.

  When JKR first came up with the idea she started making copious notes and outlines. By her own admission though, the very first thing she wrote narratively was the epilogue. It's one of the reasons the epilogue is so cringe worthy.

  Props to her for knowing where she wanted to go with it and end up, a lot of authors don't.

  She knew the main plot elements of the books before writing it all out, however JKR's real talent always was and always will be character-driven stories. For the first five books, it seems obvious to me that she was hitting all the plot points she needed to, but inbetween the plot how she handled the characters was much more "what works best" and "what would this character do or say right now".

  But she finished OotP, looked at all that she had written, and had a moment where she realized that she was now getting rather far from the epilogue she had written in the mid 90s. The characters had taken on a life of their own and they didn't want to fit the ending place she was headed. (Not just in pairings, in other ways also.)

  She could, of course, have thrown the epilogue away at that moment. But instead she decided that she needed to "correct" the direction things were headed in. It's why HBP is so ham-fisted. She was for the first time really forcing characters that she had been mostly giving freedom to in the previous 5 books.
#+end_quote

--------------

This perspective on HBP and how it was written is one that JKR has basically shared in interviews since the series has been completed. She /knows/ this is what she did, and she knows why she did it. Again, that's fine, this is still one of the best collected works of fiction ever.

I actually quite liked DH, but I don't read it that often because that means reading HBP.

Outside of the OBVIOUS answer of HBP, my answer would have to be Chamber of Secrets for many of the reasons listed in an earlier answer. That book isn't quite as frustrating from a character perspective, but is just grating to read through at times.

*** Yes, so much this! I've been through the stages of grief, and you do /not/ recover that quickly. Dumbledore saying it was mature of Harry irked me. No, it was OoC. Harry mourned more for Cedric than he did Sirius.

Also, as an author, you have to let the ending adapt to the story. Yeah, I have the ending of my story planned, I know how I /want/ it to play out on the way there, but am I going to keep it entirely the same? Probably not. I get to know these characters as I write, and they might not be the same people at the end as I first imagined them. (Sorry if this sounds rambling...)

*** Your second comment really clarifies things for me. I've said before that the way to (partially) fix HBP would be to drop the Dean subplot and have Harry's interactions with Ginny in OotP be the start of their romance. It would make the "breakup" subplot a lot more compelling, too. But of course, doing that would require JKR to actually be thinking about romance when she was writing OotP, and she clearly wasn't.

That said, I don't think the epilogue /doesn't/ work. I know many people would have preferred if she'd left it open, but it's still believable that it would work out that way as the books are written. (And I think it still would be if you cut out the "chest monster" and kept Harry's and Ginny's relationship at the OotP level through DH.)

**** The epilogue works, it's just... a bit cringy and anti-climactic. Albus Severus Potter... I nearly dropped my book when I read that the first time.

The thing JKR really needed to do to make Ginny and Harry work better is show Ginny /even once/ thinking of Harry before herself.

I /really/ think that the Christmas scene in OotP was the thing that ruined that for me. That was a situation tailor made to allow Ginny to swoop in and save Harry for once. But instead, we have Hermione cancel a vacation with her parents whom she only sees for a few weeks a year to come and save Harry. Even /Sirius/ didn't really help him in that situation, though to be fair after Azkaban and his Grimmauld imprisonment, he probably wasn't mentally equipped to be that person.

But instead of the scene that could have forgiven so many sins in the Harry/Ginny romance for me, when given the chance, Ginny basically just tries to guilt him for ignoring her.

It was very frustrating, but I didn't realize /how/ frustrating that scene was until HBP came out and it became clear that JKR was going to make Harry/Ginny happen */no matter what/*. Prior to HBP, I thought to myself, /"Surely JKR wouldn't have given so much of the scenes that showed shared understanding and companionship, that showed two people really coming to understand how to support one another to Hermione instead of Ginny if she's going to make the crush in Books 1 and 2 come full circle."/

HBP was so frustrating to me because it is /obvious/ that JKR knows how to write good character interactions with a rare level of talent, and it is also obvious that she knows how to depict deep and complex emotional and mental companionship. I just expected that to be /part/ of the eventual teenage romance that would happen, since it was a part of every other book before.

HBP was only so frustrating because JKR had shown herself to be so talented previously. I wouldn't be mad at a less talented author for a book like that, because you can't expect more from a less talented author. It's the same reason that I don't expect certain levels of care and complexity from fanfic authors... most simply don't have the experience and/or talent for that kind of expectation to be fair.

But I feel like that was a fair expectation of JKR because of how clearly talented and accomplished she was at that point.

** HBP.

I can excuse the "monster in the chest" or OOC behaviour of Hermione and Ron (she's hormonal and jealous for the first time and he finally got the attention he wanted for his whole life).

But the rest of the plot moves like the 5th book didn't happen, like Harry didn't lost his godfather several month ago, like he didn't get two know that Dumbledore hid information about the prophesy for all that time and condemned him for long miserable years, etc.

No one cares about those things and that there's the Darkest Lord with growing support and powers outside the Hogwarts walls!

*** I have such mixed feelings about HBP.

On the one hand, it includes a lot of the "slice of life" Hogwarts stuff that I had always craved. On the other hand, it included it at such an inappropriate time in the series: innocence was for the earlier books, and HBP should have been a ramping up of the war.

And to add insult to injury, most of the slice of life stuff took pains to stress how much Harry was struggling with magic. Just to rub our noses in the fact that the hero's journey hinted at in PoA-GoF was not happening.

** Chamber of Secrets.

On a narrative level, this book is easily the worst in the series.

- Even next to its predecessor, it feels too out of sync with the wizarding world established later on, including all the characterizations.
- The entire situation feels incredibly contrived for the big reveal of Ginny being the one opening the chamber.
- Dobby's powers were written expicitly to provide fore shadowing.
- The arrival of Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, plus the basilisk fang being on hand, are possibly the biggest deus ex machina in the series, possibly next to the whole mirror situation in DH.
- Sixteen year old Voldemort has this incredibly elaborate plan that he gets away with, but his endgame is almost laughable comparitively which is out of sync.
- Harry not being able to attack the shade, but the shade can pick up his wand and cast spells.
- The phoenix has all these incredibly convenient powers, many of which would be useless in other situations. If Fawkes had a bunch of useless abilities too, like say, the ability to detect the presence of chocolate, it would have at least not been as big of a deal.
- This book portrays the younger Weasleys in a worse light than in all the other books, including Ginny. Sure, they are kids. But they also lived their whole lives together. The entire Ginny-crush feels contrived to give an excuse to why this girl is suddenly quieter and withdrawn.

As for HBP. I agree with some points about it, particularly with the idea that Harry seems to still be wandering aimlessly through life. On the romance...I think Harry deserves something of a pass considering his less than normal childhood and understanding of relationships. Not to mention /they are sixteen years old/. Magic doesn't make you less hormonal. Shit, Dumbledore was gearing up to travel the world with a kid who had been kicked out of another school and was spouting diatribes about domination and the natural order of things. James spent six years obsessing over the same girl, who wasn't interested till later.

1) James was either ignored or belittled, his appearance was never described, and it was entirely possible he wasn't Harry's son;

2) Harry sought his own redemption through Albus Severus, and holy cow, were things adding up;

3) Lily just wanted everyone to be happy, and man, was this just sad;

4) Ginny was letting Harry control/do anything he wanted, and JKR made this far too easy.

**** I think you're inferring a LOT of things here that I can't see at all.

1: James was neither ignored nor belittled; he was chastised for worrying his brother, and then he went off on his own for a bit, then he was hugged and told to give Neville his parent's love, which he didn't appreciate. There's NO evidence to support he wasn't Harry's son, so that's just taking it all out of thin air.

2: Harry never sought redemption for anything that I could see, so I don't see how he could do it through Albus Severus.

3: Lily appears to be a perfectly normal little girl. She complains that she's too young for Hogwarts and argues with Hugo over Hogwarts houses. Nothing that really says she's trying to keep happiness in an unhappy family or anything.

4: Very little real interaction between Harry and Ginny, though Ginny seems more in charge than Harry is. Ginny scolds James, Ginny assures Albus they'll write to him, Ginny reassured Harry that Albus will be all right. Harrty mainly just tells Albus about the Sorting Hat, and insists that Albus and James aren't allowed to share a bedroom. If you mean the "Ginny let Harry do everything he wanted" thing as in "Harrty clearly picked all the kids' names and Ginny had no say" like a lot of people have complained, there's no real evidence for this either.

Thing about the epilogue is that there's no real substance to it. You can't really deconstruct it because there's hardly anything there. You could certainly infer or make up a whole lot of things, but there's nothing in the text that supports it.

For example, if I was going to make an angsty fic based on the epilogue that "proved" that the characters were all either deeply unhappy or had turned into total villains, I could claim, with just as much validity:

1: James regularly torments and abuses Albus, to the point of nearly driving Albus to suicide twice, but Harry and Ginny just tell Albus that his brother is just "having a laugh."

2: Lily is actually the oldest of the kids, but she's a Squib who will never go to Hogwarts. Harry and Ginny have tried to cover it up; they have modified everyone's memories to make them think Lily is younger than she really is. For ten years now Lily has "only had two more years" until she gets to go to Hogwarts. She's almost twenty and still thinks she's nine.

3: Neither Rose nor Hugo are Ron's children; Hermione doesn't even know who their father is because she likes to go out at weekends, feed love potions to random Muggle men and have wild, unprotected sex with them, after which she erases their memories of the whole thing.

It doesn't makes sense to me based off a two minute blip in their future lifes to suggest that. There isn't much go by in the epilogue to really say for sure anyways, so no judgment from me on that. However I will add, if we wish to go that route it could be entirely possible for James to not be Ginny's son, because the epilogue doesn't say she gave birth to him.

****** It is insane and utterly laughable, that was the point. ^_^ There are a lot of things that could be inferred by the epilogue, but which the text doesn't actually back up at all.

No, I DON'T think James has nearly pushed Albus to suicide; his relationship with Albus seems more reminiscent of Fred and George's with Ron -- merciless taunting and teasing that occasionally goes too far, but isn't actually malicious. But if I'd read the epilogue already having decided to hate James, then his treatment of Albus could easily be seen to back up my "he's scum" opinion.

And I think it's the same if you read the epilogue having already decided that it's flawed and in need of "deconstruction"... you're going to find something that you feel build up under your notions, even if it's not actually in the text at all.

As for your Word of God... I think I'm going to have to ask for a quote here, because I can't find any JKR quotes about Harry naming his son after Snape and Dumbledore out of guilt. On Twitter she named the reasons as "forgiveness and gratitude," which don't have much to do with guilt or redemption.
