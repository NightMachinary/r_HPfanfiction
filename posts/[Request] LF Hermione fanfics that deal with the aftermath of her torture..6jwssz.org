Hi, I'm looking for Hermione fanfictions preferably done well that are the aftermath of her dealing with what Bellatrix did to her. The longer the better and the pairng doesn't matter. I know the Mudblood scar is movie only but it doesn't matter to me one way or the other if that's included. Thanks in advance!!


** Hermione's pain at Malfoy Manor earned them some huge gains though:

- Bellatrix delayed calling Voldemort in her panic over the sword, thus giving Harry & Co time to organize an escape.

- Bellatrix spilled the location about Hufflepuff's cup.

- Bellatrix left her hair on Hermione.

- Harry won the allegiance of Elderwand by disarming Draco.

- They further rescued Luna, Dean, Griphook, and Ollivander, who all proved to be essential in the fight against Voldemort.

- Wormtail had been eliminated.

This episode essentially turned into a gigantic debacle for Bellatrix and the Malfoys, as they were SEVERELY punished by Voldemort afterwards. You know what that means.

Later, Hermione bent the very wand that tortured her to her will, impersonated the very person who tortured her, and robbed that person's most prized possession.

Hermione was one TOUGH NUT.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6896171/1/Hermione-s-Wand][Hermione's Wand]] is an one-shot in which she still struggled with nightmares months after, but eventually decided to keep Bellatrix's wand as her trophy.

*** Oh She definitely was one tough nut. All of that had to have such an effect on her that we never get to see because everything really picks up from that point. I'm very interested in seeing fictions where she goes to that dark place and fights her way back. Or ignores what happens and then spirals or whatever the author might come up with. Thank you for your suggestion.
