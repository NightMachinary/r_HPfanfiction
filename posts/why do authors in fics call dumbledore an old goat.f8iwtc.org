*** Unfortunately, Albus had to put his foot down when old Aberforth came up with a new crest for the Dumbledore family. A running goat with panic in it's eye was a bridge too far for the Headmaster.

** Common vernacular: an elderly man who is disliked, especially for being mean to or disapproving of younger people (Dictionary.com)

It can also indicate an old lecher.

That combined with the beard and the family history of goat fucking makes it a really, really easy insult.

*** Not in canon. He was charged with "inappropriate charms on a goat," according to Albus. Exactly what those charms were is not detailed, and in fact is cause for speculation in many fics. I read one where the charm was to make the goat change colors to reflect his mood, but the goat is so bad-tempered he's always black no matter what. (At one point in the story he manages a slightly-less-black dark gray.)

**** Yeah but it's funnier to say he fucked a goat.

** It's also more of an American thing. We've used it since about 2010 or so, as we adopt so many American things, but in the 80s and 90s it wouldn't really have been all that prevalent.
