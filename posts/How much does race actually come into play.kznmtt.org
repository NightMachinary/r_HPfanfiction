I'm in the process of doing some very careful planning for my character backgrounds and worldbuilding for a WIP fic and I'm curious as to other people's opinions onto how big of a role race/ethnicity/nationality plays into Wizarding society and culture. In non-fictional magical practices, there is a diverse array of traditions and beliefs and ethics some of which are dependent on one's ethnicity/nationality, especially for closed practices like hoodoo and Roma witchcraft (I'm not sure if it's properly referred to as witchcraft or not). Even beyond these many people work with deities that they feel culturally connected to, or do ancestral spirit work which plays heavily into your cultural ties.

We all know that Harry was a fairly shallow narrator with a lot to occupy his mind with most of the time so I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest to see race, racial tensions, and cultural magic playing a far larger role in the wizarding world than we saw in the novels. I'm just curious as to how much this would parallel with the muggle world's tensions and what different tensions we suspect to arise and which we believe would fail to translate. (EX: Wand wielding wizard/ Wandless magic practitioners/ Ritual Based Magical communities. Would these exist? Would this cause prejudice? How prominent would this be seen in a Hogwarts setting?)

Final point, is it possible that race, as we see it in the 'muggle' world, doesn't exist in the magical world or are they intertwined to too great a degree for this to be possible?


** I can't remember any racial insults other than one from Pansy Parkinson:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle, anyway?' shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. ‘Why would anyone want to look like they've got worms coming out of their head?'

  Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly, ‘Spread out, then, and let's see what we can do ...'
#+end_quote

-HP & the OotP, ch 14.

Then again, Pansy is nothing more than a one-dimensional representation of JKR's bullies at school (the 'anti-Hermione'). So I'm not sure if this can be attributed to the rest of the stuck-up pure-bloods.

** There's probably elements of it. The Muggleborn population, especially prior to and during the 80s, would definitely have at least some racist, sexist, or homophobic views. So, while Wizarding Nationals focus mainly on Blood Purity, I imagine there'd be elements of the other bigotries peppered in via Muggleborn influence over the centuries.

*** I imagine its much like the expanse.

where instead of being treated differently by skin tone.

It becomes based on other things.

so in the wizarding world its based on blood.

in the expanse universe its based on location, with earth and mars hating each other and both looking down on belters.

** They have racism, but it's different than ours, it isn't about skin color, it's about muggle or non-baseline human ancestry.

** The muggle raised would have racists.

I would love a fic where they all have different prejudices and they're all indignant and call each other barbaric and crazy.

Black pureblood: “you hate me because I'm black? It must be because you're a mudblood”

And etc. They only think the prejudices are wrong when it's directed towards them.

** IMO, I think that the British wizarding world is more prejudice against blood status than anything else. It's nitpicking, but I get annoyed when fanfic authors say the purebloods are racist. Racism is based on physical attributes. Granted, words change all the time, but I think “xenophobia” is the closest word (prejudice against foreigners) we have. While muggleborns aren't necesarrily foreigners, they are outsiders entering a new world.

The Patil sisters are listed as pureblood or half blood and the Shafiqs (Arabic etymology) are a sacred 28 family. The Shacklebolts are too, but there's no evidence that they were always black. For all we know Kingsley might be mixed or at least one of his grandparents were white (i.e., his dad is biracial and married a black woman).

That being said, I think there would definitely be a classist view on different cultural magic in wizarding Britain. For example, I really, really doubt that parselmouths would be considered evil across the world. The obvious example is India, but there are even Appalachian churches that worship with snakes (its super interesting, like an old school aspect of Christianity. Look it up). They also speak in tongues when they get really hyped up so that is perfect for a parselmouth character IMO. For you non-Americans, the Appalachian mountains are where you get your typical hillbilly or redneck stereotype. So pretty much as white as you can get. (Except for the food because we season our food around here.)

It's my headcanon that rituals and runic magic were used commonly before wands and Latin-based spells became popular, so some people might look at those types of communities as stagnant or stupid. Except for maybe the purebloods, because (remember this is only my headcanon) they have rituals recorded from their family histories and know how powerful they can be. I mean Voldemort got an entire body out of a ritual. What else can they do?

And look at modern Roma witchcraft. Hermione absolutely hated divination and thought it was silly, but there are famous witches today in Romania that have a huge following. In the HP world, I'm sure that kind of pagan-ish magic they do there today IRL would absolutely influence the magic in canon.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there are many transfer students or immigrants in Hogwarts. Everyone seems to be British so I don't know if these sorts of cultural magical prejudices would really be prominent compared to the bigotry against muggleborns. That being said, I think a character along those lines would be interesting to explore. But then again I'm a sucker for reading about magic in fanfics. One of my favorite things to think about is Tom Riddle's research expedition across the globe. I'm a librarian so the thought of all that hands on research gives me a boner.

If anyone's bored enough, here's a pseudo documentary about a popular Romanian witch family: [[https://youtu.be/X1g3CYbsssw]]

*** To add further. The book which came up with the Sacred 28 was written by a member of the Nott family. It wasn't a societal thing, it was a single pureblood supremacist's view on what the best families were. If Nott is representative of the average beliefs, then purebloods are cool with race.

** There is nothing much in the canon. JKR is very liberal lady, so the fact that (at least) Angelina Johnson and Dean Thomas are black (not mentioning at least Patils being Indian) doesn't even register in the story. I guess, the author of fanfiction can do anything they like with the race issue. I always thought that Dean Thomas (and Hermione, who is of Jewish ancestry in my headcanon) understood really fast when they are told about the pureblood racism (and it is the reason why Hermione is so devastated by the Draco slander of mudbloods).
