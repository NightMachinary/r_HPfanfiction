Any story like this exist and, if not, who also would like reading something like this? I was going to flair this as a request but since I am not sure if there are any ffs out there, I'd rather have a discussion about the potential, people's thoughts, and suggestions for a fanfiction like this. Thanks!

Edit: yes, weed was original funny idea. Then I got thinking of him growing and selling plants that make you a better flyer or better caster or something that I can't even think of. Plants that teenagers would want and don't have easy access or any access at all to due to any number of reasons. Was interested in idea/ concepts from people or any feedback at all. He becomes popular cause he is the go to guy.

Just think it could have a lot of potential and go in many directions. Wanted to share to get others' opinions and ideas.

** While he could grow mundane drugs, I feel like wizards would insist on some really weird magical stuff, after all they insist on weird drinks, then there's the various magical creature based drugs that were subtly referenced (I think billywigs get you high and make you levitate), plus presumably you can do way better than any mundane drug with potions.

**** Weed was a lot more taboo back in the 90s/2000s when Harry Potter was written than it is today. There's no way you could mention recreational weed use in a book written for children and young teens.

But of course smoking weed was still common among older teens, so I see no reason why Hogwarts would be an exception.

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.

** I mean, lets be honest here. I am sure there are fics where Neville becomes well known as someone in the herbology field being that it makes sense within canon. But I am guessing you are angling more towards a wizarding drug dealer style of Neville (whether legal or not).

That.... well... lets just say it would be more interesting, but I would be shocked if you found a story that dealt with that in that sense, much less focused on it and him as a character.

** That sounds like good fun, though I'd like to see it go the other way and have him become well known or popular for running some sort of recurring show (eg some Wizarding Wireless show) in the vain of Gardeners World.

Have Neville become the wizarding equivalent of Monty Don in some crack-esque feature, presented from the perspective of other (unlikely) characters who are trying to improve their gardens, grow some vegetables, or cultivate some biological monstrosity for their +beau+ Voldemort. All the while, Neville is inadvertently having the cast de-escalate and reduce conflict as attitudes and perspectives gradually change, all the while he's calmly delivering a weekly show that talks about weeding advice and water features.

I mean, I'd read it.

** I sometimes thought that Neville acted a bit suspicious. I couldn't pinpoint it exactly, but one moment that stood out was when he took a small amount of some plant, and put it into a small pill. He then smirked, but then probably heard my breathing. I asked him 'What is that Neville? Can i look?', but he instantly changed. He started stuttering, and replied 'Uh, no, it's from my, my grandmother, it's to help me concentrate' and immediately he looked so guilty, so vulnerable that i just left without another word. Well, i won't go into much detail, but that's how i'm now the right-hand man of Neville Longbottom, a well-known entrepreneur with known businesses in the wizarding world, and unknown businesses in the muggle one too.
