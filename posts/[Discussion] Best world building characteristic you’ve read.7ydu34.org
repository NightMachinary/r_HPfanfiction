There's some really great world building in the HP fandom and I'm curious to know what some of the best ones you've read are?

One of my favourites is when a house is semi-sentient and adjusts accordingly to the owner.


** The werewolf society in PotDK. Kind of separate and independent, but still firmly under Voldemort's thumb, to the point that being sent there is used as a punishment. And i's not just a throwaway curiosity, it's actually integral to the plot. Not that throwaway curiosities have no place, but for something that had so much of the wordcount dedicated to it, it's good that it was used beyond "Sirius and Remus are buff half-naked beast-men".

*** Not like a ROR, I didn't explain it well my apologies. The fic is centered around Grimmauld and essentially it has “feelings” so since Harry doesn't appreciate it the way it should be appreciated as the house of the ancient and noble Blacks the carpets move to make him trip, the temperature cools significantly, the kitchen grows smaller etc. etc. That's what I meant but couldn't really articulate until now

**** Sounds like House Proud, by astolat (ao3). I love that fic and astolats worldbuilding in general. Slithering is another good example though it focuses on politics instead of houses as sentinent beings.

***** Yep! That's the one. Just the small details like I mentioned above really made the fic into something more for me, just different from what I usually read

I couldn't get past the 11 year old political masterminds personally.

**** Not really. Certainly, it's an interpretation that fits very well with what we see in canon, but the specifics are never discussed. A whole, structured concept-based system is still a fanon creation, much like any worldbuilding of what Beauxbâtons is like will still be a "fanon creation" even though /something/ like what they come up with exists in canon.

***** It's not explicitly stated in canon, but there are enough clues to draw that conclusion. JKR isn't Brandon Sanderson, but she left plenty of examples to work out some basic rules of magic.

**** It is, but that's sort of a key element for my judging of fanfic worldbuilding.

There are four options:

1. It doesn't delve in how things work.
2. It uses concept-based system (either canon based or different like Wit of the Raven [even if that had also strong energy aspect])
3. It scraps everything and creates new system on a different base.
4. It keeps canon spells but tries to base them in energy or math or anything else and inevitably ends up being inconsistent with itself.

I'm okay with "1" if it fits the focus of the story, "3" can be interesting, of course, I definitely favour "2", but unfortunately it's "4" that overruns fanfiction.

*** Meh. It can be done interestingly, but I don't really like the, well, concept.

**** What alternative do you suggest?

Especially considering that the series' magic is conceptual in nature, it requires basically scrapping everything and building anew to create something sensible with a different arrangement. So far the only fic I've seen doing that was Firebird's Song.

***** Magical cores have given the idea a bad reputation, but I rather think of magic as a /force/, an energy that can do any number of things depending on the way it's "bent".

Now, a wizard's soul has an instinctual connection to it, so they can manipulate it to do things like wandless telekinesis, and if they want something hard enough the magic is going to respond more or less haphazardly; spellcrafting is figuring out exactly what shape the flows of magic must take to produce, for instance, shrinking of the target, and how to reproduce that pattern just by channeling raw magic through the wand and giving it the right shape with the wand motion.

Of course, that's the theory --- in practice, only the very simplest of spells, like /Lumos/, can rely solely on such mechanical thinking, and for any really advanced spell like the Patronus Charm, the wand movement and incantation rythm "nudge" magic the right way but you have to want it desperately enough that your instinctual magic will do the rest.

E.G., wizard magic is related to human concepts and thinking because that's how magic was "crafted", be it with the scientific precision of Alchemy or through wild, instinctual manipulation of it by living beings. That magic isn't any more "concept-based" at its core than sound can be said to be 'concept-based' just because we use it to carry meaning through oral speech.

** The detail on magical vows in Forging the Sword. Not because I consider it good world building in and of itself (personally I feel like the idea of "locking up a part of your magic" is a bit too close to magical core territory) but rather because of the way it was used in the fic to develop the character arcs of Harry and Ron.
