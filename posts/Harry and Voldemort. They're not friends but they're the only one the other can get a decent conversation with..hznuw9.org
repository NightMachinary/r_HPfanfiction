I just have this stuck in my head where Harry and Voldemort have fought so often that they're bored of the usual threats and stuff, so they just talk about anything from the weather or Quidditch to what an arsehole Dumbledore is.

Or if you want to take it one step further you have them meet at a pub every summer after 4th year.

​

15 year old Harry Potter walked into a small pub a magic fake id and a few spells taking care of any issues with his age. Sirius had died a week ago and Harry was meeting with his usual drinking buddy Voldemort.

"Alright, V." Harry greeted the snake faced man as he sat at a table in the back.

A few spells disguised the Dark lords looks.

"Harry." Voldemort greeted in return as they ordered their go to drinks.

Many drinks later the pair were talking loudly.

"Wait, wait he gave permission for a fucking third year to have a time turner for bloody classes?"

"Yep." Harry took a swig of his drink. "She even took muggle studies."

"And people say Trixie is crazy." The dark lord muttered.

"How are You and Bellatrix by the way."

"Good." Voldemort said with a grin. "She's pregnant and she said she's sorry about Black she stunned him he wasn't supposed to go through."

Harry nodded taking a large gulp of his drink before speaking.

"Congrats on the kid."

"On that topic Harry. Would you be godfather?"

"You serious?" Harry asked shocked.

"No, that was your godfather." The Dark lord joked. "But should you somehow pull a win against me out your arse and kill me. You're the only one I trust to give the baby the happy childhood we didn't get."

"Of course, I'll be godfather." Harry said seriously before he smirked. "I just hope the kid takes after Trixie in looks and not you."

Voldemort glared at the younger wizard for a second before both burst out in drunken laughter.

"Well, I better go." Harry began "If I don't see you before school starts, I'll see you when your evil plan starts."

With that said Harry left the pub.

Harry and Voldemort weren't friends just drinking buddies and decent conversation for the other.

​

That was an idea for a scene between the two that I had. Are there any stories where the have that weird sort of friendship going on.

Thanks for your help.

**** This is definitely a thing in at least one fic that I've spent the last few minutes trying to search for to no avail. Harry and Voldemort keep getting reborn, with the memories of their past lives unlocking when they see each other as everything from random acquaintances to father and son (in both directions) to fellow students at an all-girl's boarding school to, eventually, the OG universe again. By this time they've long since stopped hating each other and decide the moment is ripe to simply fuck with everyone instead.

It's on AO3, I'm pretty sure, but fuck if I can remember what it's called.

It's harder to pull off when writing is your medium, or at least, the humor becomes much more subjective, because without going a lot more obviously cracky, people will wonder about the background of how this came about or nitpick your details by comparing them to canon.

When I see Harry teasing Voldemort or not being scared of him it's normally Master of Death!Harry who has lived quite a few more years than the summer after 5th year. He might be, like, reliving his same life, to get this kind of vibe. Something like linkao3(Nose to the Wind by Batsutousai).

  COMPLETE. When Voldemort came to, he realised he was completely stark naked ... in the middle of King's Cross Station ... which was illogically silent and empty save for himself and a grinning Harry Potter. This was just a bizarre dream, surely. (Gen, MoD!Harry, oneshot)

*** I think this fic has a pretty different vibe from the one OP suggests, but it's also what first came to mind for me when I saw the prompt and it's very good. Too bad it's currently hanging out near the edge of a fairly tall cliff.

Also, happy cake day!

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M

  Nearly every evening since just before Harry turned fifteen, he has gone to sleep and woken up basked in the glow of Voldemort's hearth. Dumbledore had theorized it was another element of their bond growing stronger; an unintended side effect of Voldemort taking Harry's blood in the graveyard. Harry theorizes that the piece of Voldemort's soul in his forehead likes to make Harry's life as difficult as possible. orHarry and Voldemort have reached a stalemate, but continue to argue anyway.
