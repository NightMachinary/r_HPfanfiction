I remember reading this ages ago... it was definitely DH compliant, not sure if it was epilogue-compliant or not. The only defining feature I can remember is that George lived in a house FILLED with mirrors. All the Weasleys thought he was completely losing it, but someone (Harry?) went around to see him and realised that the reflection in the mirrors had both ears.

Does anyone know which fic this is and where I can find it? Thanks in advance!


** Woah, I want to read this! There are way too little stories about George. Do you remember which site it was on? I have tried searching it on fanfiction.net, but didn't find anything so far...

*** It might have been HPFF, but honestly that's a wild guess.
