:END:
I remember reading a fanfic about harry remembering all of Voldemort's memories from a young age. It was abandoned, 13 chapters long, had harry use the malfoys and umbridge to free sirius, and iirc it had some samhain ritual where harry, voldemort, and morgana all offered up their humanity. I can't seem to find it, but if anyone knows what im talking about, it'd be greatly appreciated if you could share.
