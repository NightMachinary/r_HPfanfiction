I hate the bashing that Molly gets in stories. Sure she can be overbearing, but people think she's in it to take Harry's mone, or some such. Sure, I can see why people bash movie Ron, and Dumbledore in general, but Molly truly deserves none of that. The biggest piece of proof I can give is her boggart. Her greatest fear isn't vain, or based in greed, but around losing her family. Do I think she was out of line with Sirius. Yes. That doesn't mean she deserves all the hate she gets. She's a mother of seven children, how she acted towards Sirius cones fromm a place of her love for Harry. If someone wrote a story where someone sat her down, and explained things from Harry's, and Sirius's perspective, that'd be awesome. Basically, the hate is undeserved. She's a mother, and most here know how mothers can be. What people seem to forget is why? People only get that way if they care about the topic a lot, amd Molly wears her heart on her sleave.

That's my rant. Thoughts? Opinions? By all means write it down below. I'm gonna be gone for a few hours, but please try to keep things civil. I know this is a bit of a hot button topic, but we are all civilised people(most of the time).

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

In their own story, no one is the villain. And well-meant is the opposite of well-done.

I mean, think about how fucked up her comment was. Sirius had to endure a decade illegally incarcerated in hell on earth, thinking about nothing but the part he unintentionally played in the death of his best friend, of his family in all but blood, due to the dementors.

And Molly then victim blames him for that. That single line made me lose what little respect I had for her after she slut-shamed Hermione, a 15-year-old girl at that point, based on a gossip article written by the very "journalist" she had criticised only a few months before. But apparently, Rita is totally fine as long as her husband isn't in the focus of the article.

What Molly said to Sirius was unforgivable IMO, and it says a lot about Sirius that he did not ban her from Number 12 on the spot then and there.

*** Oof the Sirius comment really hurts especially since he dies in that book . I mean Sirius's story is so needlessly painful like at the very least could I get a applogy scene? A hug? Someone being defensive on Sirius's behalf? No? Narrative is sadistic with Sirius.

** As a child from a big family, I have a lot of thoughts on molly.

I don't agree that she doesn't deserve to be bashed, but the bashing's she does get is often egregious and not actually critiquing the things that are wrong with her in Canon...other than that...oh yeah SHE'S A RAPIST

*** How the actual fuck does a character "deserve" anything?!??!?

This is my most hated phrase in all of fanfiction. "Oh they /deserve/ it", like /what the actual fuck is wrong with you?/

If you don't like how a character is Developer then /bloody fucking/ */change em/*. Make the character better. "They deserve it" wtf...

As for the whole love potion thing: I don't think it matters. It's one of those things that JKR put in without really thinking of the implications. Molly doesn't act like a rapist, no matter what JKR said. It's a piece of information that has no bearing on her character, as such I completely dismiss it.

Just like when JKR said that Dumbledore was gay or that wizards used to poop on the street and vanished it.

It's never addressed in the story and it can be safely removed from canon without affecting it one bit.

**** wow. Doesn't act like a rapist? How does a rapist act?

Of course it has a bearing on her character.

Eta I shut reread my comment and OP's post and I was using language OP used. I don't understand why you had such an emphatic response to my comment at all

***** What does she do in the books that's related to the fact that she used a love potion?

Nothing, that's what.

JKR once more wrote something without thinking about the implications and then completely ignored it.

​

/If it were removed from canon, nothing would change/. That's the point.

****** that's a decision you can make when you're writing, but to me it's these little details that Rowling and her characters are so blasé about that mean a lot in the scheme of things. There is a lot of shit that gets brushed over, laughed at, dismissed as normal, ‘that's just how things are' and all together if none of it was in the books, they'd be far different

****** It does actually add to the world building. You see repeatedly this very dangerous potion that people are dismissive of. Acting as if it the product of harmless crushes even though you see repeatedly in the series it causes problems.

To see someone of this culture who is still considered kind, just, and morally in the right usually, have this lackadasical attitude about love potions informs the world building quite a bit and her place in it.

******* Yeah, the problem is that it's never directly addressed.

JKR has a history of saying/writing stuff without considering their implications. As such, I can only assume that, since she never directly addressed the problem the use of such potions presents, she wasn't aware of it.

Why should I waste time and effort to make a character I dislike better? If I can be bothered to include them at all, I will depict them exactly as I see them in canon, and if that means painting an unpleasant picture, so what? I'd rather write a 200k Harry/Lily/Bellatrix/Luna epic than write a single page where I try to "fix" someone like Molly or the Malfoys.

I mean, for fuck's sake, characters are supposed to have flaws. So why should I whitewash them? I am not doing that to characters I like, so why should I do it to those I don't, nor want to read about?

** I agree that Molly and by extension Ginny get a stupid amount of bashing and I add Ginny because they're mostly bashed for the same reason. Funnily enough when a fic mentions that all Weasleys are bashed except the twins, Arthur, Bill and Charlie all I think is that the twins, Arthur and Bill should be the ones getting bashed.

****** I'm going to find the comment I was talking about cause I now view the twins and Arthur in a different light because of it. Basically if a character is getting bashed I now question whether they deserve it. It's weird because it's fanfiction and people should write what they want but I don't think Molly deserves the bashing she gets where as Snape and Ron deserve it all the time in my opinion.
