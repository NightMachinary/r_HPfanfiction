In the summary it said that the divergence was that Remus grows up in an orphanage(?). I believe it was eventual Wolfstar. Also to anyone who has read it, I have given up on it multiple times after looking at the length, is it worth it?

  Also published on AO3 (same author, same title): Wolfstar get together fic charting the Marauder's time at Hogwarts from Remus' POV. Obviously a Remus/Sirius fic, but loads of general marauders mischief and fun in the first few years. A few diversions from canon - working class/orphaned Remus.
