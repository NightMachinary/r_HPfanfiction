*** I just got around to reading this one. 10/10 would recommend.

It's hilarious for the sheer reason of Luna Lovegood being an unstoppable force of nature for most of the fic. The relationship is about as adorable as it gets, starting at "two seven-year-olds making a marriage promise without actually knowing what that means".

Fair warning, the fic was written before Deathly Hallows came out and it shows. Luna's father is named Larry in the fanfic, the Deathly Hallows don't appear at all, and the Horcruxes aren't in their canon places.

**** Do you know how some people talk with a accent and in a few days/weeks staying were they live in the foreign place (depends how and who you are) you pick up the accent? Well anyway I was reading the first chapter and it felt weird and then went to sleep. Woke up and started reading and it started to go from disturbingly unknown and weird. To normal I think he writes differently than others.

***** The first chapter was written by a different author than the rest, if I'm interpreting the tagline/summary right.
