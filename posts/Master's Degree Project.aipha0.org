Hello! I am currently undertaking a project for my master's degree, looking at women who write male/male slash fan fiction. As part of this project, I have created a study - the first stage of which is a brief survey, which is linked below. If you identify as a woman, between the age of 18-30 and have ever written a piece of slash fan fiction centred around two men, please take a few minutes to complete this survey. I would be incredibly grateful.

Edit: Whoops, saw you already posted there, good luck!
