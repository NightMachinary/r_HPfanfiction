** Prince of the Dark Kingdom. No matter how good all the other Snapes I've read are, and some were really well done, this one just gets to me. I haven't read it in a long time, so I'm not sure, but this story might predate the information that said Tobias Snape was a muggle.

** /Under Pressure/: Set just after Snape takes the job as Potions master, this is the best Snape fic I've read. The Dumbledore/Snape dynamic is one of the best in canon, and this fic does it justice. Snape's initial resentment against Dumbledore as he thinks he's basically exchanged one master for another is brilliantly portrayed, as is the subsequent evolution of their relationship.

** I feel like I recommend this story way too much, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-Ending Road]] is the best characterization of Snape I've ever seen. He's a petty, cruel, damaged man with few redeeming qualities. Yet he's a compelling character. The author managed to make me read a story that I should hate because of the squicky pairing and my general distaste for genderbent Harry because the Snape characterization is so good.

  Being Master of Death was a curious thing. It did not grant immortality, as some wizards might assume- nor did it make the entity called 'Death' your servant, neither did it grant any special power. No, in truth being 'Master of Death' was more of a curse than a gift. This was something Nicolas Delacour, once known as Harry Potter, can tell you with great enthusiasm. AU, HP/LV,
