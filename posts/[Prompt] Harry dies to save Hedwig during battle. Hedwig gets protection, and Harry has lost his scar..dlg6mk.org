Ridiculous. Harry couldn't believe he was being overshadowed by an owl.

*** At this point, I think Hedwig's fan club is more fanatical than Harry's. Who doesn't the cute fluffy owl that sacrificed her life for a friend?

*** People are willing to risk quite a bit for their pets. You don't have to make it a 'trading my life for my pet' type situation.

​

How many people do you know would run into a burning building to save their cat/dog? That is taking on (considerable) risk to life and limb.

​

Usually these things are structured more as less of intentional self harm but selfless acts to save another while putting yourself at risk. THen all you need is for the risk to go the other way.
