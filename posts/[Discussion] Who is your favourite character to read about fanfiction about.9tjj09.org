I'm of the opinion that you can't NOT love Nagini


** Okay, like roughly 80 % of young women, i once heavily identified as Hermione, the shy bookworm. In addition she adds conflict because she grew up in a very different way compared to non-muggleborns. She should have realistic flaws though, like lacking certain background facts about wizarding life and not having great social skills.

I also like to read about Snape, because he is such an asshole. While he was kinda unrepentant about bullying children and only left the DE because the woman he loved was targeted, he tried to protect her son afterwards instead of becoming the worst person ever out of despair. Fanfics writing from the perspective of a non OOC Snape are not easy to find. Naming your son after him was still too much, Harry.

In general its not the characters that make me read a fic, but the plot, the more original the better.

*** Hermione is NOT shy! She's a recluse with bad social graces, but she's not shy! If she were, then she would not freeze Neville in the first book or stand up to Ron (or Harry! Hell, she tells them off for losing points etc. and she lectures Ron about his pronounciation (and he calls her a friendless nightmare in return!))

** Hermione. Because I really like her. She's not perfect but she can be passionate about what she believes in. I think the conflict she brings about the non-magical and magical world balances out everything. That everything is not perfect and just because you've gotten used to it doesn't mean you can't make a change. Plus, I just really like her with Harry.

Daphne. She is one of the most flexible characters in the HPfanfiction world. The different ways authors give her life and background story is so... interesting and refreshing. Each author has their different take on Daphne's personality and family.

**** Yeah, I've read a few stories where she is much more open. Partners by muggledad; A Chance Encounter by spectre4hire; the Lion's trilogy by James Spookie are some of them. Dorothea Greengrass and Shygui also have different takes on her character in their stories, and all their fics are Haphne ships.

Haphne is my favorite HP pairing after Harmony.

**** Why the fuck do so many people write about Daphne? There's nothing I can think of her doing in canon. Hell, I only know her name cause of fanfiction. When I saw her the first time, I remembered something about her, but I couldn't think of anything about her but her name

She just seems like what people use instead of using OCs cause of the bias towards OC.

***** I don't use her much (had her spy for Voldemort in one scene), so I might not be exactly representative for her fanbase.

BUT

Basically, she is a Slytherin girl to fill the "rich upper class" fantasies without having to rewrite a character like you would have to for Pansy or Bellatrix. She was not a known Death Eater, so you don't have to worry on that front either. She is the go-to default for "hot Slytherin chick" if you want to write a "political" story because she is a pureblood and not dirt poor like the Weasleys.

Well, why invent horrible OC names when Rowling provided a neat list? Under ideal circumstances, you still ought to come up with some characterisation on your own. Then again, I write stories about Tonks, Lisa Turpin and Katie Bell, so I am abusing the hell out of that loophole.

** I enjoy reading stories that focus on Tom Riddle and/or Voldemort. He can be a fascinating character in the same vein as Hannibal Lector or Lex Luthor; a look at what an intelligent and charismatic person can be when they discard the rules of conventional morality as set down by society.

Riddle and his horcruxes also make a great framing device to explore philosophical concepts like ethics, identity, fate vs. free will, nature vs. nurture, etc.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Ron. I feel like there's a lot left on the table to explore with his character. His humor is a big plus for me, and i remember thinking how much charm his character had compared to others when I first read the series. I enjoy his place among the trio, sort of a emotional core of the group..the morale. It's rare you see a guy in positions like this in fiction. He's a bit of a mother hen, while being unbelievably brave to the point of recklessness for those he cares for. It's great to see fanfics that explore that, but alas few do.

*** Ditto. Snape is the entire reason I'm still in fandom, because he's a fascinating character and even now not all of his stories have been told. I'd like to see more complex fics about his upbringing and how his anti-Muggle feelings evolved (was he the classic small weird street kid whose life was made absolute hell by the neighborhood bullies?); why he styled himself the Half-Blood Prince in school when by rights he should have been ashamed of his Muggle blood (did he have a brief period of pushing back in frustration because he was tired of being treated like shit by his pureblood housemates?); how much his mother influenced his knowledge of the Dark Arts, and so on. He invented spells as a teenager; where did that experimental talent go? He was really bloody poor; I'd like to see writers who understand English industrial poverty tackle his family's home life. Did both his parents die young(ish)? There's so much to explore.

I'd like to see more fic detailing his evolving relationship with Dumbledore and the eleventh-hour shift in his moral compass to the tantalizing admission 'Lately, only those whom I could not save.' I would especially love to see more fic about that dreadful year as headmaster. He must have known he wouldn't make it out alive, and the only question about his death was when, not if. Plus, however much of a misanthrope Snape was, being hated by absolutely everybody, and knowing the people who used to be his colleagues might actually kill him one day, would have to be harrowing.

Anyway, yeah. He's a great source of drama, and the challenge of making him less of a caricature and more of a person is part of the appeal to me.

The Tonks family is a goldmine for original plots due to combining Black family stuff, Ministry/Auror stuff, the support of and fight against Pureblood supremacy and neutrality. They do not seem to be poor. Money to make things happen is available to a certain degree , so you aren't constrained from that angle.
