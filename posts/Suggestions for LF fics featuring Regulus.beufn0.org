Looking for LF fics told from Regulus' POV? Preferably canon-compliant as much as possible. Thank you.


** I don't know what LF means aside from “Looking for,” but for Regulus fanfics, you can't do better than Blackpool, and other stories by TheDivineComedian, such as the brand new story, Styx.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** There is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366][face death in the hope]] by LullabyKnell. It's really well written and it alternates between Harry and Regulus' points of view. It's very very slow going but it's the type of fix where you don't mind.

(Also, it should become slash at some point).
