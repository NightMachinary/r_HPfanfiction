First chapter (Harry's depiction) had me laughing. I thought to share my joy.


** Sometimes when I read a fic with a plot I've read before... a lot of times, I keep a mental checklist of obligatory tropes that typically comes with the package, and just for fun, I try to check off which ones this particular version of the premise uses. No offense to the author; hell, sometimes I want something simple and predictable.

Peggy Sue!Snape (particularly LESS ones) and post-war SSHG are probably the premises I've read the most which tends to fall into patterns, especially the former (at least the latter, by virtue of forcing the main characters away from canon stations, tend to have a bit more originality to them on average).

  Albus made a mistake on Voldemort's defeat left one twin with Dursleys and Proclaimed one twin as Boy-who-lived while James and Lily are in coma. What will Albus do when this mistake comes back to bite him in the ass several years later. Hadrian Potter is entering wizarding world with a bang and nothing will be same ever.

** There's no way that's not a spoof. Update: Read more. Still convinced it's a spoof.
