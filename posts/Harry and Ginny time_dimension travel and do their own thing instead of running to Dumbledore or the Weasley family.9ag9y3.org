First things first, I don't care if the time/dimensional travel is intended, an accident or the result of a hostile action. It doesn't matter if they exist as separate entities or take over their younger self, even if the first option would be preferred for plot reasons (no one takes a pair of 11-year-olds serious and you have the usual "we are adults, but we will wait for the age of consent before we have sex again" can of worms).

I know of countless stories where Harry and/or Ginny are thrown through time and space but end up their younger selves and don't do much because they are afraid to alter the timeline and so on. They usually either go to Dumbledore, the Weasleys or occasionally, the Marauders, for help. But are there any stories where they decide to do their own thing since last time they relied on "the light" and it obviously didn't work out.

Preferably without Death Eater whitewashing or Hermione paired with any Weasley, but I take what I can get.


** I totally love the concept of time travel in fiction, but I can't stand "let's preserve the timeline" plots. It's like, you have this amazing literary device and what you decide to do with it is the most boring, clichÃ© thing imaginable.

Suppose that Groundhog Day was filmed like this, instead of a guy taking advantage of his predicament he just had to repeat the same thing over and over to preserve the fabric of the universe or whatever. It would ruin the movie. As far as I'm concerned, the whole idea got old after Back to the Future and I don't want to see it again. Do interesting things with timetravel, for the love of Merlin.

Like, for example, there's this blinding light and then Harry wakes up having sex in the dark and decides to simply go along with the lifelike "dream", only to wake up the next morning and to realise that not only he is apparently in the 70s (BBC news talk about something in the Soviet Union for example), no he has actually had sex with his mother/Bellatrix Black/Malfoy's mum/Hestia Jones/literally anyone from the past. And the first words spoken are "You are not James".

***** I know that the biggest reason I wouldn't write this is getting the accurate BBC newscast for that day or something like that. I once spent two hours searching the internet for BBC 1 headlines for a specific day (breaking news was the Queen inaugurating the SIS building) because I wanted to use them in the story. Or half an hour searching for Finnish Weather archives dating back to January 1997. Or two hours trying to find out which planes were being operated on London -> Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the summer of 95.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107), meets your requirement of solving the plot without Dumbledore and breaking up Ron/Hermione, but only has Ginny doing the time travel.

** I read this recently written fic called Sling Shot where Harry ends up in his first year at Privet Drive I sure as to how he got there. It isn't until he sets off on the train that he realizes Ginny has also been sent back. They resolve to not have children get involved in a Wizarding War and change the timeline with unexpected results. The best bits are them trying to reason out how this happened, trying to solve the mystery

That's awesome. My biggest gripe with post DH stories is that the authors always claim that the characters love each other but besides the words, there is no proof (and one of the main reasons I utterly despise Ron/Hermione since most authors have them do nothing but fight, but it's ok because they love each other).

** How about they go back in time and instead of changing things on purpose they do it because they didn't know they all ready did change the timeline....

That might have been convoluted lol.

Anyhow if you're interested The Amulet of time series is time travel on a giant level. Across four stories the heroes (Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione) end up in three different times: the founders era (Harry and Ron create the game quidditch cringe worthy maybe but you get my comment above now.), 1940's WW2, and the marauders era.

It's a VERY long story and Harry is shipped with an OC before being shipped with Ginny.

It doesn't quite fit your wants but if you're at all interested it worth a read.

*** I'm not touching any WWII era time travel because either the protagonist does nothing to stop the death of ~50 million people (the Japanese were responsible for the other 20) or they do but now they have to come up with a complete AU history starting in 1933, including a vastly different cold war.
