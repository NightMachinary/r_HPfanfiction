Hello. I remember reading a Harry Potter & One Piece crossover fanfic with a 3P pairing of Ace/Harry/Luffy a while back. The only thing I can really remember is that there was around chapters (I think) and that it was deleted from [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]. However, I would still like to get ahold of the name and author or even an old link to the fic in hopes of seeing if there is any archival records of it.
