:END:
Lily and James never die, Harry is never the Boy Who Lived and becomes a Quidditch Player. He and Ginny go their separate ways after playing for Gryffindor at Hogwarts and play on separate quidditch teams until the World Cup team is announced. Eventual romance based on the fact that they sleep together during the whole thing based on strict rules about that sort of thing with other people.

Really want a chill Quidditch fic to read. Read too many dark fics.

** I don't know this one, but would be glad to read it if it's found.

However, I can recommend a different Harry-centric Quidditch fic (which I'm a few chapters behind in but) which I had been really enjoying is linkffn(13452914) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]]

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
