Y'know, James is only ever obsessed with Lily, Sirius is an energetical ladies' man, Lily avoids James in the most comical ways, Snape is a snivelly git. I've noticed a trend in Marauders fics where they always start in 7th year and are overly angsty. I'd like to avoid those.


** I apologize for not knowing how to link, but the Life and Times by Jewel5 starts the first day of sixth year, and is one of the most well received of all Marauders era. However, the ending will piss you off as it's a mix of completed/abandoned.

I'm thinking of writing a Marauder story so hopefully in a few months I can recommend my own :p

*** Second this one. Though all of the Marauders fic always make me sad, knowing what's waiting for them just a few years down the road...

Which is why I'm tempted to write a fic where Harry do a Peggy Sue "screw-them-all" style to save his parents :P. If anyone knows of any fic like this please recommend.
