**** She was found almost immediately by Tom Riddle, and just thought he was some silly boy who didn't know anything. The entire story is basically her complaining about how useless he is, unaware that he is actually a younger Voldemort.

  When Harry Potter goes back in time to fix things, we allow that he has to lie, manipulate, kill, and let a few good people die so as to kill Voldemort. Well, Peter Pettigrew once went back in time, too.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

** There's a few up on Rough Trade right now. 'Slytherin Black' is a personal favourite. You'll need to register to read, but it's worth it. FYI, slash abounds on that site, and Slytherin Black in particular is a very rare Sirius/OMC pairing. The writing quality is good, but it's fairly tropey and may not be to your taste for that reason--pretty heavy Dumbledore and Weasley (Molly/Ginny only?) bashing, plus a lot of House/political stuff. It's in progress, as all the works on Rough Trade are.
