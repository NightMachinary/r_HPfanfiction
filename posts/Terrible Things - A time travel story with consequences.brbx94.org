So I've been working on my first fic, it's on fanfiction.net linkffn(13260084) and AO3 linkao3(18455381). Basically it's a realistic view of a​n ​immortal Harry that unwittingly gets stuck reliving his life. I would love any constructive criticism or feedback!


** For context I'm in a bit of a fanfiction slump at the moment so that will doubtless colour my feedback.

I found myself loosing interest by the end of chapter two. I think this is because we're so trapped in Harry's head that there's really no space of any drama. The stakes aren't presented well enough to your audience.

I think it would be a big deal if the chosen one suddenly collapsed, but I felt we didn't get to see the Order stressing over this. If Harry is overwhelmed by the situation he's found himself in, I feel that the world should be presented as overwhelming. Instead he wakes up has a brief conversation then apperates and sleeps some more? Missed opportunity.

The stakes are undermined when Harry can */"promptly rolled over and immediately fell asleep"/* even though he has presumably traveled through time, had an unforeseen magical accident and now looks like his younger self, who is also missing. IF Harry doesn't care about the state of the world, why should I?

Harry is supposed to be this distant immortal? Because he thinks, speaks and reacts like canonical Harry. If his mind has been combined with teenage Harry, then we should get some impression of mental dissonance that must be occurring. For reference Nightmare Of Future Past covers this explicitly with the two souls conversing in a dreamscape. I don't recommend you be that explicit but as it stands, it's absence is noted.

Halfway through chapter 2 you change tense while he boils water. Then a paragraph later you switch back to third-person limited in past tense.

Harry's exposition dump about the vampire coven was just that; exposition. It was at this point that I lost interest.

I apologise if this comes across a harsh, I don't wish to deter you from your writing and I wish you the best going forward.

Perhaps take a look at https:

*** It didn't come across as harsh, I really appreciate the feedback. How would you recommend moving forward to correct these issues? Or would you rewrite the first few chapters I already have and go from there?

**** There's two contradictory pieces of advice I've been unable to reconcile.

I think completing a story, at whatever standard you can manage is really useful. Lots of fanfiction authors have a well conceptualized first acts, but struggle with the transition to 2nd and final act. Going through that struggle would be really useful. Quantity has a quality all of its own, as they say.

But the other theory can be summed up as, 'The Art of Writing is in the Rewriting.' Maybe it would be worth going back and workshopping each chapter to be the best it can be.

I think I lean more towards the former than the latter. You probably have more than one story to write, so this one doesn't need to be a masterpiece. You just need to learn something from it.

Plus you've already got yourself an audience. So you're already writing to the standard that they expect. Finish this story as is, then start a new one but with all the experience you've gained along the way.

***** Thank you, this seems like really sound advice. And I can tell that I am already learning a lot just by what I've written so far. Thank you for taking the time to reach out to me!

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Harry had always been warned that "terrible things" happen those who meddle with time. But nothing bad had happened in the last several hundred years, so he really wasn't worried. Well not until he literally runs into his younger self. Now things are a little sticky...
