I remember reading it, probably over six years ago now and I completely forget what it was called. But I really liked it.

She decides or has to stay in the past and is the same age as marauder aged characters by the time harry is school aged.

I think she hides her identity from dumbledore, but he helps her any way.

Vague memories of it being very lemony

Any help is appreciated.


** You /might/ be talking about One Hundred and Sixty Nine. I think she pretends to be Swiss (similar to french?) and it is a HG/SB. But everything else you said is right including her staying in the past and Dumbledore helping her. linkao3(1124404)

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

*** I don't think that's it, thanks though.

I only started reading hg/SB in the last couple of years, it's not really my ship of choice.

But it sounds exciting so I'll read it either way!

Thanks

**** Yeah this fic is REALLY well done. I am a hardcore RL/SB shipper, but I loved this. It is one of my all time favorite time travel fics.

*** Thanks I was really hopeful this was it.

It's already in my library though and I've read it so many times. It's fun, but she's not French, just an "exchange" I had a memory of her appearance being changed to.

I'll keep reading, you never know.

Thanks again

  Draco meant to send her to the future, to a world ruled by Lord Voldemort. He really ought to read directions before he goes messing with other people's things. Hermione finds herself stuck in the past (The 70s!), pretending to be something she's not (Average!) and fighting with everything she has to keep from changing the future.
