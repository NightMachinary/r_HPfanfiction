As the title says, I'm in search of f/f (or femslash, if you will). I'm not super interested in porn for the sake of porn, but mature content is okay with me. I'd like it to be decently long and possibly completed.

Bonus points for anything involving Luna Lovegood. Thanks in advance!

Nothing super long (except Black Ink, Red Rose) or involving Luna, sorry.

  “You're being childish. Not everything is about winning and losing.”

  Ginny frowned at Hermione's nonchalance. --Ron and Hermione have recently broken up, and Ginny --- concerned for her best friend --- has decided that the only thing for Hermione to do now is to date someone new to make Ron jealous.

** My WIP is called Luna Lovegood and the Forgotten Circle, it's on both AO3 and FFN. It's an AU where Luna starts an alternative blood magic school for girls. The ship is Luna/Ginny but romance isn't the focus.

Hope you find lots to read! I love Luna and f/f :)

  Luna Lovegood grows up a Seer, the child of prophecy, and best friends with Ginny Weasley. After Ginny is possessed by the Dark Lord during her first year at Hogwarts, Luna founds a magical school for girls to explore the ancient art of women's blood magic, defensive magic, and rhetorical diplomacy. She fights the rising tide of darkness with this new brand of old magic, putting her at odds with the Ministry, Hogwarts, and Harry Potter. Luna must choose between traditions when a darker power rises to threaten her brave new world.

***** IIRC, the bigger reason was that it runs the risk of getting this sub banned. Reddit TOS don't allow underage sexual content, which this sub already arguably violates on the regular with the amount of underage smut present in HP fanfiction. If the Reddit mods noticed us sharing a story that has child prostitution in the first chapter, and paedophile characters who aren't depicted as evil straight away... well, they might decide it's a bridge too far.

If the sub mods are doing it themselves, they shouldn't. It is a harry potter fanfic that fits the criteria.

If it's being moderated for reddit as a platform doesn't that break the whole purpose of subreddits? Because it is a response to a specific group, answering the question of that group (as above)
