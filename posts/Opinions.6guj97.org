On a scale from one to ten, how horrible is this? What could be changed? The intent is *not* self promotion but *improvement.*

** Read the first chapter. Definitely not my cup of tea. Your Harry doesn't fell like he's eleven years old, much more like a teenager of maybe 14. There are also a few stereotypical fanfiction tropes in there. For example the special wand cores. Harry is already a very special character, he's the boy who lived, and I think he doesn't need a fancy wand to prove how special he is. Another thing is the Dursley abuse. Harry was neglected, but fanfiction really tends to blow things out of proportion, and I think the way your Harry thinks about them at the beginning of the first chapter quite melodramatic. Also, your Harry is far too powerful and has far too much of an understanding of the magical world for a boy who discovered it just weeks ago. If you want to go for a believable powerful Harry, canon Hermione could be an orientation in terms of magical knowledge. The brief shift to Zabini's point of view at the end of the chapter was odd.

Sorry, I know that was quite a harsh review, and I know that writing is much harder than reviewing.

*** You know, locking anyone into a cupboard sized space counts as inhuman treatment. Keeping a child there for ten years can be described as either child abuse or as torture, depending how much he was allowed out (and based on canon I tend to the later). Also it is not considered unusual when Petunia swings a frying pan at Harry's head. Should she connect serious injury and even death are quite possible results. The casual way such things are mentioned says a lot more than the act itself.

The Dursleys committed child abuse in hundreds of counts over sixteen years. That's not some exaggeration but merely Rowling's canon.

*** The Dursley abuse is very different than the ones in canon. It involves pure hate, envy, and disgust. The Dursleys believe that magic is abnormal and here, they've taken it to the extreme. As for information, that's in the chapters where books are explained to have their own brand of magic and yes, Zabini was odd.

*** And honestly, I had this...

"Yes, let's add a stupid bookworm to a story when you already have competent and intelligent protagonists like Harry and Daphne. A dumb bookworm, who in canon, would've got everyone relieved of their souls if Harry had listened to her in their third year. Whose idea of secrecy was to hang a parchment with all of the DA's members on it in the same room where they were practicing. Who turned her back on a Death Eater in the middle of a duel in the Ministry. Who was stupid enough not to at least investigate what made the Prince's methods so superior to others. Who was incompetent enough to get caught by a DE, while apparating to Grimmauld Place and consequently compromising the only safe house they had. Who was snarrow-minded enough to completely disbelieve the existence of the most mundane Hallow - the wand - based on the few books she'd read - as if reading a few on wandlore suddenly makes you an authority on them

Hermione's so-called accomplishments during school look like a joke when compared with the Prince's, let alone Tom or Dumbledore.

So why is she even in this story? What does she contribute that Harry and Daphne and the rest cannot come up with together? Or are we going to have to read endless paragraphs of her ramming her face up the rear orifice of every authority figure and blindly believing all their rules, even when said figures could not even prevent the local celebrity from getting cruciated under their watch? And then blindly believing Dumbles when he tried to cover things up?

Fail. Absolute fail."

So it could be worse.

(Edit: This is a review from another guy). Actually, sorry for including this. The "it" was supposed to be the harsh criticism.

** Does a bit too much wrong for my taste.

1.) The Dialogue is choppy; it feels like I'm reading a really bad Manga. There is no real flow, and once again, for a first-person POV, Harry's thoughts are all gone.

2.) Magic feels very stupid in your world. I don't know how to put it any nicer, but, it just feels incredibly basic and boring, as if whole bricks are being left out of the foundation in your magic.

3.) The whole Dursley abuse thing is blown way out of proportion. It adds an unnecessary element to the story that you will likely just drop at some point. We get it, the Dursleys are horrible, etc, etc... but I can't help but feel that giving Harry family members that either care for him or have a distant respect, would be a whole of a lot better than a Harry that is for some ambiguous reason beaten by Vernon Dursley. It's dumb.

4.) The Ollivander scene was boring and uninteresting. You would think that people would try some nice variations for Harry getting his wand, but nope. It feels more like he's asking a Blacksmith to make him a sword than he is asking someone to make his lifetime companion in the Wizarding World.

5.) For the Love of God, why do you put him in the house where people are supposed to hate him when you just change it so that there are several people that like him? What is the point? Might as well put him in Gryffindor and skip the bashing that I know will come. At least Ron and Hermione are somewhat fleshed out.

Tl;dr Read The Magicians, then read Magician's Land (skip Magician King). It's a better way to show you what you do bad and what you could do better/how you treat magic.

Duels shouldn't be "He threw a ton of curses in a spell-chain", as the concept of spell-chains is relatively dumb in itself. Don't be afraid to keep in finger movements (say, for Wandless Magic or something) and incantation (just spam Google translate and mix languages or rephrase things with IO, UM, or any other magicy language at the end, you can combine languages too), as it still needs to be said in your head anyways (and more powerful spells are harder to call upon without being spoken unless you do it often).

By that I mean you're hat tipping and heading off things from canon rather than letting them develop by themselves, a fanfiction for fanfiction readers, maybe I've read to much but it feels like you're trying to fix/ write a more 'realistic' canon rather than your own tale.

** Right, so ... some critique:

- As noted, the narration, which is presumed to be done by Harry, is not one that a eleven year old kid of any kind would be able to deliver.

- The scene with Ollivander is ... well, bleech. To start with, it takes Ollivander and changes him from how we know him as a character to something ... much different; Garrick has a storageful of premade wands so that he'd be able to fit everyone and their grandmother and her pet kneazle with a /proper/ wand as before his time people just brought a piece of wood and a core material to a wandmaker and got ... some wand, more often than not one that wasn't best for them or really for anyone, and what Garrick did is somewhat revolutionary and something that only happened because of his strong conviction. As such, him offering to make custom wands from the get-go is very out of character, and him having “a plethora of materials” for wand cores is also out as he sticks to three specific kinds /for a reason/, that being that a lot of the time other cores are simply subpar in comparison., and we get back to his conviction once again there. Since it's the second thing we get in the story, after a short intro about how Dursleys are evil, him being oh-so-damn-indifferent is also kind of ... hmm, let's say annoying; you don't show indifference by narrating everything and then writing that the character didn't care, especially when that character is narrating, as that gives the readers a “the character totally cares but is being edgy because fucking tantrum” kind of feeling. Also, Harry getting two cores just screams “Harry is a special fucking snowflake”, and as the swear word's presence there shows it rather isn't something good; if you have to give him a wand that is different from the canon one for whatever reason then take a look at Madame Rowling's writings about wand woods and cores and try to match what you see there with the concept of the character, not only will it be an actual nod to canon but it will also let you avoid inserting cliched ... something, for the sake of making the story more edgy or more dark.

- On a random note, while I can understand naming the owl Hedwig because of course everybody does that, in canon Harry had only named her /after/ his journey to Diagon Alley came to an end, and he'd named her after someone he read about, so if your Harry is oh-so-dark then it's kind of unexpected for him to be reading the same kind of material which likely would have to be the case for Hedwig to be named the same.

- The introduction of Daphne. No, please, not only is a eleven year old kid not going to start narrating about someone the very first time they meet that they are oh-so-stunningly-beautiful (a few years too young, at the very least), but you are pretty much waxing poetic in their descriptions which is rather bad (to put it bluntly: you are not far from calling their eyes “orbs”, and doing that probably counts as a crime). Also, Harry having been reading about pureblood customs ... ~sigh~, can we please not do something as cliche as that? It's neither foreshadowed nor does this actually add anything to the story, and as such it comes across as something of a power wank.

- Also, after getting to the end of the first chapter, there is no conflict to be seen because whatever happens Harry is automatically better, or at least it appears so. That is ... quite bad, really, because starting with the main character being overpowered tends to be a very bad idea outside of parody stories, which this one isn't.

- The random spellcasting on the train. This is a big change from canon, as none of them actually knew, or at least not officially, any spells before their first year, and while the Protego in the previous chapter was annoying and came across as something of a Mary Sue manoeuvre, the Petrificus Totalus is worse because it's pretty much a proclamation that the previous one is not a mistake but instead the whole thing is yet another power wank. Power wanks aren't good unless you are writing a story for children and teenagers starved for edgy stuff.

- On another random note, Hagrid doesn't tend to drop the starting “H” when he speaks, nor does he do what you had him do when he spoke to McGonagall. His speech can be hard to get, so if you aren't sure (there was a post about his specific accent somewhere at this place, you'd have to search for it if you want to find it but that's a way to get more sure) it may be better to just write his speech normally. This isn't really any kind of terminal offence or anything, but when combined with the stuff already there is can be seen as one more bad sign by readers because you've already had Harry pretty much dismiss Hagrid.

- Also, “battlements”, not “battalions”; again not a terminal offence but when you have Harry use a lot of words he probably wouldn't know in the narration, using a completely different word when describing something that probably has no plot significance of any kind is ... well, not good, and likely to be seen as a sign of lack of competence.

- Harry's sudden criticism of the house system comes across as an “oh gosh I am so much fucking better than everyone because I am perfect and they are filthy and flawed” kind of whining. No, please, just no. If you have to criticise the house system, heck, if you have to criticise anything, then there are much better ways than ... that.

- The hat's ramblings could actually have come decently if they were done as a minor parody of what the had could have gone through rather than a reply to Harry's “oh gosh another disgusting person touches my perfect presence” whine.

- Basic spellcheck. I do realise it can be difficult to get a hold of a beta reader able to catch everything, but it's not hard to get a hold on a text editor with basic spellcheck that allows for adding words and marks those that aren't in its dictionary. Because, while you are way above the average in that regard, things like “Durlseys” and “empahsizing” still shouldn't have happened precisely because a basic spellchecker should have been able to stop it from happening.

That's as far as I got as I don't have the time to get further and not only you do have critique from others already but I've managed to put a minor wall of text here as well.
