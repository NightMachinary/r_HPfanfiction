Okay so this is totally based upon The Hidden Hero. I have yet to find a fic like it and to this day it remains one of my favourite ever fanfictions and I HIGHLY recommend it. Holy shit I want to reread it but I also don't want to.

^{Please} don't ignore this post lol.^

Also please no "Hadrian-The-Son-Of-Bellatrix" tropes if you'd be so kind. Nor a Regulus/Remus/Sirius raised fic. Orphanage/Dursley raised is preferred,because I want it to focus on Harry looking after himself and the Wizarding world with no outside help or recognition, whilst simultaneously trying to desperately hide his identity as the BWL. (Also I know this sounds like every WBWL story ever but eh)

If you haven't, go read The Hidden Hero because it's hands down AWESOME.

Anyway I hope ya'll are staying happy, occupied and safe ✌️


** "Hello, I'm Harry Potter."

"You're the Boy-Who-Lived!"

"No, I'm not. I've read about him, and I can't remember doing any of that shit. Must be a different Harry Potter."

"You've got the scar!"

"I got it in the car crash that killed my parents. My aunt told me. I hadn't even heard about magic until I turned 11."

"You've got the glasses!"

"Dude ..."

** Does being raised by a different family, while still hiding his identity from the greater world count?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby]] does this, except he's considered a half-blood. Luna +kidnaps+ rescues Harry to be +safe+ her husband. He ends up waiting a year to go to Hogwarts. It completely wrecks the plot. They dye his hair and surgically remove /most/ of the scar and say it's from a car accident.

Besides the few people they tell, only like three people actually find out. But overall, it stays a secret.

** this kind of happens in my fic Iron? but it's more bc Harry is born with a different name and changes his name to Harry as a child, which the Hogwarts student register automatically updates, and no one knows where the "Girl-Who-Lived" is. a few of the teachers start to figure it out where i've left off (mostly bc Harry asks Snape what the dorm situation is for trans students + Snape notices how much Harry looks like James Potter, and he puts it together), and Harry tells his politics-obsessed Slytherin roomies that he's a distant cousin of the Potters so they don't figure it out. my plan is for no one to know he's the Chosen One until 6th year.

the fic's on hiatus rn and i probably won't be updating it until summer. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18572623/chapters/44025565]]
