Fics like Inquisitor Carrow, where he comes back after a lifetime of war as an Adeptus Astartes, like Basilisk Born (I think that's the name) where he gets cast back in history to the time of Merlin, like Hell Eyes, where it turns out James Potter wasn't /quite/ from around here, like The Katarn Side, where a retired Jedi with a penchant for boots to the head swings by and scoops him up towards the stars, etcetera! I don't care if it's fem!Harry, or slash, or anything at all. Thanks in advance!
