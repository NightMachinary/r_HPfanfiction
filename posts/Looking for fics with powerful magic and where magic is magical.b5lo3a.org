I've been really wanting to read some fics that have Harry or some other character performing feats of magic that awe and inspire, and give magic that magical feel back that so many fics seem to lack these days. I want to read something that brings back the wonder of magic again.

I'd prefer het or no pairings if possible.

Thanks in advance!


** Canon HP Magic is very powerful already. I actually don't see the need to beef it up or wank it even more. The main problem with so many fics, including the canon 7 Books, is the inconsistent application of canon magic to jam through some particular plot.

In canon, we have some quite powerful magic such as Fidelius Charm, Unbreakable Vows, Veritaserum, and all kinds of interesting transfigurations and charms. But somehow, characters would conveniently ‘forget' to use them for whatever plot reasons. When inventing her wonderful magical plot devices, JKR apparently didn't consider whether their repeat uses would break her world or not.

I've seen many fics, especially postwar Auror Harry ones, reducing them to basically Muggles. I have seen many crossovers that nerf HP magic so the characters still face challenges. I have seen many fics with combat scenes that boil down to “bad guys throwing Unforgivables, good guys responding with Stunners”.

Very disappointing.

*** And that's the main reason I'm looking for these kinds of fics. HP canon has some amazing pieces of magic, but almost everything is in singular doses. The fights between Voldemort and Harry just seem like gunfights most of the time. I was just looking for something to make it seem magical again, with the big flashes and the type of stuff little me would have imagined with wide eyes and wonder. Just looking over them, these fics seem to fit the bill. Thanks!

*** As for individual fics that show HP canon magic in its full glory, here are some:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929), is the name of an aircraft carrier which they converted into spaceship capable of interstellar colonization.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), is my top crossover with ASOIAF. It shows how easy is it for Ginny and Sirius to build an empire in that land with HP magic in its full power.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), has many excellent combat scenes. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort are awesome. And there are some very scary applications of the Alchemy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), goes quite deep into dark arts and ward breaking.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), pits Harry's super transfiguration against Voldemort's extreme dark arts.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

**** I love Wind Shear. It's a great example of how badass a combatant is who becomes a complete MASTER of one specific technique - here, Harry's weird hybrid of animation and elemental transfiguration.

This may be interesting, though it's very AU for magic mechanics. Still quite interesting in their applications

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
