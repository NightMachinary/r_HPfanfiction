I'm planning to write a Post DH fanfiction (main goal: focusing on how Harry and the others will cope with the Hogwarts battle and so on) But I need more informations. I wish I could know more about the Pensieve? How does it really work? Its function is due to the runes? No idea Does anyone know if I can find this information in any ff?


** I think its called runemaster, i just type in harry learns runes in google and it shows in one of the first reddit links
