I dont have a lot of hope anymore but i guess it never hurts to try. Some time ago i read a fic combining HP and Pokemon and i am afraid it got deleted. Harry, Ron, Hermione plus Ash and Dracos brother maybe? attended Hogwarts. The houses were named after Pokemon. I think Harry went to House Mewtwo and Giovanni was the head of the house. The fic was hosted on ffn. I am eternally greatful for help !

edit: I know it should be flaired as Fic-Search, i just havent realised yet how that works on the phone, sorry.


** Top right the three dots then edit flair. Can't help with the fic though sorry

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
