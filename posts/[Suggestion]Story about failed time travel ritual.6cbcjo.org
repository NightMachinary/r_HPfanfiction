I've read a lot of stories on time travel and often they use some sort of ritual to send harry or whoever back.

I have not seen many failed attempts at this though. I could see some fun stories about losing magic or age and staying in current timeline.

A couple ideas that i had while falling asleep last night.

Crack fic. 6th year harry does ritual to go back, ends up basically in a coma but can still see whats going on. Ginny or luna or whoever finds him in room of requirement and has her way with him then rents him out to other girls (or boys) to get rich. maybe allow ghosts to possess body as well. sell parts of him for potions or other rituals.

Plenty of opportunity for shenanigans and fun shit to happen.

Next idea.

Drama, adventure, humour, or romance. Harry decides to do ritual without talking to others, maybe gets idea from a book from room of requirement. Idea is to send magic back and it will take knowledge with it (common theme) but this time it just steals his magic.

From there it could go in multiple directions.

Drama/adventure: He gets confused due to not being able to see hogwarts or maybe muggle repelling wards. Runs off and has to figure things out and maybe still defeat voldy. This storyline could go into the whole muggle life thing you see sometimes without him choosing to not be a wizard anymore.

You could also go with Humour/adventure. Harry tries to hide his missing magic while still going to classes and hunting horcruxes and what not. Leaning on others to do the work and using magic objects to fake still having magic.

Lastly, if you like the romance option you can insert whatever other person(s) you want for harry to lean on and work through stuff with.

If i was any good at writing it would write some short stories for people to play with but i suck so hopefully someone else finds this amusing.

Cheers.


** If dimension jumping counts, I remember reading one (it might be 0800-rent-a-hero?) where Harry gets pulled into a 5th year world by a botched summoning, and arrives looking as though he's been pulled through a shredder. He then gets blackmailed by Dumbledore into staying on as the Divination teacher.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

*** I'm thinking more along the lines of him staying in original dimension with consequences.

****** Thanks!

Edit: this was a time loop paradox story. Which while interesting was still not what im going for.

I want a story in which harry(or whoever) stays in the same universe same time same everything but has to deal with the results of his failed ritual or whatever method.

The stories always have him succesfully (with or without issues) go somewhere or somewhen and proceed from there. I want him to not go away but still have to pay.

******* ahhh sorry I don't think I can help in that case :( I'm intrigued by the idea, though~ I've had vague ideas for a time travel story on the back burner for a while now. I want to do the thing properly, though, and make the time travel more than just a single use plot device to stick adult Harry in 1991.
