Hello everyone!

I'm grappling with writing a fic with Professor Potter as a premise. There are a lot of interactions with the Hogwarts community in general that I've thought about, but I'm undecided on whom I want Harry to teach. The most central of premises is a post-Albus world-be it in any era.

The overarching point of the fic is to determine how Harry responds to the same pressures as Dumbledore in being the chief magical power in the community and yet be at Hogwarts.

To accomplish this, whom do you believe Harry should teach? There are two difficulties in writing the students: familiarity in the students themselves, and in setting up a realistic premise. There is also the issue of shipping to be considered, although I'm not a huge romance writer in general.

It'd be easiest to write a post-canon premise on Harry teaching. It'd be the most challenging to write about all OC characters that Harry would be teaching however.

Writing about Harry's contemporaries in Hogwarts would be the easiest in writing about the students, but moderately challenging writing a premise that fit.

Writing about the Marauders would be relatively easy about the students, but the most difficult in writing a coherent history without Dumbledore.


** After the war era is the best. In a way, he follows both Dumbledore and Riddle and also can improve relations between the house. Btw, waiting for the fic

*** Yeah the only challenge is figuring out OC character names of both student and staff. Has the most opportunity for improvement of the school though

** for some reason I prefer them in the Marauders era. I think it's because there is that little bit of distance from his classmates, and also this â€˜mysterious powerful stranger' phenomenon; rather than the man who conquered or the other ridiculous names. I also have little interest int next gen, so unless it's a fic that centers around Harry's relationships with adults I don't really care enough about it

While I love the idea of Harry becoming a professor for some reason once I know he is one my interest fails

---but then I have that problem with interest once Harry gets out of the Dursleys quite often too

There are always exceptions to this though

*** What are you talking about with that Dursley comment?

Understood and agree otherwise. It's definitely the most common Professor Potter fic type

** I have never seen a professor harry teaching dumbledore. But that would be extremely difficult because of all the OC's so I think a harry's parents story because you get the "where did this guy come from". I also prefer a kinda powerful Harry so like in the fist class he does some insane magic or maybe later he defends the students during a hogsmead weekend.

*** Yeah that's wayyyy out of my depth, definitely not going to have Harry teach Dumbledore.

I tend to like the fics you point out though

**** This is an abandoned fic, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/589726/chapters/1060711][The Prince and The Professor]] has this.

It's snape/lily if that bothers you, but it never actually gets to that point, because like i said, it's abandoned.

** Personally, while I don't /mind/ Marauder-era Professor Potter (I've read a couple, IIRC Wind Shear did it, and there's also the unfinished The Prince and the Professor), my issue with it is that typically, the interaction with the Marauders, Snape, and others of that era usually detract from the whole Professor aspect. Which isn't a bad thing, but if the main focus of a fic is Harry being a Professor, I think it's better done in nextgen.
