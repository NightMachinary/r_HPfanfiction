***** Maybe that is indeed the norm in other places, it seems to vary in the HP book series. I have never read a book that uses single quotation marks, and I have read the Harry Potter series dozens of times in secret. I have only encountered this style of writing in rare online stories. The Oxford Guide to Style itself even states that doubt quotes are preferred. It also coincidentally mentions that it is okay to change single to double when localizing the text. So, while it isn't wrong to do so, it also isn't correct. A matter of style as the link implies. [[http://www.eng-lang.co.uk/ogs.htm]]

There isn't anything wrong about measuring the distance to the next city in millimeters either. I'm not irritated that they used single quotation marks precisely. It's the lack of uniformity with most stories that stops me from being immersed.

I had to do so in secret because I had a bit of a Vernon problem myself.

** I wrote this from the POV of a muggle who's wondering what's up with this weird coworker. It's complete.

I just updated this one, about Merope's muggle rape victim, Tom Riddle. Now that he knows about magic, he's determined to exploit it to his own ends, not be victimized by it.

**** Mwa ha ha! I actually started writing the sequel to this, but this story has been so unpopular, I got discouraged and didn't finish it. I assumed there was no demand for a sequel. Possibly most people who read it smashed their reading devices and swore off fanfiction forever immediately after reading that ending.

There is a way back up from this. “John,” trying to get away from it all, learns why it's a bad idea to buy a cheap international portkey from Mundungus Fletcher. Kingsley regrets his earlier actions and tries to recruit Beth to track down their mutual friend so he can apologize. Awkward conversation ensues. But you know how Kingsley read her memory? If he saved a copy...

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Oh, and this is my play on the marriage law trope. Lucius is forced to marry a muggle stripper. I've posted only two chapters so far, but I want to assure any readers who were scared away by my Employee of the Month story that this story, unlike that one, will have a happy ending. Well, happy from the point of view of a Death Eater and his bride, at least.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.
