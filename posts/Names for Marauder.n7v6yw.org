Do you have any suggestions to nicknames for a female Marauder?

It's for a fanfic I'm working on. She's the twin of Sirius and her Animagus form is a dog. It's similar to Sirius' but in a white colour.

I would like it to fit with Moony, Padfoot and Prongs.


** Well Marauder nicknames are designed to take the piss out of their forms, which is something most writers forget. They are supposed to be unflattering in a good natured way, but they should not really be accessible to those not in the know.

The problem is that Marauder nicknames are generic since Padfoot could theoretically apply to any dog, so you've sort of written yourself into a corner by giving both Sirius and his twin functionally the same form, which also gives me some weird vibes.

**** Well that depends on the criteria you want to use, i.e. is it random? or is it dictated by the personality of the animagus.\\
The Animagi we know of in canon are all appear to be relatively common British wildlife, so I have a few Ideas.\\
1) Some form of Corvid; Crow, Magpie, Jackdaw or Blackbird. These are much more common than Ravens in the UK. This one's is nice as we haven't seen a bird animagus in canon. Names could be 'Miss Beaky', 'Miss Dour', 'Miss Feathers' or something of that ilk. Could also work well if she's perhaps more melancholic than the rest.

2) Fox. Keeps the canine connection with Sirius. Nicknames might be Miss Screechy or something maybe Miss Dustbin at a stretch as foxes are well known for scavenging in the bins, and making an awful racket while mating when you are trying to sleep.

***** Thank you very much. I like the ideas. Definitely something I will consider much more than my own original idea. So far my character is definitely more melancholy than the others so it would fit rather perfectly. Also I prefer that the type of Animagus is linked to the personality of the characters.

** I mean they're all named for features of their animal forms so it depends what you were thinking she looks like.

** I vote for either "Phantom" or for "Pooka". (Pooka's are shape-changers, & can take the appearance of horses, goats, cats, dogs, & hares.)

** first off all Marauder names should be extremely obvious about the animal and simple but fun

If she's like Padfood but white, could be Miss Longbite, Puffhair

You can also call her Miss Redeye if her form is that of an albino as I think the best description of Sirius's form is similar to that of a Tibetan Mastiff or a Cane Corso and neither come naturally in white. But Albinism could explain it

** I think if you're going to have her be a dog also, maybe have her nickname be based on the color instead of the animal? I vote for snowflake LOL Or just whitey? Idk

** I would suggest something like Astra or Stela ( both meaning Star) and just have her have a white patch of fur on her forehead when in Animagus form. this serves both to distinguish her from her brother, be something that only those who know of her dog form can get the meaning of and be in line with Moony's name, so it's not that dissimilar.
