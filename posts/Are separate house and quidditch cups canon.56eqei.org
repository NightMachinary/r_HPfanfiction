In some fabrication there are separate house cups decided by the points awarded in classes and quidditch cups decided by the point differentals in the quidditch matchs. However in other ones there is no quidditch cups and the point differentals go into the house cup race, and I guess there isn't really a winner for the quidditch season, it's just 3 individual matches.

Which one of those is canon? Or is it not really explained.


** They're seperate, as evidenced by Gryffindor winning the House Cup but /not/ the Quidditch Cup in PS and CoS. They are completely seperate; the House Cup points are for academic achievements/failures and good/bad behaviour. The Quidditch Cup points are tallied depending on game scores in matches. This is why Gryffindor had to wait until they were 50 points ahead in their match against Slytherin in POA before Harry could catch the snitch; if they weren't, they wouldn't have got the 200 point margin needed to get the cup even if they'd still won the match.

Also, just as a note, there are 6 matches a year:

- Gryffindor-Slytherin
- Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff
- Gryffindor-Ravenclaw
- Slytherin-Hufflepuff
- Gryffindor-Hufflepuff
- Slytherin-Ravenclaw

We just never see anything about the non-Gryffindor matches.

*** I meant 3 matches from that teams perspective. If there wasn't a quidditch cup then the other matches wouldn't matter to them.

Thanks for the info. I thought it was separate, but sometimes fics combine them which confused me.

** They're separate, but POA suggests the winners of the QC win points for the HC; I think it says their win of the HC that year was helped by the QC.

** The QC is separate from the House Cup, first year RavenClaw wins the Quidditch Cuo (we can assume this from the knowledge Gryffindor beat both Hufflepuff and Slytherin on page but they lost when Harry was in Madam Pomfree's care post Qurrelmort. But we know for sure that Gryffindor wins the House Cup that year.

Now I believe, I'm not sure, but I think the points of the game are also added as house points, eg: Gryffindor beats Hufflepuff 340-110, Gryffindor gets 340 house points as well, Hufflepuff 110 additional house points
