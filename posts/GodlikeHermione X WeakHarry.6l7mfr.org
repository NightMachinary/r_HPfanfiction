** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) hasn't been updated in a long time, unfortunately. I'm looking at you, [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]].

linkffn(Adorable Violence by Cloud Zen) is a one-shot along these lines.

Nooooo, don't look at meeee.

Seriously, I just need to push out those next few chapters.

I'm back to posting stuff again ([[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/8666100/][here]] in a DCU fanfic, for example) and I'll get through my editing pile backlog one of these days to finish up all those waiting stories.

Nothing is dead yet.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

*** Indeed, poor Harry...his upbringing left him weak (he really doesn't assert himself often IMHO, he only defends his friends and sometimes the truth ("Voldemort really is back!"), but he never confronts others over their bad behaviour towards himself (like those badges or that heir of Slytherin stuff - IMHO he should have told Hermione and the guys at the Hogshead to "go fuck yourself" because they didn't stick up for him and believed the media over a fellow student and thus they don't deserve his training and if they die because of that, then that's Dumbledore's fault because he didn't fight tooth and nail to block Umbridge!) or tells people that, no he doesn't want to do this (Hermione her bossyness and drive to study!) right now!) to this kind of thing, but any woman who goes after him and uses that weakness is kind of despicable (and/or insecure!)

**** I am not sure what your point is here. You seem to be suggesting that canon Harry /is/ a submissive, which would mean that a femdom relationship may in fact be good for him. (Me, I am not sure. I don't think that he's the natural leader that fanon often portrays him as, but he certainly doesn't like taking orders.)

**** Powerful!Harry does NOT mean weak everybody else (it just means that he's the exception to the rule, but that doesn't mean that everybody else is stupid and weak and it also doesn't mean that he will pick up an abused girl/woman as his girlfriend who will be utterly dependent on him and will only say "Yes dear! How high, dear?" when asked to jump or do something for him!), femdom stuff (and powerful female characters in modern media in general) often means exactly that (look at superhero movies with female heroes - they have to put all their male counterparts to shame, don't they? They can't have a weakness? They can't be human underneath all that "I am badass"-ness etc. :( )

***** 1. In absolute terms, Powerful!Harry indeed does not mean Weak!everybody else; but power is relative, especially if the threat is scaled to match the new power level of the protagonist. (Where the threat is not scaled, the power-up is usually pointless in the first place.)
2. Snark aside, the point is that Powerful!Hermione/Weak!Harry (with weakness being relative) is no more inherently femdom than Powerful!Harry/Weak!Hermione (again, relatively) is inherently maledom/Gorean. If it were all about magical power differentials, the relationship between Snape's parents would be femdom, since Tobias Snape was a Muggle; and yet it clearly wasn't. For that matter, in the two fics I linked, Harry isn't submissive at all.

I do agree with you about superhero media to a point. The way I see it, we, as a culture, are still trying to sort out what to do with superheroines, especially if they appear in comics and films alongside superheroes. They have to be badass, because they are superheroines, and we can't give them the Damsel in Disstress stereotype because we believe in equality, /but/ they must also be conventionally attractive, and they can't have too many unfeminine traits or habits, either. The result is the pile-up that you describe. Something similar goes for female action protagonists in general.

** Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure an FF.net writer Pstibbons or something similar writes fic like that, but I also recall having a strong negative reaction to it, though I don't quite remember why.

** Canon you mean? ;) (sorry, but this kind of really strikes me as an exaggerated version of canon, not that canon didn't kind of paint her that way already! It's like she can do no wrong (or at least she's never punished for doing something bad, like the DA-Parchment-Curse, which while justified (Umbridge was after all trying to ruin their education and was threatening expulsion!) was kind of over the top, too) and is basically the best at everything (just Dumbledore and Tom Riddle are better at magic than her it seems!)...the last book already was more like "Hermione Granger and the Deathly Hollows", because frankly Harry felt like a weak, clueless and stupid tag along who couldn't do shit and relied on others to do stuff for him (or to lie for/about him etc.) and at worst die for him! Hell, he still used that stupid disarming charm in a real fight (sorry, but I'd go fully lethal in any fight to the death, disarming only happens by cutting off the wand-arm or burning it etc. - not to mention that it makes him identifiable because it's his signature move!) instead of say a reductor curse or a cutting curse or even Avada Kedavra (it's not elegant, but it sure finishes fights and it isn't easily blocked!))
