  Dumbledore said Harry had a choice. He could go back, go back to battle, end the war. He could go on, be with his loved ones in the afterlife. Somehow, he settled for in between and landed somewhere in America in the year 2010 with two guns pointed at him. Plucked from one war in one universe, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of another. (Betas acquired!)

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

***** How much do you need to know about Firefly to understand Browncoat, Green Eyes? I've seen it recommended so many times but I've never actually watched Firefly, and don't want to start something I wouldn't fully appreciate.

****** It pretty much takes for granted that you're familiar with the main characters and their relationships with each other so you'll probably miss out on a lot if you aren't, especially for the first half or so of the fic where the magic side of the plot hasn't really taken off yet.

It mostly builds on the events of /Serenity/ the movie though, so if you've just seen that it might be enough.

** I feel you. Since the pandemic, I've been spending WAY more time with HP fanfic and sometimes I feel like it's too much but I'm so bored that I continue anyway! Haha. But I've been getting into modern and non magic AU which helps shake things up. Same characters, so same comfort, but different world!
