I cant remember a lot (or any really) of it, but hermione eventually has kids and she calls them her cubs and they live in a mansion. i am pretty sure its a lucius x hermione. i've read so many stories, i'm hoping they're not blurring together. But the story starts in hogwarts, and she joins slytherin and gains their trust and they start give her an affectionate nickname and eventually becomes like the leader of them i think maybe to take down voldy from the inside,


** Domina is her silly title.
