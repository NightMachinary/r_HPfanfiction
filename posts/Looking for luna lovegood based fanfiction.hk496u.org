** Not exactly that, but linkffn(It's Always The Quiet Ones by PixelWriter1) is just so awesome, that it always is worthy to read it again.

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
