** /Alt. Universe: Fudge was right in OtP. Dumbledore is seeking more power and trying to take over as the singular authority in the Ministry. Unfortunately, nobody believes him and most people see it as him losing it due to stress from previous events./

"In the name of the Ministry, you're under arrest, Headmaster."\\
"Are you threatening me, Master Auror?", asks Dumbledore in his usual grandfatherly manner.\\
"The Ministry will decide your fate.", Dawlish replies.

"I AM THE MINISTRY!"

** which of course leads to....

"Don't lecture me, Ron! I see through the lies of the ministry. I do not fear the dark arts as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and the greater good to my new empire!"

"The greater good, mate?"

"Don't make me kill you."

"Harry, I'm loyal to our friends! To Gryffindor!"

"If you're not with me, then you're my enemy."

....

and naturally...

"Harry, mate, it's over, I've got the high ground!"

"You underestimate my power!"

"Don't try it."

"ACCIO FIREBOLT!"

"Confringo!"

"You were the chosen one, Harry! You were supposed to defeat the dark lord, not become him!"

"I HATE YOU!"

"You were my brother, Harry. I loved you."

** Man I've had this thought for a while that Dumbledore could make a great Emperor Sidious. But I imagine Harry as more of a Luke... and well... I'm not a huge Severitus fan, but like... it would fit pretty well with Severus playing Vader. (I find your lack of... turning to page 394... disturbing).

*** Well, Snape has the walk down. He just lacks a tragic backstory leading to his disfigurement. (Lily: You're breaking my heart, Sevvy! lol)

And, of course, he needs a theme while he's patrolling menacingly through the corridors.

** Grindelwald was a Dark Lord of magic, so powerful and so wise he could wield the Elder Wand. He had such a knowledge of the Deathly Hallows that he could even stop death. Dark magic is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately he taught his lover everything he knew, then his lover defeated him in a duel and locked him in his own prison. Ironic. He sought the Hallows but they could not save him.

** From another [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/eoazbl/dumbledore_as_palpatine/][Thread a year ago]] something i wrote out for it

Harry and Dumbledore sat watching the Quidditch game above them. the cheers of the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs drowning out the worry Harry secretly held for Sirius. He had been having nightmares recently of Sirius dying during the War against Voldemort and they hadn't been stopping.

Shaking off the worry and unable to focus on the game he looked to his right at Dumbledore. The man was smiling and watching the game with glee, but that smile dropped when he felt Harry's eyes on him.

"I know the Order has asked you to Spy on me Harry..."

Harry's eyes widened a fraction but he didn't deny it. He had no idea why the Order of the Phoenix had ordered him to spy on his Mentor, but he was surprised that Dumbledore knew.

Dumbledore shifted in his seat "Tell me, Harry, Have you ever heard the Tragedy of Gellert Grindelwald the Wise?"

"No..." Harry answered

"I thought not," Dumbledore chuckled "It's not a tale the Order would tell you..."
