Hermione reminds you of the kid in all your classes, teacher's pet, making good grades, but lacking true brilliance. She does not make connections very well and seems like the type for rote memorization. She also seems a bit arrogant as well as close-minded when it comes to intellect. Are there any fics where she isn't "the smartest witch of her age"? One where she isn't automatically top at everything. Where there are legitimately better students? Something like Mind Arts Hermione would be preferred.


** To be fair, "smartest witch of her age" is already a fanon thing. If I remember Canon well, Lupin said something like "Smartest 13 years old witch I know), which, considering he spent most of his life in isolation due to his "little furry problem", doesn't say much.

But question for your request. "The Mind Arts" doesn't really do this but do you want some bashing or not? Because a surprising number of Harry-Daphne fics use this trope (tying Daphne to Hermione or even making her better).

More precisely, it's a misinterpretation of the line. Lupin says “the smartest witch of her age I've ever known”. That is to say “the smartest witch /that age/” that Lupin has encountered, as opposed to “the smartest witch of the era”.

**** Fanon Hermione is either a boring character with no flaws or a shrew. I just want a fic where say she's intelligent, but not a super genius. Where she makes wrong guesses. A fic that gives Harry and Ron room to shine. I for instance love a fic where Harry has the power, but lacks absolute skill compared to competent adults.

***** My take on Hermione is that she /is/ intellectually brilliant (very much so, not just "average top-of-the-class-student" brilliant) but has very little instinct or /feel/ for magic, the way people like Dumbledore and Voldemort and Snape do, and this keeps her out of their league no matter how much she studies. She's suited to being a top-of-the-line magical scholar and spellcrafter, perhaps she's even suited to mastering a "quiet", controlled magical profession like alchemy, but certainly not to dueling or any other type of magic that needs one to think on one's feet instead of planning everything out consciously and meticulously.

That being said, she does have some flaws and I do appreciate book 6 trying to demonstrate this. And in Mind Arts, she isn't #1 in the class and only tops History and Astronomy, two memorization classes.

3rd year students were also born during war, so even more likelythat she is being compared against an even smaller group.

**** The one-shot was funny. And Hermionie SHOULD have used the time turner for the extra homework and some sleep. She should have gone to her dorm mates, who were experts in the beautification spells and option field, for advice. But she looked down on them for being frivolous and it cost her; she wasted resources. I'll give you the last one. It's not even fair to put that decision on her alone any way. The smaller one speak to her inflexibility, lack of innovation, and that her intelligence is mere route memorization.

***** But you are assuming she didn't ask her for dorm mates for advice. That might not be the case, GoF doesn't mention where she got the idea for the potion. I agree with you on the use of time turner but I can't blame a 13-14 year old for being extremely rigid in her use of a potentially dangerous artifact.

Moreover, you have to remember her accomplishments. She brewed a highly complicated potion - namely polyjuice - in her second year. She's the only one of the trio to even consider preparing for their treasure hunt - shown by her expanded bag. She practically founded the DA, even if Harry was the leader. For all her faults and flaws, Hermione was a smart girl and smartest of her age group as far as we can tell.

The only one comparable is Harry and he's a moron until and unless a danger of some sort is involved. I mean this is the guy who - after fourth year - bought Daily Prophet, glimpsed at the headlines and threw it away before bemoaning how no one tells him anything. Other than Hermione, we see almost no one show a hint of being a prodigy in their day to day life.

****** And you are assuming that she did ask her dorm mates. How complicated can polyjuice be if a second year could brew it in a bathroom. It's time consuming, sure, but only complicated to a second year student. Her prep for the treasure hunt was as academic as all her other accomplishments: she packed books, not practical survival supplies like food and first aid kits. She founded the DA and forced Harry to lead it.

The complaint the one-shot points out is that all her 'smartest of her age group' nonsense is academic. And really, we can't call her the smartest of her age group as we only see Gryffindors and Slytherins to compare her to. Harry, and to a lesser extent Ron, are not morons, they are just lazy about the academics. Harry masters most spells in a timely manner (just as fast as the rest of the class, which is usually the same day its introduced to them), but also a NEWTs level spell in his third year that he preformed fine, and just needed to work on the emotional component.

Hermione does not show a hint of being a prodigy in her day to day life. she only gets the spells the others are taught first, not well ahead of them, she never invents new spells, or works on special projects because she excels in a particular subject. She is a good student, but that's all.

******* Oh, come now. Polyjuice is at least a NEWT level potion if not above. Other takes months to brew. I don't know about you but a twelve?thirteen year old working on such a long term project that demands some expertise is darn impressive. And Hermione didn't just take books with her to the hunt, she took potions - like the one she used to save Ron when he was splinched, and a tent and God knows what else. You are right in that she didn't invent anything, like Marauders and Snape did, but remember that she had far more pressing concerns than those guys, what with being at the center of every plot and a whole fricking war by the virtue of her closeness with Harry.

I also agree with you on how little we know of Harry's year mates so we can't actually compare her to all the students but remember, Remus - a teacher who thought every student Harry's year - thought she was 'the cleverest witch of her age', not that that's definitive.

What I'm saying is, whether or not she was the smartest of her age, she was pretty darn smart. The only time she acted particularly foolish, imo, was in sixth year when she became a walking embodiment of raging hormones or some other nonsense.

******** Polyjuice only took months to brew because when certain ingredients needed to be harvested/added. You are correct in that it is only taught at NEWTs level, but we never see it actually being brewed other then by second year Hermione so it could be restricted due to its effects. It is impressive for a second year to brew it, but that's like her knowing Alohomora and the full body bind in first year: we don't actually know how hard those spells are or (again) have any one to compare her to.

I had forgotten the splinching, so yes I guess she did at least bring some medical supplies, but no food. Remus said that in regard to her figuring out he was a werewolf from the essay Snape set. It was not a comment on her general brilliance. She was pretty darn smart, but only book smart. Hermione was not really clever or resourceful and while she could do research she had difficulty applying it.

***** Yeah. Your prompt has value, but I can't help but feel there are only two ways it could work in a fic. Either you use another student as an example of what a truly smart student could be capable of or you improve upon Hermione, make her question her own beliefs and methods. O like the second idea better because I quite like Hermione character, flaws and all, so...

Either way, I'd suggest you look into fics that has smarter Harry without the power wank. Those tend to push the people around Harry to be smarter too, either by him pushing his friends to new heights or by making new friends.

I think to balance it out a bit, Ron needs some area to shine in the later books and Hermione should have done something more obvious as a flaw. IMHO her obliviousness to the implications of Voldemort's return for Muggleborn like her was a flaw, but it's never directly mentioned in the books.
