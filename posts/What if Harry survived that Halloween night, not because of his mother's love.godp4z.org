But because she wrapped him in Death's Cloak of Invisibility? Canon is vague and unwieldy on why Lily's choice to die is different than other parents who have chosen to die for their children. (My favorite fan explanation is that it's because Voldemort offered her three chances to walk away, three being a magic number - but that's fanon, not specified in canon.)

What if, instead, Lily took those last few desperate seconds to wrap Harry in the invisibility cloak? Voldemort could have aimed at the crib and guessed where the baby was - or perhaps the cloak slipped down enough to reveal his forehead. The cloak is supposed to hide its wearer from Death, after all. What if it's strong enough to deflect a killing curse?

You could take this in a lot of different directions. Does Dumbledore know the truth? Or does Hagrid just say "I followed the sound of the crying baby, oh yeah, and here's James's invisibility cloak"? If Dumbledore does know, why does he spread the story of the Boy-Who-Lived? Maybe it's to distract attention from the Deathly Hallows, or maybe he wanted to give people a symbol of hope and proof of love's triumph. That's assuming Dumbledore is benevolent - what if he sees the power of the Death's Cloak and decides to keep it and resume the hunt for all three Hallows?

Perhaps this explains Voldemort's sudden obsession with mastery of the Elder Wand - he believes that a master of a Deathly Hallow can only be overcome by the master of another Hallow (or two, if he figures out the ring). Or perhaps there's some overarching plot, a ritual or prophecy about reuniting the three brothers that can be fulfilled by Dumbledore, master of the wand, Voldemort, master of the stone, and Harry, master of the cloak.


** I don't think the canon explanation is particularly problematic. He had to give her a chance to save herself, and she had to refuse and not fight back. That isn't fanon. Is it hard to believe that those specific conditions hadn't been met before?

Not to say I don't like the idea though.

*** Yes it is.

Considering that Harry triggers it in the last book as well for literary everybody on his side, without having to refuse a chance to save his life a couple of times

**** He totally had a chance to save his own life. He could have flown away from Hogwarts on his firebolt. Voldemort gave him an hour to show up, plenty of time to get the hell out of dodge.

*** It becomes more plausible when you consider the following:

It's not enough to just be willing to die in someone's place, there are specific conditions that have to be met.

1. The person sacrificing themselves must be given the opportunity to save themselves, and refuse.

2. The person sacrificing themselves must not fight the killer. They must give their life freely to save the person.

Fanon adds more but these are the only canon ones. If Voldemort had just blasted Lily when she got in his way, it wouldn't have worked. If Lily had tried to blast Voldemort it wouldn't have worked. That's why James sacrificing his life didn't do any good.

**** The thing is, while I can definitely see it as an one-time thing in the Voldemort wars themselves, I have a hard time buying the possibility that such a scenario never ever happened before. People like Snape, Lily+Harry and Voldemort (the main players to cause the chain of events that led to Voldemort's first downfall) have all existed in the past, so why was this the first time someone survived the Killing Curse?

***** Rowling said it was the first time, but ironically, I'm not sure she knows what she's talking about. Because In chamber of secrets Riddle commented that Lily dying to save Harry was indeed a simple but effective countercurse, so maybe it wasn't the first and other events were just obscure or something. Otherwise how would Riddle even know that?

Another possibility: maybe other Voldemorts preferred other curses. Sacrificial protection doesn't only apply to the killing curse and would be pretty rare in any event. So other curse gets rebounded, oh they must have just flubbed up the countercurse, good thing that Dark Lord's dead now! Dope de dope de Doo.

A third possibility: other Snape's weren't high enough in their Voldemort's good graces to make such a request. I'm not I need to expand on this one.

*** Who says it hasn't happened before? The happenstance with Harry is special because he got a scar (and therefore a horcrux) and a rumor caught on, and because Voldemort was the baddest dark lord in history.

If Eldron the Eviscerator goes to a home and kills a family, then blows up by reflected curse, there is no reason to believe that Eldron didn't just blow himself up because he was a dark lord and the dark arts are chaotic and destructive.

** For what it's worth, while I'm certain that Voldemort believes in the Elder Wand specifically, he doesn't believe in the Deathly Hallows in canon, as near as I can tell.

** Ya'll are missing the point. It's not that she merely offered her life instead. I'm sure any mother would would do that, except in all the other cases the opportunity to kill the child was merely one of opportunity -- the child just happened to be there. Voldie went there for the EXPRESS purpose of killing Harry! He had no reason to go there, otherwise.

*** Ironically, everyone is missing the point of the prompt in order to focus on canon. I suppose I should have left that part out; I didn't realize it'd be such a derailer.
