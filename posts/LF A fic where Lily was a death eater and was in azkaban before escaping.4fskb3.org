Please Help!

Looking for a fic where from what I can remeber Lily was (I can't remember why) a Death Eater and escpaped from azkaban when Harry was at Hogwarts.

If I remeber correctly there were some hints of Bella/Lily.

I can't remember the title and can't find it anywhere.


** Soooo...Muggleborn Death Eater huh? I'd certainly like to know how that is explained away.

Although I guess you could do it with a more reasonable Voldemort that truly wants to change the Wizarding World instead of just being a bigoted maniac. There aren't enough fics with Tom Riddle as a real character instead of an absolutely insane lunatic.

Edit: Ok, i did a quick search and found this: linkffn(11037004). It appears to be an Outtake for the story you're looking for, which is called "Mirror", unfortunately the main story doesn't seem to be available anymore, or at least it's not on the author's profile.

*** Thank youuuuuu. :D This helped me find the fic on another website. Having the author and title helped a bunch :D

Edit: Now I've read it again I can see why Lily and James became Death Eaters, it's never explicitly explained but it's hinted and from what I can make out does make sense.

So Spoilers sort-of: 1) Lily says everything she's ever done was because she loved harry. 2) That they joined a couple of years before Voldemort fell to Neville!BWL 3) They have an unbreakable vow with Voldemort 4) If James and Lily were unable to then Sev or Lucius SHOULD have raised Harry and they and Voldemort are pissed with them for not doing so (he was raised in a orphanage)

Along with a couple of other small things it leads me to believe that after Lily and James heard of the prophecy (I don't think they were told the exact wording just that their son would be a threat to Voldy) from Dumbledore they decided that the best option was to go to Voldemort and swear an unbreakable Vow with him that basically said they would be loyal Death Eaters and raise Harry to be the same as long as Voldemort was loyal to them in return (or something similar). Also explains why they didn't plead imperious and went to azkaban. Voldemort was really worried and pissed that Harry was not raised by Malfoy or Snape but was relieved that he hates muggles and likes the Dark Arts, i.e indication that he would be loyal to Voldy.

Not only is that really unique, but I think it makes a ton of sense, Fully possible that 2 people would betray everything if it meant they and their son would be safe. And while I couldn't see Canon!Voldy going along with it because he was batshit insane, if he was what Tom Riddle was supposed to be, I could definitely see him going along with it. He gets two powerful and magically bound loyal followers with a future loyal follower who has the potential to be his equal magically yet still loyal and subordinate to himself, while simultaneously depriving his enemies of the same.

Really Good idea, only let down in this instance by the fact the author isn't an native english speaker so grammer can sometimes be horrible.

Really I wish more people would take this idea and create something from it, honestly makes so much sense, if James and lily were willing to die for Harry who's to say they wouldn't join Voldemort for him if they could ensure Voldy would uphold his side of the deal.

**** I just read it and i agree that the idea is definitely intriguing. I've always avoided "Dark Harry" stories before but now i'm thinking that that might have been a mistake.

I especially liked how similar Harry's upbringing was to that of Tom Riddle. I always thought Harry took the abuse from his relatives way too lightly and should have had a lot more animosity for Dumbledore after he placed Harry with them.

I also really liked the interaction between the Death Eater children, it was nice to have a different perspective from the usual "all Death Eater children are evil and we hate them" thing. I found Harry's and Cassi's attitude completely reasonable considering how they grew up. Harry especially is hated by teachers and students for whom his parents were, did they honestly expect he could turn out to be an upstanding citizen after how they acted towards him? The situation between McGonagall and Harry reminded be quite a bit of Dumbledore and Tom, which i'm sure was intentional. It gives a lot more insight in how Tom Riddle turned into Voldemort.

I only read about half of it because i got tired of the the frankly terrible grammar and spelling; do you have any other "Dark Harry" stories that are similar? I don't want anything where Harry is just evil for the sake of being evil but a story where his actions are justifiable because of his upbringing and/or the attitude other students and teachers have towards him.

****** I checked the Malachite series out, it was brilliant up until the 7th chapter of the 3rd. The Daphne/Hadrian ruined it utterly for me. It was so bad and forced it was painful to read, it had Hadrian acting completely and utterly OOC compared to how the Author otherwise portrayed him in order to accommodate it.

******* I know. I have mixed feelings about the third book. It's very detailed and atmospheric, but the characterization is a bit too exaggerated and unrealistic, though it seemed to have gotten better during the last few updates.

Voldemort canonically tried to recruit James and Lily.

*JKR:* /Well it depends how you take defying, doesn't it? If you're counting, which I do, (JN laughs) any time you arrested one of his henchmen, any time you escaped him, any time you thwarted him. That's what he's looking for. (SU: Yeah.) And both couples qualified, because they were both fighting. Also James and Lily turned him down. That's established in Philosopher's Stone. He wanted them, (SU: Wow.) and they wouldn't come over, so that's one strike against them before they were even out of their teens./

**** Even more reason then. They learn of the prophecy, they know Voldemort would have them as he'd previously attempted to recruit them and they'd turned him down, so they go to him to ensure Harry's ( and their own) safety.

It's fully possible, much more so than a lot of the other popular HP tropes and cliche's. It'd be nice to see more people take this idea and run with it.
