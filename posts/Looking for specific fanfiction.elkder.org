:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a specific fanfiction where harry travels to a new universe. What I remember:

After killing voldemort harry goes to the graveyard in godrics hollow and falls asleep where he freezes to death

The harry in the alternate universe it around 10 practicing to fly his broom at night and falls off cracking his head on a graveyard and dying.

Death and fate send our harry to replace that harry.

Harry has siblings and parents are alive.

Sirius is married and has a daughter ( I think she is called Aquila? Love interest) think his wife Is Japanese.


** Was the kid Harry he replaces a shithead? I remember reading a fic with a similar premise and Harry had to overcome/reverse the perception that people had of him. His sister more or less hated him because of how kid Harry was.
