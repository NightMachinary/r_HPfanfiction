Who let the Basilisk out to stretch & Mertils death was a tragic accident?


** "It's a shame about that Ravenclaw girl, isn't it?" Tom strode around by the door to the Gryffindor common room. "Which one of your pets was it this time?"

"Muffy didn't mean ter, yeh see, she's just got that look about her," Hagrid said, hesitantly patting his pocket. "She was just stretchin' her scales, is all."

"Scales?" Tom asked, raising a dark brow. "Let me see this creature of yours."

Hagrid took a step back, but Tom raised his wand, a threat in his eyes. Hagrid paled, letting out a low hiss and turning his head to the side.

Something dark and heavy moved closer and Tom spun around, wand at the ready. "What the-"

The last thing Tom remembered was big yellow eyes and hearing Hagrid say; "Muffy! Yeh shouldn't've done that!"

/I'll see myself out/

** Crackfic: Hagrid (not Riddle) is the parselmouth and has a crush on the King of Slytherin. Cue kidnapping/date in the chamber of secrets with "Mrs. Slinky" as the waiter.
