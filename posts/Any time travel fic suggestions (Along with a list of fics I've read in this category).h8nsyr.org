*What I'm looking for:* Any fics where older Harry travels back in time and has to redo his school years. I'm not too picky on the date, so it can be before he gets his letter or a few years after. I'm also mainly looking for not just Harry going back (I'm more or less looking for the Golden Trio going back, or Harry going back with Ginny or Draco), though I'd be okay with just Harry going back to his younger body.

*What I'm not looking for:* Harry going back to raise himself (unless you absolutely think that I should totally read it), the next-gen coming into play, and CROSSOVERS.

*A few pairings I don't want are:* Harry/Ron (or the twins, Percy, and Bill), Harry/Daphne (or any other Slytherin girl), Harry/Fleur or Cho, any harem pairings, ESPECIALLY NO HARRY/VOLDEMORT, essentially no Harry/any other guys unless it's Draco or Charlie (perhaps Snape), Harry/Tonks, Draco/Hermione

*Pairings I'm okay with:* Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Charlie, Harry/Ginny, Harry/Luna, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Sirius or Remus

Thank you for reading my long post any my specifics and giving me any suggestions! If you have anything else that remains in the specifications but aren't time travel fics, then I'd be happy to check them out!

*This has been posted on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]

*Fics I've read in this category and recommend:* linkffn(Harry Potter: Dark Memories), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Difference of Time), linkffn(Time Warp: Year One), linkffn(The Time Meddlers), linkao3(Messing With Time), linkffn(Let's do the Time Warp Again), linkao3(Step back in time - part one), linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Gift of Time), linkffn(The Eighth Time is the Charm), linkao(This Time of Ours), linkao3(HP & The Philophoser's Stone: The Time Jump Chronicles), linkffn(Time is a Healer), linkffn(The Twist of Time), linkffn(Timely Errors), linkao3(Time Turned Back), linkffn(Harry Potter: Magical Time), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Time Mage), linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always), linkao3(The Road Less Traveled), linkao3(Perfect Shapes), linkao3(Escaping the Paradox), linkao3(Tempus), linkao3(Meeting Your Maker (Literally)), linkao3(To Be with the One He Loves), linkao3(Princeps), linkao3(Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards), linkao3(Praeparet Bellum (Prepare for War)), linkao3(Evitative), linkao3(Master of Death), linkao3(Oh God Not Again!), linkao3(Princeps)

  When Harry first joined the wizarding world, he did everything he was supposed to do. He sorted to Gryffindor, he was part of the Golden Trio and he was willing to die to defeat the man that had killed his parents. Unfortunately all that got him were seven uncomfortable years leading to an even more uncomfortable conversation with Dumbledore after he had apparently died. But while Harry was still considering his options between staying dead and Dumbledore's suggestion of somehow returning to finally defeat Voldemort once and for all, a third path was presented that would give him the chance to choose a different road to take on the day he'd first learned that Magic existed.

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

  The ultimate betrayal sends seventeen year old Harry Potter spiraling six years into the past, de-aged to eleven, but retaining his young adult memories of the brutal Second Wizarding War. Determined to end the war before it starts, a war-torn Harry is Slytherin! Grey! Independent! Powerful! and Cunning! Includes Mentor!Snape, Hufflepuff!Neville, and Sexually Confused!Draco Also, I was too lazy to separate the chapters, so it's all shoved into one. Be warned.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

  When Harry first joined the wizarding world, he did everything he was supposed to do. He sorted to Gryffindor, he was part of the Golden Trio and he was willing to die to defeat the man that had killed his parents. Unfortunately all that got him were seven uncomfortable years leading to an even more uncomfortable conversation with Dumbledore after he had apparently died. But while Harry was still considering his options between staying dead and Dumbledore's suggestion of somehow returning to finally defeat Voldemort once and for all, a third path was presented that would give him the chance to choose a different road to take on the day he'd first learned that Magic existed.

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

  AU. Year 2148: Gobal Population: 1. He made a mistake 150 years ago or so and now the human race no longer exists. For a century or so, he has sought a way to fix it all. Can he, or is the end of the world inevitable?
