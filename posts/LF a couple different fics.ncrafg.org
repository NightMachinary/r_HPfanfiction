:END:
I'm looking for a couple fics that I have read in the past, swore I bookmarked and now can't find.

The first - No longer wanting to fight Voldemort and sick of being 'the chosen one', Harry negates the prophecy by willingly taking a sex-change potion. Her new first name is a flower and, I believe, she is passed off as a relation to Severus. Shortly before or after the potion is given, Draco asks if he can start a relationship with her. The Light side is kept in the dark of this change though eventually at least Hermione becomes aware the new girl used to be Harry.

The second one I stink at describing, but I'll give it a whirl - One summer, Harry winds up in the Hogwarts Infirmary, brought there, I believe, by Dumbledore and Snape. It is revealed that James and Lily have named Severus as a sort of protector to Harry. He is charged with killing Harry should he ever go dark - and if memory serves - he would be the only one who would be able to do so. Harry has some sort of vision/dream about Draco and brings/has him brought to Hogwarts. The pair has formed a Clarion (spelling?) bond which is platonic. Several of his friends become a part of a guard/fighting group - I think they fought in some sort of formation around Harry. Relationshipwise, Harry ends up with a transfer student (Emile, maybe) after being drawn to her the first time he sees her step into the Great Hall.

The sequel deals with an older Harry who is mortally cursed at the beginning of the story and the fallout of that. I can't recall if it's the original or sequel (but think its the sequel) that has a new dark lord with followers called 'Chasers' who wear irremovable collars. Harry is able to remove them, if I remember right.

Any help would be greatly appreciated as would suggestions for similar sounding fics.


** I've been trying to find the first fic you mentioned for ages and am very hopeful that somebody knows it!!
