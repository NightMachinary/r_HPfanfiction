  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** This is one of Sarah1281's weakest stories in my opinion. It's fun on a first read-through, but while rereading it I was mentally checking out until about Year 4.

Pretty much everyone is way OOC, and Snape's characterization is very annoying throughout, as it's obvious the author is or at least used to be a Snape fangirl. Luna's characterization is particularly egregious. The story would have been far better if Luna was just as clueless as everyone else, but was still an oddball.

** I'm on chapter one; Harry is talking to Draco. And...the conversation is a little too [[/r/iamverysmart]]. In combination with the "I know everything about Hogwarts speach? It's not my cup of tea.

Edit: The time travel aspect is barely mentioned. Outside hinting at Harry knowing things, it isn't mentioned at all. Not when he sees Ginny at the platform, and I'm not saying he should start making a harem. But look at Ginny and think of his wife and child? Something other than sarcasm and jokes?

I'm on chapter 3 and I've already started skimming.

Edit: And I'm out. Halfway through chapter 5. This isn't a Harry goes back in time story. This is a rewrite where Harry has better one liners. And I get that the only real tag for the story is humour. But this is just lazy writing.

Edit: I lied. Read a little more and

  In the weeks before Black's escape, he was known to mutter in his sleep about "that greasy git" and "gotta go back to Majorca." Who exactly is this "greasy git" and is Black actually heading to Spain? Only time will tell.

Edit: Soooo....I skipped 5 chapters. And chapter 10 something signigicantly actually diverted from canon! It was not even a bad twist. I thought maybe it would be a little more plot heavy for the next chapter, but it's right back to Harry, now with the addition of Sirius, making fun of people in this timeline with knowledge from the future.

Edit: Skipped 10 chapters. And Luna is in the chapter. Not canon Luna. Fanon Luna, who is the worst thing anyone has ever written. Ever.

The positive thing about this story? It doesn't drag out the plot. They are already in book 2 plot.

Edit: Skipped to chapter 25, and I'm out for real. The reason is 100% this

  "I believe so," Luna answered him, eyeing Ginny and Lockhart carefully. "But Norbert isn't." She bent down to pick up the Crumple-Horned Snorkack creature Harry had gotten her for Christmas and showed the stiff little pig-like creature to him.

Edit: I lied.Again.

Skip to chapter 39, and read it like an AU year 4 where Harry makes more funny one liners, and Sirius got an official pardon. It's actually a kind of funny, absurd story from that point.

I'm confused. Do people actually think OGNA ISN'T a crack fic? It doesn't even try to hide it - the very first AN in the very first chapter says it's a parody.

** I feel the read was ultimately pointless, the thing is this Harry didn't have any reason to go back so is meaningless from a "Main Character Perspective" since he doesn't have anything to learn nor did he have any new conflict to solve, and sice the deviations towards other character arcs are so short and kinda "meh", it is also meaningless from a plot perspective. The only thing that is mildly interesting is how he sees his mother actions, I'm pretty sure I've yet to see that perspective

** I remember reading this years ago and liking much of it, but some of the bad writing drove me crazy and almost made it unreadable. I remember leaving (what I thought was) some constructive critique in a review and the author flaming me for it (IIRC, she responded to every critique with “it's a PARODY” and then when I suggested a parody didn't have to have certain flaws, she insisted I didn't know what a parody was).

** Hmm. I've read it before, a while ago. From what I recall, it was reasonably funny, if you like absurd humour. Not my favourite do-over fic, but a respectable writing effort.

The Lockhart angle is interesting, too, treating his canon persona as an actual joke, one that Lockhart doesn't take seriously either.

Actually it's the title that makes me uncomfortable. Either talk about God, or don't, I reckon. Saying "God" and then talking about something completely different just isn't sensible.

*** Well, "oh god" in general is a common phrase where I'm from. It's the same meaning as saying "oh my god." Very rarely does someone say "omg" and actually mean to refer to God. The title is pretty obviously using it this way.

My mom hated when I said "oh my god" and claimed I was "taking the Lords name in vain" lol. Is that why it made you uncomfortable, or is it not a common thing where you're from?

"Vain" means "empty, pointless". So, using "OMG" or similar phrases without intending to refer to God is exactly what "taking God's name in vain" actually means. Your mom was right :).

As a general thing, I'm in favor of saying what I mean and meaning what I say. In specific, I think using God's name without intending to address Him is disrespectful, akin to a prank call.

***** The commandment was less about profanity and was actually about /swearing an oath/ in his name, a /shvu'ah./ It was about following through with what you swore you would do. You should not promise something in his name if you will not fulfill it.

There are other interpretations- I was once told by a pastor that he thought it's more about not committing acts in his name that are not Holy. (Really, what he was saying, is you should not call yourself a Christian, then turn around and do something unholy or against his will, while claiming his name.) Basically, I'm not saying your interpretation is wrong, just that there are other ways of looking at it!

Looking at "omg" more linguistically, I wouldn't call saying "omg" a performative speech act but more an idiom at this point, at least for me. Saying "omg" isn't actually a "vain" act, since the phrase /has meaning/ in that it means emphasized surprise or a general expression of disbelief, frustration, excitement, or anger. Like most idioms, that meaning is no longer truly connected to the words separately. Maybe that's just where the phrase is headed and not where it's at yet, though.

Honestly, language is fascinating. The way words change meaning through history, the way things change in interpretation, in both denotation and connotation... I could talk about it for hours. But this is probably not the place to do that so I'll stop now haha. You really made me take a minute to evaluate my own speech and beliefs and I'm thankful for that!
