I'm looking for Drarry or Dramione fics that take place post-Hogwarts and have a good amount of angst, i.e. deal heavily with Draco's negative feelings about himself and his actions during the War, generally having problems coping and relating to himself, etc. I read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6239806/chapters/14295997][Stately Homes of Wiltshire]] and it's almost exactly what I'm looking for in terms of plot, but I would like something angstier where Draco's dealing with more emotional troubles (cause I mean, he's gotta have a ton). Preferrably at least an M rating. :P Also, if there's a fic that isn't Drarry or Dramione but fits the bill otherwise, I'd be down to try it anyways. Thanks!


** I think linkao3("Dad says") fits what you're looking for! I would recommend GallaPlacidia's fics in general. Often lots of angst (particularly on Draco's side) but with a happy ending.

**** No problem! The Bucket List is my absolute favourite, followed by Lessons in Grace and Decorum, Dad says and Cassieopia Lily Malfoy.
