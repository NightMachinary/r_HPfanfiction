This is an all-encompassing simple request for any Harry Potter fics that have him either being born as or somehow turning into a girl...

Born as a girl but due to the machinations of Dumbledore or Harry's parents... she is put under a powerful spell that turns him into a boy. This spell is undone at some point in Harry's time at Hogwarts.

Other possible scenarios: A spell that switches the gender of the victim. A polyjuice accident that turns him into a girl long term. Body swapping with one of the female cast. Being fate's whipping post and being sent into another world where he's put in the body of his female counterpart to fulfill the prophecy... again. By becoming "Master of Death" an unknown side-effect is that he's turned into a girl because Death hates people getting one up on him. Etc.

Really anything that has to deal with Harry dealing with Harry finding out that he is now a she.

  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?

** So, judging by how you worded the request I'm taking it that you're NOT looking for fem!Harry who was born a girl and identifies as a girl throughout... otherwise I would have gone for some shameless self-promotion and mentioned my fic, Holly Potter and the Witching World.

Fics where the change happens during the story, though... the one that first comes to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10073299/6/Harry-Potter-And-The-Unexpected-Second-Life][Harry Potter And The Unexpected Second Life]], where there's an assassination attempt on Harry and Ron after the Battle of Hogwarts, using a potion known as "the Widowmaker" because it's lethal to males by not females...and so, to save their lives they have to spend some time as girls while the potion is in their systems. Unlike most "becoming female" fics, there's a big emphasis on secrecy, with cover stories invented as to where Harry and Ron went and who these two new girls are.

linkffn(10073299)

Then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11395728/1/The-Many-Faces-of-Har-er-Adira-Potter][The Many Faces of Har---er, Adira Potter]]... okay, I'm not SURE you'd count this one. Harry has multiple personalities, some of which are female, and since there's magic and all, his body turns female when a female personality is in charge... and the "main" Harry eventually comes out as trans and takes the name "Adira"... I did think it was a pretty good story.

linkffn(11395728)

Oh, and there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11396276/1/The-Chosen-One-Has-Knockers][The Chosen One Has Knockers]], which is a lot more traditional in that Harry just gets cursed to becoming a girl in an AU sixth year. It pretty quickly turns into cracky lesbian smut, but it's kind of fun and refreshingly lacking in angst.

  A different ending to the Battle of Hogwarts is followed by a deadly assassination attempt on the Golden Trio. In an alternative timeline, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are forced to go undercover, to complete their education -- whilst dark secrets and the ongoing Death Eater menace threaten them all. Harry's new life as a witch certainly won't be dull... Please read and review!

  Harry Potter is a wizard, which surprises him. But Harry Potter is also a Multiple, which surprises everyone. But that's not the end of the surprises. Note: Trans!Harry eventually. This part is complete. The story will continue as "The Many Faces Go To War." Check my profile or subscribe to my author page for updates.

  "Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, pity those who live without love." A Harry Potter from the future travels through time to change his past --- and loses himself. A Harry Potter from the present struggles with his destiny --- and must find himself. No, they can't cheat off each other. (time travel, ewe, badass!fem!harry, tsundere!fem!voldemort)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else.

*** I am really confused about “To Reach Without”: first of all, I am not into slash (and even less femslash), so I gave up on reading it after some time, but what I read had a lot of potential (ignoring unnecessary high-level of angst from the change itself): AU story with a well-developed indepent plot, Susan Bones written as a real character (not just reflection of her aunt), but still within just the reasonable distance from canon.
