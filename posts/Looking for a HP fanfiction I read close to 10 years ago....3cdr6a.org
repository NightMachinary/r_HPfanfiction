So there was this fanfiction that was supposedly book 5 and then a follow up book 6 prereleased and they were quite a bit darker and more graphic, in several ways. Harry and Cho get together, Harry and the gang start using powerful curses, including 2 weird killing curses (one involving snake bullets and one variation of avada kedavra that makes you explode into confetti, sorta). I had hard copies at one point and remember that they were just as long as an actual book. Any info would be great.


** Maybe this one? linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent by Barb LP)

*** Holy shit. I think that's it! Thank you! Have you read it?

Edit: after reading several chapters I don't believe I've read this before, although it has many similarities, it's not the one I was looking for. I did remember that the one I'm remembering also had the 3 mains becoming unregistered animaguses.
