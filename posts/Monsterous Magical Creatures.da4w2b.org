I have seen countless fics where, for example, everyone and their mother works for werewolf rights. But are there any fics where werewolves are not just the poor victims of discrimination but also close to their European folklore depiction (eradicate entire villages, eat recently buried corpses, you get the picture)? Where Vampires are a terror and not just dinner guests? Where a group of ghouls ravages cottage after cottage?

Preferably with Harry hunting them down.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
