Quite impressive that a load of people here love it, yet it seems to be the only one without a ship name. Heur? Fleurarry? Flarry?


** People here don't really like using ship names. We just call it Harry/Fleur.

*** Why not? With gems like McGape, Flarry, Drape, Snarry, Snalbus, and my favourite: Snughorn. Pairing names are fun.

**** I dunno, probably because of those types of ship names. It's kinda hard to call a fic serious and then say it's Flarry.

******* "Snughorn" is Snape/Slughorn, in case you didn't figure that one out either.

We could also call McGape "Minervus" if we wanted to use their first names, but the point is moot. Gryffindor and Slytherin would never allow their houses to be combined in that manner.

** As a super avid Harry'Fleur fan and reader, I don't think I've ever come across any name for the pairing that I would consider close to widespread in it use. Most of the times its usually H/F, Harry/Fleur, or HFleur. I think the problem is that Harry and Fleur don't have good phonetic euphony.

I nominate FlowerPot as the ship name.
