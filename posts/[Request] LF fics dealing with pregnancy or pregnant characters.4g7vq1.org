Hi all!

I'm looking for any fics that have a pregnant character/s as a main character or pregnancy as a main plot point. Can be angsty, dark, romantic, canon, AU, pwp, you name it. Not fussy on who the characters are as long as they are female.

No MPreg, please.


** linkao3(Hermione Granger and the intended vessels) deals with pregnancy big-time. It's been a while since I've read it, it's been posted under at least one different name, so I don't really remember what I thought of it. I do remember it had an interesting potion and medical concepts.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

  COMPLETE: A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it-smashing it-nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century. This should not have happened. HG/TR.

  The war is over. Hermione Granger's life, while safer, is no less complicated. Victory has had unintended consequences which affect not only Hermione, but all those around her.

** Linkffn(Banned Love by lesblams)

First time I've linked using link to ffn, hope it works! Banned Love is a story about Harry and Gabriel. Her pregnancy is the main focus of the story. A bit happy and a bit sad of a story.
