I stumbled upon [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5jwo0p/where_the_heck_did_line_theft_come_from_and_are/][this thread on the origins of Line Theft]] while looking up something else, and got curious. [[/u/ModernDayWeeaboo][u/ModernDayWeeaboo]] says that the idea of Line Theft stems from ancient Rome, but I've been faffing about on Google for the last day or two and haven't found anything. I suspect I am having issues because I don't know what they called it back then, and am using the wrong keywords.

Does anyone know of any historical instances of Line Theft being a crime? If so, could you let me know what it's called and where it was a thing, please.

Discussion is also welcome on how it could have hypothetically come about, just make sure you note that your reply is speculation please :)


** Didn't that Lannister bitch incest her kid onto the Iron Throne? That's some line theft right there. But IRL? I didn't pay much attention to history, can't think of any.

** fyi you flair your post using the flair button, it should be next to all the buttons saying source, share, save, etc. I'm not sure what exactly the autoflair bot uses to flair discussion, probably discussion, and not Disc.
