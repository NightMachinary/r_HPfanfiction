God how he /hated/ this place... It wasn't the bland, /frankly disgusting/, food, nor it's lack of quantity. It wasn't the lack of freedom he was given, nor the lack of any /real/ belongings he could be proud of.

It was the people that lived in it.

He'd lived in the place for almost 10 years, assuming the 'caretaker' didn't lie to him about his birth date /as well/, though he doubted she did, there was no reason to lie about that after all. Still, even without that... He could always tell. It was what made him different. What made him special. What gave him hope for the world outside. Surely the rest of the world wasn't as bad?

The people here on the other hand.... There were two kinds in the orphanage, as far as he was concerned at any case.

Those that feared him. That slept with their lights on because of him. That avoided him, as much as they could, at all costs. Those that would smile to his face and tell him what he'd /want/ to hear just to get rid of him.

He could tell when someone lied to him. When their emotions and feelings didn't coincide with what they were saying, he could see the difference right in their /eyes/. /He always could./

Feelings, he'd realised early on, only told others the truth one wanted to hide. They could only be used against you... Besides, as far as he was concerned, none of them deserved to know the truth. Whatever it was. They didn't and would /never/ deserve it.

But those that feared him weren't the problem... It was the ones that didn't.

/There were two groups of people in Wools Orphanage. Those that feared him. And those that didn't./

The ones that didn't fear him... Out of all those in his orphanage, there were seven, /always seven no matter the day, month or year,/ that didn't fear him. And of those, /every single one, each and every time,/ hated his very /existence/, for reasons he could not fathom.

The way they stole /his/ few belongings. The way they not only refused to include him in anything, whether meal times or frankly any activity, that would've been perfectly fine as he had absolutely no desire to meddle with them, but the fact they actively went out of their way to stop him, not giving him the choice in the first place. The way they tried their best to torment him, likely hoping he'd snap and simply disappear. The way they never said word of /truth/ to him*.*

Honestly. If the caretaker hadn't been one of those people, he probably would've had an easier time dealing with the hell he lived in.

So, one can imagine his surprise when said caretaker told him he was going to a special school. He wasn't surprised about been told he'd be headed to a 'special' school... He was more surprised by the fact that perhaps for the first time in /years/...

The caretaker had been /honest/ with him. There was even a geniune /smile/ on her face for once.

...

As the man supposed to be responsible for taking him to this 'special' school entered, Tom quickly snapped his gaze to the man's eyes.

"Hello, my name is Albus Dumbledore..."

And for the first time in his life, Tom /froze./ His mind barely taking in the rest of the stranger's words.

For the first time in his life... He had absolutely no idea what was going on behind someones eyes.

For the first time in his life. Tom Riddle felt fear.

And he found himself absolutely /loathing/ the feeling.

​

...

​

The whole seven thing was written in because I figured it'd relate to Tom more then Arithmancy would? I am considering changing it to /six/ so that his reasoning for having /seven/ Horcruxes would make a bit more sense? Would appreciate feedback for this.

Edited version:

God how he /hated/ this place. It wasn't the bland, frankly disgusting, food, nor it's lack of quantity. It wasn't the lack of freedom he was given, nor the lack of any /real/ belongings he could be proud of.

It was the people that lived in it.

He'd lived in the place for almost 10 years, assuming the 'caretaker' didn't lie to him about his birth date /as well/, though he doubted she did, there was no reason to lie about that after all. Still, even then... He could always /tell/. It was what made him different. What made him special. What gave him hope for the world outside. Surely the rest of the world wasn't as bad?

The people here on the other hand? 

There were two kinds in the orphanage, as far as he was concerned at any case.

Those that feared him. That slept with their lights on because of him. That avoided him, as much as they could, at all costs. Those that would smile to his face and tell him what he'd /want/ to hear just to get rid of him.

He could tell when someone lied to him. When their emotions and feelings didn't coincide with what they were saying, he could see the difference right in their eyes. He /always/ could.

Feelings, he'd realised early on, only told others the truth one wanted to hide. They could only be used against you... Besides none of them deserved to know the truth. Whatever it was. They didn't and would never deserve it.

And then there were those that /didn't./

Out of all those in his orphanage, there were seven, always seven no matter the day, month or year, that didn't fear him. And of those, every single one*,* each and every time, whether they were one of the older kids or the /replacements,/ hated his very existence. 

For reasons he could not fathom. 

Still. They weren't the ones with /power./ 

It always came as some sort of surprise to them.

Still. He did not start those fights. Well not all of them at any rate. The majority of them however tended to make him their enemy. Once again. For reasons he could not understand. 

The way they stole /his/ few belongings. The way they not only refused to include him in anything, whether meal times or frankly any activity, that would've been perfectly fine as he had absolutely no desire to meddle with them, but the fact they actively went out of their way to stop him, not giving him the choice in the first place. Trying to control /him./ The way they tried their best to torment him, likely hoping he'd snap and simply disappear. The way they never said word of /truth/ to him*.*

Honestly. If the caretaker hadn't been one of those people, he probably would've had an easier time dealing with the hell he lived in.

** First impressions on the writing:

- You have too many italicized words and phrases. Italics emphasize specific concepts you want to highlight to the reader, like a neon yellow hi-lighter pen you use for studying. When every sentence has italics in it, it's hard to tell what the most important idea of the paragraph is.

- You also use too much ellipsis (...). I can tell you want to convey an internal train of consciousness, but when you put in too many, the effect is that your character's voice sounds conflicted, dazed, and out-of-focus, rather than secure and certain. Tom Riddle is a character with strong convictions, and that feels out of place for him. Just like italics and shaved truffles, there is sometimes too much of a good thing.

- You repeat certain phrases, and the effect is that it turns Tom's inner thoughts from a logical flow of ideas into a circle. There are two groups, then two more groups? Are they the same groups? Are there four groups?

  - *"There were two kinds in the orphanage, as far as he was concerned at any case."*
  - "Those that feared him." (Next paragraph down.)
  - "But those that feared him weren't the problem... It was the ones that didn't. / *There were two groups of people in Wools Orphanage.* Those that feared him. And those that didn't. / The ones that didn't fear him..." (3 paragraphs down.)

--------------

Impressions on the story:

- My takeaway: this seems is a canon compliant version of the 11 y.o. Tom Riddle memory from the Pensieve. His powers seem to fit what he bragged about ("I hurt people who annoy me"), his relationship with his fellow orphans and caretakers seems to be pretty dysfunctional, which works into canon.

- Tom is arrogant, bitter, and cynical, and I like how you presented this straight off from the start. However, you also tried to make him sympathetic in spite of his unfriendly character traits, by portraying as a victim of bullying by the other orphans (" The way they tried their best to torment him"). I'm kind of on the edge with this, as I don't think Tom would think of himself as a victim, even if he /was/ bullied by other people. Tom is also so egocentric that I doubt he would put much thought into what other people think of him.

- I think I would have liked to see something different about Tom, instead of starting from canon building blocks, which is something that many other Tom Riddle fics have done before, even going so far as to repeat the book line for line. The intro starting with an AU or canon divergence from Tom learning about magic would have personally drawn my interest more, because that's a plot hook. While this was an interesting snippet and a good delve into Tom's crazy psyche, I can appreciate the character study, but I'm wondering if that's all it's meant to be.

I feel like it's introductory characterization, a backstory or prequel, and from what you've written, there's no indication of what the actual story content is supposed to be about. You mention "always seven", but it the symbolism has to make sense for Tom's character too, not just for the meta-foreshadowing. Angry little orphan Tommy wouldn't allow seven people to diss him on a regular basis. He wouldn't allow one.

All in all, it's a good effort. A well done character study, but I would try to think of where to go with your plot, because it's very easy to slip into the stations of canon, which suffers from not having enough conflict/tension when all the readers can guess what will happen.

**** As the earlier comment suggested, I don't think he would've waited? He had no reason after all. Also considering how easily he admitted his ability to hurt them to Dumbledore, makes it pretty clear that he did use magic on the others kids in the orphanage.

*** Oh I definitely agree regarding the italics, ellipses and repeating phrases. It's a habit I've been trying to get rid of for some time.

This isn't meant for a Tom Riddle focused fic or anything, merely some backstory I decided to include for the Voldemort in my OC story. The backstory is meant to /mostly/ mirrors the oc's in question with the only difference been that the oc had more guidance, so to speak, compared to him.

Regarding the whole seven thing, it's not that he accepted and allowed the bullying, it was more that anytime he did try to deal with it/the person involved, they simply got replaced by someone/something else. Less of a victim of a specific person but more that he feels like he's a victim of the structure he's in. Something, that at the time, he couldn't control.

Also, while he could deal with the other orphans, dealing with the caretaker was a step even he wouldn't have considered without any assurances that he wouldn't be sent off to somewhere worse given his immediate dislike of been told he was going to a 'special' school and, more importantly, without any assurances he would /succeed./

** I'm wondering what kind of idiot would bully Tom Riddle. The seven thing seems odd, but I assume you'll explain that later.
