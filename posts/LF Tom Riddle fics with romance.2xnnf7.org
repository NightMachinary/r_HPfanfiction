** You've probably seen this already, since I think I found it through this sub, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10402749/1/War-Paint][War Paint]] is about the only Riddle romance I can stomach. Its short and pretty well written.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5500156/1/Tempora-Abducto][Tempora Abducto]] Found this on my list but idr it at all sorry. Wish I could tell you more.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5034546/1/Ultima-ratio][Ultima ratio]] this one is insanely long and just okay imo. I skimmed a lot of it.

I second Tied for Last. Anywhos, good luck! I love a good Tomione, they're hard to find...

By: anyavioletta If you think that Hogwarts was squeaky clean in the 1940's, think again. Sex, drugs, violence, love, jealousy, and a bit of murder... Welcome to Hogwarts!

Sorry I didn't post earlier, my Reddit scrip finally ran out and I axed my account of 7 years which some mod shadowbanned for an unknown reason, and no other mod would take action on. IMHO it's the worst part of reddit.

**** NP, glad you like the idea. Her other major story is also quite good, somewhat related, and really tear-jerky at the end. You are warned. :)
