Ideally I would prefer completed works but anything like the description would do. Time travel, universe travel, whatever you can come up with, I'm down for it.


** linkffn(Honor Thy Blood) comes to mind

#+begin_quote
  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
