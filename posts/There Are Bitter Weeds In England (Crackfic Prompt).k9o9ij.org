The year is 1978.

Voldemort and his Death Chompers are attacking a small Welsh village (of which name I cannot pronounce) when 3 wasted Royal Marines stumble out of a pub. Voldie immediately decides to kill them and raises his wand. The Dark Lord never gets a chance to attack, however, due to a full mag of .45 ACP penetrating his skull before he can even get out a word. Voldemort's body drops to the ground as his soul leaves his body. The Royal Marines then stumble back into the pub, having no idea what one of them just did.

(AKA, wasted Royal Marine accidentally kills Voldemort)


** what would be really funny making a crackfic where voldemort keeps getting killed by muggles on accident. every horcrux manages to get their own body but they all die by the hands of muggles

edit: cherry on top would be if petunia or vernon did one of the kills somehow
