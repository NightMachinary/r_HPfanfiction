** There's the Yule Ball Panic series by Philosophize, which has a lesbian Jasmine Potter being angsty over Hermione until they get together and have to deal with homophobia while Veela fangirl and have odd ritual orgies every so often. It's a weird series, but surprisingly decent, and I don't remember the sex being explicit, but it's been awhile since I've read it and I'm the kind of asexual that tends to skip sex scenes out of boredom like they're football matches (they're of the same entertainment value to me and I fell asleep at a football match once, so...). There's three in the series, IIRC, but the first is Yule Ball Panic.

Handles homophobia in a really interesting fashion, too. It's not quite the usual 'no bang, no heir, so no gays' approach many fics involving homophobia take.

*** Thanks for the reply, the first and last sounds interesting.

However i'm mainly looking for stories that has no references to harry potter whatsoever, and he was born a girl, or he has a sister and not where he turns into a girl.

**** Right. Magical Metamorphosis is kind of ... (it is the story of transgender!Harry), so it is a question as what he was born, but yes, I don't remember born fem!Harry which is a lesbian.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  Ginny Weasley is straight - she's had boyfriends, after all. But when she sets her sights on a position with the Holyhead Harpies (the only all-women Quidditch team in the League), she decides that going to the Harpies' favourite hangout - which is also London's only wizarding lesbian bar- and pretending to be a lesbian will help her chances of getting on the team. She decides to bring Harriet along for support - unaware that Harriet is in the closet, and terrified of anyone finding out.But Ginny's reasons for going to the Kitty Kat Club are more complex than Harriet knows - and maybe people finding out the truth about Harriet won't be such a disaster, after all.

** Here's a good one: Linkao3(Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis by Enigmaris). It's a marvel crossover (but actually good) that is set after canon, with a female Harry that /says/ she's bi, but has only been attracted to women thus far. There's not yet an end pairing, but I have a feeling the author won't make that person a man.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  Harriet Lily Potter was left on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive. They called her ugly and gave her Dudley's hand-me-downs. They would tell people that she went to a boarding school for troubled young women. Dudley still offered to stick her head in toilets, and she still learned to snap back, "Really, Duds? The poor toilet's never had anything as nasty as your head down it, it might hurt it," and run. Harry was the kind of girl who came home with scabby knees, who snuck the kitchen shears in the dead of night to snip her dark messy hair short. She wondered, as she curled up in her cupboard, if Vernon and Petunia would have loved a niece who was pretty instead of scrappy, who had soft hands and never burned the bacon at breakfast.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
