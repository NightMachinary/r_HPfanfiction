An [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2o2e2p/things_you_just_dont_understand/cmjf4mz][earlier discussion]] with [[/u/Subrosian_Smithy]] wont leave me alone. What would an Indy!Harry, without Harry being angry at the Weasleys, Dumbledore, etc look like? Can you have an independant Harry without giving him more resources than were available to him in canon? aka no Lordships, vast inheritances, etc. Or at least not front loading it at the beginning, since I suppose its not unreasonable that a Harry trying to support himself on his own might acquire more stuff along the way (via an endorsement from the BWL in exchange for funds or w/e.)

Just a more willful spirit who decides "No, I will /not/ [go back to | stay with] the Dursleys TYVM," and then takes whatever steps he finds necessary to complete his escape. Clearly canon Harry was perfectly capable of thinking Hermione was brilliant /and/ disagree with her over the Firebolt. Why not a Harry who respects the Headmaster, but disagrees over his placement. Canon Harry always just sort of accepts his isolation, even when it's obviously unhealthy. If I were Harry, I'd have run away from home ASAP after year 1, seeking that taste of freedom via the magical world...

Does something like this exist? Or should I just go reread The Merging which is the closest I can remember but is sadly still WIP?


** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] is what you're looking for. It's a slow start, but after Harry gets to Diagon Alley it's pretty much exactly what you're looking for. Harry is 15, has only the resources he does in canon, and is pretty firm about just doing his own thing.

It's very much a character piece; the writing is good and the pace is slow at first. I remember really enjoying it, though.

*** I avoided this one for years, and finally decided to give it a shot from this recommendation. It is an absolute brilliant read up until the most recent 5 chapters or so. The story just kind of becomes a mess and manages to undo everything good about it.

**** Yeah, I liked the first few chapters. But then, Harry starts going by /Sparky/ and becomes a part of a cozy family of two girls and happy parents. It was sickeningly sweet. Would not reread.

***** I didn't mind the whole "Sparky" thing, he was a hardworking kid making his living during the summer. I didn't even mind him befriending the muggleborn family. It was when he babysat and the dad came home that things started getting weird.

** well, it's unfinished, and at this point will probably never be completed, but Miranda Flairgolds "A Second Chance at Life" is fantastic. Definitely an independent harry, solid magic system and great OCs.

** Have you read A Marauder's Plan ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]])? It's not exactly an Indy!Harry in that he's not running the show on his own, but he's making a lot of decisions about his life and getting support to do so (From Sirius, primarily). He does have more resources, but they're not as out there as in a lot of the Indy!Harry fics, and a lot of them are social rather than financial, as well as indirect. One of the things I think it does particularly well is deal with the fact that relationships are rarely as cut and dried as canon Harry percieves things, and that you can feel more than one thing about a person at a time.And ooh, interesting stuff about forgiveness vs absolution and some other things around the edges- plus just a plain good solid AU what if plot. :)

I think one of the tricky things is that depending on where you diverge from canon, well, to get a kid who is very CLEARLY underage, 14 or 15 and looking younger, and have him manage to not just get shipped back off and told to listen to the adults, you've got to give him some pretty major guns on his side and fairly quickly.

*** A Marauder's Plan is literally the opposite of an Indy!Harry. Direct quote from chapter 62:

"Harry shuddered and squirmed closer to Sirius again, wanting to feel his warmth, hear his heartbeat and the steady rise and fall of his breathing; all the signs that told him the undeniable truth that Sirius was alive.

'Don't leave me!' said Harry desperately. 'Don't ever leave me! Promise!'"

Bear in mind that Harry is 14 in this scene, and not 6, as you'd assume from the text.

**** Hmm. I think I see the categories as a little bit more fluid than you are defining them? (Also, I think you are taking that scene way out of context, given the fact that Harry's spent a lot of the fic leading up to that point adapting to you know, an actual family relationship, and then had it yanked out from under him and put back together.)

Sirius is driving a lot of the action but Harry also has a lot of choices. I'm not sure- maybe there needs to be another category "Reasonable And Sane-ish Adults Helping While Teaching Proper Life Skills!Harry Fic?"

***** Is there a category of fics where the adults make sane decisions? Cause I feel like most of the adults in Harry's life in canon are cray-cray. Thou I generally just rationalize it as simply "magic removes consequences from early childhood... so no learning to make sensible decisions for you Mr Wizard!"

Oooh! A shiny dark lord magnet! Lets hide it in a school full of children! And then all the teachers go along with this plan.

****** True!

Hmm. I think White Squirrel's "The Arithmancer" makes a stab at this (although it's the adults in Hermione's life we really get a look at, and they make some sorta iffy decisions, but they clearly wrestle with balancing what Hermione wants, their desire to keep her safe, and what is ultimately best for her in terms of learning and growth- I think that's kind of my working definition of sanity, too.) And WS's other fic, The Accidental Animagus also does this too, some.

****** Methods of Rationality attempts to make every character act like they're at least trying to fulfil their roles in a dutiful and sensible manner -- a concept that the author refers to as [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 Intelligent Characters]]. This doesn't always turn out well -- sometimes people are asking "what would someone in my role reasonably be expected to do?" rather than "what is the optimal thing to do in this specific circumstance?"

***** Yeah, the categories themselves are pretty fluid, depending on who you talk to. At least for me, Indy!Harry carries a strong connotation of Harry giving the middle finger to everyone over the age of 20, consciously breaking from support systems, and going his own way. That's not a good thing in and of itself, by the way - that class of fic can be horribly cliched and stupid.

Nor is a Harry with a supportive family life a bad thing. I actually enjoyed most of what's in A Marauder's Plan - but that quote definitely rubbed me the wrong way. There's having a support system, and there's having a security blanket, and the Harry/Sirius relationship in that fic veers into the second category at times, and it's very grating.

*** Majors guns... or a willingness to run and hide. I don't see Harry having anything against buying a cheap wizarding tent with a muggle repelling charm and living in a park. Honestly, even a normal tent would probably be an improvement in living conditions over the cupboard.

...Wait... why not a muggle repelling tent in the back yard of #4... Granted he only finds out these things exist in later books... but that seems like a distressing lack of curiosity for a small child that just discovered magic is REAL. Any Harry destined for independence would likely learn more random details like that much faster.

--------------

I have read Marauder's Plan... or rather I read the first 60 chapters... It seems I forgot to follow it, and missed 9 updates. IIRC, Sirius is the driving force behind Harry's independence tho... Its not anything Harry did for himself.

** I think it might look something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1921201/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dance-of-the-Warrior][this]], one of the very early stories in the genre (dating back to 2004). While Harry indeed is furious with the Headmaster at one point (justifiably so), he nevertheless recognizes the need to work with him. It's a good example of how the IndyHarry theme can be done without bashing.

** I would think Indy!Harry is Slythern!Harry, or maybe Ravenclaw!Harry.

I would imagine that one of his primary goals would probably focus on figuring out how to use magic outside of school (e.g. a la the now-removed Nos Tres Reges story).

Certainly Harry would be more proactive. In canon, Harry seems mostly reactive. Indy!Harry has goals (ambitions), and works to achieve them. Assuming he is still the BWL, he exploits that fact. Maybe he plays up his home life to the paper. Maybe he plays it up to purebloods.
