Look I like AU's too and I would love to see a well written Dark Lord Potter Fic, or a well written Fic where Dumbledore is the villain, but most Dark!Harry Fics and Dark lord Potter Fics are so cliche, Dumbledore is secretly controlling everything, Harry gains power, becomes friends with the goblins inherits a great wealth becomes a Lord and takes over the Wizarding World or the greater good. Hey he is killing and maiming and modifying memories left and right, but he displaces obviously evil!Dumbledore so it's all ok.

I have not had one Dark Harry story which was believable. It always boils down to UNLIMITED POWER MUHAAAA, let's go shopping to prove how dark I am and let's make Tonks into a sex slave, because I am somehow related to the house Black and a Lord. To quote Matthew Stover a really good Star Wars writer, “There is nothing more dangerous than a Jedi gone sane”, why not use that as a concept for a Dark!Harry story, show how he got corrupted as someone who snapped under the pressure, who lost everything and tried to save it only to embrace the Dark, was consumed by it, or maybe he thought going Dark was his only choice of defeating Voldemort after everything else failed. Maybe the Horcrux inside him slowly corrupted him, there are so many possibilities. He fights against the Death Eaters using Dark Magic how is he any different from the Death Eaters and Evil!Dumbledore gaining power for the greater good, how does he justify it to himself?

Show how it affects the family his friends will they join him, will they try to save him? Why, in these stories, does it always turn out that Ron was secretly working for Dumbledore or was secretly a Death Eater, he was consistently shown to be a friend and someone Harry was very close to and who he trusted and 99% of the time Ron repaid that trust. I think he would be horrified by what his friend has become or maybe he would join him out of loyalty turning him against the rest of the family. What about Hermione, she is the smartest witch of her age, but Dark!Harry fics consistently treat her like arm candy and turn her into a snob looking down on the Weasleys, basically turning into her Horcrux representation in DH.

Most Dark!Harry fics seem to already start off with AU characterization instead of starting of with his Canon Personality and work of from that so that the reader can relate to the character. Please and I can not stress this enough *DO NOT* I repeat *DO NOT* treat Dark!Harry as a hero at best he is an anti hero or an outright villain DO NOT try to justify his actions and make him a hero. Harry will justify his actions, but he is still a villain do not try and turn him into a hero, unless you somehow redeem him. I have seen so many Dark!Harry who treat him as a Hero no matter the horrible things he does, but if a character the author hates does the same things they are vilified, I'm looking at you “Partially kissed hero”

Another pet peeve of mine that constantly pops up in Dark!Harry Fics is Dumbledore bashing aka Dark!Dumbledore. It would be so easy to make him into a compelling villain instead of an obvious mustache twirling villain. There are so many reasons for someone to go Dark and power is just one of them and usually there are a myriad of other reasons which they use to justify their actions to themselves. If you wanted Dumbledore to go evil simply have him remain with Grindelwald and he would be the Vader to Grindelwald's Palpatine, using Ariana to justify his actions how he is building a better world for Ariana and how she doesn't have to hide anymore. Also, hey he was born in the late 19th century right, why not use common justifications for imperialism that Muggles used during that time like: oh the muggles are so backwards we are making their lives better through magic, because we are superior because of our inherent magic, look at how many wars they are causing we are saving them from themselves etc. This makes for a much more compelling villain than most Dumbledore bashing fic ever does. Let's be honest when was the last time fanfic authors made Dumbledore a compelling villain and not just a man making grand plans while grabbing power off panel despite constantly making really dumb decisions and bragging about his plan. Seriously most Dark!Dumbledore/ Dumbledore bashing fics makes me wonder how he grabbed so much power to begin with if he makes so many stupid decisions.

Look, I'm sorry this turned into such a long rant, but this has been bothering me for a long time and I needed to get it off my chest.

Do you agree, what do you think makes a good Dark!Harry Fic, what pet peeves do you harbor resentments against?

**** Kind of yes and kind of no. While I do acknowledge that it is how you use magic that matters in the end, and the classification of some things as dark or light or whatever else probably is caused by bureaucracy rather than anything sensible, in the stories this is about the excuse that the unforgivables were used for something else in the past and had oh-so-great medical or whatever uses is just nonsense and this is what matters. The Killing Curse requires the intent to /murder/, the Cruciatus Curse the intent to /torture/, the Imperius Curse the intent to /enslave/; if anyone manages to cast the Cruciatus curse on a person's heart “to prevent heart failure”, then the first question asked should be “what the fjord is wrong with that medic?” because they just demonstrated that they somehow had the intent to torture someone, and quite likely the person who was dying.

People who use those kinds of excuses do it only because they forget about those casting requirements. Don't forget about them and it becomes nigh-impossible to use the unforgivables to justify anything. Not to mention that there is at least one set of two spells, one of which is a charm and one of which is a curse and thus dark, where the basic effect is the same but the latter is classified differently because it has a secondary effect that is definitely there just to cause more harm; the spells in question are Diffindo and Sectumsempra, the latter of which leaves cursed wounds that cannot be healed, and that serves as a demonstration that at least in some cases there is no need to reach for what is classified as dark magic unless you want those secondary effects to happen. Certainly, dark magic is probably more effective in combat so I can see using pragmatism as a way of justifying its use, but going “oh, the Cruciatus has oh-so-great medical uses” is not pragmatism, it's just bullshit.

** "For the Love of Magic", it is a fic that shows a Harry that dabbles with what is termed as dark magic. To the point of even willingly sacrificing people just to make a dagger or test some anti-wolfsbane potion thing. (not spoiling too much).

It starts off pretty AU with Harry being abandoned by the Dursleys and thus ending up having a completely different childhood. Beware though, it has a lot of lemons, so if that's not your cup of tea then do not read it.

As for a completely Dark!Harry fic: I recently finished one where Harry is raised by Voldemort, under the alias of Harish Blake (or something along the lines of that).

"The Power of Potters": while a mid-rating fanfic, imo ,it does show us a Dumbledore that's at least portrayed as selfish, if not a bit evil and selfcentered. I didn't get the vibe that he is made out to be the grand mastermind of evil, but he does play an antagonistical role, although he has helped a bit along the process.

It would be way more cooler if he went to a different school, because then you can actually believe that he might find one of those books. But Hogwarts? No. I can accept finding some basic Dark Arts books in Durmstrang, but definitely not in Hogwarts. I want a Dark!Harry fic where instead of Voldemort being his mentor it's Dark!Dumbledore, and Dark!Dumbledore doesn't have control of everything. Back to my original point, Dumbledore might have some Dark Arts books hidden in his office, but I doubt you can just find whatever book you want in the RoR.

*** My understanding is that Hogwarts Library actually has books on Dark Arts, in the Restricted Section, which can be accessed without restriction by NEWT students. (They might even have unrestricted books on jinxes and such.) In fact, IIRC, books on horcruxes were to be found there, until Dumbledore removed them. Hogwarts doesn't teach Dark Arts as such (except for the year of Voldemort's reign), but DADA involves seeing enough of them to be able to cast Dark Curses, that's for sure. (Harry learning Cruciatus and Imperius is one example of a student picking up Dark Arts from Hogwarts materials; Hermione's Parchment Jinx may have been another, since it resisted reversal by professional healers.)

This is getting into headcanon territory, but I think that the difference between the Durmstrang's approach and the Hogwarts's approach is that Durmstrang actually has students practice Dark Curses, learning Dark Arts under supervision, which Hogwarts does not, so students have to learn on their own if they want to, or be taught by their own families, like Malfoys and Blacks. This is important, because Dark Arts are inherently dangerous to learn without supervision --- even more so than non-Dark magic.

After all a book in a potions classroom, left there for people who had no books of their own (HBP, Snape's Potions Book) had a scribble with a dark cutting curse, Sectumsempra...a curse created by a student while he was still attending Hogwarts...now, even if he was in Slytherin...Snape was kinda of an outcast, so where else could he have learned about dark magic and stuff?

***** It has never been clearly stated, but the clues all point to it being a dark item:

First of all if they were legal no one would bother with the floo network. Which would a snob wizard prefer? Going somewhere through a fireplace and ending up covered in shoot or entering a simple cabinet?

Second: the fact that there is one in Borgin & Burke's, while not being an outright declaration of such items being dark, combined with the fact that no one else has them can only mean two things:

1-They ARE illegal or 2-They are not usefull....and we know they are usefull

After all (that's point 3) they can even bypass the protections of hogwarts, as they for example allow one to apparate inside the grounds of hogwarts, something that the school's protections do not allow.

Of course since a lot of the wizarding population did use them during the first wizarding war we can conclude that:

A)They are a legal grey area

B)They were classified as illegal sometime after the first wizarding war

OR

C) They are not useful (something we have already ruled out)

Considering that the cabinets have two nodes and the floo network hundreds or thousands, the floo wins every time. Who want to send their cabinet on ahead every time they want to go somewhere?

That's some pretty faulty logic. It could mean any number of things. Maybe they're expensive? B&B doesn't seem cheap; the Malfoys shop and sell there. Maybe they're difficult to make. There's no mention of them being illegal, and, indeed every argument you've given to them being so is incredibly weak. They're useful, but their use, or availability, but probably both is severly limited.

No, they don't. It gets the Death Eaters into the castle, much like the Floo would. Unlike the Floo it's unknown and not controlled.

As or your final points; maybe A or B is true, but there's precious little reason to think so. As for C, they are useful, only in a very limited way compared to other means. Combine that with the fact that they're in all likelihood somewhat rare and expensive; of course they're not going to be in common use.

I want a Dark!Harry fic where instead of Voldemort being his mentor it's Dark!Dumbledore, and Dark!Dumbledore doesn't have control of everything. Back to my original point, Dumbledore might have some Dark Arts books hidden in his office, but I doubt you can just find whatever book you want in the RoR.
