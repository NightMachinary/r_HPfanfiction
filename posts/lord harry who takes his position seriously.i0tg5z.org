a fic like 'Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament' where harry realize just how precarious his position is being the uneducated famous sole heir to a noble house and eligible to inherit another, so he resolves to be more proactive.

instead of reacting to whatever life throws at him and only surviving through sheer dumb luck by reevaluating his friends and acquaintances, educating himself on the wizarding world, managing his fame and wealth better as to not become the obvious scapegoat for whenever shit hits the fan (hiring lawyer, managers, political advisors..), along with surrounding himself with competent people who are either loyal or have an invested interest in his success to advise and balance his laking instead of friends who either abandon him or make his situation worse in misguided attempt to help.

basically a harry who realizes that he is not just harry.
