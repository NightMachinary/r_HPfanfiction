In a world where wizards and witches consider themselves gods, Herpo creates a Horcrux to fight the Olympians on equal grounds. He also rides his Basilisk, called Typhon, to destroy them. Unfortunately for him, a wizard called Zeus defeated both him and his Basilisk, and Herpo went down in history as "the Foulest of humans".


** Meh! Herpo the Foul was called that due to reasons relating to personal hygiene.
