Voldemort's Last Spell by Louis IX

Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?

- I'll be honest, I have no clue what this story is even about. I read what was there around 2006-7 and then the author disappeared and it suddenly updated again a month ago? I remember Louis as the author of Mastermind Hunting which was an enjoyable, if overly complicated read. I'll probably re-read the whole thing once it updates a few more times.

Blood Crest by Cauchy

The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

- Another case of "updating out of the blue after years of inactivity". I generally like this one, good plot and characterization. However it's starting to feature quite a bit of Harry being subservient to Voldemort and I don't like that vibe too much.

Weeb Adventures by Andrius

Harry's leisurely life as Britain's celebrated hero is upended when his best friend helps him realize he has lost sight of what's truly important. Armed with harebrained plans and driven by manly dreams, they set out for Central Europe in search of the legendary harpy queen. Sequel to Weeb.

- This is hands down my current favorite story. Harry is very fun mix of lazy, talented, adventurous and hedonistic. Never fails to bring a smile to my face, plus there's an actual post!Voldemort plot which is a rare thing indeed.

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin

As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

- This is in my favorites due to inertia, I'm just too lazy to log in ffn and remove it. After reading the first ~30 chapters way back I concluded that it's going nowhere and is in fact a multi-year troll attempt by the author. I read new chapters every now and then if I want to get pissed off.

Whiskey Time Travel by Sapper One

When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

- This is a rewrite of the fairly well-known story. I enjoyed the previous version, am now waiting for more to get posted before reading this one.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] Harry is raised by a necromancer, it has some really good parts, some parts drag on a bit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11233445/1/Whiskey-Time-Travel][Whiskey Time Travel]] Harry ends up in the '70s. He's some sort of Dep. of Mysteries super spy. It's being rewritten now.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5562313/1/Out-of-the-Depths][Out of the Depths]] I have no idea what this is, it's a fic from another age that I have no memory of. But it started updating again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][Grow Young With Me]] Widower Harry gets to know a muggle woman. It's a character piece, everyone is very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]] A fem!Harry fic used to explore and expand the magical world. It's Taure so the quality is there. However I'll say it suffers from an excess of Malfoy.

** *How to Get Engaged To Hermione Granger*: Hermione's extended family are dicks, they're massive dicks, her grandmother cut contact with her mother because her mother got pregnant with Hermione out of wedlock. After the War Hermione's family is starting to reconcile, so Hermione who's sick of being talked down to by her family invites Harry to a dinner party as her plus one to kinda get her through the evening, Harry being Harry accidently gets them engaged to each other. It's a fun fic, no real high stakes plot wise just two close friends pretending to be engaged and then eventually ending up in an actual relationship. I am enjoying it and this is coming from someone who has been thoroughly burnt out on Harmony for the past year. linkffn(13581651)

*If Not for Umbridge*: Daphne Greengrass ends up joining Dumbledores Army on a whim, and the story progresses from there. not really much to say, but I am liking that Ron and Hermione are pretty friendly towards Daphne and Tracey in this fic, and Tracey has her own ambitions (she wants to play quidditch professionally, but can't really practice because the slytherin team monopolizes the pitch at all times) It's a fun little fic and from what i've read so far. linkffn(13566959)

*Legacy*: Slytherin dies and reincarnates as Harry Potter, ends up going to hogwarts and meeting Cedric who is Gryffindor's reincarnation. This isn't just normal reincarnation and forget either this is you die and remember EVERYTHING levels of reincarnation. Very fun fic and I love the interactions between Harry and Cedric, and watching them do things around Hogwarts is great linkffn(13255912)

*A Court of Flowers*: Harry and Fleur story from Harry's first person point of view, It talks about dealing with your fame and getting past expectations that others have of you. I love the character moments between Harry and Fleur I also like the moments between Dumbledore and Harry, this Dumbledore doesn't just sit there and let Harry go into the tournement unprepared, he gives him his personal Journal that has every single spell he and Grindewald ever thought up including the cool blue fire dragon thing from fantastic beasts, they sit down for tea every so often and talk about the journal that Wulfric or Percival gave Harry, great interactions all around linkffn(13298565)

*Harry Potter, Squatter*: Harry ends up being abandoned in New York and takes up residence in the Empire State building, in the Temple of -Redacted-, He meets Hestia and goes from there. Really cute crossover and a great story over all, there are alot of bullshit moments in it where you think "oh come on! How did he get away with that!?" , but it's a fun story nonetheless. linkffn(13274956)

*** Wow - I just read Legacy and its absolutely brilliant.

I'm hooked, I hope that the rest of the story is written soon.

Its a bit random that James Potter is Indian, but it didn't throw me out of the immersion, so I guess its not the biggest deal. I always saw him as the quintessential old money English nobility and not from the subcontinent, but maybe there is a story reason for it later on?

Its a fab story though, I love it. Can't wait for another 17 chapters!

****** it was a plot bunny that bit the author after someone asked about the possibility

from their tumblr page

Because you seriously cannot give me one Tamil James Potter headanon and not expect me to worldbuild. You cannot. Here have some rambly headcanons:

The Tamil lineage of the Potter clan are possibly wizarding Iyers (I say possibly because well Tamil surnames /shrug/) that emigrated during the Raj.

They adopted the name Potter after a Potter marrying into their family and maybe converted eventually because it made things simpler. But all their other Iyer Tamil customs and traditions remained.

However the Tamil Potter line stayed strictly Tamil (Brahmin - if we're going to be honest, they were picky about that) for years. They eased off later on, about any kind of purity and were the first branch of the all the Potters to do so.

James mother is a practising Hindu and a classical singer. She thinks her clan is the Pillai clan but her family too emigrated during the Raj so there's a lot of lost family history. His father is a non practising Christian.

James speaks Tamil at home. He knows more spells in Tamil and Sanskrit than English and Latin.

His parents call him ‘kanna' at home.

Communication is James' main issue in Hogwarts because doing so in English all the time is exhausting for him. He constantly code-switches to Tamil without realising it, and then when he does he has to go back and repeat himself in

English which frustrates him to no end. He gets much better, but it stays a problem throughout his life at Hogwarts, and is prominent mostly when he's back from his holidays.

McGonagall knows a little bit of Tamil, and she is the House head, so she tells James that her door is open whenever she needs to rant. He appreciates it immensely.

Sirius and him initially bond over being the two oddball purebloods. Peter and him bond over missing their homes.

Everyone bonds with Remus because honestly Remus incites this feeling in them to take care of him, which he always protests and never understands.

James makes it five weeks before sending out a lengthy ranty letter to his mother grumbling about how he's missing her cooking. He wanted to hold out until Christmas vacations, but it's his first Deepavali away from home and he's homesick.

Four days later there's a huge parcel delivered to him. His mother sends him a whole lot of homemade Deepavali sweets and a whole bunch of recipes. His father sends him detailed instructions on exactly how to sneak down to the kitchens and cajole the house elves into making those dishes. (And also a small sympathy note: because son he knows your plight. He can't live without his wife's cooking either.)

Sirius and Peter steal most of the sweets, give a Remus a share, and then join James in sneaking down to the kitchens. (Later James's parents will realise that this may have been what started their child's prankster streak. They don't care that much.)

The rest of the Marauders learn Tamil in secret. It's absolutely frustrating and Sirius and Peter are just done 90% of the time. But James' reaction the first time he realises that when he code-switched unconsciously and the rest of his friends just followed his lead, is priceless and worth it. Peter actually clicked a picture of it. Remus sent it to the Potters. James' mom sent them sweets in return.

Also knowing Tamil comes in handy later on whenever they're planning pranks or excursions. And once they decide to create the Map and become Animagi to give Remus company during his transformations.

By their third year, the Potters send Sirius, Remus and Peter Deepavali gifts and sweets along with James' cache.

During his fourth year vacations James and his mother finally convince Mr. Potter to visit India. James and his mom go to her native village, and her family temple, and a whole tour of various places. He takes a fuck tonne of pictures and buys a whole lot of stuff for the rest of the Marauders. He comes back to Hogwarts sun burned brown and a slightly nasal twange to his accent, and so so many gifts for the rest of the Marauders. They make a pact to go there together one day, when school is done, so that James can show them this aspect of his world.

James also learns to cook during this time because his mother forces him to learn. He appreciates this fact years later when he can spoil a pregnant Lily. (He never thought she'd like vegetarian food so much.)

The first time Mrs Potter called Sirius ‘kanna' he might have cried. For hours. James is a good friend who never mentions it.

When Sirius comes to stay with them, he becomes best friends with James' mom and the two of them chat in rapid fire Tamil for hours.

After Lily and James' sixth month anniversary Sirius is the one who offers to teach Lily Tamil. While this is how they find out that Lily is gifted with languages, her accent is wrong. Mrs. Potter adores her anyway, and adores Sirius more for teaching her, and James is too busy swooning over the fact that Lily picked up Tamil for him, to bother or notice that his friends are laughing at him.

Even though their wedding is rushed, Lily still wears James' mother's bridal sari, instead of a wedding gown. James' cries the moment he sees it because his mother would've wanted it. Sirius is a good enough friend and Best Man to not laugh at him for the rest of his life. (Also, as Remus reminds him later on, because he was crying too. They all were.)

James wanted to take Lily to his mother's native village in India too. She said when the war was over they'd go, and drag their friends too.

Once Harry bonds with them, finally after years, Remus plans to teach him Tamil. Sirius searches everywhere for Mrs Potter's recipe book, and the various other recipes he knows he had. Because both of them hate the knowledge that

Harry has grown up without his culture, something James took a deep pride in. They know that if Harry grew up with

James and Lily, this is what he'd have grown up with, and they want him to have a taste of that.

The fact that it doesn't happen because of fucking Voldemort will be a regret that both men take to their graves.

When the War is over Ginny is the one who finds Mrs Potters recipe book. She shows it to the Trio. Hermione goes out to find books that will teach them Tamil, (emphasis them) because while it may not be the dialect Harry would have learned but it is something. Harry's emotional over the whole thing, and Ron awkwardly consoles him.

This also spurs Harry into digging into his family traditions. Ginny encourages him because she knows how important those are.

Harry and Ginny go to Mrs Potters native village eventually. Harry comes back tanned and delighted and Ginny comes back with far more freckles, and a bunch of sarees.

The Potter-Weasley and extended family speak Tamil at home eventually.

The first time James Sirius curses in Tamil near McGonagall, she sends Harry a letter telling him that his son sounds exactly like his namesake when he was a child.

Ginny frames the letter on the wall.

I'm glad I'm not the only one seeing this. I can be reading a perfectly normal fic and then a guy will say to his girlfriend that he's bisexual or something and it's be irrelevant from there on.

  When Harry offers to help Hermione out by joining her at a quaint family diner, it's no big deal. But when he gets angered by her stupid cousin and decides to fake propose, it is. How far will they go to sustain their facade? And what happens when unwanted feelings start to blossom? This will be a romcom Harmony story. EWE. No Ginny/Ron-bashing. Rated M for later content.

** So I rarely use ff.net anymore in favor of Ao3, so this is the five most recently updated stories that I follow/subscribe to from ff.net and Ao3 combined, excepting the fics that are very early in progress so it's premature to leave a review. These five stories may not be 'favorites', but they are interesting enough for me to be subscribed. Also, I only included Harry Potter fics, of course.

--------------

*Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis* by Enigmaris\\
/An MCU/Harry Potter crossover. Female Harry Potter (Holly Potter), years after the events of the books, finds herself leaving Britain for various reasons and staying away from the magical world. After becoming the Avengers' cleaning lady shortly after the invasion of New York, Holly gradually finds herself sucked into the defense of Earth against various threats./\\
Unlike other MCU/HP crossovers, this doesn't throw characters at the reader right from the start. The cast does get large towards the end (the fic is in its final stages right now), but the author thankfully doesn't feel the need to tell the reader exactly what goes on with every character at all times, which cuts down on the bloat. And the vast majority of the characters are minor, as it is a Holly-centric story. Holly is very powerful, and gains new powers later on in the fic, but those powers come at a high cost. Due to various reasons, Holly never seems overpowered, which is a huge relief. The author rather cleverly fits the wizarding world into the world of the MCU in a way that makes sense. It's not a shipping fic either. Unfortunately, the few wizarding world characters present in the fic behave rather OOC, and the whole Jarvis/Hogwarts subplot and the integrating technology into Hogwarts subplot both were mistakes in my opinion, though that's mostly personal preference. I dislike the idea of modernizing Hogwarts.

--------------

*The Bureaucratic Error* by Iniga\\
/A Peggy Sue fic where, after he dies, Remus is sent back in time to the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban. Remus tries to change the timeline as best he can, given the information he has at the time of his death./\\
The author did a great job with only allowing Remus to know what he would have known in canon. In other words, no knowledge of Horcruxes, Deathly Hallows, or what happened to Harry in the forest. Therefore Remus has to discover the existence of the Horcruxes on his own. Remus also struggles with the matter of his relationship with Tonks, which is largely handled well by the author. Sirius is characterized very well, especially when he struggles with the lingering effects of Azkaban. In fact, Sirius may be the best-written character among a whole host of believable characters. The author also likes to recommend other fics at the end of each chapter, which is a nice touch.

--------------

*Intensity* by MarauderLover7\\
*The fifth book in the Innocent series (Innocent, Initiate, Identity, Impose) that started when Sirius broke out of Azkaban sooner than in canon. Harry is therefore raised by a loving godfather. In Intensity, the Triwizard Tournament is happening at Hogwarts and Harry finds himself somehow entered into the tournament by Voldemort. Unlike canon, Voldemort makes no secret to Harry that it's his doing.\\
Each book is very well-written (except for an annoying subplot at the end of the first book) and Intensity is doubly so. The author does not feel the need to heed rigidly to canon, instead choosing to use canon as a loose guide. Many characters are very well done. In this book so far, Fleur, Ron, Tonks, and Draco are particular standouts. I can't recommend the series enough.

*Grow Young With Me* by [[/u/taliesin19]]\\
/A widowed Harry Potter trying to muddle through life without the woman he loved more than anything encounters a curious waitress in a Muggle coffee shop. A story of healing and learning to deal with past trauma and moving on and taking a chance on love again./\\
This is one of the best romance fics I have ever read. It's believable, has excellent and canon characterizations of everyone, has incredibly well-written and flawed OCs, and is emotionally powerful. Harry's children are utterly adorable and behave exactly like children (for better or for worse).

--------------

*In Defiance of Destiny* by AgentGrey\\
/A Peggy Sue fic in which a Hermione from a future where Voldemort effectively won manages to send herself back to early in the story of the Goblet of Fire. She has a plan of how to avoid the desolation that Voldemort wreaks on everyone and must figure out how to subtly implement it and save her friends./\\
This a romance fic between Hermione and Fleur, which is handled very well overall. It also features trans Harry Potter, which is a major subplot. I love both the romance and the coming out of +Harry+ she-whose-new-name-is-revealed-in-the-fic. Very fun characters. Luna is a minor character but is wonderful in every way. Ginny is hilarious.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  Voldemort didn't stay dead at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, and things got very, very bad. Ancient magic returns a 20-year-old Hermione back to her 15-year-old body, and she must set up complicated plans in secret to ensure the end of the world doesn't come to pass. Her first goal is to stop Voldemort before his body is restored, but she cannot do it alone. She must enlist the help of at least one of the champions of the Triwizard Tournament if she has any shot at stopping Voldemort and protecting Harry in the process. And she is as surprised as anyone when she finds love along the way.If you enjoy Fleurmione stories, sibling dynamics between Hermione and Harry, or time-travel fix-its generally, this is the story for you! Also, this features a major trans storyline, because JKR is a transphobic bigot and we deserve better.I make no promises about any kind of an update schedule. If you're a fan of any of my other works, you'll know I can be all over the place. Sorry! But I'm a busy lawyer. I do have the gist of the story plotted out, and as with all my stories, I promise not to abandon it.

** There aren't many replies here, so I'll begin!

The first in the list is Second Time Around by Neko-Tenchi. It's been updating more frequently these past few months, so I'm happy that the writer is having such a productive rush in the lock down. Honestly speaking, it was a really good story. It's among the lengthiest Dramion(i)es I've read, and the time fold and characterization is amazing. Unlike many others, the plot armour doesn't break easy, and the OCs are really well thought out and contribute to the story, without being overbearing. If Time Traveling Dramione is your thing, you should definitely check it out. Warning, a bit of heat, with warnings before the chapters.

Second- New Blood, by Artemis Blood Ah, to see Slytherin Hermione. This is amazing on multiple levels. The characterisation (I'm a sucker for well thought out characters), the implications, all the characters in the world she's created, the way *she describes magic*; Holy hell, it's /AMAZING/. I especially like her portrayal of the Hermione's house mates (ahem ahem Blaise, Draco and Jude(hope I got that right)), the parents (a bit ideal, but okay), and drumroll.... Snape. I hate it when people turn Snape into an angel in Slytherin!Hermione fics, but I feel like they've done a very good job here. He's an arsehole, but he's an arsehole who looks out for his snakes. Very much appreciated. Addendum, (人/´∀｀)｡/ﾟ /witchcraft/ (/´ω｀/) ALSO, SHE'S VERY REGULAR ABOUT UPDATES, SO THANKS! The first two chapters were a /bit/ awkward for /me/, but it's a fic which keeps evolving. I look forward to future updates :)

Third- Curls & Kisses by Luxsolis Now, I'm not a very big HarryxHermione shipper, but damn if she didn't change my mind. Brilliant. Abso-fuckin-lutely /brilliant/. I love this writer, and I deeply regret not having discovered her earlier. Beautiful. Anything that you know about wizarding society, throw it out the window, because she's here to redesign it. Her world is so well structured, and she reimagines the characters so well, my heart hurts. Some might say that her characters are a bit OOC, and I can't say much about it, other than the fact that these characters have slightly different origin stories, and /life will impact them./ They don't drift too far from the characters that we know and love; it's just that a few traits stand out more due to their different conditions. I generally love all her fics, but one of them seemed a bit reverse rapey to me, so I don't know. Her work has some /heat/, so be warned.

1. An Unexpected Malfoy, by RiverWriter I'm well aware that RiverWriter is already somewhat famous within the community, so I'll try to keep this short. The first chapter really kicks things off to a great start, and the rest of the chapters follow pace. Another Dramione, as might be expected of me, though to be fair, I'm okay with most ship pairings. I'm a bit on the fence about the characterisation here, for the sole reason that we generally don't see Draco being much of an arsehole here. Or at all in general, even though the upbringing up to the age of 12 was cannon. I understand that he has a lot of respect for Narcissa, but if my mum got friendly with someone I considered below me, and/or as an enemy, you can bet that every time my mum made an such mentions of hypothetical person, I'd be fuming over here. Their friendship is easy, and plot armour is strong, but as someone who's really into angst /right now/, and will surely regret this comment later, (I'M SO SORRY RIVERWRITER) , it's a bit too... Idealistic. Everything is. Maybe it's because in the original everybody just let kids run around like a train wreck, and we were constantly waiting for the kids to get into trouble (the plot), seeing adults expertly handle everything, with the kiddos facing kid sized difficulties, seems too rational. I don't know what exactly I'm complaining about, since I'm a huge Slice of Life fan, but there it is. Could be me just being too nitpicky of course. Still a good read, for anyone who's interested.

Last but not the least, Howl for Me by Kittenshift17. Right, marriage law fic. I can't remember all the details right now, but a must read for everyone who is on a marriage law trope trip. Happens to the best of us, don't worry. This is actually very, very well written. It adds a few new elements, as you can always expect from this particular author, or if nothing else, from the title. Characters are very well drawn up, a bit steamy, but I went in knowing the rating. You can kind of get the sense that the author really has high regards for Hermione, but that's just my opinion. The author is doing a good job with the side pairings as well, which I've often seen others ignore. I especially love how well everyone is bonding as adults. There's the acceptance of flaws and a well handled calling out of bullshit. I've noticed only one, and I mean a tiny scratch on the plot armour, but nothing worth discussing about. I personally don't enjoy Hermione's monologue in the opening chapters, but this is a really satisfying fic. I would pressure the author to update more often, but I don't think I've reached that level of thoughtlessness yet. Either ways, I was surprised to read the update, because I'd fantasised about the story to such an extent, that the sudden realisation that none of it was actually written was seriously unexpected.

Thank you for reading through my long rants. I'm really bad at keeping things short.

  The Ministry enacts a Marriage Law, magically pairing couples who'd never in a million years agree to even speak, let alone wed. Paired off with Malfoy, Hermione has to suffer the added indignity of the Ministry banning all contraception and forcing fertility treatment and aphrodisiacs on them all. Draco's secret makes it worse.

** I really need some new stuff to read. The first two entries here are pretty embarrassing.

1) *Loose Cannon* by manattee-vs-walrus

This story is just about readable. There's never been much genuine conflict and everything is so convenient and perfect for Harry that it's all too easy. The writing is decent enough and the Quidditch scenes are better than average, and there's just enough original stuff to keep it bearable.

2) *Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin* by The Sinister Man

A wallowing plot with a cast of thousands. I stick with this out of bloody-mindedness more than anything else now. It's over a million words - twice as long as War and Peace ffs - and I've invested enough time in it that I feel I can't just let it go. I can't remember when I last found it particularly enjoyable though.

3) *Intensity* by MarauderLover7

Book V of the Innocent series. I can't help but feel this is dragging on now. The original twist of Harry being raised by Sirius has long since passed and we're now in some interminable set of plots and alliances that... meh. It's just dragging. It's a good series but it needs to get to the fucking point soon.

4) *Grow Young With Me* by Taliesin19

Harry's lost Ginny but now he's found... we'll see. It's a really good character piece. The real stars are Harry's kids, who are each given a proper personality and appropriate dialogue. My problem is that the main two characters have been falling in love forever and now we're kind of getting to the point where something is about to happen I can almost hear the gears crunching as the author tries to negotiate the tricky change of pace.

5) *The Futile Facade* by murkybluematter

Being pro-Europe I always think of this as The Futile Farage, but that's another story... This one is book four of the Pureblood Pretense series, and it's another good sequel. The hoops through which the protagonists have to jump to maintain the pretence keep being raised, yet they manage to sail through every time. That's my one big gripe about the series - the two main characters manage to come up with a plan at age 11 that, with the occasional tweak here and there, keeps the whole wizarding world oblivious to what's going on. But I can ignore that because there's a huge amount of original material in each of the stories that is always well-written and engaging.

0) [Title redacted] by TheEndless7

*** I feel like Loose Cannon has conflict, but it isn't the kind we are used to in fanfic. It's the conflict within Harry's mind between what he is “supposed to be” against what he wishes to do, whether that be quidditch, (I agree the scenes are good), or his personal life. There's also plenty of space to add interpersonal conflict along with Harry's abilities. It's definitely a lighter drama compared to life and death in so many others, and has been enjoyable in contrast to darker fics like Fate.

** Mastermind Hunting! Now there's a name I haven't heard in years. If I recall, the story was really interesting, but I randomly quit because I got busy, I think now might be a good time to get back into it. Also I think Blood Crest has always updated frequently? I've been following it for a while and I can't remember a long period of inactivity?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin:]] A lot of people on this sub have really mixed feelings on this fic, but I really enjoy it because of the worldbuilding and vast number of storylines. I don't really mind if it never truly finishes (similar to ASOIAF), I just enjoy reading the updates and seeing what direction each of the characters (who are really entertaining to read) go.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina:]] I didn't even realize this fic updated recently because I never followed it, so I should probably get on rereading that. A Regulus survives story in which he saves his brother and Harry from their canon lives, really detailed and a good read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13283547/1/More-Than-One-Way-to-Skin-a-Cat:]] Snape + Harry time travel story that does ignore quite a few of Snape's flaws, but manages to be an interesting twist on the classic. Fun and lighthearted for the most part.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13408693/1/Rupert-Grint-and-the-Tears-of-Osiris:]] This sub was really into this fic for a while IIRC. It's a fun and concise read that doesn't drag on.

** Limiting myself to solely HP fics, as well as to ones i actually remember the plot of because one or two stories i haven't read in years apparently updated recently, i'm left with two, both crossovers with Marvel, heh (i've been reading a lot of Mass Effect, Star Wars, and Buffy fics, recently).

Ghosts of the Past by Nimbus Llewelyn, sequel to Child of the Storm. basically, in this, Odin had tried to humble Thor by making him a mortal once before. as James Potter. who returned to Asgard when he was "murdered" by Voldemort, only to have Odin block his memories of that life for fear that Thor would destroy the earth in his rage at the death of his wife. fast forward to year three, where Harry's abilities as a Telepath are awakened when he's attacked by Dementors and instinctively calls out for help, heard by Loki, who restores Thor's memories so he can save him. it's also a crossover with a number of other series, including DC (Harry's "Cousin" on his father's side is Wonder Woman, for example, and his mother is now a permanent avatar of the Phoenix, AKA Destruction of the Endless, an eighth sibling of their number) and the Dresden Files (with Harry Dresden becoming the apprentice of Wanda Maximoff, herself the apprentice of Steven Strange. as well as Harry Potter's godmother).

honestly, it all crosses over surprisingly well and is one of my favorite fics out there now.

​

A Third Path to the Future by Vimesenthusias. i actually have a more mixed opinion of this one, to be honest, it started off pretty promising, but has started to drag on, and has been bogged down by the decision to make it a harem fic, albeit one of the better ones out there in that regard. basic premise is that a very powerful Harry walks through the veil and winds up in the negative zone for quite some time, quietly going insane until he comes upon some of the minions of Annihlus attempting to kidnap an infant Franklin Richards, who he rescues. leading to him meeting and leaving with the Fantastic Four, who he becomes friends with. fast forward to him moving into Xavier Mansion for a time to help train the X-Men in tactics, before moving on and forming his own super team called the World Guardians (Custodes Mundi), which the X-Men become subordinate to. also has him dating Storm, Jean Grey, Emma Frost, and most recently Hel. current threat that his group is trying to deal with is a potential invasion by the Kree.

** 1- Live Forever by Petrificus Somewhatus [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13577616/1/Live-Forever]] Hermione ignores Dumbledore and contacts Harry over the summer. Really terrific, all of the authors stories are. HHr

2- The Code by Aduro [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2750775/1/The-Code]] Honestly have no idea what this is or what it's about. The story just got updated after longer than a decade. Apparently Draco is a genius and is friends with Bill?

5- Green Eyed Beast by MrWriterWriter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13219690/1/Green-Eyed-Beast]] James and Sirius give Harry a gift to help him in the future. Short chapters but satisfying, I wish there was more of it.

  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13606101/1/All-Because-Of][All Because Of:]] It claims to be "drama", but I honestly read it as humour. The word "lord" was used 25 times in chapter 4 ("lady" was used 8 times). I'm honestly just hoping for an update on The Last Casualties by the same author. Anyway, when Harry turns 10 he receives a letter from his future self so he goes to Gringotts and becomes a rich lord- I'm sure you know the drill by now.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][The Prince of Slytherin:]] It gets recommended around here all the time. But I've grown tired of it. Every chapter just raises more questions than it answers and the author is constantly punishing the good guys for succeeding. I'm just not that into torture porn. Good must triumph over evil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11811498/1/Reclaiming-the-House-of-Black][Reclaiming the House of Black:]] I don't even know, man. I'm pretty sure it was just 2 or 3 chapters long about Sirius putting Molly in her place. But now it's 16 chapters and nearly 60k words. Go figure.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12927652/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unexpected-Dogfather][The Unexpected Dogfather:]] Again- I don't even know. I'm beginning to think I'm not using favourites the right way. I /think/ I've read the first part- The Unexpected Friend and this is a sequel. I guess I'm waiting for the sequel to be complete because I don't remember reading it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][Grow Young with Me:]] This one also gets recommended often and it's a great fic. Especially since I'm not a big fan of romance-only stories and the premise is a bit boring- Harry is a widower and goes to a cafe for his lunch break and gets pestered by a waitress. But honestly the OC- Abby- is so well written that the fic just works. Even at 240k words it's still going strong and I can't wait for more.

linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) - WBWL, Slytherin Harry, insanely detailed world/character building, but the plot thickens very slowly

linkffn(Grow Old With Me) - Post-War Harry/OC fluffy romance. Possibly my favorite OC in any fic I've read.

linkffn(Casting Shadows) - I'm not sure why this is favorited, I guess to remind me to read it, but I haven't, so idk.

linkffn(Soul Scars) - both my favorite soul bond fic and favorite Harry/Multi fic

linkffn(The Wolf Lord) - Harry was raised as a werewolf in America by Remus and his OC wife. They go to Hogwarts when Sirius escapes Azkaban

** Restricting it to just HP fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13436100/1/Ghost-of-Privet-Drive][Ghost of Privet Drive]] - An SI fic, not something I normally enjoy, but this one is an interesting twist on the concept. The SI basically takes the form of a bodiless spirit caring for a young Harry as best he can.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13589237/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Girl-Who-Tried][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Tried]] - A one-shot that if memory serves actually originated from a prompt posted here in this sub. Daphne Greengrass is stuck in a marriage contract with Harry Potter, where the only way out she can find is his death. Shenanigans ensue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13326497/1/Post-Apocalyptic-Potter-from-a-Parallel-Universe][Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe]] - A crossover with the MCU and Marvel in general, mostly Harry and the Avengers kicking all the baddies' arses and making the world a better place through technomancy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council][Harry Potter, et al, and the Keystone Council]] - Five different versions of Harry from five different realities find themselves linked mind-to-mind from an early age, and use information from each other's worlds to try and figure out what's going on in their own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][The Perils of Innocence]] - The Dursleys dump Harry off at a children's mental institution, where he gradually learns to overcome their mistreatment of him and starts to examine the strange things that happen around him sometimes. Eventually, two other children are brought in with similar abilities, and they learn about them together until they're contacted by a strange school called Hogwarts.

I don't tend to Favorite many in-progress fics, since I hate getting hooked into a fic only to find it was abandoned halfway through, but some are good enough or unique enough to merit it.

*** The description of Keystone Council makes me think of [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Series-2585][A Brane of Extraordinary Women]], where Hermione visits various alternate settings (Buffy, Stargate, Alex Mack, etc) to gather a Chosen One from each and beat a multiversal threat.

The original story is ok, but what makes it particularly interesting is how the author has then written other (long) stories about how the experience affected each of them after they returned home. For example, Alex gets serious about superheroing, getting her family to help her devise a name and costume, building publicity, and making connections with the alternate versions of people she recognises like Willow (who in her world is a genius computer programmer). There's also a nonmagical Hermione-oriented rewrite of canon, where "Harworts" is a training school for children to go into jobs like MI6.

** I normally only 'Favourite' fics when they are completed or abandoned so I'll post from my Follow list instead (which is more relevant given the recent update criterion).

1. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) -- This is a fic where Harry is abandoned by his parents in favour of the WBWL and gets sorted into Slytherin which he slowly comes to dominate. Some of the politicing was fun, the MC was interesting to start with and the explanations for oddities in canon were well thought out but it has gone quite cracky and self interested. I haven't read this in ages. I think last time I did Pettigrew was boning Narcissa Malfoy.
2. linkffn(A Godfather's Promise by The Metal Sage) -- Harry raised by Sirius and turns out more confident. Starts in 4th year with his name coming out of the Goblet. Harry is into BDSM (especially bondage) but it is his secret shame until Fleur finds out and is into it too. Fun ensues but not a smutfic more like a normal AU story that happens to include consenting but kinky adults.
3. linkffn(The Greatest of Secrets by Ajjaxx) -- Just starting out. Harry is powerful so the French unspeakables send Fleur (an agent) to recruit him. Not great so far but I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt.
4. linkffn(A Court of Flowers by DavidTheAthenai) -- Harry/Fleur fic of some sort. I honestly can't remember anything about it.
5. linkffn(Apex by JustBored21) -- Harry is rejected by everyone following Goblet and decides to stop being medicore. Gets more confident and has a lot more fun. Harry/Fleur/Tonks

Weirdly Harry/Fleur is in 4/5 of these but that is just a coincidence, I think.

** Ok, so disclaimer here off the bat --- I VERY RARELY favourite fics. I follow quite a few, but I take the whole “favourite” thing very literally, so there are a couple of fics on here that haven't been updated in 2020.

1 - linkffn(Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin) by The Sinister Man. I know this is a pretty controversial one on here. You love it or you hate it, is what it seems. Personally, this is my all time favourite fanfiction by a country mile. The world building is second to none and the plot is intricate and unpredictable. There will be a one off scene that comes up and you think it's pointless and then, somehow, that scene will be foreshadowing for some Earth shattering revelation later. I love the unpredictability of this fic, as well as the ways it explains the flaws of canon and subverts some of the more used tropes for WBWL stories.

2 - linkffn(Harry Potter and The International Triwizard Tournament) by SalientCasualty. This fic starts off in a bit of a cliched manner, but it really does pick up and make the best of its starting point. In many ways, this fic is similar to DarknessEnthroned's “A Cadmean Victory” --- Harry is abandoned by his friends after the GOF fiasco, he seeks refuge in the Chamber of Secrets, is mentored by Salazar Slytherin (through his writings in this fic) and on and on. But this fic really wins me over with its emphasis on magical theory. It's system of magic is very interesting, and it has one of my favourite OC's I've ever read in fanfiction, as well as her family. Harry's characterization in this one is also very fun.

3 - linkffn(The Champion's Legacy) by skiranth1808. This is the sequel to “The Other Champion”. In the first book, Harry and Cassius Warrington sere the two Hogwarts champions. Warrington was built up beautifully as a character and given an absolutely heart touching background. This also features a Haphne pairing, which I know is popular. Honestly, I'm not too bothered about that, but the way the pairing is written is very fun. Full disclosure, I'm pretty sure I meant to follow this fic and not favourite it. I have only read the first few chapters, which are good, but I'm waiting for more updates so I can binge the story.

4 - linkffn(Twelve Days) by TheEndless7. Most of what TE7 has written is on my favourites list to be honest. The only reason his newest fic isn't is because it's been so long that I need to reread it XD. As for this one, it's a Harry/Gabrielle fic, and possibly the best one ever done. Even if it isn't, its only competition is TE7's other story, so... But anyway, this is a post war fic that is beautifully done. Short and sweet at 40 something k words, it is a brilliant fluffy story! The romance is done pretty much perfectly.

5 - linkffn(The Mind Arts) by Wu Gang. Unfortunately, I'm 95% sure this is abandoned, but it was fun as hell while it lasted. Granted, the fic gets a bit iffy near the end, but the first 90% of it is marvellous if you're into this kind of thing. Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw with the magic and the mind to one day be on equal footing with the likes of Dumbledore and Voldemort. Harry slowly evolved from an extreme introvert to the leader of a close knit, small circle of friends. The magic in this fic is amazing! I'm a sucker for some good magical theory, and the author uses Harry's prodigious nature to take us through his own system of magic.

** 1. Loose Cannon by manatee-vs-walrus

Its a EWE fic. Post war. Harry is sick of being an auror and joins chudley cannons. It actually shows a good character development for all our characters. It a light read. There are 69 chapters so far, but i think the plot is just starting to thicken. It's updated twice a week at least. I would recommend it as a good-light-long fic read.

​

1. Harry Potter and the Prince of Sltherin - The Sinister Man

This is a loooooong fic. It is based on the "harry is the twin of BWL" trope. 136 chapters (approx 1 million words) and we have barely completed the 3rd yr (only school yr, summer vacation story just started). It is a super complicated fic. I am still hanging on because I like the characterization and story. After the pandemic started, the author has started updating 2-3 times a month.

​

1. Soulless Marriage - Jpena

Snape and Hermione time travel and adopt tom riddle. This is an awesome fic. I personally love the writing. It is 64 chapters old (200k words long). The pandemic is responsible for frequent (3-4 times a month) updating of the fic. The tom riddle (snape) 'betterment' project part of the fic is over. Now we are at a point where he is an adult. 40-50 yrs old. Its pretty good.

​

1. Basilisk Born by Ebenbild

I found this fic only recently (which is why it shows in the latest updated, it was last updated in march). It is a super long fic. 64 chapters and 625k words so far.

I love this fic. Harry is thrown back in time. Seriously way back. The story alternates between present time and the past timeline . It's at a good place, where it is not at a super annoying cliff hanger. So if the story doesnt update, you aren't left frustrated, just disappointed. Still I am praying for an update.

(5th is actually howl for me, but that has already been talked about)

​

1. Lord of Time - DebsTheSlytherinSpaneFan

This is one of my fav. ongoing fics. It is so good. So well written. The updates are sporadic, but not enough that you lose interest. 92 chapters and 443k words. It is an absolute must read IMO.

Harry is the Master of Death. He dies (not really clear as to why) and goes back in time. He is a class mate of Tom Riddle. This is such a good read. The fic is not particularly dark. Harry doesn't change completely and love all things evil etc. Its a completely new story about characters that you ve known and read about.

** Of the ones I've actually been reading, instead of followed because it's on my list... and four of them are crossovers :x All from AO3 because I avoid FFN if I can (and definitely don't use their favourites feature).

Gods Among Us by arturus - xover with Battlestar Galactica. I've read maybe half of what's published, and set it aside because... well I honestly don't remember. I'm not invested in BSG because I've literally never seen it before and everything I know about it comes from my brother waxing poetic about the original series, but that seemed to be enough to get by with. Decent story with semi-regular updates from what I've seen, would recommend especially if you're a fan of the crossover.

So We Have Some Issues... by SherlockMalfoy, a oneshot and the latest instalment of the "Iron Squib" series, a MCU crossover. Most of it is pre-slash. A different take on the MCU MoD crossover, it was an enjoyable read.

Honor Bound by sifshadowheart, Anita Blake crossover series, explicit smutty slash with tropes galore but a fun romp. I only vaguely remember reading the first one or two AB books over a decade ago and was fine with the crossover. This is part of a larger series that went on hiatus as of this instalment's completion.

That Universe Over There by mytimeconsumingsidehobby. This one isn't a crossover! Harry raises a female version of himself: cracky, absurd and hilarious at times, I highly recommend this one. Ivy is a riot, honestly.

One of One by zArkham, a Star Trek Voyager crossover. MoD trope with Harry getting taken by the Borg many years ago and joining up with the crew of Voyager when they encounter the Borg during... I think season 2? Maybe 3? I don't recall! A fusion that smashes the two histories together and somehow makes them work (the eugenics war timeline is altered a bit, etc) that's in a way more commentary on the ST universe than a rehash. They've diverged a lot from the plot of VOY, and it definitely has a fix-it feel to it. Enjoyable read.

** I will cheat a little bit and only do the most recently updated that I am actively reading.

The Imposter Complex - A teenage Tom Riddle escapes the Diary and takes on a new identity after discovering the his original self went bonkers from splitting his soul, and sets out to track down and destroy Lord Voldemort. My favorite ongoing fic.

That Was Part of the Plan - Bellatrix Black meant to go back in time 30 years and cause Grindelwald's rebellion to succeed, but instead she is thrown 30 years into the future of an alternative timeline where Grindlewald successfully started a global wizarding world. This is part 2, part 1 is complete.

Draco Malfoy Meets a Dark Lord - Draco is at the zoo when Harry is brought along with Dudley and speaks Parseltongue to the snake. Draco decides that he must be a dark lord, and decides to be his follower. This is cute and silly and I like it.

Like Brothers - After Draco and Hermione travel back from a war-torn future to give a warning, Harry is raised by Sirius and the Malfoy's with Draco as his brother. Not sure if this one is still being updated.

Para Bellum - Harry was sent back in time by a betrayed and broken Bellatrix Lestrange and meets her younger self. Part 2, part 1 is Delenda Est. Long abandoned, I am afraid.

Sorry, I don't usually read in progress stories because then they get abandoned and it hurts my heart that they are never finished.

** The five most recently updated HP fics in my favs are:

"The Divide" linkffn(13022404). It's last update was actually the last one and wrapped up the story. It's a pretty good next-gen OC fic that explores magic, squibs, and expands the magical world just a little bit.

"A Squib at Hogwarts" linkffn(13314330). I like it. It's a bit quirky as it's written in first person and sort of like an old lady is telling her life story to a couple of kids, so there are some tangents and stuff. It's a pretty short story and I wish a lot that there was more stuff expanded on at times, but it's an interesting story different from other stuff I've read and is complete.

"Time After Time" linkffn(12558255). This one is a crossover with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. It's a story where Miss Peregrine is actually a witch who's animagus instead of a peculiar. The story is basically about her and the children under her care getting a visit from Sirius, who she once had a relationship with. It's a nice little story that finds a way to make these two universes mesh.

"The Moment it Began" linkffn(3735743) This is a pretty well-known Snape Peggy-Sue time travel. I liked it a lot because I enjoy a good time travel and it's a solid story about making one different choice can change a lot of things.

"Hard Wrought Joy" linkffn(11197165). It's a neat little AU where after an abortion gone wrong, Molly loses the ability to have children and instead has to build her family through different means. In it, she's basically an Order babysitter and sort of depicts what the war is like from her perspective and ends with making her own small family that she loves just as much as her canon one.

** Whiskey Time Travel by Sapper One

Loved it before the author started rewriting it. Havne't read what's been re-written yet though.

Daphne Potter and the Cursed Child by VereorFaux

Pairing obvious from title. Their younger daughter has a blood curse, they mess up a ritual trying to cure her and end up in the past, before their third year.

A Year Too Soon by NHunter

Harry gets his Hogwarts letter a year early. I love that premise just because I've never seen it before this story. Also, I really, really love a good title that matches the story well. Harry/Carrow twins pairing. Would like to see more of that pairing tbh, not very common.

We're In This Together by zugrian

Probably the only Harry/Pansy story in the hundreds of fics I have favourited/followed. Lots of sex scenes, but I'm currently too drunk to remember how graphic it gets.

Harry Potter and the Pursuit of Significance by ALJhp

Tbh I don't remember this story. Followed it like 5 years ago, updating recently (maybe a couple times?). Haven't re-read it yet.

** linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) - Harry is unintentionally summoned to Middle Earth by servants of Morgoth (they wanted "the master of death"), centuries before The Lord of the Rings. After being freed, he wanders the land, causing ripples in history and looking for magic that might take him home, but without a wand, he's starting from scratch. Fortunately he seems to be ageless.

linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) - Harry turned into a dragon during his primary school years, but due to the spells designed to conceal dragons from Muggle notice, no one else realised it until Hagrid brought his Hogwarts letter. Voldemort never becomes a serious threat in this story; it's just exploring his school years and the effects of Hogwarts enrolling other "unusually shaped" students. The author is a talented wordsmith with a great sense of humour.

linkffn(Pokemon: The Origin of Species) - Not a Harry Potter story, but I'll mention it anyway, because if anyone is interested in rationalist fiction, yet found the protagonist of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to be obnoxious, then they might like this one better. Red Verres is more humble and not as socially isolated. Updates monthly.

linkffn(The Potters Who Lived) - This is in the very early stages, but has potential; James had his wand when Voldemort attacked, and was able to hold him off properly. The author has a bunch of other stories in progress, too, some of which I quite enjoyed.

linkffn(Minuets in B Minor) - This isn't exactly a story, but a collection of snippets based on typos in other stories, basically asking, "What if we took the mistake seriously?" From holding a privet sorting ceremony, to cheering for the Cuddly Cannons, a word can make a difference indeed.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes.

Instead of starting his journey in ignorance, Red has spent his years studying the creatures so central to his world... and he doesn't quite agree with all the information in his books. No time for rookie mistakes here: he's on a quest to discover the true nature of Pokémon, and maybe even find out where they really come from.

  Picking up immediately where "I'll Hold Him Off" left off. An exploration of what might have happened if things had gone a little differently one Hallowe'en night in Godric's Hollow.
