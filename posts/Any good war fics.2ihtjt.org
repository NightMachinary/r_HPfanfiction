I'm talking about magical tactics, field battles...etc. How would a magical war play out?

This is a fantastic story, but it doesn't exactly match your request. It's about war and magic is a heavy factor in it, but it's muggle war focused.

Focused around the second war. Be prepared for a lot of character death.

** Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]], particularly the second major arc; 252k words, complete.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

And it's sequel 'Harry Potter and the Spiritus Crystalus'--not sure it's exactly what you're looking for, but it involves Harry befriending a Squib who's ex-Army and they fight with muggle Army tactics. There's a lot more than just war and battles though.
