  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

*** Is there really a point though? I assume when people are looking for fics, they've already read all the top tier stuff. Like, if someone is looking for Hp/LotR, you have to assume they've read Shadow of Angmar. Like we have to draw a line someone, and if a story (like browncoat green eyes) is in the top 25 most popular list (which it is), then it really shouldn't have to be recommended. We should be trying to promote some of the lesser known but still great stories rather than the ones people will find with 2 seconds of searching.

** I'm not a big fan of crossovers and it's been a long time since I read any but here's a few I remember enjoying:

Lost in Middle Earth, in which HP characters replace LOTR characters. Very cracky. linkao3(68814)

Ace of Spades and Protocol Potter. I'm going to list these two together since I read them back-to-back and there aren't a lot of fics like them. They're both Batman crossovers that pair Harry and the Joker. It's not glamorized, if I remember correctly but I read them 3 years ago. linkao3(1047582) linkao3(419325)

You Are a Paradigm. I read this back in like 2014 during my huge Sherlock phrase. It's a Johnlock in the HP universe where John is actually a wizard. linkao3(466922)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/murkybluematter][The Rigel Black series]] series is very good. It's a cross between HP and Alanna the Lioness series. Basically it's a AU where the half blood Harriet has to pretend to be her pure blood cousin in order to go to Hogwarts. Also her cousin is a boy. It's currently on book 4 but the first book is The Pureblood Pretense. The series as a whole is able to keep a great balance of heart, character, and nerdy technical stuff like magic theory.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/4509749/kleinnak][The Adventures of Harriet Potter]] is not exactly a crossover, but it's one of my favorite fan stories ever. It's a AU where Harry is a girl, but also expands the HP world as well as adds inspired characters and OCs. By inspired characters I mean they take other characters from different series and add them to the hp world. So we have a Sherlock Holmes character who is an ex Auror who currently is the headmaster of a Arts school that teaches both wizards and muggles. Or there is Uncle Iroh who is the headmaster of a Asian wizarding school and who is the character who gives quotes before every chapter. I KNOW THIS SERIES SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD BE A HOT MESS BUT ITS NOT!!!! The original plot was created by multiple people who were able to convince a friend of theirs who is an aspiring author to write the ideas into a series. The writer is very talented and does a very good job of balancing the many characters as well as the world they inhabit. It's pretty freakin fantastic. The first book is very similar to the first hp book, but still changes several things and introduces important changes that will come later. The major changes to the series really gets a kick start in book 2. The series is currently on book 5. The series can be found on FF.net, archive of our own and deviantart.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7395580/SBishoptheBard][SBishoptheBard]] is the author of the two spin-off series of the Adventures of Harriet Potter (AHP) mentioned above. once again it's not exactly crossover, but does have some character from AHP as well as some new inspired characters. I've only read part of Pacific front, but it's still a really good addition the the AHP series. Here's the authors description: Dr. Sebastian Dwightly Bishop is a Muggle-trained wizard psychiatrist, stuck as a half-cat person due to an improperly brewed Polyjuice Potion he fixed while at school. How will this kind-hearted shrink, a virgin to war, handle the hell to be found in the Pacific Campaign of America's civil war?

Oh yeah did I mention that there is a American wizarding civil war in AHP! Not sure exactly what point you should read the spinoffs but I recommend Pacific Front during AHP year 4 and maybe Mysteries maybe before starting AHP year 5
