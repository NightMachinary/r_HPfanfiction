I'd like a fic about Harry being a Healer. You know, trying to help people, but not really being a warrior. It'd be cool if you drew upon old-style country doctors for Healers who work outside of St. Mungo's, with him making housecalls and such.


** Ngl I read this as "Harry is THE doctor", and that would be... chaotic.

** linkffn(Healer Harry - A Fanfic by SalTalStudios) has Harry as a healer, but it's a crackfic and Harry acts more like House than a professional healer really should (disclaimer: I've never actually watched House, but it's the impression I get). It's an enjoyable story, at least. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13677334][Link in case the bot is still struggling]]

linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild) Harry becoming a healer is a relatively small part of the story, but it does seem to keep popping up. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411][Link]]

*** I've read Basilisk-Born, it's fun. If you haven't watched House, I'd recommend it. It's a legitimately good show.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change]]) has a healer Harry, though you only see an adult Harry in maybe two chapters.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire.

** RobSt's "No Hurry at All" linkffn(6755363). Harry's got mad defense skills but his desire is to be a medico, using both magic and Muggle medicine. He does get there but we only see a couple scenes of actual healing.
