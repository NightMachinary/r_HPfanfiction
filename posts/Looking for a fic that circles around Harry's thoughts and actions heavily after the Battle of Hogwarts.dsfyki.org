I've been searching up some but they just aren't good enough, I want depressed!Harry but not suicidal that just gets too overwhelmed. I also don't mind anything else( eg. self-harming! ) Harry, just no smut please.


** That's more or less how linkffn(The Song of the Trees) starts off, though it's a bit AU in regards to the final battle

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

** linkffn(These Cuts I Have by melindaleo): by the author of the classic The Seventh Horcrux, the author has a distinct capability at portraying the real emotion and fallout of events and choices that most other authors fail rather badly at.

linkffn(we can still be who we said we were by Annerb): the first sequel to the infamous The Changeling, the author depicts the post-BoH summer and does a decent job of showing the traumatic effects on both Harry and Ginny during the interim.

  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on. Join the various members of the extended Weasley family as they struggle to rebuild and cope with the consequences. And of course there are still Death Eaters left to find.
