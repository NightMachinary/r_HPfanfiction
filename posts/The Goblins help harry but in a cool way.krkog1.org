Right, so just had a cool idea for a Harry Potter fic. The general idea is that the Goblins culture has evolved so that they see economic war as superior to regular war (though they still do that when they are young in war games with each other). The author could make it really interesting and make it a goblins help Harry fic that makes sense (at least it does to me). This could be achieved by having Goblins receive a portion of the net income of the vaults they manage. When Harry first became the Boy Who Lived, a lot of people had/started to leave him all their money to the slayer of Voldemort. This means that the Goblin could see it as a large benefit to not only make sure he grows up well, but potentially to become the next Dumbledore. After all, wealth and fame go hand in hand.

The author could also make it so that the Goblins have their hands in the nonmagical economy. They are the Rothschild/every other evil family conspiracy theory. This would also explain what they do with muggle money when they exchange it for Galleons. You could use this as the Goblins control everything economically, or that the Magical Contract they are under stops them from taking over the world.... or anything really. Just a cool idea for a fanfic that I would love to see. It also gives the Goblins a good reason to try to help Harry. I always find it weird when the Goblins treat Harry like he is a saint for being nice to them in some fics.
