I've read a bunch already, but I want to see what you guys know of. Yes, I know I ask for weird shit.


** Going to an alt account for this.

Be warned, this is PURE smut. But some of the best I've ever read. It's abandoned, however, so you'll just have to take each chapter for what it is.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9015823/1/Harry-s-Loves][Harry's Loves]]: This is the second part of the story. I planned this story to just be about Harry's love to Hermione, but as things tend to happen, it turned out to be more. The first six chapters were posted as part one of the story, and these are the remaining chapters of Harry's Loves, a Harry/Hermione/Multi story. Now complete. by Harry50

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8274000/1/Ladies-Man][Ladies' Man]]: After the last battle, Harry finds himself sought after by many girls, but only one really has his love. Covers the time from the last battle to about a year later. Harry/Hermione/multi. by Harry50

Will Malfoy ever forgive himself? Loads of sex, multiple partners, rape, incest, and through it all, Harry is still a nice guy. ABANDONED DUE TO REENFORCED NON-ADULT POLICIES. Summary of where the story was going is final chapter. byKedavra Lumos

Well, what do you think? My favorite is the Last Second Savior, if you haven't read it I recommend.

If you look for Harem insted of Mult, you will find others fanfics, but is, basically, the same thing.
