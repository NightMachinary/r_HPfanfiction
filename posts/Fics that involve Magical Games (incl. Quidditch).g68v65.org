By which I mean games like Chess, Gobstones, Exploding Snap (or Snape! :D), Quodpot, and so on. Any OC (OG?) is also acceptable. The Quidditch part is self-explanatory. :D

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D)
