Harry Potter did his best to remain out of sight while the Dursleys were finishing their dinner. He quietly went over his studies as his relatives continued to feast and drink merrily. While there was great animosity between them and Harry, the truth was they were afraid of him and his new abilities. Uncle Vernon's sister, Aunt Marge, had come to stay for a week as she resided in a large house in the country side. A wealthy women, she spend most of her working life breeding pedigree bulldogs and taking vacations to exotic countries in the far east.

"Usually it's just a fry-up for me what with twelve dogs to look after," Aunt Marge continued, pouring herself another brandy. "It's certainly been stressful these last few weeks, we're currently at the peak of the Estrus period and the mess is extraordinary. But I think Dr. Harvey-Grigg's latest book aptly describes the relationship between the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive mutations and the increase in the inbreeding coefficient." The others all nodded in agreement. "I certainly hope that later on when the dogs are going through diestrus that none of them will show signs of pseudopregnancy though. But that won't be a problem for Ripper here now will it?" Aunt Marge laughed, Uncle Vernon chortled as he too took a sip of brandy. Even Petunia couldn't hide a faint smile. "Anyway," Marge continued, "Harry Potter's father was a drunk and unemployed wastrel," she took another sip of her brandy and wiped her mustache, turning over to Vernon she said "and his mother was a bitch." The others all nodded in agreement.

Harry Potter, having overheard the conversation, became enraged. He burst into the dining room with his wand, pointing it at Aunt Marge. "No one talks about my parents that way". Aunt Marge's glass shattered in her hand to reveal the end of her finger having swollen to the size of salami. "My father was not a drunk and unemployed wastrel. In fact, he was a great and powerful wizard named 'James Potter'. My mother, Lily Evans, was also a powerful witch. I take great pride in my parents and am dismayed to hear you disrespect them as such. So," announced Harry, drawing himself up to his full height, "as punishment: you shall be blow."

Aunt Marge started blowing as the rest of her fingers blowed. Dudley, who had earlier sneaked off to the living room to watch TV, was eating chips on the couch oblivious to all this. One of Aunt Marge's buttons popped off her tweed jacket, flew into the next room and hit Dudley right in the head, causing him to fall off the couch. Both Vernon and Petunia were paralysed with surprise at what was happening to Aunt Marge, and Harry Potter just continued to look on with satisfaction. Aunt Marge was now completely blow and had lifted up from the table.

/BOING/ AH! /BOING/ AH! /BOING/ AH!

Aunt Marge was bouncing on the ceiling, slowly making her way to the door. "AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!" She flew outside. Vernon ran after her and grabbed her foot, but he was lifted off the ground as well. "Don't you dare let go!!!!!" Yelled Aunt Marge, but Vernon had already dropped to the ground. "NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"

Harry Potter calmly packed his suitcase and left the house with Vernon still yelling and Petunia still waving to Aunt Marge in the backyard. As Harry Potter walked along Privet Drive, a little black dot could be seen floating around in the sky...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

/Later on, Harry Potter meets up with Ron and Hermione to discuss magic/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"And then I blew her fat with a spell," said Harry.

"Wow, that's really cool!" Laughed Ron. "What happened next?"

"She flew away."

"Serves her right. I hope she died," grumbled Hermione as she took a sip of her goblin coffee. "I can't imagine how awful that must have been for you Harry, having to listen to somebody say such horrible things about your parents. I too feel heartbroken."

"That's quite alright, Hermione. I'm getting better. I won't deny that I'm still really bothered by what I overheard, but I think that in time the emotional wounds will heal."

Something caught the corner of Hermione's eye as she peered over to a table at the other side of the room. "Is that Dudley?"

"Yes it is," said Harry. "Let's go be mean to him." Ron and Hermione grinned in unison. "Yeah!"

The trio got up, walked across the room and sat on either side of Dudley. "Hi /Dudders/," mocked Harry. "How's your head?"

"Still bruised a bit," replied Dudley.

"We saw your grandma pop," announced Ron.

Dudley looked up. "Oh, ok."

**** Honestly, I'm a little confused as to how this is a 'different take'. The outcome is the same, but the characters' personalities have been completely flipped around in an inexplicable manner. And weird little details are introduced like 'goblin coffee', again, in an inexplicable manner. I'm really not sure what you're trying to achieve with this 'different take'.

At this point, I'm not sure if you're just trolling or you're actually serious. This is tweaking the personalities of the characters a tiny bit? Putting aside the fact that that dialogue does not sound natural at all, that is /very/ different from how canon Harry, Ron and Hermione would have behaved. And I still don't see how it changed the outcome of the entire event. Marge still got blown up. She still drifted away to locations unknown. The end of that scene plays out exactly as it does in the movie.

In the movie she doesn't pop, she gets found circling a chimney stack just south of Sheffield.

Yes. Harry has already shown how he takes pleasure in the misery of other characters, and Ron claims the whole situation was "brilliant" just after they got off of the Hogwarts Express in the movie. It's not a stretch to say that if Harry weren't limited in the use of his powers, the story wouldn't play out too different to my fanfic IMO.

******** When did she pop in your post?

Harry might be mean sometimes, but it's usually only in retaliation. He doesn't actively seek to 'punish' people or 'be mean' to others. He doesn't walk up to people and bully them. You turned him from defensive to an active bully. I might give you Ron, though if Harry phrased it like he did in your post, I don't think Ron would have grinned and said 'yeah!'

Literally the third to last line where Ron says to Dudley "We saw your grandma pop".

I disagree. At the beginning of The Order of the Phoenix it is Harry, not Dudley, who initiates the hurling of insults. Clearly Harry Potter is not one to avoid starting a conflict even if he's unprovoked.

Harry literally told Ron about giving a disproportionate punishment to a character that Ron didn't even know.

** This doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The setting is very muddled. At the beginning, it seems that everyone is at Number 4, but then at the end, Harry packs a suitcase and presumably goes somewhere, but where? Apparently somewhere Ron and Hermione are, but then Dudley shows up. So did Harry pack his suitcase and then Ron and Hermione show up to pick him up and they have a cup of Petunia's finest goblin coffee before taking off?

There isn't any attempt to set the scene at all. This is a bit of a problem when writing fan fiction with such a well-known property such as Harry Potter because one assumes that readers are familiar with the scene in question already, which results in low-effort things like this. But, you've changed the scene without really giving any explanation as to why. If I remember correctly, Harry is at the table when Aunt Marge is saying terrible things about his family to his face, but here he's simply "out of sight". Out of sight where? In his room? In the lounge? In the kitchen? In the basement? In the front garden, watching through the windows? If he's not there, how is he observing the interactions between Vernon, Marge and Petunia?

This piece also falls victim to telling rather than showing, which is not nearly as interesting. There are many missed opportunities here. Harry simply bursts into the room, wand drawn. What were his thoughts that led to this action? What made him reject the notion of punishment for using magic outside of school and drove him to such a rash, possibly detrimental action? Also, Marge was talking about dog breeding and then, apropos of nothing, just comes out saying Harry's parents were trash. Completely out of left field.

The main action of the piece is Aunt Marge being blown up like a balloon, but it falls completely flat. Is Harry filling her with air? Helium? Hydrogen? Whipped cream? It's not certain. Also, a person is "blown up", not "blow" or "blowed". The incorrect wording adds to the distraction of the flat action, one aspect of which is Harry simply looking on with satisfaction. Not very interesting.

The dialog between Harry, Ron and Hermione sounds very stilted and unnatural. They do not sound like 13 or 14-year-olds in the slightest. I recommend reading your dialog out loud--it will really help you find what sounds like a natural rhythm and what doesn't. Here is an example of how the dialog could go:

"So she's sitting there with brandy slopped all down her front and she says my dad was a drunk!" Harry said, still seething from Marge's hypocritical words. "So I, um, filled her full of air until she floated away."

"You what?" Ron asked, mouth falling open in amazement. "You really filled your auntie up with air until she flew away?" He looked at Hermione who was staring at Harry, completely aghast.

"Harry! What about the Trace? You'll be expelled for sure!" she said, nervously wringing her hands.

Harry shrugged. "Honestly? I'm over it. If they want to expel me, fine," he said with false bravado, hoping his friends couldn't see how deeply afraid he was of that very thing.

"Blimey, mate. If they come after you, there's no way Dumbledore will let them expel you. Self-defense, isn't it?" Ron said stoutly, punching Harry in the arm.

So there you go. Set the scene--don't depend on a reader's preexisting knowledge, show, don't tell, read your dialog out loud to make it sound more natural.
