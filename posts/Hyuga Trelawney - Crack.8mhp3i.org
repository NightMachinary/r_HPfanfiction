All the teachers were unable to stand up to Voldemort, he was cutting through the faculty one by one, leaving them for dead, not worth a killing curse from his wand, in his opinion anyway. He got to the Divination Professor, Sybil Trelawney, and was ready for his next easy victory.

“Give up, Voldemort, Fate has declared me the winner, and you will always be the Orphan loser who was abandoned by both his parents.” Trelawney mocks. Voldemort furious at someone he views as beneath him mocking him, raises his wand in anger.

“CRUCIO” He incants. The red beam of pain charges towards the clearly intoxicated Divination Teacher, before “Hakkeshou Kaiten” She spins around, and a barrier negates the spell, the barrier caused by her rotation.

“You're within my field of Divination” Trelawney says, as she takes a stance. “Hakke Rokujuyonsho” Hitting Voldemort once, she says “One palm” another hit “Two palms” Two more hits “Four palms” four more hits, knocking Voldemort back “Eight palms” Trelawney follows along, keeping the pace and keeping the hits up, eight more hits “Sixteen palms” Voldemort slams into the wall, receiving 16 more hits “Thirty Two palms” near collapsing now, Voldemort is hit 32 more times, “HAKKE ROKUJUYONSHO!” Voldemort barely manages to moan out “How, what happened” “I sealed 64 of your tenketsu, your magic cannot be used, you're as much a muggle as those you love torturing so much. I told you, Fate has declared you a loser.” Voldemort passes out, anguish and anger evident on his face

“Please fulfil my prophecy now, Mr Potter.” Trelawney orders Harry, who watched the entire thing in amazement “This is what a mastery in Divination teaches you.” Harry raised his wand and casts “Diffindo! Reducto! Incendio!” Decapitating Voldemort, Destroying the brain, and burning the body, ending the Dark Lords reign forever. Divination went on to be the most popular elective at Hogwarts, and Sybil Trelawney was given an Order of Merlin First Class for annihilating Voldemort.


** This reads as if you just took a bit of Naruto and wrote "Trelawney" in place of "Neji".

*** Which was the point. I was making Divination and Trelawney useful, rather than "The Joke subject" and the best way to do that was making her Neji, given that they're both Fate obsessed, and Neji obsesses over Divination

*** Only came up with the idea because Neji always says "You're within my field of Divination" before he uses Hakke Rokujuyonsho, and talks about Fate, he'd make a good Divination professor, so i gave Trelawney his power. I was just that bored.

*** Wasn't sure where to fit it in. Outside of actively giving her the Byakugan, which was admittedly tempting, it was too short to fit in a full background.
