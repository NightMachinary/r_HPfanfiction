:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello!! So a couple of months ago, I read this HP fanfiction that was so good and I can't remember the name but here are some details I remember about it.

1. SI fell through the 9 3/4 wall from the future and into the HP world
2. Daughter of Regulus Black
3. Ends up with Fred Weasley at the end

If anyone has any ideas on what it is, I would greatly appreciate it!!

** Muggle on wattpad is insane, she would get a lot more recognition for her work if she went to fanfiction.net but she doesn't I would put her muggle story on par with the greatest fanfics to ever grace this subreddit. It is super sick the story and how interesting it is.
