Looking for a specific story that I think has a Secret Santa, but I know for sure has Harry buying Hermione a "Gryffindor colors" bathrobe because he had a vision/dream that they were married and in the "dream" she was wearing it. During the story he's concerned that Ron has a crush on her but I'm pretty sure he actually has a crush on Luna?

Thanks in advance!

*** Thank you! I love Ron/Luna so much!! I'm not the biggest fan of Harry/Hermione (I prefer Harry/Ginny), but Ron/Luna makes up for it!
