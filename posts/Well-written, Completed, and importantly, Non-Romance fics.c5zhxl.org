Title is pretty much self-explanatory. (:

â€‹

I feel like I need to venture off into the non-romance category since the last series I read that kind of fits the description is the James Potter series from /y e a r s/ ago. If romance does exist, then please none where Harry or Hermione are involved with someone else since I need to stay true to my OTP! Preferably post-Hogwarts or 6th/7th/8th year though I am open to earlier years as well. Other than that, anything works. Humour, angst, action/adventure, time-travel, what-have-you... give me your best please!

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
