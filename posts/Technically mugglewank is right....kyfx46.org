The muggle technology is unbelievably advanced in comparison with the wizard technology (even in the 90s). A muggle without an weapon could be easily defeated by a wizard, but so a wizard without a wand could be easily defeated by a muggle with an weapon. If a war between both worlds start, muggles would start losing, but quickly turn the game. I mean, it only needs a squib and a 3 nuclear bombs to destroy the mains wizard spots in Britain (Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley and the Ministry). What do you guy think?


** The term advanced is highly relative. Most things muggles can do with technology, wizards don't need to do as they generally have an alternative that's been well established for a while.

Electricity is the muggle replacement for magic. Also in canon, we only see very little by way of technology. If you chose to build the world further and explore, it could very easily be more "advanced".

Also, an untrained wizard unleashing fiendfyre would probably cause massive amounts of damage, very quickly and muggles would never be able to put it out.

Lastly, with Nuclear bombs, that's a highly stupid move by anybody. For one, you're really underestimating the effects and payload of a nuclear bomb. They cause a massive amount of damage that lasts over a period of years. There's a reason MAD is considered a strategy with respect to nuclear weapons. It's pure idiocy to use it on someone else, let alone aim it at your own country.

Also, diagon Alley and the Ministry are right in the middle of London. You'd be killing exponentially more muggles than wizards/witches.

Mugglewank is looked down upon for more reasons than just taste of the reader.

** I assume by weapon you meant firearms. The way I a muggle with a gun vs mcgonagall ending is said muggle holding a bouquet of flowers instead. Yes it doesn't take very long to pull a trigger, it also doesn't take very long to wave a wand.

That's a person to person confrontation, but wizards can attack from a range in ways muggles can't, you don't even need the imperius curse to wreak havoc. Memory charms and confunduses will do fine.

Or, if you really want to talk about what wizards might do if muggles forced them to get creative, they might stick the entire wizarding world under a fidelius. Now muggles can't see wizards at all. They might herd muggles into particular areas with city sized muggle repelling charms.

Maybe those last two are no limits fallacies? Fair, I'm not sure they'd work in canon. You know what would work? Repurposing some of the flying cannon balls they play sports with to specifically chase down muggles and only muggles. Forever. And then any muggle not hiding in a tank or bunker would be pelted with bludgers and die.

I just can't see muggles winning unless they do something stupid like the nuke thing. Spells are better tools in general, frankly.

** I just don't like it, I'm about to read fantasy, and if Muggle nations destroy or dominate the wizarding world, there's just no fun. I prefer stories that simply move away from the Muggle world and with worldbuilding focusing on the magical world.

I don't like supremacist fics, whether Muggles/Muggle-borns destroying Magical Britain or Pure-blood destroying and enslaving Muggles... That's all shit for me.

** I mean, it only takes a wizard and 3 Imperius Curses to fuck over an entire nation overnight. Not to mention, an average wizard casting a powerful Imperius is much more believable than an average muggle/squib having access to nukes.

** Like everything else, it's not about what you've got, it's how you use it.

Wizards have imperius and fiendfyre and magic, Muggles have bombs and sniper-rifles and technology. Wizards can imperius the right people and do untold damage to Muggle hierarchies, but Muggles could ambush a group of wizards and snipe them all before they even knew they were there. If they make good decisions and use their tools well, both could do a lot of damage to the other side, but if they fuck up and make mistakes, then they could find themselves vulnerable.

That's the thing I find most interesting about the possibilities of Magic/Mugglewank when it's used well. It's not about who has the biggest arsenal, because both sides have powerful and effective tools - it's who has the cleverest tacticians and most intelligent strategies.

I'm with Snoo on the nukes though. The explosion at Chernobyl irradiated Sweden. Nuclear bombs are a very much last resort for a reason.

** What's stopping wizards from using protective enchantments to protect their key locations? One Unplottable charm and Diagon Alley can't be found much less nuked by muggles. Or have you forgotten that the Muggle Repelling charm essentially renders Muggles useless? How about the Protego Totalum charm which is unbreachable by non-magical means? Wizarda and Muggles have already had a war. The Wizards won it before the Muggles even knew it had begun.

And why do Wizards need technology? The only area Mugglekind has an advantage over Wizardkind is entertainment due to the former's sheer population numbers. Wizards don't need cars; they have brooms. They don't need planes when they can apparate or use a portkey. Wizards don't need electricity because their energy sources never run out. A fire can be bewitched to burn forever. An item can be enchanted to produce light. Wizards don't need mobiles when they can floo call. Wizardkind will never face a scarcity of food because food can be multiplied (enlarged, I think- the pumpkins Hagrid grows in PS). Water? Here's a charm to produce potablr water anytime, anywhere.

** You have to establish much clearer guidelines if you want to decide who would win.

** Frankly, this is a weird question, most mugglewank or wizardwank is about culture, not military power. If you want to ask questions about how a military conflict would go, you can't just measure firepower. Wizards would have a simple goal, make anyone who knows forget and seeing as it would be kept under wraps... It would be a lot simpler to make the military forget. If Wizards for whatever reason wanted to assassinate a muggle, they would be able to. In a straight fight on a battlefield, it's unknown who would win. If you imagine that the Shield Charm is a physical shield, then it would be far simpler for the Wizards to win. If it isn't then muggle firearms would be able to quickly dismantle a wizard before they could even get off a spell.

Realistically, wizards would win a war because they'd be able to prevent it from ever happening. That doesn't mean that muggle developments wouldn't be a massive aid against the DEs.

In my personal opinion, I think muggles are better because any group that doesn't at least try to go to the moon is kind of shameful (this is meant to be funny).

** It's complicated. Mugglewank/wizardwank on the level “who would won the outright war against each other” certainly doens't make much sense (and doesn't lead to any good story), but on the lower level of day-to-day life there is a problem. JKR was a single mother on the dole who couldn't or wouldn't anticipate the Deluge of Internet, emails, web, Wikipedia, etc. Looking from our current world with Wikipedia (how many seconds it would take to find out who is Nicolas Flamel?), mobile phones, emails, and IMs (owls? really?), the magical world seems quite a lot behind our reality.

Suddenly the magical world seems quite less desirable. A lot of magic looks irrelevant (messages sent by the Patronus Charm seem like an equivalent of pagers at best), ones I can live without (wizarding tents, self-washing dishes), or ones I cannot care less (glamour charms). What remains as truly valuable magic are three types: transportation, healing, and battle charms (I don't have much for the last one, just noticing it). Getting from London to Scotland in seconds (or minutes, I am actually not sure how long apparition/portkey takes) is just great, and healing broken limbs overnight would be helpful as well.

** You guys have great points! I particularly don't like mugglewank either (should have mentioned that) and I used a very exaggerated example with the nuclear bombs, but imagine that as a last resource. The point I was trying to say was badly explained. I don't think muggles are superior or could easily win the war, but I think they would have a chance, since they are the majority, have very destructive weapons and probably would have some wizards by their side to protect from imperious or other spells like that (also should have mentioned that, coming to think about it, this post was a really badly written). To sum up what I wanted to express is that I think a wizard vs muggle war, made by Death Eaters (who completely underestimate their enemy and have a lot of enemies themselves) the winner side would be the muggles. Again, you have great points, I just think muggles can be /very/ destructive if they want to (just my opinion, tough)
