In the first chapter Mcgonnagall is reading a map while in her animagus form and then in second she makes a map disappear with out Changing back.

Are there any stories that expand on the idea that an animagus can use a limited amount of magic in there animal form?

*** This brings up an interesting question: they obviously can't use it consciously, but can werewolves do accidental magic while transformed?

**** Yes that makes sense, I mean why not Achille? :) They used magic to get INTO the animagus form, and magic transforms a werewolf, so why couldn't they train wandless magic so well that they can use it in an animal form? They're still MAGIC, I mean that doesn't change right? I don't see why it would be IMPOSSIBLE, like they don't lose their magic just cause they change bodies. Like you can still do magic while polyjuiced for instance. :)

It might be like a one in a million, lifetime rare training thing though, but I think someone could.

****** :o That's a super good point! :) At least for werewolves. I think if an animagus trained for like years they could do wandless magic feats in animal form. :)

**** Not sure. Probably the Ministry's laws might clue us in on this. If they're considered beasts whiled transformed, might suggest they're subject to the wand ban while transformed, so it could be possible but it's a guess.

***** As I said, they couldn't use a wand even if they were allowed, because paws. But the question is whether a werewolf under pressure might perform accidental magic.

****** Since werewolves are pretty physically dominant and intimidating, it's hard to think there's much that could put them under the kind of pressure that tends to manifest accidental magic. Also about the wands, couldn't the werewolf jut set their paw on the wand and try it that way? Or if it needs intent, just have someone who took Wolfsbane test it out since they keep their mind then.

Because one needs to /hold/ the wand to perform a wand movement.

******** Well the artwork for werewolves on Pottermore shows them as having fingers (no opposable thumbs though), not quite paws. So if wand movements are needed that mightn't be an issue: [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/f/f8/RemusLupin_WB_F3_ConceptOfLupinInForestAsAWerewolf_Illust_080615_Land.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151218230927]]

********* That's the movie concept art, though. The actual /written/ Pottermore content says that a transformed werewolf is mostly indistinguishable from a real wolf except for a shorter muzzle and tail, and possibly slightly different eyes.
