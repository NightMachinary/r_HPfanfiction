Harry's not the most observant of fellows, but perhaps he's even less reliable than we thought.

To clarify, with thanks to [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] Harry isn't the narrator, Rowling is. What I mean to say is Harry isn't reliable when we are in his head. The idea I was trying to go for in the prompt was that what if our objective narrator, Rowling, wasn't actually the objective narrator, but instead we were seeing how Harry saw the world, and then getting his thoughts later.

For example:

In PS McGonagall dismisses the concerns of the Golden Trio. If Harry isn't reliable, he sees this as a complete dismissal, when in actuality McGonagall was much more reasonable, because he doesn't trust authority figures since his time with the Dursleys.

He should be perving on Tonks, Katie, Angelina, Alicia, Parvarti, Padma, Susan, the Grey Lady, Hestia Jones, any professor born this century, and any other being with a vaguely human female form.

** Harry isn't really a narrator at all, reliable or otherwise. The language and word choice of the narrator of the HP books is not even close to Harry's character voice. On top of that the reader and Harry do not share knowledge: Harry frequently knows a lot more than the reader about what is going on, whether it be magic or Harry's plans.

The narrator of the HP books is more like an invisible demon sitting on Harry's shoulder which has access to Harry's thoughts. And which occasionally teleports to observe other people instead.

*** It's called third person limited. He's our point of view character. Besides prologues, we only ever see the story from his perspective. We're not directly in his head, but at the same time, he's the source of the information. We only ever know what he knows, and we know the conclusions he draws from it. Again, besides the prologues.

**** Yes I am aware of the terminology.

However, third person limited is not a single viewpoint but a wide spectrum. The HP books take place around the mid-point of the spectrum - we're not so close to Harry's perspective that the voice of the narrator is his. The language of the narrator in PS, for example, is not that of an 11-year-old boy. But nor are we so far away from Harry's perspective that the narrator is telling us things Harry doesn't know (except on rare occasions, like in PS when we see the Quidditch match from Ron and Hermione's perspective).

However, one important point is that Harry's thinking and conclusions are often hidden from the reader, for the purpose of dramatic tension. The most prominent example being Harry's conclusions about the Elder Wand in DH. And of course Harry knows far more than the reader about magic, the magical world, the inhabitants of Hogwarts, etc. This is the simple and inevitable result of us only seeing a small part of his day to day life.

***** It's a small perspective, that's why it's called third person limited. The third person perspective is limited to a couple characters.

Harry is still the perspective character. We don't get information he doesn't have, but like you said, we don't always get all the information he has. I'm saying he's an unreliable perspective character. That's good evidence for my point.

I don't understand, do you think Harry's a reliable narrator? Or do you just take issue with me using the word narrator?

The perspective character is not the same as the narrator.

As I described above, third person limited is like an invisible demon sitting on the shoulder of a character, (usually) listening to the character's thoughts.

The narrator is the demon on the shoulder. The perspective character is the person whose shoulder the demon sits on.

The narrator of Harry Potter has a distinct voice, and it's definitely not Harry's. It is the voice of JK Rowling. When Harry enters a place, the narrator treats us to a description. That description is not the same description that you would get from Harry if you asked him to describe the same place. The words are different and the objects of focus are different - the narrator is conveying the place to the reader to best allow the reader to visualise that place, not to reflect Harry's focus.

In HP the narrator usually, but not always, sits on Harry's shoulder. But the reliability of the narrator is not related to the perspective character. The reliability of the narrator concerns whether the reader can trust the information conveyed to them by the narrator. And in HP that question is not about trusting Harry, but trusting JKR.

******* I meant to add, cause I'll stop calling him a narrator, because he is just a perspective character. But mobile. Sorry.

What I meant was that we get an objective analysis from the narrator, but we also get Harry's impressions of the scene. That's what makes third person limited such a cool perspective.

The idea I was trying to go for in the prompt was that what if our objective narrator, wasn't so objective, and was actually just Harry's interpretation presented differently. Does that make sense? I'm not sure if I'm getting it across properly.

To be clear, you're making sense. I should just no longer be allowed to post before sleeping. Because I reread that, and I make no damn sense.

** That's actually one of the keys how to make Dursley's into actual human beings (not good human beings, that they are not). We have their image only through eyes of abused sixteen year old teenager ... that is certainly not the most objective kind of reporter.

**** I have even emphasized that I don't think they were good (nevertheless I got -10 points on it, because nobody reads what I wrote). My problem is not that they are not /good/ in the books (they are not, and I am OK with that), but that they are not /real/. Try to write a story with Dursleys as significant characters and you'll find out what I mean --- they are so grotesque and fairy-tale-like that they don't make sense as real living human beings. Even people who are evil (Lucius Malfoy, Tom Riddle) make sense in their evilness, Dursleys don't.
