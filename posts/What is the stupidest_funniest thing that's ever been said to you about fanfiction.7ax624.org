For me, it was probably when I said that I was worried about approaching a ship in a way that felt believably in-character, and a girl who was hardcore into the ship genuinely said to me, "Fanfiction shouldn't be IC! If it's not OOC, you're doing it wrong - being in character is for canon stuff!"

*** I don't really agree, honestly. Protagonists doing different things isn't the same as being completely OOC, like.

For example, Lucius Malfoy is, at his core, an upper class bigot who speaks very smoothly, is very concerned with appearances, and has something of an issue with his temper. If he is suddenly a loud, slobbish guy who simpers and never says a bad word to anyone, that's very OOC. To say that all characters are inherently going to be OOC is an excuse for lazy writing. If JKR had Arthur Weasley as a nice man in Chamber of Secrets, and then suddenly an absolute asshole in Prisoner of Azkaban, people would raise eyebrows, no?

No HP fanfiction is /canon/, sure, but you can have accurate characterisation, like. An alternate universe will influence character development, but it oughtn't transform a character into something completely unrecognizable.

You can have different spins on a character while keeping their core traits and their unique voice. If they aren't /those/ characters, then you're just writing OC fanfiction with the names and skins of the canon characters messily painted on top.

***** But there's a difference between an AU version of a character and a completely different character who just happens to have messy hair, a scar and glasses and be called Harry Potter. I don't think it's OOC for a character to be affected by events around them that, for whatever reason, go differently, so long as the character is being developed right, but what you need is an understandable evolution or change.

Character development isn't, in itself, OOC. What's OOC is changing traits in a character without any rhyme or reason except for "it's sexier this way" or "it's easier to hate this character this way".

If you're reading a fanfic and somebody has done their job right, you should be able to recognize characters without physical descriptions or their names attached - you should be able to tell by their actions and dialogue who they are, even within AUs.

Character development seems out of scope in this discussion. I don't think the OOC that you describe (grotesquely changing a character to a degree that they might as well have a different name) is very common - except in the very worst of fanfics and I don't think that was what the friend you were talking to was thinking about.

*** The “if it's not OOC you're doing it wrong” is very far off from true. Sure, you can write OOC characters if you want, I'm sure some people are into it. I find many people not into it though - it's like you're not even writing about the character it's inspired from. Now, many people achieve this by starting with a very in-character version, and slowly developing them so they're quite different than how they started but it feels natural and not weird.
