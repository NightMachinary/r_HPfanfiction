:END:
Hello,

 

I'm looking for a particular story where Harry spends a lot of time networking by writing letters.

 

Things I remember:

-I believe he was in Slytherin but I could be wrong

-He had a chalkboard in his room where he outlined the people he wanted to contact

-Augusta Longbottom posted an open letter to a publication of some sort praising Harry's letter-writing ability

 

If y'all could help me out here it would be much appreciated.

 

Thank you for your time!


** Is it [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100][The Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady]]

Harry just wants to have a quiet life and get along with everyone. He wants to be normal, and accepted. Being “normal” for the Dursleys yielded great results in improving his standard of living, and as he heads off to Hogwarts he still retains that impulse to keep his head down and blend in. Of course, life isn't as simple as that, and Harry is a magnet for trouble. And what does "normal" really mean, anyway? The pure-bloods in his group of friends think he should learn more about their culture and religion if he wants to fit in.

**** Ok one more try, I know I have read this is it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5421731/chapters/38182070][Common Sense by grohiik]] “The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense.”

** Not what your looking for, but he does network a lot by writing letters in this. Plus I just finished this story, and want to share it.
