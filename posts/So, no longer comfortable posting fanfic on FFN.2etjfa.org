** If you decide that you want to delete your story, then you can. But if people have kept copies that they share with each other...well, then shouldn't you be a bit flattered that some love the story enough to go looking for copies of it? Not many stories are so good that people are really upset to find them missing off of ff.net (or wherever they've been posted)--I'd be /proud/ to think that people were going looking for a story I'd deleted.

On another note, it's always feasible to create a new site, but it'll never compete with the big ones. If you're really serious about making something new (and this isn't just an angry, snap decision), then pm me for free labour... I've got nothing better to do.

**** Perhaps there should be a notification system; it wouldn't be hard to do an automatic PM system that gives authors a chance to object, thinking about it. As I stated in Scoopbot's thread (forgot the posters username, oops), if an author asks for their work to be taken down then it should be, regardless of the reason. I can see that it would be distressing to find stuff of yours somewhere where you /didn't/ post it and where someone /refuses/ to remove it.

As devil's advocate, I can say that the scooping system /is/ a relatively good idea (especially after the MA purge of June 2012, which saw thousands of fics deleted overnight with no warning, and many of which weren't backed-up properly, being quite old), but it's not well known. I had no idea of it's existence until today and have found my own (and annoyingly worst, because it's challenge fics which I struggled with) work on there.

*TL;DR:* /Scoopbot/ is /a good idea, but the site owner should remove works at the request of the author--no questions asked--and install an automatic PM notification system, so people know their work is on there./

** The Internet is forever. Caches exist, among other things. People download PDFs of stories and email them to each other when the original is pulled. If you don't want them circulated don't publish, really.

** Your fics will ALWAYS be able to be copied if you publish them on the internet. If someone archives my stories I wouldn't have a problem with that.

So, actual question. What's the big deal with someone having a copy of your story?

****** I'm not trying to attack you. If you want to keep track of your content, hunt down ff databases like these once in a while and ask them to remove your stories. They'll always exist.

** It's not "fucked up" - it's just the point of that "share it for free over the internet" thing is not getting to dictate what every reader does with their copy, where they keep it, who they choose to share it or if and when they decide to delete it. That's what "sharing" digital content means. (as opposed to selling or renting it out)

Trying to keep control over above listed actions of every reader is a) technologically impractical and (b) attempts to shove a second paint of copyright semi-law into an area that only recently started to get free of being restrained by actual law.

(I say semi-law, because as far as I know there is no actual legal protection of fan fiction copyright without original content creator getting personally involved in the dispute)

** You act as if you had a choice to remove anything from the web once it was posted, once it's on the web, it's there forever.
