As a part of great Mugfang Conspiracy, the Rajya Sabha (Parliament) of Magic has recruited wizards to act in Bollywood films. In an attempt to normalize magic in the eyes of Muggles, wizards are now frequently recruited in very many popular Bollywood films. Muggles frequently wish to display super-human strength and Bollywood films have fueled this fantasy for many years.

No movie however, have blatantly shown magic such as this.

"Blimey, Hermione!" Ron said, struggling to make sense of a chubby policemen holding a banana. "That banana looks something lethal." The spurt of blood was shown in color in the pages of Quibbler. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWFGh58lBtQ]]

"Oh my! They should at-least give a warning of M rated content!" Hermione huffed as she looked disapprovingly at Quibbler.

The wand is transfigured banana - a tricky transfiguration feat in itself - kills many attackers through the use of the cutting curse. The final fight, /the article continued,/ shown through small cut scenes is an obvious attempt to hide the magic at play. Small cut-scenes are usually an indication of poor acting performance in movies, however this fact is cleverly used by film makers to hide the plain magic at play.


** Rajya Sabha does not pass laws, that's the Lok Sabha. RS is a rubber-stamp.

** I joke that the Quibbler is basically the Wizarding equivalent of The Onion or The Babylon Bee, and the only reason it isn't more popular is because the average wizard doesn't understand satire.
