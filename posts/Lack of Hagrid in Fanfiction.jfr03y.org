I've noticed lately that Hagrid doesn't get much love in the fanfiction community. Fics can delve into every detail of the trio's lives and just ignore him. He's one of my favorite characters, and in some ways he represents the heart of Hogwarts.

Why do you think people don't like writing about Hagrid? Could it be because he isn't very shippable himself? or am I just missing the good fics?


** His accent is a pain to write.

*** I just don't write it

Edit: sorry I'm really tired and bad at communicating today. I was agreeing with you if that isn't clear

*** I don't even read it for the most part. I subdue the accent so much when reading out loud. My kids would never understand what he is saying.

*** That and it's just hard to find a role for him in the plot. Even JKR struggled in canon with this - the whole Grawp/negotiate with the giants sub-plot was entirely superfluous and could easily have been cut from the books.

The only real plot role any of that had was leading Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest trap at the end of OotP, but that could easily have been achieved with centaurs alone, or alternatively Aragog.

** I don't know tbh. I've written a Rubeus Hagrid fic and just started another one, and he's a joy to write. Personally I find him a very interesting character, along with Minerva McGonagall and also Flitwick.

I think one reason is that they aren't from the Marauders generation, and don't have the rockstar quality of those characters. But I think that's a mistake people are making.

Hagrid is Tom Riddle's contemporary, and he has lived as an outsider and yet close to Hogwarts for a long time. it gives him a really interesting POV. I don't like the infantilising way people do tend to write him when they do include him, more often than not. I don't think he's stupid either, just...he's a magical being who isn't entirely human and I think he's just as misunderstood as the dangerous animals he loves so much

and I mean while the Marauders' generation has a lot of tragedy and drama...there are a lot of gaps where there should be grandparents. Hagrid and McGonagall's generation went through Grindelwald's war as kids, so they're a wartime generation as well. It's a POV that has been written a bit, but not enough imo

sorry this is long but it's a bit of a hobby horse of mine

  When Hadrian James Potter felled the Dark Lord Voldemort, it wasn't only wixenkind who celebrated their newfound freedoms. When the Chief Warlock then moves to leave their apparently beloved little Harry Potter on a doorstep on a blustery November night it is the creatures that step up to care for and raise the Boy-Who-Lived. In the process the Boy-Who-Was-Left-Alone becomes something that no one quite expected. Not Voldemort, certainly not Dumbledore, nor any other wizard either.

** I'd imagine for a lot of people it's the fact they think they have to write accents phonetically (you really don't and IMO shouldn't) and Hagrid's accent is a nightmare of incomprehensible nonsense if you do that. Otherwise, it's probably that Hagrid is another exposition character (If you want your protagonist to find out a secret, have someone tell it to Hagrid) and people usually use Hermione or Dumbledore for most of that in fanfiction. Or Daphne and the Slytherins, for any Pureblood Culture stuff.

** In the first book he really drives the story. In the second book, his history also drives the story. If you're getting away from the canon, it would make sense to get away from Hagrid.

The story I wrote involves Hagrid at multiple points. I find an adult figure who doesn't have the same instincts as the other adults to be very useful. He's more likely to reveal information, and his hut is something of a safe space for the original character. It's Hogwarts, but not Hogwarts.

At the same time, he's a groundskeeper. Harry's closer relationship with Hagrid in the books only makes sense from the perspective of Dumbledore's involvement. Without Diagon Alley showing, Dursley-rescuing Hagrid there is much less reason to bring him in.
