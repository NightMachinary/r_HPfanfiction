Hi all, new to the world of fanfic! I always enjoyed HP, but it always left some major questions in my mind about the nature of magic and anthropology - specifically, what do disabilities look like in a world with time travel, transfiguration, and potions that regrow bones? How does magic intersect with anxiety or Down Syndrome? How would someone balance their identities of being a brother to someone excluded from both the wizarding AND muggle worlds? I set out to write down thoughts, but ended up with around 35000 words and a snowflake-model/outline (so the current draft is about 12/30 chapters). As I've gone, I've had a lot of fun with trying to tease out questions of identity, politics, relationships, and social theory through original characters in a challenging and intriguing (canon-compliant) world.

However, one of my passions is dialogue and collaboration. I'm reading a lot of Bakhtin, a Russian literary critic, and his major philosophy is that big concepts like 'truth' and 'people' are dialogic (meaning, they are always emerging from multiple inputs that don't resolve into one major idea, but coexist. Imagine a song with multiple voices singing different lines at once - like the end of /God Only Knows/ by the Beach Boys. The song is complete only because different voices aren't coming together to sing the same thing). I feel like one of the best ways of preventing writing from being a single-minded affair is to involve several people in the process. I want to try writing as a collaboration and dialogue, rather than just put my own voice out there (I get my own voice out plenty - too much, some would say). I'm tired of being a solo writer, I want some polyphonic, Beach Boys harmonies!

So, if anyone is interested in co-writing or any form of collaboration on this story, I'd be really interested in exploring it together! I can give more info on what I have (characters, plot, themes, writing so far), but I'm also not 100% tied to it all. I have some big picture questions, but I don't have to be the one who answers them all! The ideal co-authors would be interested in collaboration. Beyond that, it might be a perk if you read critical theory and/or if you have any experience with disabilities, but I've never done something like this so I have no idea if that's important or not. Thanks all, hope this finds someone interested!

(Mods, I'm flairing this as Misc since it seems to straddle the lines of self-promotion and writing prompt. Please let me know if I should change it!)


** I'm down to write the villain, so long as I have creative license on that villain and their dastardly plots.
