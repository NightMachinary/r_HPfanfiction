** I've probably only posted about 5% of the total words I've written. Too many snippets, unedited garbage, and 1 chapter test-stories that go nowhere.

** I've got a few. Inspiration is cheap, perspiration is expensive.

** Oh, I do. Every time I see it, my respect for other authors here have increased. They actually pulled through and completed them, while here I am hoarding up ideas as if I'd ever complete one.

** Yeah, and I am honestly surprised when writers claim that they are out of ideas. I have more than enough to last five lifetimes if someone would bother to write all of them, and every time I read something which I think sucks or was abandoned, the pile grows. I mean, I started rereading "Blue Magic" on the commute home and already picked three ideas from that, not to mention a twerk to an existing one.

As for the WIPs, my production time is atrocious. The "quickest" I went from the drawing board to FFN was two months, and even that included recycling a few older snippets.

** Yep! I go through them to get something to read, tidy as I go and add a bit to the end.

Every now and then I get to the end and it's an odd feeling that the story is just done.

Then starts the real work, cleaning that all up and making it into something good enough to post. (Not there yet.)

** Yes, I do!\\
Never posted anything yet though, just collecting snippets and ideas for different stories. Currently I balance three WIPs and have no finished stories so far.
