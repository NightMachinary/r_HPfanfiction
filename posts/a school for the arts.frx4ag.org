Harry was nervous, and checked the letter once again for confirmation. This was indeed the place where he was supposed to be, the ink was shifting colours as if it couldn't decide what shade of blue to be. The letter detailed a meeting where he would be taken to orientation at Etch Asketch's School of Arts and Illusion.

Uncle Vernon had taken the other letter with a red wax seal away from him before he had had the chance to read it, the letter he was holding now had shown up on his pillow, and after reading its contents, stated his name and blew onto the blue wax seal where it then dissolved into a stream of glitter and disappeared.

"Ah, you must be Mr. Potter, it is a privilege to meet you. My name is Macoron Kraft, Culinary Arts professor at the school. Now as per the letter, I'm here to take you to orientation, but I must ask, how familiar are you with the Wizarding World?"

Harry flushed a little, "Not very much Sir."

"That's not a problem, young man. We get plenty of muggleborns each year that go through orientation, I'm sure you'll fit right in. Now, take my hand and we'll be off."

Harry took his hand and a second later he felt like he was being squeezed through a tube and stumbled when the sensation stopped.

"I'm quite sorry, I forgot to warn you that apparition may be unpleasant to the the unexperienced, I knew I should have brought a door, in anycase, welcome Mr. Potter, to the School of Arts and Illusion!"

The school itself was a beautiful building in the style of a Roman Villa, surrounded by different landscapes, including a desert, a forest, and a lake with glaciers in the far distance. There was a gathering of children and their parents in front of the school and that was where the Mr. Kraft left him wishing him well and said "I hope to see you in my class Mr. Potter."

"Hello and welcome everyone, to the School of Arts and Illusion! I am Etch Asketch, headmaster here at the School, and it is my pleasure to guide you through our facilities to see what we have to offer students here. Now if you would follow me."

The man led them into a hallway containing huge paintings of different rooms and landscapes the one at the end was of a Greek amphitheatre containing people wearing different styles of clothes from around the world, all of them tasteful and fashionable.

"These are th---some of the Professors here at the School, I will let them introduce themselves."

The Headmaster went off to the side with another Professor and Harry barely heard them in their hushed tones.

"Where is Professor Psyche?"

"She fell in love with the statue of Eros again, we couldn't get her away in time for orientation."

"And Professor Echo?"

"I don't know sir, she's not speaking to anyone right now."

In the front a man stepped up to the podium, "Hello everyone, my name is Maurits Escher, Professor of Illusionwork. Here at the School, I teach students the art of Illusions, giving life to their imaginations, sometimes even tricking reality itself!"

The man waved a stick throught the air and suddenly Harry was transported to a lush, green meadow. The tall grass waved hypnotically as a breeze blew through his hair and clothes, warm and relaxing. The man twisted the stick and they were back in the amphitheatre, he stepped down and a hard woman took his place.

"I am Asteria Penthe, Professor of Martial Arts and War. It is indeed an artform, in my classroom I teach students how to defend themselves from muggles, wizards, beasts, and nature itself, many of my most promising students have successful careers as aurors, cursebreakers, and the like."

After the lady stepped down, the others introduced themselves as the Professors of Painting, Oration, Music, Dance, Potioneering and Alchemy, Charms, Culinary, Transfiguration, Enchantment, and Obscure Magicks.

After all the Professors, save a few who werent there, like the Professor of Carving and the Professor of Divination, presented themselves, the group Harry was in were given a tour of the rest of the school, many of the classrooms were situated in paintings, small pocket dimensions, the Painting Professor explained.

Professor Escher gave them a tour of his best work, the Staircase of Relativity, after which, Harry was quite dizzy. The Professor who had brought him here, Professor Kraft, provided lunch, though Harry was wary of the pea soup, it did reach out to bite his spoon after all.

The orientation was over, and Harry was reluctant to go back to his Aunt and Uncle, but one thing was sure, he couldn't wait to come back.
