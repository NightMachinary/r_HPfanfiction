** The Second String linkao3(15465966) has a Harry that utilizes household spells for combat purposes to great effect.

It's slash, which would usually keep me from reading it (I find most pairing somewhat unsettling), but it really is one of the best fics I have ever read.

I'd give it a perfect score of 5/7.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** In Harry Potter, Geek of Magic linkffn(12703694), Harry has no use for 'The Quidditch', and he feels it could be quite dangerous if you fell off your broom. So Harry experiments with special underwear treated with /Arresto Momentum./ Harry then test his invention by jumping up during class and leaping off the Astronomy tower. After he lives, Hermione shouts, "Harry Potter I hope you DIE in detention!" "I can arrange that!", shouts Professor Sinistra.

That's not the only spell he puts on underwear. This Harry's a little odd.

In Harry McGonagall linkffn(3160475), Harry and his sister do build a functioning hoverboard inspired by Back to the Future. Harry uses it to good effect in the Tri Wizard tournament. The epilogue had Harry and his sister with Sirius and Remus open a quidditch shop selling the hoverboards.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
