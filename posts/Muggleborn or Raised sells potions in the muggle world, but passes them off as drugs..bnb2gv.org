KInd of like in linkffn(Blindness) by AngelaStarCat, but on a wider scale. They make a potion, give it to scientist or researcher (that's aware of the magical world) and have them replicate the results non-magically. Maybe it's as effective as the magical version, maybe it isn't. It would take years but I could see this becoming profitable.

Thoughts?

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** "and have them replicate the results non-magically."

Wouldn't work. Magic is a metaphysical trait, not a physical one. Otherwise it couldn't be magic. You might as well have muggles casting spells, or creating bottomless trunks or broomsticks at that point.

** I doubt this would work. I read somewhere on Pottermore that muggles can't make potions even with the right ingredients (I think it's because magic is part of the process to brew a potion), so it would be incredibly hard, if not impossible, for a muggle to “replicate” the effects of potions.

Also, I'm not sure about the profitability either, I don't know if the costs of potions ingredients have been mentioned but they could potentially be more expensive than drugs.

Besides, wouldn't it be illegal under the statute of secrecy? Even if the market is underground MACUSA or the Ministry would probably find out soon enough.
