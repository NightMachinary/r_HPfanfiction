** Is it that good? I've been meaning to get stuck in for a few months now but never had the time.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Something about that fic rubbed me the wrong way so much I dropped it. I don't really know what it was, but like halfway through I just decided I couldn't keep reading it.

**** Good news: I think most of your questions get answered during book 3. If I remember right the thing with Quirrel was the Baron or one of the other ghosts possessing Harry and wiping his memories afterwards and the ghosts wanted him to get the locket for something that happens later. It's been a little over a year since I read the fic so it's all a little foggy.

Bad news: It's only going to get more confusing from here on out but there's some really neat world building in there. I don't want to spoil anything but the author's version of Durmstrang is pretty much my headcanon now.

Suggestions: Since I read it over the course of a couple months I started jotting down notes about major plot points character decisions to keep things straight. Really helped once the Merlin time travel stuff started cropping up because my God was that convoluted. Give it a shot if things are starting to get too much.

****** The last couple chapters and epilogue wraps things up pretty well if I'm remembering right. There's still a few dangling threads but nothing too serious.
