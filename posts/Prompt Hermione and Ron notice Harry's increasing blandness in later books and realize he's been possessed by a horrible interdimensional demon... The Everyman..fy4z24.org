*** The Everyman is a character trope where the character is so painfully average and everyday in order to make them relatable (so they're a normal person getting put into extraordinary circumstances, rather than being extraordinary in and of themselves) - which Rowling is renowned for being obsessed with making Harry into, hence why he's so reactive and passive in the story. The term comes from an old English play.

***** I don't know anything about One Punch Man, unfortunately, so I can't really say - it depends on how much of a regular, normal person he is. You might've heard the phrase as 'Regular Joe'?

****** I'm familiar with the term, yes. There's a few episodes like when his friend wants to become a hero that he's not normal. He doesn't realize he's not normal and there was one episode his only desire was to get to the grocers before a sale ended. I'm not overly familiar with the show as I've only seen a handful.

******* Ah, okay. Well, according to Ashiaka, Saitama (who I assume is the One Punch Man) is no longer an everyman, but your description makes it sound like he could be, so my answer is just /shrugs/ "Maybe?" :D

***** Not really. Saitama is not painfully average in almost all regards being thrown into crazy situations. He's a dude who was an Everyman, then decided to become a hero after getting a thrill killing a monster as an average joe, and become stupidly strong, but also extremely bored because One Punch, BOOM! He does mostly do every day stuff, but when there is a monster he is aware of, he does his best to get there. Stuff does happen to him, but he also goes out of his way to do stuff. So he's both extraordinary and proactive, which the Everyman isn't really, as I understand it.

***** He can be. But he's generally regarded as not being as proactive as he ought to, especially after a few years of "Hey, Voldemort's trying to kill me again. Huh. Better go play some Quidditch!" sort of behaviours. He generally gets dragged from action to action rather than runs to them himself. There's a reason why "Harry gears up and trains up and becomes the soldier he needs to be to survive the inevitable attack on his life" fics are so popular to write.

But yes, he can be active too. There's no strict 'this is ALWAYS this' or 'that is ALWAYS that' in Harry Potter - Rowling has no constancy from book to book, so patterns are mostly just 'this is OFTEN this' or 'that is OFTEN that'. Nobody and nothing is consistently one thing.

Saitama is lazy and unmotivated, however he is the most special person in the entire show, so no he is not an everyman

** 'So, let me get this straight,' Hermione said. 'You just heard of a prophecy that will lead Voldemort to kill you and there is no way to avoid this. And instead of, like in our fourth year, hit the books and practice with us as if your life depends on it (which it does, might I remind you), /you're just sitting here?!'/

Harry shrugged.

'No,' she suddenly said determined. 'Bad enough that you hang around here moping about Sirius all the time, I know he meant a lot to you, but you're /not/ giving up. Not on my watch. What's gotten /into/ you?'

'Sirius is dead,' he muttered. 'Most of Voldemort's spells have no defense, not even this.'\\
he tapped his scar.\\
Hermione left, exasperated.

The next day, in the common room, something happened.

'/Accio/ demon,' he heard Hermione mutter, and felt immediately lighter, better, as Hermione conjured golden chains around the demon and arced her wand downwards, as if to cut a rope.
