Laid-back Erotic/Erotic comedy style fic with decent writing that may or may not contain smut/sexual activity as a central plot point.

no slashes and i'll allow, to some extent, tropes such as time-travel, dimension-travelling and bashing(not sure if thats a trope). Preferably a Harry/X pairing but it's not a must, all other pairings are welcome.

Oh and I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11516452/1/A-Big-Happy-Weasley-Family][A Big Happy Weasley Family]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][It Could Only Happen to Harry]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045539/1/Crack-d-Mirror][Crack'd Mirror]].

** A Black Comedy? It's fairly popular so you might have read it already.

*** This was the first thing that came to my mind. I second the recommendation.

There are also parts of linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter?) that are sort of similar.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
