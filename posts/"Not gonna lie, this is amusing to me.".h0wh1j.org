Said Harry as he watched Voldemort writle in his deformed baby form. He then slowly traced his wand down Petigrews stiff face.

"I know, I know, I am not as you expected. Noy a meek boy in over his head, nor a dashing hero trying to defeat evil."

'Wingardium leviousa' and the baby flew.

"Why?" Was all that Vopdemort was able to croak out.


** I remember reading a fic where Dumbledore trained Harry to the point where he was somewhat competent and managed to overpower Pettigrew (not that it took much) and destroyed Babymort, delaying Voldemort's rise by a year. Sadly don't remember the name of the fic, would love to read it again.

*** Crap, I think I remember reading a fic like that too, but I can't remember it either. Hate when that happens.

*** Harry doesn't need training. He needs creativity. Accio Voldemort's lungs. Alohomora Voldemort's valves. Scrougify Voldemort and watch him choke. Levitate him high in the air and drop him.

**** While I get that adding even an ounce of logic to the HP series would ruin it, I highly doubt that would work. I mean, if it was that easy, someone would have done it already.

***** “Wizards don't have an ounce of logic”

Personally I think people tend to rule out the obvious too early. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work but if it does...well you wish you did that sooner.

****** That was an arrogant Hermione reacting to a simple puzzle. But said puzzle, along with the other obstacles other than Fluffy, were also easy, to the point they were likely not really meant to stop anyone, just slow them down enough for Dumbledore to turn up and ensure that the corridor seemed well guarded.

******* Oh I completely agree. But we often tend to overlook the simple solutions. I just wish people would try them. If it doesn't work then fine.

**** That is assuming that those spells can do what you expect them to do. And choking someone with soap isn't exactly original if I remember "worst memory" correctly.

Not to mention that shield charms exist.

**** Accio Voldemort's lungs would not really work no would it? First off wouldn't V's innate magic prevent this? Second his real name is Tom Marvolo Riddle.

**** Wasn't it clarified somewhere that accio doesn't work on living things. We never see it used on a living thing in canon so it would make sense.

**** I thought that accio doesn't work on living things?

That said, a quick thinking Harry probably could've taken down Pettigrew and baby Voldemort.

I wonder if baby Voldemort could escape that form and become a wraith? If not then giving Pettigrew and baby Voldemort to Dumbledore would probably delay Voldemort's rise by quite a bit, if not indefinitely.

***** Harry uses it on a toad in the books, and in Tales of Beedle the Bard someone uses it to summon a.... donkey I wanna say? Ron summoned the brain in the department of mysteries. Harry tried to use it on Hagrid during the flight from Privet Drive in book 7, and I don't remember if it worked or not.
