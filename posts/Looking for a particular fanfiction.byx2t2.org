I read a fanfiction some time ago in which Harry was either a raven or a crow animagus. In it he decides not to wait around and starts taking out the Death Eaters. He gets a manor that he converts pretty much the entire top floor into a nest for other birds of his animagus form. He gains the ability to speak to them and binds that ability to his bloodline. A particular scene that stuck with me is shortly after getting his form Harry and Sirius go out in their animagus forms and play a prank on some mundane girls where in the end Harry in his bird form sits on Padfoot and orders the Grim to "away". Those are the main details I can remember as concretely belonging to this story. Any assistance would be appreciated.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Well it's not the particular fun and happy fanfic, but more of leaning towards dark and serious. But it fits the requirement of Harry having a Raven animagus form. The fanfiction is called A Marauders Plan. I'll put in the link later.
