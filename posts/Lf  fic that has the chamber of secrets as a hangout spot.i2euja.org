:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I know that at some point I have read a fic that has the gang spending a lot of time in the chamber of secrets, they turn it into a clubhouse and find a library down there. I thought it might have been Harry Potter and the Fifth Element, and while they do make use of the chamber, its not that one!

Knowing the type of fics that I gravitate to, its likely to have the following criteria M/E Rating 100k+ Hermione as part of the main pairing Complete Ao3/ffn

If anyone can help, I would be most grateful!

(Also if anyone would like to suggest other stories that follow my criteria, im up for it!) Its not A Cadmean Victory Or Harry Potter and the Fifth Element

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1057502][The Quiet Ones series]] by LonelyHarvest (second story IP) has at least part of this: I remember it became kind of a clubhouse for the outsider kids, but don't remember if they found a library. First story is The Child of Azkaban linkao3(15068012)

#+begin_quote
  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
