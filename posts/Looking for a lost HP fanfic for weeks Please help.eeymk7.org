Happy Christmas Eve! I'm looking for a deleted fanfic from archive of our own. It was by an author called valardoheris and the title was hope remains. If anybody could supply an old url, I would be eternally grateful! I tried the wayback machine but it didn't work because I didn't have a url :'(


** Searching Google results lead to previous ao3 tag searches which Way Back had archived which lead to this: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11926557/chapters/26955726]]

That was a fun search!
