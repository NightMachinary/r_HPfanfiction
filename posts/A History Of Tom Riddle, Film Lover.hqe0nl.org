I've had this vague idea bubbling away in my head for ages but can't quite make it all work. However, I think this introductory scene holds up on its own ...

-----

London, August 1936. Tom is 9 (“nearly 10!”)

Tom loved going to the flicks. Whenever he had a few pennies (which wasn't often) he would spend them there, and whenever he didn't have a few pennies, like today, he would go anyway, only occasionally getting caught sneaking in. The best film ever was Gypsy Melody which he saw three times with his friend Ronnie Grimes. They both agreed that Lupe Velez, the leading lady, was very pretty and they wished she could be their mother.

Mrs Cole was waiting when they returned home. “Shame on you Tom” she shrieked, “shame on you Ronnie. Old Mrs Wool would be turning in her grave if she knew that we'd brought up /thieves/ here. No more trips into town for a month, no pocket money, and get into my office!” - where she made them pull their shorts down, bend over her desk, and they each got two strokes with the cane before being sent to their rooms without any tea.

When, three weeks later, Tom overheard Billy Stubbs boasting to his friend Eric about how he was getting Tom and Ronnie's pocket money after he sneaked on them, Tom had one of those Moments that had got him into so much trouble in the past. But this time, he wasn't scared or hurt, he was just furious and he somehow managed to control the Moment. He could feel the fury inside him though, getting colder and sharper, looking for a way out. He needed to get away and calm down, so he went out into the back garden - and there, by the shed and the chicken run, was the little hutch where some of the children kept their pets. And Tom was so angry. Looking around to make sure no-one could see Tom undid the latch, pulled Billy's rabbit out, and /squeezed/. He felt something go /POP/ inside him but it felt so right and then there was something like sparkling blue knives on his fingers and blood blood blood blood blood. He looked around again, this time truly frightened but there was no-one to see, and despite his fright there wasn't a Moment about to happen. He quickly washed his hands, looked around /again/ and dashed into the shed where he found a ball of twine. Cutting off a four foot length he knotted one end around a splinter in the door frame, and made a loop in the other, which he drew around the gore of the rabbit's neck. He washed his hands again before sauntering ever so casually - so casually that any adult who saw would have instantly known he was Up To Something - back to the house and up to his room. He didn't sleep well that night.
