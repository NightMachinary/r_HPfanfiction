Greetings-

I'm a podcast host based out of Indianapolis, IN. On the show, we watch movies, and provide an alternate commentary track for the film. We will be focusing the attention of 8 of our episodes on the "Harry Potter" series. I've conducted interviews in previous episodes and I'd like to continue the trend with a "Harry Potter" fan fiction writer. It would be a phone-in interview that would last approximately 15 minutes. We will also be conducting interviews with Pagans to discuss the differences in real magic practitioners and those we see in the films. We'll also be interviewing a quidditch player. It'll be interesting to discuss the themes of the "Harry Potter" series while displaying their real-life counterparts on the show. If you are interested in helping, please message me here or email me: [[mailto:moviebuzzed@gmail.com][moviebuzzed@gmail.com]]. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I thank you for taking time to read my post.

Sincerely, Zach

*** It depends on what they write and how open they are to comedy.

** I have written fan fiction, and am writing a Harry Potter one, though it isn't online yet, if you still need someone.
