Hello! I'm looking for fics where Snape has a family (married or just an unknown extended family) and not necessarily a Severitus. I don't care about pairings, just any fics where Snape has a family. Props if the family is super fluffy and happy. Thanks!

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

** It's quite AU, like AU to the extreme lol, but Of Muggles and Magic by Aurette fits the bill. Severus/Hermione eventual, but the happy family is an OC.

  A witch struggles to conform in a society that restricts her. A wizard thinks he has nothing to offer anyone but his duty and, ultimately, his life. An SS/HG Regency Tale. As AU as you get. M for later chapters.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
