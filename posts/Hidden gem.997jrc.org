It's a 6th year AU with a interesting portrayal of dumbledore, a compelling OC, and a not completely insane Voldemort that's menacing. Magical system for the most part is the same bar dimensional travel (not parallel universe), explores the ICW more than in the original book, and a more competent ministry. Harry is still the BWL.

I'm surprised it has such a low following but atleast the reviews are very positive.


** Looks interesting. Gonna check it out.
