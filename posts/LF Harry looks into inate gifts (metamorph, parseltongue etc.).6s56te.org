Ok, to clarify this:

I am looking for a Harry who looks into inate abilities (parseltongue, metamorphmagi, veela alure and others (which aren't canon)) and tries to kind of copy them (like say extracting what makes a metamorph able to shapeshift and then applying it to himself (or producing something similar via runes or something - just without a wand, so that a simple finite will not turn him back)

Hope something like this exists :)

Also: Please no slash and only really well writen Harry/Ginny (I don't like this pairing all that much)

So, stage is yours boys and girls and thank you already for your efforts :)

greetings LAX


** Will people stop classifying veela along with Parselmouths and Metamorphmagi? Unlike those two, veela, though human-like in appearance, are another species entirely from /Homo Sapiens/ (more like goblins and giants).

*** So, tricky thing here is that they don't quite fit the proper definition of species - they can have kids with each other, so they're more like races in the D&D sense

***** I thought ligers were infertile?

Yeah, the latter is also used to demonstrate that our definition of species isn't robust enough.

****** On ligers' fertility: allow me to quote the relevant paragraph of the Wikipedia page.

#+begin_quote
  The fertility of hybrid big cat females is well documented across a number of different hybrids. This is in accordance with Haldane's rule: in hybrids of animals whose sex is determined by sex chromosomes, if one sex is absent, rare or sterile, it is the heterogametic sex (the one with two different sex chromosomes e.g. X and Y). According to /Wild Cats of the World/ (1975) by C. A. W. Guggisberg, ligers and tigons were long thought to be sterile: in 1943, a fifteen-year-old hybrid between a lion and an 'Island' tiger was successfully mated with a lion at the Munich Hellabrunn Zoo. The female cub, though of delicate health, was raised to adulthood. In September 2012, the Russian Novosibirsk Zoo announced the birth of a "liliger", which is the offspring of a liger mother and a lion father. The cub was named Kiara.

**** Hmmm... fair point. But while the "metamorphmagus" gene could conceivably be injected into a normal wizard, manipulating human genome to exhibit such characteristics seems orders of magnitude more difficult.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
