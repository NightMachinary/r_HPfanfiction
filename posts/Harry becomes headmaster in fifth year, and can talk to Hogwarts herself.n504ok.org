:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Umbridge used blood quills on people and it messed up their magic And Harry took over as headteacher of Hogwarts and she accepted him as headmaster so he could talk to her (Hogwarts that is)

Loads of students ended up in the infirmary after I think harry almost died or something because of how much he had to use the quill

And Umbridge gets locked in some cage stone thing (maybe?) on Hogwarts grounds

I'm sure Harry also spoke to a ghost spirit thing soon after that? But I could be thinking of a different fic

But I can't find it anywhere, it might be on wattpad (that was the first app I used to read FanFiction when I first started, and I read this fic a LONG time ago)

But yeah if anyone knows ðŸ˜… be much appreciated


** I think the flair you want is "What's That Fic?" but I don't have the answer, sorry.

** It feels a lot like Basilisk Born! It has a lot of this premise but Harry helps heal a first year who was hurt by overuse of blood quill.

But Umbridge arc is very small part of the story!

** It sounds like One of Those Days by Anthezar. Just caught up with it recently.

  One strange spell. That's all it took to alter the course of Harry's life - and everyone else's life around him. Bound to stay within ten feet of each other, Harry Potter and Severus Snape have to learn to get along or die trying. But in the hardest of times, one can learn things never imagined possible. After all, the past doesn't define the future. Mentor/Guardian Snape

  ABANDONED/RE-WRITE IN PRGRESS - 4th CHAPTER POSTED. TITLE: A FUTURE UNSEEN Umbridge goes a little further in her interrogation so Hogwarts wakes up to combat the threat the Ministry poses. Hogwarts choses her own Headmaster, someone capable of bringing the changes needed to survive. No-one saw her choice coming ... least of all Harry Potter.

  Before Fudge could make Umbridge the Headmistress during Harry's fifth year, the school woke up and activated the Founder's Charter. Now Harry is the Headmaster of a school that he hasn't even graduated from! What in Merlin's name is he going to do now?
