Teddy was born in April 1998, so he's as old as I am. I'm just curious what stories feature him as a young adult that focuses on his relationship with Harry.

Any ship or anything can go, I'd prefer Harry + Ron Auror duo or close friendship.


** I have a few fluffy one shots focusing on Harry and Ted throughout the years but they're more of a parent-child vibe. Won't be offended if that's not what you're looking for!

** The only one I'm aware of which resembles that is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13054713/chapters/29859897][Heroes Assemble]], in which Harry becomes the seventh Avenger (Mage) and Ted (he's a teenager, Teddy sounds so /childish/) manages to join the Avengers Academy as his apprentice/trainee (Marauder) with the proviso that he has to get EE+ in his Owls for it to be official.
