are there many fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7848621/1/The-Phoenix-Syndrome][The Phoenix Syndrome]] where the whole 'ginny potions harry and ron potions Hermione' cliche work up until the epilogue when their hole plan collapses in on its self and it ends up being a h/hr fic?

  Starts out the day after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry and Hermione meet the Goddess of Love, and she offers to let them go back in time. Strictly Harry and Hermione. Minor - well maybe major Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore Bashing. Soul Bond - Time Travel

  4 September, 2017: It has been nineteen years and some months since the Battle of Hogwarts; and three days since Hermione and her husband Ron boarded two of their children onto the Hogwarts Express. In darkness, Hermione now wakens from a sound sleep, suffering a fierce headache, body aches all over, and many confused thoughts.The reason for Hermione's miseries: Potions that for the past twenty years have Confunded the thoughts of the former “brightest witch of her age”---those potions all are wearing off.This is a post-Epilogue H/Hr story that bashes Molly Weasley, Ron Weasley and Ginny Weasley (Potter).
