Sort of like Linkffn(Picnic panic; the get together; relatives) where Ron has trouble fitting in with her muggle relatives or doesn't even try No love potions no bashing (other than Ron as long as it's realistic) Edit Linkffn(relatives by HJP Squared)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione time travels to her two years old self to fix things. But that's only the easier part, and her parents must be deeply involved.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/][Escape]], linkffn(11916243): Harry and Hermione ran from a marriage law and are directing the war behind scenes. The Grangers are playing a key role.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290): The Grangers are masquerading as dentists.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

**** I see. I was confused because as much as I like the story it isn't realistic concerning it's Ron bashing imo. BTW I totally forgot I have a recent two chapter oneshot (twoshot?) that fits what you asked for...

This is the one i was trying to rec. mixed up the names.

Pretty good one. Follows your prompt well also.

I don't like putting anything in a recommendation that spoils the fic but I would recommend this one for sure.

Not that one. I'll try to find the direct link LOL.

IT IS NOT HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT, that's a different HP/SB fic.
