:END:
(Fic request) Been trying to find this for a while now, but no luck. It was largely set in a village afterlife, with annual games to compete for the ability to return to the world for a night, with the runner up risking permanent death. Voldemort and followers existed in a prison near the village. I seem to remember it ended with finding the way beyond to a more fulfilling beyond.

Any help appreciated.
