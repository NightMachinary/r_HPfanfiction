  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I'm a pretty big fan of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2221413/Tsume-Yuki][Tsume Yuki's]] fics, several of which have fem!Harry paired off with a guy, though often times the guy is non-canon, as she writes a lot of crossovers. I particularly like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10873705/1/This-Dream-s-On-Me][This Dream's On Me]], though it hasn't updated in half a year, but she's still active, so there's hope. Another good couple of authors of fem!Harry are [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1318815/The-Carnivorous-Muffin][The Carnivorous Muffin]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1485356/wordhammer][wordhammer]], but you've probably read those if you like the genre.

Another good fem!Harry Hobbit cross is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate Be Changed]] and a good non-cross is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10942056/1/crawlersout][crawlersout]] (I'm not typically one to read genderbent fics, excepting Ranma 1/2 ones, but still like these anyway, so it's primarily because I find them exceptional enough to overcome my lack of interest in the genre).

EDIT: Can't believe I almost left out [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1/Black-Sky][Black Sky]]. Seriously, this is probably my favorite of all of the ones I listed. So much intricate yet perfectly fitting plot with well-developed characters on top of it.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9081608/1/Fire-Born][Fire Born]] has a rather awesome depiction of Tom Riddle. The way it developed the relationship between Tom and Fem!Harry was very interesting mainly because it featured a Tom Riddle who's still a psychopath. I really wish there was more to this story because it was really intriguing while I was reading it.

** linkffn(9486886) I can't belive Moratorium isn't allready mentioned-.. scratch that I know why it hasn't been mentioned. It has some really big flaws, Mary Sues, Self Incert'ish and very weird paceing. But on the other hand its ending is really nice, and not like School Days nice but actually nice, and a pre-avatar Night Shamalama twist. So if you want a 225K complete story that ends itself without leaving anything major hanging, to this one, though I will admit I couldn't read more than a chaptor at a time.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** I post this often, but the Severus' Rose series has a pretty prominent fem!Harry/Fred bit going on. Completed years 1 through 7 with an unfinished postwar sequel. Not for Snape haters though.

On my phone now so can't be arsed to link, but it's on ffnet anyway.
