So there are some obvious problems to Hogwarts like the bullying problem and the bad Professors. I'm looking for a fic where those are more recognized and dealt with. Maybe someone gets hired in replace of Dumbledore and changes the school for the better the Professors are more involved in the students lives or something?


** This series has competent professors: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15475770/chapters/35925678]]. It focuses on Snape, but other teachers are involved as well.

*** What a delightful fic! I love the idea of a Snape whose greatest ambition is to have the lowest fatality rate for a Potions professor lol

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

  Time and time again the Bad Guys do bad things and get away with it. Time and time again the Good Guys take the low blow and just soldier on with their upper lips stiff. What might happen if someone couldn't hold it together? How would Magical Britain react? More to the point; who would they blame? A little One-Shot in documentary style.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.
