Somewhat similar to my previous post, but i'm not looking for a monster Harry. I'm looking for a Harry that is 100% unkillable in every way. 20k+ words please.

Thanks, Warryn.


** linkffn(12388283) is almost both what you want and the complete opposite. Harry keeps getting killed but restarts, memory intact. I quite liked it, [[/spoiler][it becomes very tactical when Volde realises what is happening]].

** linkffn(A Long Journey Home) is one of my 'default' reocommendeations. While it is fem!Harry, it's not the focus of the story.

It's slow-going at times yet I still liked it very much.

Killability: You /can/ kill 'Jasmine', she just gets reborn from the ashes (as 17+ year old, as far as we can tell).

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

I wrote a short silly snippet 8 months ago and posted it here, you might like to read it. It's just a silly little thing about Harry accidentally becoming invincible after Voldemort uses his blood to resurrect himself.

*** That was awesome. Do you think you might expand on that story, because it's definetly a unique, (and from the look of the nerdy death eater, and voldemort being aware of the story) and great idea for a crack fic. If not maybe post it as a prompt, because this looks like such a good story that it'd be a shame not to continue it.

Thanks, Warryn.

***** Trust me. It is. It's brilliant, and set's the foundation already while allowing writers to explore the beginning's of the world you've created, and allows them to use there own idea's as well since it's not clearly defined where you want such a story to go. Let's them do it themselves, because of that you'll end up with wildly different stories.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
