Imagine seeing Remus visiting a shop, extorting an owner to pay for protection from death eaters. Envision Lucius importing drugs and roughshod over a gang of muggle kids dealing heroin to fund his master's war.


** Sounds like a crossover with Worm could do this

*** Luna Lovegood has rough times in school. It is even worse as her mother died couple(?) years ago. She decides to become a Light Wizard through power of controlling... whatever /THOSE/ entities(lol) are.

She joins DE teen generation group to find info, and now she accidentally Godrics Hollow, and her main enemy is... hmm... Rubeus Hagrid? Her childhood hero.

In the end, Pomfrey(who is much younger in this au) uses forbidden magic to turn wrackspurs more agressive through Lunas body as mediator, making them Imperio-style hivemind. But Everliving(who was named Harry Potter many years ago) stops her, ugh, by Expelliarmus maybe?

** Now, the only thing I can think of is Dumbledor and Voldemort snapping at eachother like in the opening scene of westside story.

** IMO, the only way to really "control territory" is to put it under the Fidelius charm. Otherwise, physical location doesn't much matter for wizards.
