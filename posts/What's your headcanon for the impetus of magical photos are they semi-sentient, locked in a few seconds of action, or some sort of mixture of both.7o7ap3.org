** They're nothing like repeating gifs, because that is muggle, not magic. Screw the movies if that's how they did it there (I don't remember).

There was one reference to Harry trying to get out of the picture, I think. And wasn't Penelope trying to hide in a picture, because someone spilled a drop on it and her nose became blotched?

Yup. PoA, chapter 5 "The Dementor".

  ‘The sooner we get on the train, the better,' he said. ‘At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he's accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know,' Ron grimaced, ‘his girlfriend. She's hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy ...'

Semi-sentient, not locked in. It repeats seamlessly, like [[https://media.giphy.com/media/TzJxDdJckPQ9q/giphy.gif][this]], not like [[https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-05/enhanced/webdr08/2/15/anigif_enhanced-buzz-6283-1399060754-8.gif][this]].

*** I like the idea that there's different kinds. So that picture of Sirius would be locked and unable to interact with, to push a narrative. But family photos would be little snapshots of the person's personality in that moment, so like you mentioned with Penelope, they'd just smile and wave or whatever, until you do something like insult them- then they'll look angry or turn around. Portraits can talk back and leave the picture frame.

*** Lol, in the German version it states that she got pimples all over her face and tried to hide because of that. I really need to read the books in the original language.

**** Blotchy can mean both in english. And it most likely meant pimples but percy would rather believe his brother's a prat versus his gf not being perfect

** Photos are definitely interactive - we see this when Moody (or Sirius, can't remember) shows Harry the photo of the first order and ask the people in the photo to shuffle.

I feel like they retain a snapshot of the person's personality at that time, but they weren't sentient the way that living people are.

** I always thought they were locked in a few seconds of action, with the exception of the ability to walk out of the photo.

** I mean in the one picture Harry had with Lockhart, Harry's image self kept moving out of the frame while Lockhart dragged him back, so I think that it is the personality. I think it also has to do with the intent - Sirius' image in the newspaper was stuck in a loop, i guess the editor didn't want him running through the newspaper killing all the other stories?

** For me, it all depends on what magic you use on it. As hinted in the /Chamber of Secrets/ film, the photograph at first comes out inanimate and will only gain magical movement when a magical revealing fluid (presumably a potion) is used to develop them.

So I think the basic, cheapest kind of motion-potion, the one they can reasonably spray mass-produced items like the /Daily Prophet/ or Wanted posters with, gets you a barely-moving gif-on-paper; but it's also perfectly possible to infuse your picture with much more elaborate magic that's only a notch behind Portraits, and that's what Lockhart did with his personal, "artistic" photographs of himself. With the right enchantments, photographs can be sort-of-moving like chatbots, or even fully independant like Portraits.

** btw sentient means able to perceive or feel, sapient means able to think. So I think pictures would definitely be sentient, as they respond to outside stimuli (waving and looking at people looking at them), but idk about being sapient. someone said something about Moody asking them to move around in the OotP picture, which would suggest sapience unless that was a preprogrammed function, but i dunno. of course there could be multiple types like Achille-Talon suggested that aren't even sentient, basically a gif, and there could be advanced ones that are sapient
