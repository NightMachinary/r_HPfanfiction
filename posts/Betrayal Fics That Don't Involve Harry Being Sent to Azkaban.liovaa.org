For the past month I've been trying to find good betrayal fics to read and I'm finding it really difficult to discover stories that don't revolve around Harry being sent to Azkaban as the big betrayal of the story.

And then I remembered that I'm part of this lovely group full of all of you well read people! Why haven't I asked you all for recommendations yet!? So on that note: Anyone got some juicy betrayal fics for me to read? You'd be my heroes!
