** I can't think of anything that matches this description and it seems nobody else can. What part is more important to you, /the summoning/ by someone not in the order or the fact that the order wasn't involved in the the travel since I think I can recommend a few with reality swapping where the Order wasn't involved, often the person sending themselves?

**** Well reality swapping fics without the Order being involved in the dimension travel. There's a bunch and a whole load more crossovers but sticking to popular Harry Potter ones.

Linkffn(9704180) I'm still here. A well know fic, still being updated but slowly. Harry unintentionally slips into another world.

Linkffn(11525673) A one shot that inspired linkffn(4040192) (Harry Potter and the girl that lived.)

linkffn(11525673) the final story in a trilogy that hasn't aged too well but is being rewritten. Alternate Harry swaps places with canon Harry.

linkffn(12446118) (Intersecting realities) The newest completed reality swapping fic. Harry WAS summoned by AN Order but left and found himself in an entirely new reality. For all intents and purposes Its the Canon world he swaps into.

Linkffn(12188150) technically time travel but its Tonks (Yes Order member but quickly begins to disapprove of their actions) so not the usual swap. Either way, injecting a new variable into canon universe.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
