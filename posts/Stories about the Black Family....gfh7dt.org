I'm looking for stories about the Black family set after 1980. Anybody have suggestions?


** I'm currently writing a fic set in 1984, centred around Sirius's mother and grandfather getting him out of Azkaban and securing him a trial. The fic centres around Sirius having to come to terms with being free and his relationship with his family I'm general. Purely family-centred, no pairings.

Hope this fits what you're looking for :)

** !linkffn(All According to Plan) is a longfic where a thirteen year old Bellatrix from an alternate universe travels to the canon timeline in the summer of 1993. She immediately sets out to clear Sirius's name and resurrect the house of Black. Very well written and frequently updated

#+begin_quote
  Thirteen-year-old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron goddess. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. Title drop. (A collaboration by LeighaGreene and inwardtransience)
