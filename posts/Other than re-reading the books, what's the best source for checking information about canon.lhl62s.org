Not really much more to add beyond the title. I'm open to any kind of canon:

- Book Canon
- Movie Canon
- J.K.'s Word of God additions
- etc.

And any level of source. Could be a tweet compilation, a dramatic personae, plot synopses, worldbuilding details, spell lists, or whatever else you think might be useful.

I'm just looking to build up some good reference tools for the fics I'm currently plotting out, so every little helps. :)


** Lexicon is quite useful when it comes to spells and classroom learning. It has got citations for when Harry learnt what in which class, as well as what he was tested on.

#+end_quote

That is useful, both for Harry's classes and any others I might play around with - gives me a ballpark to estimate from, so to speak.

Does it include anything other than his classes? Arithmancy and Runes and so on?

** Lexicon. Wizarding World is good, but I would make sure it was written by JKR and not a random article . HP wiki is okay, but you have to make sure it's not video game or movie info you're looking at.

** The failings of the Wiki have been pointed out. Aside from citing HP Lego, I can only add that sometimes, the information is /made up entirely/.

I can recommend getting ebooks and having them in a manner where you can quickly search them on your computer. Then the Lexicon, which has been mentioned, and finally, anything from [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/index.htm][CJ Whitehound]], in particular the [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/Location_Location.htm][Location essays]].

This is the gold standard of how to cite. She always has her opinion and conclusions, but since every last bit of the assertions is traced back to a Canon source, which on top of that is cited in-text, you can easily draw your own conclusions, without even having to crack open the books.

*** You need to be really careful with CJ's stuff. She might know her facts, but she often twists them, ignores the ones that disagree with her, and sneaks in some logical fallacies to push a "Snape is an angel and Gryffindors are evil bastards" narrative. See [[https://reddit.com/comments/kmha56/comment/ghej2c3][this thread]], where several of us explain how everything she has to say about Fred and George is deliberate misinformation.

**** I know she has strong opinions, but tbh, that is why I find the essays impressive. I haven't felt nudged into certain directions when reading them. She draws her conclusions and I draw mine; she presents her thought process, not her conclusion. Like on the Location essays, I sometimes think there's rather reaching leaps in logic, but facts and conclusions are so well separated that it's never an issue.

*** Honestly, with the multiple cracks about HP Lego Canon here, I'm half tempted to write a fic purely based on the Lego Game Canon just to see how many chapters I can get before someone goes "Hang on a minute!" :D

That's a good idea, vis a vis the ebooks thing. I have Calibre, so I can use that to search the books pretty quickly if I need to verify something.

And heh. Yeah, does look pretty good. Brings me back to my uni days (less than three years ago :D) and that level of citation-conclusion distinction. I was always told - use your research to tell your story, but make sure to let the research stand on its own too.

** "Reading the books" fics?

The [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page][HP wiki]] is good for plot synopsis and character history, but the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/][Lexicon]] is much better for cross-referencing specific worldbuilding details (classes, spells, potions, magical creatures etc.) while writing a fic.

That's a very good point. I hadn't thought of that.

#+begin_quote
  , but the
#+end_quote

It does sound like the sites are very complimentary like that. Some other people have said things quite similar to that.

** The [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/][Lexicon]] is my go-to (I find myself referring to the timelines constantly!) and I use the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page][Wiki]] as a backup. Be wary of sources in the Wiki especially and always check the footnotes, as sometimes it adds in details from the old HP games and lego!
