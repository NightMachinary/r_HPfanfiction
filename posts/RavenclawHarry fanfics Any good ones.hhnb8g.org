  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

  Licking the Philosopher's Stone was perhaps not something Harry would have done if he'd known what it was. But that act, along with so many others, started him down his path to building a library with Hermione and Millicent while Tom lurked in the background. So, he was happy with how things turned out.---Editing for grammar in April 2019. My great thanks and respect for Tazzm for their rather phenomenal work.

** linkffn(The Birth of Evil by DisobedienceWriter). Harry takes over England.

linkffn(Always Smiling by Lady Salazar). Says it's complete, but doesn't feel that way to me.

linkffn(I was never a scarecrow by dogbertcarroll). The Goblet summons Ravenclaw!Harry, because normal Harry is under wards it can't overpower.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes by Peeves' best friend). WBWL considered dark by parents, twin Max.

  Running only made it worse, and crying only made them enjoy it more. So Harry smiled instead, and waited for the day when he wouldn't have to, when it'd be them running and crying in his place. Oneshot, RK elements.

** Oh god I can't remember what it was called and it's gonna bug me... But it was a MOD!Harry fic where something happens and Harry ends up as the mod at like 8? And Death teaches him about the Wizarding World and bits and pieces of wandless magic... Harry also can't die, I remember that. He gets pushed off the stairs by a group of kids, falls a few flights and cracks his skull open and dies, but he wakes up like three hours later completely healed with dried blood in his hair. He's in ravenclaw, yes, but that's not really the most important part of this fic. I think during the battle at the DoM, when Sirius falls through the veil, Death just sorta pushes him back out and waves at Harry. It was good.

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)
