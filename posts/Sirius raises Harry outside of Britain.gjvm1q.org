:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that the fan fiction was centered around Harry finally returning to Hogwarts, and Britain as a whole, after being raised outside of Britain by Sirius. It was mentioned quite a few times about how the ministry (fudge specifically) had tried to kidnap Harry multiple times to bring him back without his or Siruis' permission, especially during one event when Harry was 8 (?) that left him somewhat traumatised and attached to his godfather. This fic was almost certainly a powerful Harry trope, and had him paired with Hermione.

I think there was also a scene where Harry was kidnapped and taken to a forest and Sirius used his form of a Grimm to reign down some serious hell. (Pun intended) Though that might have been from a different fic... I'm not sure.

I'll admit that I've read a lot of these fics, especially if they feature a powerful Harry and pair him with Hermione but this one escapes me now. I'm hoping all of these bits and pieces I remember are from the same fic and not different ones my memory has mashed together.


** I am not sure about the Grim scene but the rest sounds like Keira Marcos' 'Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond.

** LIke Heresy23, I'm not sure about the grim scene, but I do recall a few scenes involving the ministry trying to kidnap Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5712501][/Sirius' Savior/ by Silverfawkes]]

Sorry. I read so many fanfics they all kind of blend together. I think I've read through twenty from start to finish since all these lockdowns began.

*** That you! It doesn't ring any bells but I'll add it to my to read list anyway since I'm always looking for good fics :)

Like you, I've read so many that everything blends together so I'm not sure if the grim scene was related.
