**** Well, we're actually not told what arithmancy and ancient runes do, so the author is free to go wild.

Personally, I think arithmancy has a lot to do with spellcrafting and potions. There's really no other way to explain how new spells and potions are made.

Runes, of course, must be the basis of enchanting and wards.

Presumably, runes and arithmancy are the main courses a magical inventor would need. Although, potions, herbology, charms and transfiguration would be needed for a good base. Functionally speaking, DADA is worthless, Divination is a joke, CoMC is only useful for Lords with a lot of land and Astronomy is an undefined wildcard.

When a potion is brewed, what decides the numbers of stirs? Why are some stirs counterclockwise? What effect does cauldron metal have on the brewed potion? Why is cauldron bottom thickness an issue? Would a muggle ceramic dish work?

There's a lot going on that isn't explained and I have a very hard time imagining it was all determined by trial and error. I'm sure Snape could throw together a potion on the fly by instinct of potion ingredient interactions, but I doubt any student could.

******** Actually, its explicitly stated that you can summon food :P. I think you're mixing up summoning (/Accio/) and conjuring, the branch of transfiguration that is about creating stuff out of nothing. Duplicated is allowed as far as I can tell from the single paragraph on the 5 exceptions to Gamp's law of elemental transfiguration we get.

"Your mother can't produce food out of thin air, no one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigura... It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some..."

~Hermione in DH.

So you can summon food (i.e. steal from a supermarket from a mile away using /accio/) or duplicate/increase it (/gemino/ or /engorgio/), or you can transfigure it from some other, non food item, but you can't create it with no base object using a spell like you can with, say, birds (/Avis/). Also anything conjured is temporary so it wouldn't be healthy to eat even if it was possible. (Side note, Transfiguration being temporary is fanon. Its only conjuration Rowling said is temporary)

Edit: although I'm really not clear on how aguamenti fits into all of this. It isn't quite food, but it also is a permanent conjuration as far as I can tell... there is also the wine refilling spell that Harry used to get the memory, but that could just be increasing the wine that was still leftover in the bottle.
