** This isn't serious, right? or is it? I can't tell.

If you are serious, then no, paintings don't have rights, because while they are sentient, they aren't alive. Neither are they the person they're representing. They're just sentient only due to enchantments, and they can't do anything beyond what they've been enchanted.

You probably don't need permission to make portraits in the HPverse, but laws there are finnecky.

Again, it's not ALL paintings in the wizarding world which are sentient, it's only the ones that have been enchanted to act and move that way. So no, graffiti wouldn't be sentient, unless it's been enchanted.

Are they though? They might just be highly advanced simulacra, yet still pale echos of what was.

Eh, they're probably sentient. But that's a boring answer.

**** Sentient means perceiving sensations, and since they can tell and understand what people are saying, and see and comprehend what people look like, I'd definitely call them sentient.

***** the degree to which they can interact with the people looking at them depends on the power of the witch or wizard painted. I doubt you could call all portraits sentient

** I think the litmus for granting rights in the Wizarding world is

- Are they a potential threat?

and

- Can we negotiate with them?

** The portraits behave the way they are enchanted to behave and only imitate the behavior of the person painted in the way it appeared to the painter. The amount of interaction they have with real people is also limited and depends on the power of the wizard or witch painted

** The portraits of Hogwarts serve the Headmaster, is this because they choose to or are they bound to the castle and its Headmaster when they are created? I can't imagine they are sentient in the traditional sense or else it would be seen as a form of immortality. They're an echo and little more or else they wouldn't be content just sitting on walls.

** I've always found this an interesting question. By modern ethical standards, one would think that any sentient being must have a few basic rights. But in the Wizarding world, which seems to only give any serious rights to human wizards? Perhaps not.

I have a feeling that most wizards treat paintings as nothing more than a curiosity - regardless of sentience.

** My guess? There would probably be laws akin to animal cruelty laws, but maybe not in Britain.

If you think about Animal Cruelty laws, they are more about restricting human behavior we find repulsive rather than protecting the actual rights of animals. That is why these laws apply even to animals (like insects) that generally aren't viewed as 'thinking'. We still allow them to be ... manhandled for certain reasons (Science, art, whatever for instance), but the idea of someone doing it to get their gollies off offends us and we ban that.

Or another example, we find someone taking an ant-hill cast ok but the concept of someone sitting torturing ants to be repulsive.

The portraits are reasonable facsimiles of humans. Even if everyone agreed that they were completely anatomic, people would still find the behavior of tormenting one to be repulsive and self-destructive, which would be enough to imagine laws banning it.

Exactly what laws would depend on the legal framework you are sticking it into. After all, even something like pornography is considered repulsive and self-harming, but is generally not banned in the US because of free speech concerns. For exactly how the laws would be structured, you'd have to imagine the legal system you are talking about and what similar laws would be in place.

The reason I say maybe not in Britain is because the Ministry of Magic is generally depicted as backwards and archaic. I would suspect this could easily be put into the catalog of 'laws that are behind the times'. If they did have something, it might be based on the older principals of nobility. i.e.: A crime to defile the portrait of a noble house, or for anyone outside of the family to do so, or something.

** I would say they probably do. They are sentient. I doubt anyone needs permission to make them in the first place, but in a school of 1000 kids, a number of which are pretty unpleasent, how many of those paintings are graffitied or vandalised? And for that matter, does Peeves even go after them?

** This is a Harry Potter fanfic subreddit none of it is serious. But I was just thinking as I know they need to be enchanted, yes most paintings probably only have simple tasks like talk/laugh/move a bit, could you enchant them well enough to become as intelligent as humans maybe more so. I mean the paintings in Hogwarts can have conversations to people in the real world interact with other artwork and they feel emotions like when the fat lady says she 'sees' Sirius black and is genuinely terrified. So they are showing human traits feelings and communication which may lead to the ethics like you can't destroy a painting if they have their own thought and conversations and can make their own choices even if they are simple. I'm kind of looking at them more as like AI of the wizarding world and if you can enchant them well enough you could make life in a sense.
