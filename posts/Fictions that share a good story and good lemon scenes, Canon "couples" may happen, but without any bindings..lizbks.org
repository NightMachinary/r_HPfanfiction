i got partially inspired by this from "The House of Healing Souls" that has Harry/Narcissa.

During the progress of the Fic, at some Point, Harry enters a gala and meets up with Neville. The whole thing is about Harry entering the Noble society.

I would like to read similar stuff, its not necessary and i wouldnt expect Harry going full Noble, after all he uses it as a tool to get, what and where he wants.

Maybe its an investigation fic. But whatever the case is, the couples arent bound, so there is no "solid" relationship. I imagined for example, that Neville could have 2 escort ladys on his side.

Harry can appear to stay with Ginny, but they arent really a "couple" or they have an open Relationship or open marriage. So both might sleep with other partners and there isnt such a big deal about it. Occassionally they might sleep with each other (or she with Neville).

  This is the sequel to a much shorter story also on this archive, Under the Influence. While it might be helpful to read that brief story first, it's not strictly necessary. This is really the story of how one deals with the aftermath of casual intimacy -- what happens when you want someone you hadn't expected to want, and then when what you want turns out to be. . . rather more.
