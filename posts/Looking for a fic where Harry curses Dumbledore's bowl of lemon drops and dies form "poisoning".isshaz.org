Can't remember the name of the fic, and no matter how much I look I can't seem to find it.

It's a fic where year one Harry curses Dumbledore's bowl and the lemon drops become cursed/poisoned. At the 4th or 5th year , Dumbledore finally dies after being slowly poisoned for years. He dies while trying to explain horcruxes to Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Severe abuse causes an enormous burst of accidental magic from which Harry learns to control the Dursleys. With their home as a casual base, he takes to the streets, thieving & improving his magic. Dumbledore-bashing. Dark retribution shocker. Grey nonreactive, noncompliant, anti-hero Harry. Friends. Fluff. Pairing. M-rated. Broken boy v powerful sanctimonious manipulative tyrant!
