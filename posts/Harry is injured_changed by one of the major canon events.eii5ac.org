Maybe he's unlucky against the troll or during the confrontation with Quirrell. Maybe the 1000 year old Basilisk managed to hurt him more than a single bite that was caused by Harry when he stabbed the thing. Maybe the dementors did more damage than just emotional or he hit the ground when he fell from his broom during that Quidditch match. Maybe any one of the events that occurred during his time at Hogwarts, where he was forced to do the job of adults, left more of a lasting impact on him.

So many things happening to him but he's very rarely seriously injured as a result.

I get that magic is incredibly powerful but it seems like such a cheap tool to avoid having Harry spend too much time in the infirmary.

I'm not necessarily asking for crippled Harry or amputation or brain damage, if you link those though then fine, but simply for his heroic moments to be more impactful than being followed up with "You've had a busy day so get some rest! You have class in the morning!"


** Huh. I just had an idea.

Genius!Harry who got hit in the head by the troll or something and it somehow managed to awaken his brain instead of damaging it

Thanks for the inspiration!

** Try Blindness, or any number of fics like that - there're a bunch of fics about how the basilisk venom does stuff to him, the dementors have unforeseen consequences etc - have a stroll through the top 100 HP fanfics on ffn and you'll find quite a few, in a way Basiliskborn might also qualify? It all depends on interpretation tbh, but Blindness is probably the best example

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
