I've been thinking about it lately, and I just can't get it out of my head. Some sort of "Lost" fic, but not a crossover. Is there any, or am I just crazy? (PS, I'm new on reddit, so please, if I missed something on the post, or I'm just making a fool out of myself, do tell me [: )


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][The Island of Fire]] series, starting with linkao3(3236603) was what immediately came to mind.

  The situation, Tonks surmised, was indeed bleak. She had no wand, no contact with the Ministry and no way off the remote Scottish island that held her prisoner. If things went according to plan, she'd be dead within the hour.

** There's only two that come to mind. linkffn(10061782), this is technically not a desert /island/ fic but it's a desert /place/ fic. Some sort of ever-changing maze. It's not so good anymore but I loved it when I first read it and I still cite it as a great inspiration. Sadly abandonded.

linkffn(7287278) hits the nail right on the head. It says incomplete but it's only missing an epilogue, plus NMB may or may not be working on the sequel? He has some of it written, from what I understand. Really good and creative fic.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** If they have their wands with them (most likely), then getting lost on a remote island isn't nearly as much a challenge as compared to muggles.

Magic just makes so many things easier: Want a fire? Incendio! Want some fish? Accio Fish! Want something from a tree? Diffindo! Want some other useful things? Just Conjure them from thin air!

*** I think it the castaways' chance of survival would depend heavily on how much magical training they've got under their belts. There isn't much in the first few years' curriculum that would help them. PS, CS, and PA divergent stories would be hard pressed to explain how anyone could survive without primarily relying on Muggle survival methods.

(Off Topic) I was a bit disappointed to see Harry use this on Hagrid on DH. I'd always thought that one of the limitations to this spell was that it couldn't be used on living things. Every other instance of the Summoning Charm in the original series involved only the summoning of things, not people/animals.
