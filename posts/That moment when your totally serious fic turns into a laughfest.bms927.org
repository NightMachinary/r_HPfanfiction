I originally intended a fic on how Harry's big fat saga affected everyone else, focusing on a particular few kids. It was at first gonna be totally serious, kind of "how the heck do we survive trolls and basilisks and dear-gd-everyone-is-dying-make-it-stop" sort of thing. It kind of turned into a "hey look Harry just got nearly burned alive by a dragon/I just wanna take my exams and go to sleep darnit/Harry you can't go 5 seconds without attracting some dark magic" thing.

LOL this is gonna be amazing


** Parvati-Blossom's fic (translated by Vanessa Li Potter) /River Styx/ is, as I understand it, a very dark and serious fic that explores Harry joining Voldemort and all sorts of drama and serious philosophical themes involving destiny and the meaning of power.

Unfortunately, when Harry joins Voldemort, he takes on the moniker /Dark Lord/ */Filldeserp/*. And so, when I tried to read the fic, it was like every appearance or mention of Harry triggered canned laughter.

*** Is that supposed to be “son of [the] serpent” in terribly broken French? I must agree it sounds quite absurd in English though.

**** Sounds as absurd in French (though it's not French as pointed out), because /filldeserp/ when read aloud means "daughter of the billhook" (though it'd be written /fille de serpe/).
