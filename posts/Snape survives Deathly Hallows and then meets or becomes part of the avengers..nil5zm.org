:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Someone mentioned this fic to me a while back, and I wasn't really in the mood for Snape centric fics at the time. Now I can't stop thinking about this fic but I can't remember it's name or even where I first saw it mentioned.... I think he meets Bruce Banner first, btw.

#+begin_quote
  How did the greatest Potion Master and spy of his time ever succumb to the likes of Nagini? The answer: he didn't. Having 'died', Severus Snape leaves the past behind and is determined to live over again. But Fate isn't finished with him yet, and another war looms on the horizon. Falling in with a misfit group of heroes, the Potions Master must make his stand.
