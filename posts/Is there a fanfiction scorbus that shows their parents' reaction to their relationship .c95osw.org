** I also 100% recommend "Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time."

Also, FloreatCastellum has a ton of short little slice-of-life ficlets that center around Harry and Ginny and their family, and that includes the outing of Albus and Scorpius. The Malfoys aren't in these stories, though.

[[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/LinksToFiclets][Her list of ficlets is here]]. You should read "Albus and Scorpius first kiss," and then read everything from "Albus and Scorpius on cliffs" to "Scorpius is welcomed to the family as Al's boyfriend." Then end with the sweet "Al shares something with Harry."

#+begin_quote
  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.
