Are there any fics that deal with poachers killing and harvesting parts from magical creatures? Can be a main focus (eg. a Witcher-esque hunter that takes parts from its targets to meet a contracted demand) or just a secondary thing (eg. one of Luna's expeditions finds her creature being targeted by poachers a la Crazy Little Things by Dreiser).

Inspired by a post by Uncommonality that talked about a narcotic potion using centaur eyes as an ingredient/component.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.


** Look for it under Newt / gellart grinderwall type fics. I remember reading at least 3 really good ones like that.

And one under Newt / Harry Potter where Harry time travels by accident into Africa or something. That one has almost all of the things you asked for PLUS it's humor is awesome.

I haven't seen any of the new movies yet (Everything came out while I was still in uni, so I'm massively behind on pretty much everything in most of the fandoms I'm part of), would that be a limiter to reading these kinds of fics or can they carry themselves despite me not knowing most of the characters or info?

**** You don't have to watch all of it just see enough of the 1st FBAWTFT it has all the awesome Newt scenes you need. You should definitely watch it.

But nothing is stopping you from just reading it either. It's just that you won't be able to appreciate who Newt is as a character and his values without atleast seeing the 1st movie if not all of it.

***** Ah, okay. Cool. I'll save it until I've seen the movie. And I'm planning to, I just don't have the time yet and there are other things further up the list to catch up on first. It is, unfortunately, a very, very long list. I still haven't seen any of the new star wars movies either.

  Being a parselmouth, Harry is hired by all of the Dragon Sanctuaries. His new job: to travel the world, check on all the dragons, talk to them and learn about them. The dragons have also heard of Harry's talent - as an artist and they can be pushy about having their portrait painted. With dragons, magizoologists and shades of Dark Lords after him, Harry's life is anything but dull.

** In later stories of the 'It's Tea Time' series, by frombluetored Harry, daughter Lily Potter is a dragon keeper, and there's a whole plotline surrounding dragon poachers and the consequences of the methods they use for poaching.
