:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't know how it happens, but it does. Harry's attitude towards it is about what you'd expect. He's surprised to find that while Draco is pretty much as bad as he thought, the Malfoy parents are a huge improvement on the Dursleys. They're perhaps a bit strict and they're definitely not affectionate or anything, but they're fair and reasonable guardians.

Draco has friends over throughout the summer, which isn't a pleasant time for Harry. He doesn't bring it up, but it does come up that Harry could have friends over as well if he'd like. He asks about Hermione, trying to prove a point or something, and is again surprised when they don't hesitate to allow it. The adult Malfoys don't like muggles or muggleborns at all and they don't pretend to, they just say that they are perfectly capable of civilly tolerating one in their home for some time for the sake of their ward.

Does anyone recognize this?

*** Unfortunately not. I'm pretty sure it wasn't ffn and I get the feeling it wasn't ao3, but I could easily be wrong.

** I remember...I think that it was a fic where Harry was uneducated about his status in the wizarding world and Lucius Malfoy winds up taking over the guardianship.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
