Looking for any fic that involves The Ministry of Magic being integrated into The British Government


** You mean something like linkffn(Long Live The Queen by offsides), or Lord (Justin) Finch-Fletchley in the House of Lords? I don't know about the latter, but it would be cool. Or even (please, say no!) linkao3(Royal Ward by Catstaff)?

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen, an event which causes Vernon to die of a heart attack. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry's 9th birthday and several years before Prince Charles and Princess Diana divorced. Warnings may change as the story progresses.
