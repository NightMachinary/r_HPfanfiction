So, there's these fics where Dumbledore is dosing Harry with loyalty potions, and I'm thinking, is there anything where these potions are just given once but the effects are subtly enforced through conditioning.

Like Harry is given a mild love potion once to jumpstart a relationship, then it's promptly weaned off of.

Or Dumbledore gives Harry a loyalty potion first year, then gives him grandfatherly advice Christmas time.


** I only condition with Gilderoy Lockhart's product line.

*** ... that's actually fairly clever. Have an upvote.

** There might be some, but I don't think there will be too many like this. If there's one thing this fandom got right, it was that love potions and things like that need to be used continuously.

*** Sure, we've only ever seen it in use where Romilda gives Ron huge amounts by accident via him being a glutton, and Tom Riddle Sr being dosed by the unattractive Merope Gaunt.

Although speaking of, that goes in hand with another idea of mine. A doses B with a potion tuned to C and C with a potion tuned to B, then convinces both to continue dosing the other.

I don't know how I'd get it into a fic, but it just popped up in my head.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/][A Marauder's Plan]] touches on this, (but at 80% the length of the original books it touches on a lot of things).

Now this is major spoilers, near the end it is revealed that Barty Crouch did this to Hannah Abbott using mild confundus charms on letters they sent to make them more receptive to conditioning. (i would add a link to this scene but I don't feel like skimming through 893,787 words today)

*** I've read it before. That fic would have been perfect. It had friendships, but then it starts using family magic and has a Harry that is whiny about his relationship with Hermione.
