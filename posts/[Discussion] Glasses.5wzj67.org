I don't know if it was answered somewhere but why so many wizards and witches wear glasses ? I imagine if there are potions to regrow bones and spells for reattaching limbs after splinching then there should be some potion or spell or something to fix eyesight. I remember that Harry had quite bad eyesight in the books. One summoning charm on glasses would be enough to render him useless in duel. It also includes many other wizards.


** Call it: correcting vision problems is so much more painful than something like Skelegrow that it's just not worth it to most people.

Especially since the eyes continue to degenerate over the course of someone's life. They'd need multiple alterations--multiple painful "operations".

** We don't know how easy or hard it is to magically fix eyesight, if it's possible at all. There isn't a spell for everything. The definition of "fixed" is also a very subjective, and would not be something to easily quantify using magic. Magic has no idea what 20/20 means.

** Impervious and stuck glasses pretty much render the duel problem moot - and might even protect his eyes from other spells. Sure, glasses can be broken by magic - but if you can hit them with a spell, you can hit his head with a spell as well, so that's not exactly a big disadvantage.

Alternatively, magic contacts should be possible too.

** Because their poor eyesight is completely natural? Regrowing bones and reattaching limbs is not, which is why magic works really well for those things. Fixing other health issues (like, say, broken bones or cuts) is a matter of speeding up the healing process magically, or undoing the action done to them, I don't know.

Though, there might be magical ways of improving eyesight, but they might be any combination of:

- expensive

- difficult

- in the realm of dubious legality

- social stigma

And honestly, Harry could always just summon his glasses back. It's not like he isn't experienced at summoning things he can't see.

*** i definitely wanted to agree with you and pretty much do, except I think Hermione got her teeth fixed by Madam Pompfrey in GoF (from buckteeth to normal), so that would be a bit of a wrench in that. But the whole "only back to what you are naturally given" thing makes a lot of sense.

**** Well, Pompfrey was just shrinking them until Hermione said when, so Pompfrey was never actually undoing the magic.

** Rowling said that damage caused by spells that have backfired can cause damage that lasts forever like it did with Lockhart and spells that targets the eyes would probably be really complicated so maybe its just not worth the risk. I imagine the first person wanting to invent a spell being reluctant to try it out on themself. I think it should be possible to transfigure someones eyes in fully functional ones but that would probably require someone to be really adept at transfiguration and could be reverse by a simple revelio charm

** I prefer to believe fixing eyes is as tricky as laser surgery.

** We don't know what they're using glasses for. Myopia? Magi-Visionâ„¢? A transparent map beamed directly into their eyes?

If magic utility glasses are common and muggleborns are rare, then people who see Harry wearing glasses might think he's showing off his wealth in a somewhat nerdy way. Or, since his father wore glasses (to show off his wealth but let's not speak ill of the dead), it might be in honor of his father. Maybe they think he's wearing his father's old glasses, even (thus the tape).

*** It's at least in the movie, and I think in the book as well.
