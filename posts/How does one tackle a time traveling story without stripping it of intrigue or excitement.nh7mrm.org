If you have Harry going back to his first year and not quickly exposing Quirrell and then exonerating Sirius while warning about the Basilisk?


** To maintain intrigue and excitement, I think you have to chose what the intrigue and excitement of your story is.

Is Harry trying to fix everything that went wrong for him, then he better have a realistic plan. And that plan better fail, and spectacularly.

Is Harry accidentally in the past or not trying to change anything too far ahead. Instead just trying to fix things as they come? Okay well he's a different person now, he will be making minor changes every day and they will snowball larger. Eventually his foreknowledge will be worth only a bit, and a new Harry with new allies and new enemies will have to face somewhat new issues.

Obv these arnt universal solutions, but realise that excitement usually comes from rising stakes. Intrigue comes from the main character not knowing the answers, or sometimes from the reader not knowing the answers.

*** That's very good thank you

​

hypothetically what if your character was a villian and was trying to save Voldemort how would that work ?

**** This is purely off the cuff, so don't judge it harshly.

Harry has a want and a need. Evil Harry wants to work for or with Voldemort. He needs(a win, allies, to feel comfortable in who he is, to feel in control).

So make Harry want impossible, he tries to help Voldemort, but every time he gets a chance he fails it, or doesn't realize it's his chance. And these mess ups are making his timeline knowledge for frayed. Now Voldemort thinks Harry knows too much. He's still trying to do bad things, but hes losing more and more control. But hes also realizes that he's been sort of falling into allies or followers. Or something else has been changing in his life. Enough that he realizes that he can be happier being his own dark lord, not beholden to Voldy.

Or maybe something completely opposite, he gets what he wants but lost what he needed. He's now Voldys man, but has noone, has no control. Something to that effect.

Hope this helps.

** A lot of rehashes ignore just how incredibly fucking difficult keeping the timeline preserved would actually be.

Aside from the fact that the time traveller is half a decade or more older than they were, they'll never remember everything and they can't be everywhere, so if they make a tiny change (eg. Harry stops to pick up Susan Bones' books and says something suspicious because he's an adult trying to pretend to be a child, so she contacts her aunt about him) that can spiral out massively. All it takes is one tiny stepping-on-a-butterfly mistake to change things.

Like, if nothing else, imagine how hard it would be not to treat the people around you like you do in the future? How often you'd have to resist the urge to reference something that hadn't happened yet, or make an old in-joke the other person hasn't heard yet?

So, yeah. If I was gonna write a time-travel canon-rehash, that's how I'd make it interesting. The action wouldn't be the rehashed events, it'd be the efforts the time-traveller goes to to make sure those events still happened.

**** Well, yes. That's kind of implicit in the idea of time-travel. Children time-travelling to adulthood is just... aging. :D

And a child in an adult's body isn't time travel, it's a midlife crisis. :)

** The previous comments already gave good advices, but another solution (that seems to be less popular than the one previously told) is to create a Time Traveler antagonist. The motivations of this antagonist don't really matter (a Death Eater who want Voldemort to win, a previous friend of Harry who think he is a worse threat than Voldemort . . .), the important thing is that this person has similar informations than Harry, and can also work into modifying the timeline (to his advantage) :

- Harry wants to expose Quirell at the start of the year? Quirell either fail to show up at the start of the year, or doesn't have Voldemort with him.
- Warning about the Basilisk? The Chamber is sealed by a passoword, or the Basilisk has been moved, or maybe even already killed.
- Try to exonerate Sirius? Impossible without Pettigrew, and Scabber has dissapeared/ been stolen right before the start of the year.

With this new scenario, Harry would have to identify his time traveling opponent, and keep trying to modify (or at least maintain) the timeline while blocking his enemy's attempt to do the same.

** For me, one of the most boring elements of time-travel fix-its is when the characters stick as close to the original timeline as possible and it's just a regurgitation of canon with kids acting like all knowing adults. If you know the events that are going to happen and when, it's a pretty boring read. If you really want to keep the major “bad” events the same, you could change things up by Harry bring in a different House and exploring his experience through the lens of a non-Gryffindor with different friends.

To create excitement and intrigue, I'd rather you do change things - like expose Quirrel early, or do something about the basilisk, or exonerate Sirius early as a jumping off point and then explore the ramifications of those actions and how it changes the events going forward. Then the intrigue and excitement is there because I don't know what's going to happen and now there's a unique story to read.

I personally hate time travel fix-its where they do things like leave Sirius in Azkaban to “preserve the timeline” - it's just cruel and too much of an “I'm the all-knowing time traveler so I get to make all the decisions in everyone's lives” attitude.

I would argue that what is the point of time traveling if you are going to get cold feet about disrupting the timeline ?

​

i make you right that if you foiled Voldemorts main resurrection plots then he would adapt and do something else and that's when Harry would probaly get unstuck because now he has changed so much he Has no idea what's coming

**** Exactly, what's the point of going back in time if you're not going to change anything? I'd rather read a unique storyline where things change and thus Voldemort's plans change accordingly so they can't predict what's coming because then I, the reader, can't predict what's coming either. Reading about them following the motions of canon up through Voldemort's resurrection just isn't very appealing for me, but I've read fics that do that. There's some intrigue in how the time traveler keeps or reveals their secrets, but that's not always enough to keep me interested.

** You make it so either nobody believes him (because bro you're 11 years old stfu) or you change the timeline- minor changes, such as Quirell isn't the DADA teacher, or he isn't Voldemort's host; Snape actually is a quintuple agent, and is actually helping Voldemort; Sirius, with his time in Azkaban, became crazy enough that he actually *does* want to kill Harry; etc.

If you tweak even just a few elements of canon, you could get a wonderful time travel story.

** Well I think part of it is sticking to the established laws of time travel in harry potter, which is that it all already happened before you went back because its a sort of loop I guess. So if it hasn't happened yet, then it wont happen at all, as thats kind of how its works. Maybe your way of making it interesting is by having one of the characters create a new form of time travel that works a different way then the time turners. They its experimental and the reader has to spend the story trying to understand how it works and the new laws of this form of time travel, while also trying to accomplish the goals that you listed above?

** Well maybe instead of Harry trying to fix things, we could have Harry trying NOT to fix things.

Imagine a grown up Harry, married with kids, a happy family, a successful career, money stability, and everything is going well... UNTIL it's not. Now some people can call him selfish but what if he just wanted his future not to change ? What if he changed something and his wife and kids disappeared ? This Harry (chief Auror etc... knows that time is dangerous) would try really hard to keep things the way they were ( maybe he'd chicken out and actually save Sirius, Remus, Tonks etc.. I don't know it depends on how you want to write it )

But keeping things the way they were is much more harder than trying to change them because :

After more than 30 years, he honestly doesn't remember all the details and every single little thing could make a difference (butterfly effect). If he unintentionally did something wrong and HE IS bound to because a 40 year old man isn't the same as an 11 kid, it could range from an overpowered thing to him not asking about something because he already knew it. Anyway too many things can happen.

So yeah if you want some intrigue but at the same time struggle to stray away from Canon this would be interesting. But to be honest you're bound to add some unexpected twist anyway.

** Things being changed as a butterfly affect, due to Harry or whoever going back in time, when they change the past.

Harry doesn't remember every single thing that happened at Hogwarts. It's very unrealistic to have the time traveler remember every specific thing that had happened.

How does he interact with the characters from the past? Does he become a different person, (changed name/changed look) or has he taken over the Harry Potter from the past?

If he's older, and ends up in a younger version of his past self, it'll be difficult for him to get to accept and know Hermione and Ron, he'll realize just how young they are, wanting to keep them safe for as long as possible, etc.

Does he tell anyone? If so, who? And how much does he share with people, if he does share anything with others?

How much does he try to change? Or does he try to ignore it? If he tries to ignore it, things should change anyway, just because he's there.

Things not always working out for Harry, just because he knows things. Again, the Butterfly Affect should be in play here, where unexpected changes happens because Harry time traveled.

** The very fact of going back and fixing everything should automatically create intrigue, as the only things any time-traveller would have would be knowledge of a future that no longer exists and whatever skills they had before taking the trip. Depending on when the trip back in time happens will help determine a lot of the story.

For example, you have Harry going back in time the moment Voldemort hits him with the AK in the forest (which is a setup I've seen before), compared to a 100 year old Harry purposefully going back in time. Both would have very different skill sets and 'future knowledge' they could apply.

Obviously the difficulty with doing this is it essentially means writing the story from scratch, which is probably why many time travel stories rely on the 'not changing too much to preserve future knowledge' trope so much.

** Fundamentally, you produce intrigue and excitement in a time-traveling story the same way you produce intrigue and excitement in any other kind of story: careful and judicious control of the author-to-reader flow of information and the management of stakes.

For some reason, time-travel fanfiction authors seem to nigh-unanimously forget that dramatic irony even exists, which is particularly egregious considering just how conducive time-travel is to creating dramatic irony (eg, in a Peggy Sue fic: choosing to be the time traveler a different character who won't be privy to a/some critical piece(s) of plot-relevant information, choosing a point in the story f/ which the time traveler travels back f/ where they weren't privy to a/some critical piece(s) of plot-relevant information, &c). Crucially, I think trying to produce dramatic irony can serve as a gateway to being more adept at choosing certain pieces of information to hide f/ the reader and characters for dramatic and plot-driving effect.

Managing stakes is comparatively simple: (1) no easy wins and (2) the more significant the obstacle, the more important it is for the crucial step that allows for defeating the obstacle to be entangled w/ a character's personal growth.

Of/c, the undergirding backdrop that affects all of this in a time-travel story is the choice of time-travel mechanics. Whatever set of mechanics you choose to use, make sure to comprehensively chart out to/from when, to/from where, and to/from which timelines^{⟨if you're using a set of mechanics that involves multiple timelines⟩} all people/objects/information move according to your set of time-travel mechanics. This should include any relevant emotions-based and/or esoteric mechanics---soft magic is no excuse for sloppy or inconsistent worldbuilding. If nothing else, don't use the basic Peggy Sue formula. Just don't do it. At best, it let's an alternate universe fic masquerade as being less divergent f/ canon than it actually is. The vast, vast majority of the time, all it does is let the protagonist repeat their life on easy mode.
