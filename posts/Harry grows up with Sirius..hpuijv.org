Am looking for a fanfic we're Harry is rased by Sirius and is the black and potter heir. I wouldn't mind if he knew that and used that for his benefit some times, but not in a weird way ( if you get it). Preferably no slash or Harry/Ginny or Harry/ Hermione.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** Note that there hasn't been any particular mention of Harry being an heir of anything beyond his parents' vault, so if the OP particularly wants him to be the Potter-Black heir, maybe this isn't the right story. But it does a really great job of showing Sirius raising Harry from age eight onwards. It's sweet to see Harry get at least a few years of actual childhood, and a parental figure who, for all his flaws, cares very much about Harry's wellbeing.

** There's a great series of fics, I think the author is MarauderLover7. They retell the whole series as if Sirius raises Harry. I'm on my phone so I can't confirm but I THINK the fic is called “Innocent”, a sequel called “Identity” (they go through pre-PS, up to POA at least, last time I checked. Excellent series, I almost prefer them to the actual series!)

  Ancient family magic was used to create a bond between Sirius Black and his godson Harry Potter. When Harry's pain and fear break through the magic surrounding Azkaban Sirius knows what he must do to help his young godson. Child Harry fic at beginning, father/son relationship. Abandoned

#+begin_quote
  Sirius had made a slew of different decisions that night he had arrived at Godric's Hollow. With Sirius' focus on Harry rather than revenge, a very different Boy-Who-Lived is going to make his return to the wizarding world at the age of 13. But the question is, why did Harry return so late? And will he still be the Hero the Wizarding World needs? Haphne! AU-ish, slightly mature!
