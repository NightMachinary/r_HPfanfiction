**** I second that. Imo, it's the best Voldemort in the fandom, bar none. I would also recommend linkffn(Renegade Cause). Voldemort here is closer to canon, but the author still owns the character in his own way.

And if you'll permit a self-plug, here's my fic: linkffn(Lesser Evils). Voldemort doesn't feature heavily, but I try to move him away from the common cartoon-villain tropes.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
