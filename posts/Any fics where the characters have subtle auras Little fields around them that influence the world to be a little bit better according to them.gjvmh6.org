I was reading In the Language of Flowers and the description of Petunias accidental magic,

"Petunia drips magic the way she drips anger. Sparingly. Subtly. Nothing overt or obnoxious. Nothing that attracts the stares of other children or the suspicion of adults. Just things that help her. Her dolls line back up after the football Lily was kicking about ruins their perfect symmetry. Her bed makes itself while she brushes her teeth meticulously. Tea that is slightly too hot or too cold settles to the perfect temperature. Magic maintains the realm of order she has built around herself."

made me want a fic where everyone just unconciously influences the world around them for comfort. Maybe Dumbledore makes colours more vibrant ect.


** I really, really like this idea.

Not exactly the same but in linkffn(12550081) a lot of witches/wizards have specific accidental magic. For instance Hermione always seemed to flip to the correct page in a book and she always seem to guess the right time. It's a pretty interesting AU world so give it a read if you like.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

** I actually have a HC that Felix Felicis works making this auras all encompassing (or at least much stronger) while connecting the person to the lines of fate in a way that they get a feeling telling them what is needed to reach their goal.
