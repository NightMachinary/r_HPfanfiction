e.g:

Malfoy: You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.

Harry: Feck off will ya I can tell who the gobshites are meself malfoy

or something like that

edit: ight im writing this... I'm australian so if anyone can get me in contact with an irishman/woman to help with the slang then please do... or if you are an irish person...


** I'm Irish and I can only imagine this would be written by an American who's never been to Ireland. Who i'm sure is lovely but I can absolutely guarantee that if it's like any other mention of Ireland in fanfiction Harry 100% joins the IRA at some point with absolutely no one having any issues or concerns about it nor any mention of why terrorism is bad.

**** Seriously if you ever come across it in a fic you'll know exactly what I mean. It's mad and universally terribly done. It's just better to steer clear because unless you're actually going to go into it in detail you're just going to fuck it up.

Like there's off-hand mentions to Seamus going home where his family are all involved with "the struggle" and everyone is just like "oh cool, it's early 90's England, obviously no one is going to comment on this open support of the group bombing us and burning people alive, good for you Seamus".

People wouldn't ignore that, Like people still sing No Surrender to the IRA at England football games 20 years post peace, it'd be like having American! Harry and him going to Ilvermorny and everyone laughing at the Muslim who's family are in ISIS making jokes about it..

Bonus points if he brings C4 back for some reason because obviously bombing random people is where his explosion spell thing comes from. You know, because it's quirky.

****** Lovely. They killed a journalist in Derry last year. Also is the site of one of the Proxy Bombings (they kidnapped peoples families and forced them to suicide bomb, often not knowing it would be suicide in the end).

It's a complex subject best left for history books not fanfiction.

****** To be fair that's entirely because he set a feather (?) on fire in the first book. Then the movies made it a thing for some reason. It's a bit of a weird extrapolation from one line but I guess it's an easy way of giving a personality without having to expand a character.

******* Yeah, they lean into it a weird amount and end up with an Irish high schooler whose thing is he loves alcohol and blows stuff up. It's a nuanced and delicate representation of Irish culture, for sure.

For me, it was only when much loved, BAFTA award winning actress Maggie Smith just tells "Mr Finnegan" to blow up a bridge that it hit proper "fuck me, what have they done" levels.

*** I've seen a great mention of Ireland in a fanfic... it was a single sentence in history class (with not-Binns teaching it) that was along the lines of "and now we're going to talk about why the 70s was such a fine time to be Irish." /endscene

My uncle did a 'grand tour' backpacking hippy trail thing in the late 60s and found himself in Derry. Why? Who the fuck knows, but somebody did take pity on his dumb ass and gave him some good advice: if anyone stops you and asks 'protestant or catholic' you answer 'Canadian' and then you fucking leave. Did he crash on couches of IRA members? Probably, he certainly thinks so. But he doesn't know for sure because you don't talk about that shit.

*** I have vague memories of a fic where harry decides to use guns and bombs and pays some former IRA members to train him and some others in how to fight. Which given that after Riddle takes over the government, he and his friends are basically insurgents at least somewhat makes since.

Really don't remember much of the particulars, though.
