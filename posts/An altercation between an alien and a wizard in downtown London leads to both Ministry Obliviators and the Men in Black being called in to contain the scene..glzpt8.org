One wonders what happens when two different groups that erase memories meet eachother.

***** I was a passive aggressive dick who kept skirting one of their most subjective rules.

Apparently, sending them a message saying,

#+begin_quote
  Thank you for your time, but I'm done
#+end_quote

was the last straw for them. When I went back the next day and apologized, they told me that they would not accept the apology, I'd been skirting the edges of the rules for too long, I was a piece of ****, and that I would either have to leave the subreddit forever, or be banned forever.

I asked to appeal a year later, and they said "Hell no."

********* Yeah. There are some corollaries to that rule, specific examples(e.g. no memes, recent events), but you don't have to transgress any of them in order to find yourself on the wrong side of the rule.

  Auror Ron Weasley and Agent J are on the case to stop two rampaging beasts. Unfortunately, problems arrive when they both try to implement the "wiping witness memories" part of their jobs. ONE SHOT

** I can see it now:

Agent J - Holup, /magic/ is real??!! Not just crazy alien technology?

Hermione - Wait, /aliens from outer space/ are real? They aren't just magical creatures?

There is so much fun to be had w/ your prompt...I only wish I could do it justice.
