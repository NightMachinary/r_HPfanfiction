You can make a case for OtWtG Harry being rather mature for his age, but he starts off as a kid and the character development is well-paced and highly believable. Inverarity is probably the best realistic kid writer in the fandom, though it might come at the cost of likeability, especially in AQ.

** I get where you are going with this request, but to be fair, one 11 year old may act much older or younger then another 11 year old based upon circumstances in their life and natural maturity level. This is true for any age. One 18 year old may act 10, while another may act 30, and they may have a near identical upbringing but just different personalities and maturity levels. Or they may have vastly different upbringings that affect who they are.

So "Acting their age" is subjective and not reality. But i understand you are looking for kids acting like kids, and I get that and actually am interested in it myself because sometimes you just need some fun relaxed kids will be kids storylines.
