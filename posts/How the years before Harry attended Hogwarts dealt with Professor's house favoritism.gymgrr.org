We all have noticed throughout the series how some professors favored certain houses. We've also seen how the end of year House Cup went throughout the series.

Prior to Harry starting at Hogwarts, Syltherin had won for several years. However, there didn't seem to be such a divide between the students until Harry's year started and Gryffindor kept winning the house cup at the last moment.

The older years seemed to not have much opposition with other houses for the house cup except when it came to Quidditch. So, house points were given more fairly prior to Harry's coming. Even Severus Snape wasn't taking points left and right, sure the students still found him rude, but never would talk back or insult their professor.

From what little the older students talk about how the school was before Harry came, I gather that the House Cup was more academic competition. Animosity between houses for the cup wasn't nearly so bad.

The professors that would give the most points were Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick, but Harry's first-year seems to be the first time (or rather the rarest time) that Headmaster Dumbledore gave points for the House Cup since becoming Headmaster. So, I feel like the older years didn't really feel or recognize much favoritism from professors until Harry's year started.


** I'm not sure they did deal with the favoritism, seeing as until Harry came to Hogwarts, Slytherin won the house cup every year since Snape became head of said house.

*** So there was favoritism in Slytherin house for sure, but do you think it was extreme before Harry arrived?

**** Well, yes. Harry was a catalyst for it getting /worse/ but it had been going on long enough for /Ron/ to be aware of it before he even started Hogwarts.
