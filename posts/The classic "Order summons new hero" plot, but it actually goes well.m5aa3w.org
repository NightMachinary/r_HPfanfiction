Like, we've all seen those stories where they summon basically indy!harry on steroids or something, but what if they actually accomplish their goal?

So their ritual proceeds, they array themselves around a chalk circle and wait until their hero stabilizes, but the hero doesn't behave like a teenager. Maybe they're an experienced auror, or already beat Voldemort in their world, so they help out - with the only condition being that any children are excluded from the war where ever possible.

From then, it would just be a story of adults dealing with the situation, without all the garbage kids have to go through in order for the plot to happen.

Voldemort is dead, the hero gets unsummoned and Dumbledore gives them a spell that will prevent any further unwanted summonings. The end.

--------------

Alternatively, the hero they summon works for an interdimensional agency created specifically for this purpose. Most high civilisations routinely travel between dimensions, so they know about it, but they also catch and reroute any attempts to basically randomly pull someone somewhere else by sending one of their agents instead.


** How about making Lily Potter, Vanquisher of the Dark Lord Voldemort in an alternate dimension, be the one summoned?

This Lily lost both her husband and son on that Halloween night, but she managed to destroy the body of the Dark Lord. In the following week, she saved the Longbottoms and killed two Lestranges in the process. Over the next decade, she, Sirius, Remus, and Severus led the effort in hunting down Voldemort's Horcruxes. Finally on Halloween 1991, she managed to track down and destroy the Diadem of Ravenclaw. Voldemort, still lingering as a wraith in Albanian forest, was permanently vanquished.

However, this victory came at a steep cost. Sirius, Remus, and Severus all died at various stages of this dangerous quest. Lily locked herself deep in the Department of the Mysteries, trying desperately to bring her family and friends back. Eventually, she settled on the concept of dimensional travel. For almost 5 solitary years, she worked fruitlessly trying to modify the Veil into a gateway to a world where Harry and her friends are still alive.

After Dumbledore explained the situation, this Lily became exceedingly enthusiastic...

Also, this world's Harry is not dead or incapacitated, this is Dumbledore's contingency plan after being mortally wounded by the Ring Horcrux.

*** Another option I'd like to see is the Bellatrix from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], the sequel to "Delenda Est", being summoned. This Bellatrix is quite a fun character, and will jump at the opportunity of exploiting a time travel to her fullest extent. She also ran her dimension's DoM for a long time and likely knows multiple ways of dealing with Horcruxes.

I prefer Sirius to be alive here and their banters would be gold.

** Linkao3(World in Pieces by Lomonaaeren) fits this. After Harry defeats Voldemort in canon, he gets summoned to another world where all the prior Harrys who've been summoned got killed by this world's much more dangerous Voldemort. Our Harry wins in the end and comes back to the canon world after.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** Thing is, all the dimensions run at different times, so the Mid-90s in Dumbledore's dimension is the early 40s in another, etc.

So, Dumbledore is very confused when Douglas MacArthur appears out of the summoning circle, M1 Garand in hand. General MacArthur is rather confused too, as he had just landed in the Philippines. However, after being briefed on his arrival and the situation the Magical UK is in, MacArthur agrees to help as long as Dumbledore figures out a way to send him home.

So basically, Douglas MacArthur & OOTP vs Voldemort & DEs.
