Ok folks i want this to be a little different than your same old "recommend a fic for me to read" post. I would like to see the best of the best but also why you think they are. It can be for best picture (best fic overall ) or more specific like best use of wards or best fight scene, best non canon pairing what ever you can think of. Just remember to tell us what award/awards you think the fic should win. Please try to link the fic or at least give us title and author so we can look it up.so lets get going and have some fun. The Emmy for.....goes too.....

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Ill even start us out. The Emmy for best comedy goes too [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy]] Why...just read it. The relationship between Sirius and Harry is more like two brothers than godfather/godson. I wont spoil too much but when they keep waking up with random women that are linked by some crazy (but funny as hell) reason i actually laughed out loud. Oh and Bella trying to get pregnant.... i dont want to spoil too much just go read it.
