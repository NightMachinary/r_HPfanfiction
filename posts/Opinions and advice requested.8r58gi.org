I was hoping for what the title says, particularly for my previous post, which you can find [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8qzdpm/the_incomplete_story_of_talash_academy/][here.]] I made the post late last night but, it seems not many people noticed it.


** So this is something I see a lot with people writing their first fanfic.

You have a wonderful, creative idea. I have no doubt it would be well written, intriguing, with bundles of research.

No one will read it.

People read fanfiction largely for the familiarity. Even starting with an OC is tough enough because people want to read about Harry or Draco or whoever. OCs out of Hogwarts or wizarding Britain? What you have there is original fiction, and it's not what people come to fanfic for. Some authors have managed it, but they usually established themselves first.

My advice? Cut the cord with JK Rowling's world. Develop your own magic system and world. Go original, you're nearly there.

** [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] already gave you great advice... one more thing:

#+begin_quote
  P.S. Sorry about any errors in the post, like words moving down a line, I copied this from windows notepad.
#+end_quote

This is not acceptable. You want me to read your fiction and give you advice? The least you could do is fix the formatting of the text. Two things:

1. It's borderline unreadable if there are no recognizable paragraphs

2. Why should I invest my time if you won't bother to invest yours?

A terrible first impression like this will make it impossible to judge your writing fairly.

** [[/u/Deathcrow]] is right. I hate to be harsh but it became way too frustrating for me to even finish what you wrote because the formatting was all whacky.
