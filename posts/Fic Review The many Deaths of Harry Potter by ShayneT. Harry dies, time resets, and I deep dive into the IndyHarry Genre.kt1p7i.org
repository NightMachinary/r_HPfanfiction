If you dislike long form reviews, just read the Premise section, then the TL;DR section at the bottom.

* Premise
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: premise
  :END:
We are looking at a darker AU rewrite for today's story -- in this case there are two points of divergence from canon:

1. Voldemort is pragmatic and shows no trace of holding the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall][Villain Ball]].

2. When Harry dies, he is pulled back to a point in his past and must relive his life over and over again.

Rather than Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow, which both revert the main characters back to a fixed point each time, TMDOHP works more like save points in a game, only we don't know what the save points are.

* Plot
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: plot
  :END:
The story begins when Harry is 9 and experiences death for the first time. During one of Dudley's “Harry Hunting” games, Harry escapes into a stranger's backyard and inadvertently stumbles across a Death Eater, who immediately disapparates, brings Harry to Quirrelmort and the latter slashes Harry's throat with a knife. Harry wakes up - understandably traumatised - to repeat the day and must adjust and change his decisions to stop himself from dying again.

Nonetheless he goes through several more deaths, each bringing him back to a different point in time. Desperate to avoid the horror of being killed, Harry's whole life quickly becomes about survival -- unsurprisingly he is sorted into Slytherin. He is an extremely proactive protagonist, using the extra time each death affords him as an opportunity to gain a skill he was lacking which might ensure his survival in the future.

In short, this is an Indy!Harry story.

* Writing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: writing
  :END:
The quality of the writing is good, even engaging, but not excellent. The story was pumped out in 4 months and shows signs of lack of review. There is a relatively innocuous smattering of typos and the author doesn't know how to spell Imperius, Pomfrey or Karkaroff, but most of this is easy to pass over as the story is pretty suspenseful and gripping.

There are some small internal inconsistencies, but I have far more trouble with certain inconsistencies with canon which aren't explained by the AU divergence points. Harry's first death at 9 not only relies on what feels like a very contrived set of coincidences, it also implies that the death eaters are still organised and serving Voldemort in person long before Voldemort summons them in 1994. In which case, why on earth is he still a parasite on Quirrel's head?

In some ways the story feels like it's supposed to be a cold bucket of realism water over the fluffy feelings of magic and wonder of canon. It amps up the consequences of things which felt silly in the books to make them more gruesome in the fic. It's also the first fic I've read in which the Durselys are kept in character but Harry prefers their company and hates Hogwarts.

* My Gripes with the Indy!Harry Genre
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: my-gripes-with-the-indyharry-genre
  :END:
I've been a bit at odds in the past with Independent Harry stories. I want to talk about some of the tropes which put me off and where I see shades of it in this story.

*Self Inserts*

It often feels like authors who write in this genre are saying, “If it had been /me/ instead of Harry Potter, /I/ would have been /SO/ much smarter than everyone else.”

I think what gets me about self inserts who are written this way is what they say about how the authors see themselves. In amongst the giant ego stroke is just so much /contempt/ for everyone else, and the result is a main character who is made big by making others small.

Harry in this story is constantly monologuing about how stupid, impractical and lazy wizards are; how frustrated he is that Dumbledore makes so many stupid choices, and how ridiculous it is that no one takes him seriously that his life is constantly in danger. There are points where the story threatens to turn Harry into a self-indulgent galaxy brain; the only rational person for miles around. Here's one line which stood out to me:

“Harry couldn't help but wonder if he was finally becoming interested in the opposite sex.

It would be a massive inconvenience if it was true. He was almost a year and a half more advanced mentally than physically. If this continued, he would eventually outpace all the girls his own age, and he doubted that older girls would be knocking at his door.”

*The Flowerpot Ship*

Fleur Delacour is practically a hallmark of these stories. The reason I call out Fleur particularly is because of the fandom prevalence of her being paired with Harry in this genre as a trophy and status symbol, due to her being French, older, extremely beautiful, and I'm sure the part-veela bit doesn't hurt. Since Harry had very little to do with her in canon, pairing them often feels like it is only done to bolster Harry's image by gifting him the hottest possible girl. In this fic, Fleur and Harry attend the Yule Ball together in one timeline and she is his first kiss.

*Independence as Physical Hyper Competence*

Most importantly, there is the independence of the independent Harry. Sounds like a weird thing to be annoyed by, doesn't it? Independence is inherently quite a good thing, and an arterial function of any coming-of-age story. But in this particular genre, Harry tends to become what I might term radically independent. Under the writer's loving hand Harry will be so great, the greatest there ever was. He will be the strongest, the smartest, the /specialest/.

His spellwork will be masterful and he will have unique abilities above and beyond what other characters could hope to achieve. He has no need to be protected or assisted in any way.

Of course, this means that other people become completely superfluous. Their knowledge and skills are worth dirt compared to Harry, so who needs something as trivial and inconvenient as teamwork? Harry doesn't need anyone to watch his back.

In the case of TMDOHP, Harry learns wandless and wordless magic, becomes an animagus, thinks of transfigurations using chemical compounds that no wizard has thought of doing before, then weaponsing them, and is a rather spectacular duelist. Not to mention his essential immortality due to his reset power, which is unique to him and no one else knows about for most of the story.

Everything Harry goes up against, he figures out himself and is never rescued, even as a child. And, despite choosing a premise in which Voldemort and the death eaters remain a brutal and palpable threat even after Voldermort's “death”, all the good guys seem to be under the impression that they're still in canon and act accordingly. Singularly frustrating for me was that the author really puts the ‘dumb' in Dumbledore in order to advance Harry's need to do everything alone, and it hurt to read.

*Independence as Emotional Detachment*

Indy!Harry is also /cool/. Just like he doesn't need the help of others, neither does he need the emotional support of friends, family, mentors or lovers. He's too independent for that -- he always has all the answers, and he's so confident that he never needs encouragement. Which is not to say that he won't have any relationships -- he will almost certainly at least have a girlfriend -- but they are always relationships revolving around him, with no need for him to put in any work or put their needs before his. They are adornments to the glorious being that is Indy!Harry -- nice to reinforce the character you're selling, but ultimately that character doesn't really need them around. This genre seems to have a cultural impression that a lack of emotional attachment is a sign of strength and badassery, when in reality we call those people sociopaths.

In TMDOHP, most of Harry's attempts at forming attachments are ripped away by the time skips caused by his deaths, and due to his deep suspicion of everyone around him he is not keen to make friends. Hermione, Neville and Sirius get some lip service at getting close to Harry, but there is always this sense that they are just a distraction, waiting in the wings for when Harry is done with more important things. Throughout the whole story, Harry has no arc. He gets his motivation to commence levelling up from the first chapter, and this is all he does until he finally levels up enough to defeat Voldemort (sorry, is that a spoiler?). All the demons are external and Harry has been on the right track since day 1. So....where is the conflict?

* Now the bit where I unpick my own judgementalism.
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: now-the-bit-where-i-unpick-my-own-judgementalism.
  :END:
So from my disparagement above, you're probably coming away with the impression that I hated this story.

I didn't.

I'd even say I enjoyed it. Whilst I wanted to lay out the things which I find frustrating about these tropes in both the macro and microcosm, I wouldn't at all be giving this story a fair shake if I left it at that. So let's now break down the ways in which I have not been fair on Indy!Harry and TMDOHP.

*Self inserts*

Such a controversial topic in fanfiction, but self inserts are not inherently bad writing. I am reminded of how Maya uses Draco as a mouthpiece for her personal jokes and opinions about Harry Potter, but it still carried the story incredibly well. Using characters as mouthpieces to critique the canon from within and point out what Harry could have done differently is something I'm actually quite fond of. I am far from a canon purist and don't believe in holding anything above critique. TMDOHP edged on a line for me because the level of critique it held at times felt disingenuous, like throwing out the baby with the bath water, but this is not to say he never raised any good points, and I would not say that Harry obnoxious or even unpleasant to read.

*The Flowerpot ship*

I want to take a moment to note that I don't actually have any issues with Harry/Fleur. I don't like to ship shame, and I'm open to being sold on pretty much anything if you can write it well enough.

Again being fair to TMDOHP, Harry does not seem to fetishise Fleur, mostly takes her to the Yule Ball for practical reasons, and in any case she isn't endgame. There is already a fairly minimal amount of attention paid to romantic subplots, but this story is actually a Harmony.

*Independence as Physical Hyper Competence*

In the past I've given a lot of grief to overpowered characters for being too self-indulgent, too unrealistic, or too pandering to a specific audience. But the truth is that none of that is good justification for /not/ writing overpowered characters -- sometimes I am simply not the target audience and that's fine. Fanfiction is not about realism, or appealing to the lowest common denominator, and there is now academic research indicating that it is in fact about self-indulgent fantasy.

Aside from the “different strokes for different folks” line of thinking, I've found myself coming around on highly competent protagonists lately, even made a list of four circumstances under which they can be incredibly enjoyable (Disclaimer: list is not exhaustive. Also even in light of this I'm not sorry for [[https://draquiareviews.wordpress.com/2020/02/03/robes-of-green-series-by-kz55/][the things I said about the Robes of Green series]].)

1. They can be a simpler way of enjoying a story -- the protagonist is always one step ahead of the antagonist so that we can watch the latter get their comeuppance. When the real world at times feels like it has no justice, this kind of story can give us great catharsis.

2. We don't see the story from the protagonist's POV -- when protagonists are always one step ahead of the game, the tension and build up is felt from the outside. We watch the events unfold from without and find out how they did it in retrospect. Sherlock does this extremely well.

3. Balance the power of the protagonist by having other powerful characters, including the antagonist. This is generally how the DCU and MCU work.

4. Have the protagonist be physically capable but require emotional support -- you can have characters who are incredibly powerful and rarely find themselves in any real danger, so the stakes of the story are emotional ones rather than physical.

What I will say in defence of TMDOHP is that for one, Harry's power ups feel /earned/, and there is real effort put into making it realistic. Having to essentially repeat school grades means Harry has already covered the material and his teachers think he's a prodigy because they don't realise it isn't his first rodeo. Harry also constantly seeks new teachers, and receives an enormous amount of outside help learning new skills over years. Even then, Harry makes mistakes, experiences lasting consequences and critiques himself.

The story does also provide an extremely powerful Voldemort as a counterpoint to Harry, and he feels like a menacing threat much moreso than he did in canon, which is a point in the story's favour.

*Independence as Emotional Detachment*

Whilst I largely stand by what I said about Harry's not having strong attachments being to the detriment of TMDOHP (and fics of this nature in general), I do give credit for the self-awareness of the author. More than once, Harry reflects back on how his deaths have damaged him emotionally; how hard he finds it to relax even for a moment; the distress he feels at never having been happy enough to conjure a patronus, and how he wishes he could trust and love and have family as easily as other people. Of course, we never really dive into these themes with any depth because the story is only about Harry's external battles, but the author has taken considerable care here to humanise Harry.

* TL;DR
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tldr
  :END:
TMDOHP is an immersive and gripping story which explores Dark but not Evil Indy!Harry, who can level up due to his ability to reset time when he dies. I used this story as a springboard to talk about the shortcomings of writing Indy!Harry stories; particularly how hyper competence can lead to a lack of story tension or ability to invest in the characters. I also critiqued my own biases with regards to this genre and acknowledge that these stories can be excellent and cathartic reads. In particular whilst TMDOHP uses certain tropes I've been given to dislike in fanfiction in the past, it consciously pulls itself away from completely succumbing to the usual traps of the genre, and is in fact a pretty decent story.

Overall I'd award it *7/10.*

Consider that kill them all Taylor kills an extreme amount of people and flaunts basically every law there is, saying that, canon Taylor(the main character of worm) is a villain and this one is a hero, that should say something to you about the original material.

Though canon Taylor does keep death to a minimum, but does other horribly fucked up shit to make up for it Haha

** I always enjoy these reviews, they're always a great read.

I am similar in the sense that while I think Indy!Harry stories typically do suffer from the points you laid out, I count this story among one of my favourites of the genre due to how it's written.

The competent Voldemort is absolutely a big factor for me, he's so rarely a threat in these types of stories, and I found Harry's final battle with him to be quite gripping.

*** Thank you kindly!

Believe it or not I cut a lot from this review for word count - I could have gone into a lot more detail. I was a fan of the blow by blow detail and creativity of the fight scenes, particularly how Harry was able to leverage the most out of a small skill set to get through momentous obstacles, like mastering the diffindo spell.

Competent Voldemort made the story way scarier, which was great, I just wish the starting premise had been better explained, because there was a lot that just didn't wrap up. We never find out who even caused at least 2 or 3 of Harry's deaths, where the threats were within Hogwarts, and what Voldemort was doing between Halloween of 1981 and the start of the story.

** I've read Many Deaths twice, and liked the way it used the reset to avoid giving Harry plot armour. Make a mistake and you /will/ get squished. Sometimes literally. And even if you get back up again - your friends might not.

Do you only review completed stories? If you're coming around on powerful protagonists, I think The Pureblood Pretense does a good job of justifying and balancing one. Harriett Potter grew up with both her parents, so is naturally much more familiar with magic, plus she has a good work ethic and is in a situation where socialising and relaxing is risky while learning extracurricular skills is essential. So, she develops a number of impressive skills, but constantly frustrates her friends by keeping secrets and not fully trusting or relying on them.

When she does have a power-up that's just because the story wrote it that way, like unusually large magical reserves, it causes as many problems as it solves, drawing attention that she can't afford and making her a target.

Perhaps most importantly, the story makes use of her abilities to enrich a new plot, rather than steamroll through canon. It delves into advanced potion brewing, and magical healing, in a really interesting way, but it doesn't just make things easy for her.
