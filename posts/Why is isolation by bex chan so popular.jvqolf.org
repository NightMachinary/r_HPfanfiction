***** Perhaps because I am male I don't see it's point.... But the dramione setup is too cliched coz Draco is always this hidden good boy who is bullied by his dad or 'Granger is too hot ,I must become the good guy to woo her'.

**** fair point but hopefully you are capable of rewording it so it's not criticism? Like "what do you like best about this ship? What appeals to you? I'm having trouble seeing the draw, can you explain it to me?"

**** Lol, as a Dramione fan, I didn't even think that you were criticising that fic. I thought you were just curious.

And many people have asked such question in that sub and no one badmouths anyone. They will put forth their reason for liking and understand why you don't but won't badmouth you.

***** Well I won't badmouth you here either. It's just that if I say something in subreddit based the perticular ship I dislike, then that would be kina awkward. Anyways could you elaborate on the finer points of this dramione so that maybe I can understand your pov. Thanks

****** That's, that's exactly my point. You are genuinely curious and you won't be satisfied unless you see both sides of the story. Why it's not liked as well as why it's liked. I'm still new to Dramione and I like isolation but not that much. That's why instead of telling you my views, I suggested that sub.

I agree that it might seem awkward if you phrase Harmony part (which I didn't see at first) but the rest of the question is genuine and many people will happily answer. In fact you can search this in that sub, there are definitely some posts on it already.

As for me liking Dramione (in general, not isolation in particular), is because I'm a suker for enemies to friends trope. From my POV, draco wasn't evil but rather misguided. As a child, he followed through his parents opinion for which we can't fault him (not talking about whether he was beaten into it or crucio'd etc but rather he grew up with such mentality running in the family and among others who he was in contact with). It doesn't mean that we can forget his past deeds but rather that there is some room for forgiveness. And redemption arc is almost everyone's favourite. You can clearly see Rowling trying that redemption arc on him when he is mature enough to question his attitude. He is still not rebelling outright but the dumbledore death scene and afterwards, he is emotionally wrecked. So what's better than a redemption arc where he apologizes and befriends the one he bullied on most.

Thats how Dramione started for me but with each different story, it keeps changing somewhat. Since Canon gave way for certain possibilities, EWE fics became top hits. Then why to stop there, so everyone started experimenting Dramione in earlier books too and the results are some exquisite reads for Dramione shippers.

I love Dramione and harmony both. I can totally see the latter happening while the former is a guilty pleasure😁.

******* Maybe coz I have had too many guilty pleasures my conscience does not allow me to indulge in this one. Thanks for elaborating. Although as far as I have seen quite a lot of shallow plots in dramione. Two last things; harry potter is written in a 3rd person perspective revolving around Harry. It does not go into the intricate feelings of others. Draco on the other hand might be a coward too. He might not have stopped from killing Dumbledore cuz he felt a chance at redemption, but because he was afraid to do so. Misguidance can also be taken to a certain level. He obsessively found ways to torment the protagonist.

******** Huh, interesting take on that matter. See I saw one side of that coin, you showed me another. Even though, I still lean on my side while I accept your opinion too.

In my opinion, the whole of fanfiction has 60% shitty works, 20% good works and 10% excellent works (give or take 5% each). So I'm constantly on lookout for those 10% cuz even among them I might not like all (well prepared but not my cup of tea). My first filter is >100k words, so that's that.

As for Draco's tormenting, I totally agree that it was obsession and much more than just the ways of his family excuse I gave earlier. He was a rich snobby brat who believed in being superior and had daddy's money to help himself out. I won't say that he should be forgiven for that freely but if he earns them and doesn't repeat them, it's a fair deal. Nothing he did is irreparable and outright evil (as far as I know but I might be wrong). And during dumbledore death, he was definitely afraid and you may call it cowardice. But what were his options? Parents hosting the dark Lord, the same guy who crucios for fun (pretty sure it ain't fanon) has ordered him to do a sure fail mission (if dumbledore hadn't planned to die due to the withering curse, draco won't have succeeded ever). So what's draco supposed to do?

And of course the most important part of him refusing to identify Potter, that wasn't cowardice... Not at all. If he had identified, there was no way they were going to get out (no one knew about dobby at that time). It takes guts to lie in such times. Although he did watch them getting tortured so yeah cowardice there but I still think he did what he did out of survival instinct and some goodness in his heart.

That I believe is the Slytherin Sense of Self-preservation. He was being treated like a house elf by that time by voldy. Imagine the pureblood prince being a slave. I was like a get out jail for him to help Harry. Had he helped in the final battle. No, coz all he wanted was to get out of voldy s clutch. Had he been good he would have had so many chances to reform before the death of Dumbledore. But what he looked for was power. He fundamentally believed in pureblood supremacy. I see your side, but the facts are muchore inclined towards mine

********** There is a big difference between 'facts' and 'interpretation', historians have argued a lot on that. Facts are absolute but they mean absolutely nothing while interpretation is the detail that actually matters but is of course highly dependent on the interpreter.

So I interpret it as his non-cowardice. All he had to do was say that it's Potter, then voldemort would have won (he was basically looking for Potter only) and draco would have been free and respected in the new regime. Yes he was treated like servant in his own house but self preservation should have made him identify Potter and elevate status rather than lie and be questioned later. Lying was not a good option for his self preservation, as the trio would not have been freed even if he said 'I'm sure its not potter'. But I think he lied because he saw them as his classmates and didn't want to be directly responsible for their death. Or wanted to help the light side in some indirect way dunno. But these are just my interpretation which of course may be biased

*********** Well I don't believe that voldemort would allow them to go free. Also you see that he did not say it's potter but he lived. So he probably did it looking at the scenario. I wouldn't go as far as to say that he can't be good, but I do belive that a world without voldemort would be better for the Malfoys too. Imagine yourself in that circumstance. Had he said yes the hope for the light might have been lost. Malfoys were only kept alive for their influence. In a world where voldemort rules is where ONLY he has power. He is too selfish to share. So tell me, would a king rather live as a slave or die? Of course the metaphor is not completely accurate but it gets the point across. I personally still do believe what I present. Thanks for discussing this with me. It has been rather fun
