:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a Daphne/Harry fic and during one summer Harry and the Greengrasses and whoever Harry's guardians are (I think Sirius) go to a dueling tournament on the continent (France maybe?) and nobody knows Harry will be competing until he sneaks away and his duel starts at the end of the last duel his opponent hits him with an AK. That's all I remember if anyone knows what fic this is I'd love to give it a read again!


** I feel like I've read this fic. Give me a minute to have a look through and see if I can find it.

**** Unfortunately I've been unable to pin down exactly which fic this is. I feel like it's part of a series but I can't find it and am not super good at knowing how best to look.

****** Which have you looked at? Maybe if we compare fics you've read with ones I have we could narrow it down?

******* I'm starting to feel like I just confused it with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12246163/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lightning-Lord]] Chapter 14 is almost exactly what I was thinking only no AK. I'm just looking through my favorites but I think I might've read it before I made an account.
