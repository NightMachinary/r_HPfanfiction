Any fics that focus on organized Crime group(s) in the Wizarding World, maybe magical branches of Yakuza, Sicilian Mafia, Triads or South American Cartels. Or it could be about magical organisation that strictly deals with the underworld, outlaws and crime.


** With all of the times regulations on various objects, like magical creatures and enchanted Muggle artifacts, are mentioned, the ease with which magic can be used for transportation/concealment/memory alteration, and the blatant corruption in the Ministry, by all rights there ought to be a roaring black market and rampant smuggling. There should absolute be magical organized crime syndicates. Unfortunately, it seems to be a perpetually-neglected area for bad guys, in favor of Death Eaters, Death Eater-knockoffs, or the occassional Muggles vs Wizards fic.

Business by esama is one of the few I've seen that deal with organised crime and is written very well.

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

** Wizard Kingpin by Odin999 is a good one.

It's in progress but definitely has organized crime as the forefront (if you couldn't tell by the name).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10507423/1/Wizard-Kingpin]]

Vahan: Possession is Nine Tenths by TheCauldron is another good one.

Sadly, it hasn't updated in a year but it's a hell of a ride.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11869527/1/Vahan-Possession-is-Nine-Tenths]]

Both are very dark but I imagine that's what you're looking for considering the post.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
