** Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay fulfills exactly /half/ of your request. No harems because, well, he's a freaking /dragon/ going to a school that decidedly doesn't have any eligible dragonettes.

It's the only "Harry = dragon" fanfic I've ever found that's any good, and it's an unabashed "for the lulz" fic.

I'm not sure if any fanfics even /exist/ where a dragon-Harry has a harem. There's /plenty/ of fics where Human Harry has a harem (although Poe's Law is, if anything, an understatement for those - 99.99999% of those fics are crap), and a few fics where Harry's a dragon (again, most of which are bad), but I don't know of any that combine the two...\\
And if one exists, I'm not sure if I'd inflict it on a sane person to read.

*** It has to be added that Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay has the best Dumbledore I've ever encountered in fanfic.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

**** Do any of those exist? Harry as a dragon is very rare already, and harem fics, while fairly common, are far rarer than single relationships.
