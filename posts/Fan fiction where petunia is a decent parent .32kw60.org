It seems to me that harry would have had a very different upbringing and character if petunia was a decent human being . Especially if she married someone other than Vernon Dursley. I'm surprised at how few fics I have seen with this scenario since its an easy au to make. Does anyone know of any fics like that aside from HpMoR

  JKR portrays Harry as completely unaffected by the Avada Kedavra cast at him. But how would things have gone if it had been different?

*** I read that one after a suggestion in another thread a couple weeks back. Really good read, and pretty short for how deep it resonated.

Petunia still dislikes Harry and what he represents, but she accepts that it is Dumbledore's fault she's saddled with him, not the child who had no part in the decision, and places the blame where it belongs.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3615871/1/Two-Sides-of-the-Same-Coin]] Description:Petunia & Harry become a team, and Harry finds the wizarding world much earlier than anyone suspects. He hides his Slytherin self under the guise of a naive Gryffindor. He also hides the wizard friendships he made years before Hogwarts. AU

She's not exactly a good parent, but she does help Harry, and it isn't a bad story.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?
#+end_quote

Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).

Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

In this one Harry goes back in time. Well sort of. Lily helps Harry to go back to his baby self. In this one it is explained that the abuse was caused by dumbledore putting a spell on them. Just read the first chapter or two to get a good feel it's a really good fic.
