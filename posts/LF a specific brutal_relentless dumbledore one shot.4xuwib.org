A while back I read a fanfiction where Dumbledore, during one of Voldemort's reigns of terror, went totally off the wall and hunted down all the Death Eaters, rather than allow them to continue hurting innocents.

I believe the fic was either a one shot or only a few short chapters. I can't remember too many details, but I believe he kills Voldemort at the end. I vaguely remember Dumbledore saying that he will accept any punishment for his actions after his work is done, though I may be getting mixed up with another work.

If you know of any similar fics, I'd love to give them a read too.

Thanks!

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon).

sounds like your answer, sadly :/

It's much more common for fics to just stop than for the author to post a final chapter saying 'it's abandoned, here's what I was going for before I dropped it'.
