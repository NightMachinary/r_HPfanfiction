  "Of course, m'lord! All ya had to do was just ask nicely!" Bellatrix chirped.

If you want this fic to be taken seriously, your dialogue needs serious work. Everyone is speaking in the same voice (your own). It's jarring to say the least.

Go back to the books. Examine and try to mimic the different ways different characters speak. Ron is always informal. Hermione is rather proper. Dumbledore is lofty and learned. Sirius is friendly. Voldemort is silky and harsh. Bellatrix is erratic and excited.

  Bellatrix and Voldemort had an illegitimate son
#+end_quote

Stopped reading right there (not really)

Just the idea of Voldemort fathering a son is cringe-inducing

I'm not saying you couldn't make something good about it if you worked it up

reading the first preface you have the dialog betwen Bella and Regulus like this

Bella: Take care of Voldemort's baby\\
Regulus: Lol nope he is evil\\
Bella: please\\
Regulus: ok but just this time

I don't think Regulus should so easily accept the anticrhist that easily
