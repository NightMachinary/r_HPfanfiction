I realized not a long ago the power of smut and how exciting could fanfictions be, but I find a lot of vulgar/unpleasant/quickly written fics and it spoils everything. *What I'd like ideally would be a slow-burn romance, well-written (details about how characters feel, how they perceive each other, etc etc, not only sex), and-but not mandatory- deeply sexy stuff* (I mean, things happening, not just kissing).

it doesn't have to be canon-compliant but at least realistic: if it is a Bella/rémus (which i'm all for x) for example, I want to see it happen because of some context that would explain it, not just 'hey, you're in the forest in front me, I feel horny and fed up about fighting, want some fuck'?.

Any pairing will go, not being difficult here (even the age discrepancy is not a problem, eyeing Rose/Drago..). Not fascinated by smut happening between 2 guys, but if it's really well-written why not?

Gimme your best shots! Thank you so much!

Edit: for the minor sexualization, I meant Drago/Rose when Rose isn't a minor anymore ofc

** Femslash recommendations, because we need more!

Hermione/Luna in linkffn(3973687) The plot is quite nice, the struggles are believable, and the resolution is...hot.

Fleur/Hermione in linkffn(7559031) This is simply brilliant. Good plot, great characterisations, quality goodness all round.

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

** One of my favourites but yes, difficult to find. I read a lot of slash, sadly, but here's what I have (all Drarry):

linkffn(3378356)

linkao3(you, a violent desire by alpha_exodus)

linkao3(Sanguis Vita Est)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16138103]])

linkao3(Ship of Theseus)

The last two aren't smut, but deep pining and falling in love with the other person. They're categorized as angst with a happy ending on ao3 (that's how I found them) and I'll have to say that, yes, it's a slow-burn romance. Last note, Sanguis Vita Est has pacing issues with the beginning, but I included it because it was one of the few stories that fit within this category. I hope that doesn't throw you off too much. Please let me know :D

  Whilst Voldemort's prisoner, Draco is made a vampire and forced to take Harry as his first meal. With Draco managing to resist the temptation to drain him, just barely, in a moment of blind rage at what he has been forced to become, he aids Harry in the destruction of Voldemort. But even with that threat vanquished, once back at Hogwarts, Draco finds himself disturbingly addicted to Harry's blood. And amongst all this, a dark shadow looms ominously on the outline of the forest, watching them closely. A vampire!Draco story and also an ‘Eighth year' story.

** This one hasn't exactly reached smut yet (they've just made out a couple of times so far), but it's a slow burn and it's well-written. The identifiers get out of hand, like a lot of fics, but it's good enough for me to soak into the story despite it and that never happens for me.

  Appetence-- defined as an attraction, a natural affinity, or an instinctive desire. A cosmic sort of bond that robs one of coherency and clouds the mind until all thought is consumed by that singular point of infatuation.When Voldemort divines what Harri Potter truly means to him all those years ago in the graveyard, held fast upon the bones of his father, a festering sort of obsession begins. His horcrux, a part of his soul, crafted from his marrow, magic, and might-- his very own damning appetence. He knows what has been kept from him, what rightfully belongs at his side, and he wants her back.
