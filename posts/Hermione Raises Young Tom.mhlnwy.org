:END:
Does anyone know the fanfic where Hermione travels back to the past to kill Tom Riddle as a baby and on the first night at the orphanage she chokes Tom but then feels bad because he was innocent. She ends up working at Wools Orphanage for a little bit and then adopting Tom later on.


** “In the Bleak Midwinter” by TheLoud linkao3(15430560), but it seems it kind of lost plot in the middle of the stream (last updated: 2020-02-23).

*** I've read that one and it's not it. The one I'm looking for has young Tom falling in love with Hermione as he grows older. Hermione and Aberforth end up raising Tom together.

***** It was very weird, to say the least. He pursued her at a young age, but she didn't really reciprocate until his 6th year maybe? I think she also stopped aging?

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Yes! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26770123/chapters/65302960][The Greatest Victory]]. I hope it's not abandoned---the author and I talked a bit when we were both publishing stories at the same time, and I haven't heard from them since ~December. I really like that fic!
