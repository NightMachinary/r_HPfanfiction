First thing I'm looking for is a fic I read a while back that I can't find now. The thing I remember about it is at one point Harry crashes a wedding with Snape dressed in a purple suit with an autotune voice, the Twins in gold suits, Moody looking like Oxzy Osbourne, and Kingsley following up very similarly. I was dying of laughter at that point. The other thing I'm looking for is just general powerful Harry time travel/humor fic where he becomes friends with Snape. I dunno why, but Snape and Harry bro-ing it down is just freaking awesome! Love you guys in advance for the help <3


** Not what you're looking for, but check out Inquisitor Carrow series for a funny Snape and Harry relationship.
