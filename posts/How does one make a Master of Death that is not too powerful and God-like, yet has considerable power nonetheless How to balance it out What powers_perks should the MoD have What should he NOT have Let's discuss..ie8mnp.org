But that doesn't have to keep a fic from being compelling. You just have to have an antagonist that's even more OP. There's a quote out there somewhere that's “if you give Luke a lightsaber, you have to give the empire the Death Star.” Give Harry whatever powers you want, just be able to one-up it for the bad guys

I really don't like this idea... at least in fanfics.

I enjoy the idea of a out of context power/problem coming in and messing with stuff, and going 'surprise, Voldemort has summoned demons and is now just a puppet! to \o/ /real evil/ \o/'... and similar buffs to the opposing force just to keep the power level the same(ish) defeats the reason I would want to read about some new twist.

--------------

as for MoD!Harry, imo there are a few versions you can use:

- *Actual MoD* - Death (and probably) other conceptualized-Entities need/want Avatars or similar... Harry is one, and can't die or whatever else Author wants to tack on.

  - *Early Life* - Maybe Harry pops back up after dying, maybe he has aptitude for Necromancy... The Hallows follow Harry around.
  - *Effects start showing* - Harry does not age; people notice... his friends grow old... Harry becomes a vagabond.
  - *Earth Has Died* - Harry is /old/, he is Ē̸̼̖̳͂̂̐l̷͖̜͇̏͌͐̒d̶͕̤̲͔̆̉̕r̶̹͕̒̃̀͘î̷̹͖͍͂̽͜͠ṱ̸͊͒c̴͙̠͈͠h̵̫̙̬̒̌, he has seen Cilization die... he is Apathetic.

- *Whipping-boy MoD* - Death is an asshole, it was all a trap to get a new toy to play around with.

- *Damaged Goods* - Dying leaves a stain, Harry was never the same.

- *Clueless Teenager* - After Martyr-death transference MoD; crossover or Peggy Sue, Harry is still canon!Harry and has almost nothing special except default HP-magic.

- *Old Man Harry*

  - *Family Man* - Harry achieved his dream of normalcy... he has coasted on his fame and hasn't really achieved anything special.
  - *Veteran* - Harry is /competent/, he lived a long life constantly living through crazy stuff...
  - *Knowledgeable* - For some reason Harry has learnt a lot, be it Hermione or His work or simply his crazy adventures.

- *Nifty Trinkets* - The Deathly Hallows were created by the Prevell Brothers; sure they are cool...but still "just" magic.

- *Just a title* - It does /nothing/, except maybe some ambitious idiot will hunt you down to claim the Death Stick

- *Might have forgotten some*

--------------

And many of those I find can be easily twisted to almost any power level... Heck if you throw MoD!Harry into a crossover you can strip him of his magic and hand-wave it with 'that magic system does not exist in this universe'

**** The lightsaber/death star thing is so stupid because it assumes that you will just tell the same story again. The real conflict can very well be the aftermath with billions of imperial loyalists, and even if you give luke a Death Star, that would do very little to win over people to the Rebellion side of things unless you want them to become the empire come again with a new logo. Or you give Luke the Death Star and yet the story is about his inner demons.

**** I agree totally that the villains don't necessarily have to be buffed to compensate for a buffed hero, though it's partly a question of /how much/ the hero's been buffed and partly one of what kind of story you want to tell. For pretty much anything but a fix-it/power-trip story, the antagonists have to have an edge over the protagonists in order for there to be narrative tension; a victory doesn't feel earned if it comes easily, after all. Thing is, no matter what the prophecy says, Harry's starting at such a massive disadvantage vs. Voldemort that many upgraded Harrys are still fighting uphill. Events go so badly for Team Good in canon that there's a lot of room to make them better without hitting the point of "too easy".

Now, that's not to say that an upgraded hero can't lead to a buffed villain: A stronger hero could lead the villain to step up their game in some way - training harder, learning new tricks, changing strategies, or using nastier stuff they had in reserve and never felt the need for in canon. They will almost certainly at least adjust their methods to account for the hero's capabilities. If there are crossover elements or the like empowering the hero, the villain will almost certainly at least want and try to acquire such power for themselves as well.

To continue with the lightsaber example, Harry getting a lightsaber and Force training would prompt Voldemort to explore the Force as well. If Riddle himself wasn't Force-sensitive, he could do something like possessing a Force-user or finding an old Sith mask or even getting some of those lizards that suppress the Force nearby to at least deny others access to a power he can't have. Having him immediately become Palpatine-level powerful and skilled in the Dark Side would be ridiculous overkill, however, at least in my opinion: When I (and I presume a lot of other people) read a crossover, we're looking for the crossover to make things /better/ for Team Good, not worse. I'm sure some people would love a dark crossover where the outside elements make things way worse and almost everybody dies horribly, but my sense is that they're not in the majority.

EDIT: Also - and to me at least this is non-negotiable - any buffs the villain gets should happen as a natural consequence of the events of the story/crossover. If nothing is different from canon for the villain, then their actions should not differ from what they did in canon. SO MANY fics ignore this and it drives me insane when things diverge from canon events without any reason to do so, just as much as railroading the plot through the stations of canon when it /should/ diverge.

** Ooh ok now you've got me thinking!

Each Death Hallow gives him a power over death. Combined, they enhance one another.

Powers:

1. The wand allows him to him kill anyone he wants effortlessly.

2. The stone allows him to commune with the dead indefinitely.

3. The cloak keeps himself alive forever.

But he's only MoD if he has all three deathly hallows on his person at the same time.

Pros:

1. He can wipe out entire armies in seconds if he wanted to.

2. He has the vast knowledge of every human being who ever died at his disposal, and can also talk to dead loved ones.

3. Immortality.

Weaknesses:

1. He can only kill if he knows his target since you can't murder someone you're unaware of.

2. He cannot bring back someone in the flesh since he wouldn't have a body to use.

3. He cannot keep someone else alive, seeing as how the cloak is what protects him, and only works for the one wearing it.

4. He ages as normal, so a couple few hundreds years down the road and he'll be painfully withering away.

5. Losing any single hallow means he is left significantly weaker and without their respective power. The remaining hallows will be rendered back to their lone abilities (wand is just powerful, stone is good for alchemy, cloak makes you invisible).

6. After losing one or more hallows he'll die quickly if he's past his normal life expectancy. Maybe even crumble into dust depending on how old he was.

I think this works because it doesn't give him any god like wisdom or power. None of that undead army raising, dimension hopping, time travelling, omnipotent nonsense I've seen before. Being MoD doesn't make him any more skilled as a wizard other than the pros listed above.

He's killable, basically.

** Maybe you could have Harry slowly discovering the full extent of his abilities. He has the title of Master of Death but he clearly isn't a 'master' yet. You could start with the three artifacts always appearing on Harry's bedside table even if he always throws the stone away and puts the Elder Wand back in Dumbledore's tomb until he gets that there's no escaping them. He will have to discover the powers on his own since no avatar or persona of Death ever comes to visit him to explain things.

** MOD is always too literal hence why its OP. Rowling is a great writer due to that, the artifacts are powerful, but their powers are subtle.

The wand is capable of great feats, like repairing a wand... but it requires a great wizard.

The robe is an invisibility cloak that hides its wearer from the most dire of threats, but does little beyond that.

The ring... it does not bring people back to life. Merely apparitions.

Honestly, great items for a detective or an auror. But hardly “game breaking”. MOD should really be just used as an informal title rather than the ridiculous OP shit most dic writers dreams up.

*** It's pretty clear in canon that each of the hallows only works properly for their true owner. The Elder Wand is obvious, but Dumbledore also says (paraphrasing) "the cloak would never have worked for me as it does for you, its rightful owner". For my money, the most sensible (and most interesting) take is that the Master of Death is just the rightful owner of all three hallows. There's plenty there for a story, without any need for some magical set bonus.

I think the most interesting of the hallows is the stone, since it's given the least explanation in canon. I'd love to see a story where Harry uses the stone to help ghosts and spirits find peace. Not out of any cosmic duty, but just because it's the kind of thing Harry would do.

To me, the MoD was little more than a clever PR act by the three brothers, just like the origin story of the Hallows. They were simply clever inventors who spun a little tale to become a legend.

(Also, in my opinion the stone is a scam which projects what the user wants to see, not an actual call to the afterlife).

** IMO, I think it's not about the OPness that is the problem but how you handle the characters that can make or break the story. How do Harry's power adds up to his opponent? Does MOD power gives literal power of Death r empowered necromancer backed up by Death? Both are OP in their own level; at universe(s) and world level.

And what about character interaction? Does Harry have anyone to interact for him to grow as a person? Or what genre's is the fic set in? Is it adventure/action where there'll be many action scenes or a more laid-back slice-of-life stuff where there can be comedy scenes or some fluff. All that can give laid out the foundation for the fic to progress.

My take ia that if you want to write a OP character; write it, but don't make it a one trick pony where the only focus is how OP Harry is. Make it so that OP Harry is only one facet of the story, maybe add some weakness or perceived weakness like deaden emotion or sensation.

In conclusion, it's all on a person preference and there are no right or wrong OPness level. In the end of the day, you must plan out at least a rough plan so there'll be no unforseen avoidable hiatus.

** Just giving him the power of the 3 Hallows (without any additional perk) could give you a very powerfull, yet not invincible wizard :

- The wand would make him stronger than most, but unable to take on armies or a monster like Dumbledore or Voldemort
- The stone would permit him to communicate with the soul of the deads, very usefull in an mystery story where the MC try to investigate something
- The cloak would make him invisble, infiltration and surveillance.

I'm not a big fan of the Immortal trope, but I always liked how the 3rd brother chose the day of his death and could "greet Death as an old friend". Maybe the MoD, while he can be killed, while only die of old age when he chose to do it.

With that, you could have a 500 years old wizard (let's say a Potter) who reunited the Hallows and became the MoD. He could have stuck around Earth, doing something until he found a new MoD and then he could finally chose to die after he trained him. You would need to explain why he kept his power despite dropping the Hallows but maybe the MoD keep the immortality even after leaving (or losing) the hallows, as long as there is not another MoD to take his place.

No real power boosts, beyond that which is granted by the Elder Wand, just the capacity to stay alive and learn as much magic as is possible to learn. Maybe using the Resurrection Stone without the madness, to learn from ancient masters of their craft? This all assumes that the measure of a wizard is their knowledge of magic and skill in casting

Power wise, he has the three deathly hallows, maybe he can summon them at will, beyond that, maybe he could theoretically bind the souls of the dead to corpses creating superior undead and increase the magical potency when it comes to killing.

Wouldn't need to be completely broken unless paired with a Harry that were very competent already.
