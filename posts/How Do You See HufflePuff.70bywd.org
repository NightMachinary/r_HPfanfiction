** Personally I've always viewed Hufflepuff as the house of Hardwork, Loyalty and Fairness all traits that are attributed to the Badger. Look into what the totem animals represent for further insight.

**** I think the "hardwork" trait for Hufflepuff means that they see working hard as a good in itself. You're not working hard as a means of acquiring knowledge. Neither are you working hard in order to achieve some ambition--becoming rich, the president, etc. Rather, you're working hard because it is a virtuous thing to do, or because you have a duty to society to do your best, or something along those lines.

** Susan Bones ends up being a cheap plot device in 95 out of 100 cases. Mostly she is used to get Harry in contact with her aunt to do some stupid "politics" that would never work. She is almost never an actual character.

More importantly Harry would meet Tonks during his first/her last year. Since they are related (distantly according to Pottermore/ 3rd or 4th cousins according to fanon) it would give him some sort of family as well as someone who could actually provide him some information about the magical world.

Instead of Bones I would prefer to see stories in which Harry interacts with the average Hufflepuff background characters like Justin FF, Megan Jones or some other students that do not have parents in influential positions but are simple store clerks, employees or merchants. That would be a pleasant change from all the "Lord Potter, Black Windsor, Plantagenet" stories.

**** But the head can't just say "hold my beer, I'm going in". There are rules and procedures to follow. Usually Amelia just bangs in and shittalks Dumbledore without even bothering about a warrant. Then Dumbledore says something about the prophecy and she's like "I don't like it, Dumbledore. I don't trust you or your judgement. If you step one toe over the line I'll throw you into prison myself. Anyways, see ya later."

Dumbledore, as Chief Warlock (insert more titles here) could simply fire her and make up some false evidence to cover his actions. Yes she has power but nothing compared to Dumbledore. In a political contest she would lose badly.

**** There's Old friends, new friends which starts with a similar premise (although Tonks is in her fifth year IIRC) but that story has an eventual romance plot which is poorly done, everything beyond PoA is a horrible mess.

Some time ago I got fed up with the lack of a decent Harry&Tonks sibling dynamic (with her as adopted big sister instead of an eventual love interest) that I started writing my own.

** Hufflepuff is the house of inclusion and participation. Everyone contributes. Members learn to Do Their Part. The worst crime is selfishness. They see Ravenclaws as loners, Slytherins as takers and Gryffindors as glory-hogs... and they're right.

** Honestly, if the Hat made decisions based on what sort of influence a House might have on someone, I don't think it would ever have put Snape in Slytherin. Snape was always a bit of a lost cause, but he was virtually deprived of all chances when the Hat shouted out 'Slytherin.' It's just a bad place for a kid like him to be. Same thing with Tom. If the Hat made that sort of decisions, I don't think it would have put a bunch of like-minded and close-minded kids into Slytherin like it did in canon at all. That House just seems so toxic prior to the war.

Honestly I just think the Hat was designed by the Founders to perform a certain function, and it did that, according to what the Founders thought about human nature. Which is probably also why Dumbledore said he thought they Sort too early. After all, in the old days, the theory was mostly that character was predetermined. Now, with the evolution of psychology, we have a more fluid view of ourselves. The Hat didn't Sort based on potentials, or not mostly based on potentials (since it did mention a possibility of greatness to Harry), it Sorted according to what it saw most in the child at the moment of their Sorting.

And out of all the alternate-Sorting stories, I've always thought that Harry being put in Hufflepuff was the most implausible, unless there was some radical (and I do mean /radical/) change in his upbringing prior to his arrival at Hogwarts. When the Sorting Hat talked to Harry, it mentioned courage, cleverness ("not a bad mind"), talent, a a thirst to prove himself. It didn't mention a single quality pertaining to what Hufflepuff was described as in canon (loyalty, hard-work, honesty etc.) And it was right. Eleven-year-old Harry had very few Hufflepuff qualities - he wasn't loyal because he hadn't had anyone to be loyal to up to this point (only a budding loyalty towards Hagrid), he isn't very hard-working (seeing as he took Ron's example as an excuse to not do a lot of work very often - I won't go into the psychological aspect of this, though I do think the Dursleys are somewhat to blame), and he definitely isn't the most honest of kids, probably due to the frankly quite necessary need to lie to the Dursleys.

Now, if it were a time-travel story though, say Harry goes back to his childhood as someone who has survived a war - I could maybe see it happening, mainly due to the loyalty thing. But I just don't think he's a very Hufflepuff person at heart - too impulsive, too goal-oriented, and far too brave for his own good. He also isn't a very participatory sort of person, and Hufflepuff was always presented as having a community sort of feel. It just seems like more of a stretch to me than even Ravenclaw. (Though I did read this one story where Harry was raised by Voldemort and developed a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome in the process, and was almost put into Hufflepuff due to the sheer intensity of that 'loyalty'. Now this I could believe.)

But in the end, I do think Rowling didn't think Hufflepuff out very well - and for that matter, Ravenclaw as well. I don't think we've really had a 'true Ravenclaw' shown to us - Luna is an eccentric even in her own House. At least Hufflepuff had Diggory. I think she was always only ever focused on Gryffindor and Slytherin as the two Houses that embodied the main conflict of the books (and therefore was the most relevant to the story) during its writing process (but now with Fantastic Beasts, she's branching out a bit, since that's no longer necessary now). I do hope she'll touch on Ravenclaw a bit; Hufflepuff now has Newt to show that it isn't only the average kids that end up in there, but what does Ravenclaw have other than Luna, Cho and Marietta? Hmmm. (And for that matter, is there a Slytherin who /hasn't/ done bad things, any bad stuff for any reason? Or who is portrayed as mostly good despite the mischief? Welp, this did end up as a criticism of the House system as it is written in canon after all.)

Edit: and all this analyzing about Hufflepuff qualities is making me itching to write a Hufflepuff Harry story. I don't think I've read any good ones yet. Sometimes it's just authors using Harry as a self-insert and off-handedly goes "oh, and he's a Hufflepuff in this one cos Hufflepuff is awesome, pls stop the Hufflepuff hate" without any explanation whatsoever, and some random awkward shoehorning of Hufflepuff qualities in Harry that comes out of the left field. Imagine, though, a traditionally Hufflepuff family adopting Harry, and impressing onto him the inherent value of hard work, steadiness, the importance of being down-to-earth and realistic, and the weight of truth, since his birth...Imagine Harry coming back from the graveyard and goes through his schoolwork and self-study for the day in the Hospital Wing even though he's just about half-dead on his feet and would rather be knocked out with a hammer, but he powers on because work is work...Imagine Harry who is the anchor of all of his classmates...Imagine Harry who is the pride of his entire House....Hmm.

*** As I remember the books it says that the Ravenclaws were upset/surprised/disgruntled for the first bit of 1st year bc they thought Hermione should have been in their house.

I think people take this and blow it up up into bullying and rivalries in fannon. When it was more of a passing "but we're supposed to be the smart ones that's not fair" of 11 year olds.

** (I went off on a tangent a little, because I feel it might be helpful to think from a Hufflepuff perspective for this. I ended up breaking it into multiple posts. However, the first post is all you need to answer this question.)

To be honest, I don't see too much changing about his persoanlity if he were a Hufflepuff. He's already loyal. He has proven that he will work hard when it really matters, even if he isn't too focussed on his classwork all the time. He has shown multiple times that he is concerned about being fair. The only major difference would be the rush-toward-danger part of his personality. I think he would be more likely to gather backup and tell more teachers about his concerns as a Hufflepuff, but he would still rush into danger if nobody listened.

I also don't see him being completely selfish if he were in Slytherin. Ambition and cunning are not necessarily selfish things. Becoming the world's best lawyer would be considered ambitous, even if your reason to do it was to find the truth or help innocent people get justice. It would also require a certain ammount of cunning. I'm sure there would be hints of selfishness in a Slytherin Harry, but not as much as some fanfic writers seem to think. He might be a little more friendly toward other Slytherins than he was in canon, but he wouldn't suddenly be besties with Malfoy.

As to the canon examples of Hufflepuf, all I'll say is Cedric Diggory. Hufflepuff's traits are loyalty, hardwork, and fairness. The reason we don't see as much of this in canon is because the story takes place from a Gryffindor perspective, and Harry doesn't really pay attention to the other houses much.

*** Their behavior in second year is because none of them know Harry very well personally. Parseltongue is a rare talent and as far as everyone knew, it was an inherited trait passed down from Slytherin's line only. From their perspective, Harry looked pretty darn guilty. He barely even talked to them, and only really tried to explain himself once. Keep in mind that none of them had seen any of his first year adventure personally either. They had all just heard garbled rumours about it.

So to Hufflepuff...Harry was that famous kid who got a really bad detention last year, broke a bunch of rules, something something philosophers stone and an evil teacher. Then Dumbledore personally made sure that Harry's house got a ton of extra points at the last second. That would not have looked very fair to them, even if it did steal the win away from Slytherin. It's not exactly the best impression to leave them with when they're about to spend months away from anyone who might actually know the full truth.

Sure, they could talk to the trio...sort of. Harry doesn't like attention, and would avoid retelling his story to most of the people who asked. Hermione spent a chunk of 2nd year petrified, and didn't see what happened after that with her own eyes. Ron didn't even see the basilisk or the final fight. He was blocked off by a rockslide. In fact, Ron and Hermione didn't actually see the final fight in first year either. They stayed by the chess set because Ron was hurt.

**** The same thought applies to fourth year. Harry still doesn't really interact with Hufflepuff often. They are left with mostly rumours to go on when it comes to his personality. Every year he breaks rules, gets in trouble, has some big end of year shenannigans, and somehow ends up fighting evil that nobody else knew about. To the Hufflepuffs, it seems odd. Teachers should be the ones fighting evil. If Harry thinks something evil is lurking in the shadows, why hasn't he tried to warn more people about it? Even if they don't all believe him, they still deserve to be warned.

The rumour mill continues to get facts wrong, so nobody is really sure if anything he supposedly did is even true. Even if every Hufflepuff realizes that most of what they hear is just rumour, they don't have much else to go on. Their personal experience is that Harry attracts attention, regardless of how much he likes or hates it. He rushes into things, he occasionally has a temper, and he doesn't make much of an effort to be friends with people outside his house. To be honest, they probably don't think about him very often unless a new rumour starts.

***** They finally have a chance to show what Hufflepuff is all about. Cedric Diggory, their close friend and housemate, has been chosen as the Hogwarts champion! He is someone they know personally, someone they see everyday in their own commonroom. Then Harry is suddenly a champion too! It's an insult to their house, their friend, and fair play all in one! Every main aspect of Hufflepuff has been slapped in the face at the same time. They make their loyalty very clear. Cedric is their champion, and they will support him completely. It's a little hard to trust the kid who constantly causes trouble, even if some rumours say that it was for a good cause.

Even his own house doesn't believe him. Ron, someone who has been his best friend for years, thinks Harry is lying! Why should the Hufflepuffs think any different? If the people who know him refuse to believe his story, it probably isn't that true.

As if that wasn't bad enough, Harry asks Cedric's girlfriend to the Yule Ball! Harry had no idea that Cho and Cedric were going together, but the Hufflepuffs don't know that. He really makes himself look like a little shit with that move. He barely even knows Cho, and suddenly he wants to go on a date with her? Seriously, he has had maybe two conversations with her at this point. In fact, I don't think he had a single full convresation with her at all by then. He simply knew she existed.

** I was sorted in Hufflepuff by Pottermore, and most other Sorting tests I take I'm almost always sorted into Hufflepuff, and when I'm not then it's mostly followed by Gryffindor.

I like the Hufflepuffs and think that they are severely underappreciated underrepresented.

From what we have seen they are hard working and loyal to their own. (The whole thing with the Tri-Wizard Tournament). I don't think they hated Harry like Draco and the other Slytherins did, they were just more loyal to Cedric because he was apart of their house.

Susan and Hannah are two of my favorite minor characters in Hufflepuff, along with Nymphadora Tonks.

Nymphadora could have very well been sorted into Gryffindor with her behavior. She's courageous, daring, bold, friendly, hard working, she doesn't seem to care what others think about herself or others. Falling in love with a man that's not only much older then her but who is also a Werewolf.

While Hannah Abbott seemed rather shy soft spoken. Falling in love with the bumbling Neville Longbottom, who for the longest time didn't have confidence in himself.

Zacharias Smith is a rather interesting character because he is much more abrasive about his thoughts much more bold and isn't afraid to say what's on his mind from the little we've seen of him. He abandoned them during the Battle of Hogwarts, which is definitely interesting and not as loyal as the other Hufflepuffs.

But they all seem independent, loyal (for the most part) and as I said hardworking in their own way.

** I'd expect Harry to have a much larger pool of people who know and trust him, and I would expect him to put some work into maintaining those friendships. Hufflepuffs are big on loyalty and community, and I think a Harry that belonged in Hufflepuff would be more proactive about constructing a chosen family for himself instead of being taken in by the Weasleys.

Also I think he would be a bit more community-minded and think more about the impacts of his actions on his friends.

** Hufflepuff is not the house of the hard working or the loyal. They are the rest. When the magical hat puts you into special boxes, it takes the rejects and puts them into Hufflepuff. They are, from the age of 11, given a chip on their shoulder, something to prove to the world. They work hard because they understand that the rest of the world doesn't care about them. They band together because the rest of the world will look down on them. Looking at the dynamics this creates, Hufflepuff outperforms every other house by a massive margin: the other houses tend into small groups and are plagued by infighting, where Hufflepuff is a single, cohesive, absolutely focused unit. Badgers are fucking scary man.
