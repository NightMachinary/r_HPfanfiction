I'm in the mood for something in a different universe. What are your favorite non-anime crossovers?


** linkffn(The Power He Knows Not)

Really good HP/LOTR with a HarryxEowyn pairing. Written in Tolkien's prose, which feels really nice for the majority of the fic, but has a /ton/ of backstory and lore that is slotted in, and explained at the end of each chapter.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

****** Yeah, I definitely agree. I don't like endings that have a few paragraphs of "And Harry finally passed away at the age of 200 with all his grandchildren surrounding him." Fuck that.

** I mainly read HP/GOT so here goes.

Linkffn(A Song of Ice, Fire and Lightning by Zero Rewind)

Awesome battle scenes, interesting additions to the world of magic. You don't need to read the previous story you can hop right in.

Linkffn(The Road to Hell by seagate)

All of Hogwarts appears in the North. Good Worldbuilding, fic focuses on Harry setting up shop and becoming a power player in Westeros.

Linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter)

One of the better crossovers I've read. Harry systematically dismantles Westeros by planting trees. Very good characterizations. Highly recommend.

Linkffn(The Last Lion of House Reyne by joen1801)

Harry discovers his magic in Westeros, he doesn't universe travel. Tywin Lannister tries to destroy the Reynes, but Harry as a baby apparates them out to safety. Harry/OC, which is well done. Not your average take over the world crossover, its solid.

Linkffn(11132113)

My personal favourite HP/GOT. Harry becomes king beyond the wall and establishes an empire. Literally the best world building I've read other than The Star Empire. This is a great read. Good establishment of a city and anticipating what problems occur with it.

Linkffn(The Black Prince by cxjenious)

Don't remember this one, but I know it was good. Sorry.

I am currently writing a HP/IC that focuses more on messing around than any pesky plot. Feel free and check it out, (shameless self promotion)

  When Tywin Lannister crushed the Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion everyone in the Kingdoms believed he ended two noble lines. But thanks to one unique infant, one Harrion Reyne called Harry by his parents, some survived.

  My reward for beating the Demon Emperor and sending him back to hell? Finding myself in an unknown land, hounded by heralds of ice and fire, as well as the idiotic peoples of the lands in this... Westeros. Is it possible to find a way home? I don't know. Eventual Harry/Daenerys. As in way, way later. Stop asking when :P

  Thrown into Alagaësia, Harry encounters a blue stone, visits Ellesméra, and tries to seduce an elven princess. Perhaps even in a strange world he can find rest.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.
