What does this sub think about corporal punishment, for example the spanking of minors ? I guess it was acceptable in earlier times but when its portrayed as normal, like if Harry gets a new, supposedly better guardian who spanks him regularly I think that the author is probably american and it makes me nope out of a fic.


** I nope out and think it's a fetish thing.

I have to say though, the other side of it is applying today's standards (where the vast majority of the western world agree that hitting children is wrong and harmful) to parenting practices in the 80s and 90s. The books mention the Weasleys parents hitting their children after serious misbehaviour and Harry makes light of physical punishment himself. Yet in fanfic we often see Molly saying things like "I would never hit my children." That simply isn't true and was an attitude that was not common until the late 90s. The difference is, and you have picked up on the Americanism here - is that it was usually a cuff round the ear or a wallop on the backside in momentary anger, rather than that American calmness around it? It feels evangelical.

** I don't like it at all, both in real life and in fiction, and I really don't want to read about Snape spanking a young Harry after rescuing him (it seems to be common for this type of story and oh I hate it). Also spanking teenagers, nope. I usually drop the fic immediately.

If it's consensual BDSM between adult, it's a different matter. I want a warning though so I can decide if I want to read it or not.

*** I don't like to read it, but I do think it's realistic. Snape, a boy raised by a drunken, abusive, uneducated father and a mother who didn't help at all... yeah, he isn't going to be reading parenting manuals. He would treat Harry with the strict discipline we see in the classroom, which could be considered abusive, like threatening to poison Neville's pet.

Spanking teenagers is just weird though.

** Threads like these remind me that I'm one of probably only a handful of Asians on this sub. Depending on where you come from, spanking a minor can be acceptable in some cases. Non-whackjob Asian households cane kids only after very severe offences such as stealing stuff or beating up other kids. My family was the same. Of course, caning should only be used hand-in-hand with explaining what the child did wrong. And caning should be stopped after a child reaches emotional maturity. So I guess many Asian people would find corporal punishment okay.

** The question exists in too many contexts:

Do I accept corporal punishment in real life? I don't have kids, so I haven't had to make the call.

Do I accept corporal punishment in fics? Absolutely, if it follows a consistent use by the character.

Is it alright if I see spanking in a fic? Not really, because it isn't funny - if you see it in fanfic, it's usually done to drum up emotions of sympathy (or excitement), and that's not my thing. If it's funny, we're fine.

Do I think the wizarding world accepts corporal punishment? Hell, yes. Half the characters were raised before the notions of Dr. Spock would have filtered down into magical culture, so they'd accept it without question. Also worth mentioning, the wizarding world is very unsympathetic to injuries and emotional pain, probably due to the use of spells and potions to immediately correct the damage.

Altogether, my reaction to seeing it in a story is 'why?'. If I agree to the 'why', we can move on.

** Corporal punishment seems to be a matter of ignorance, more than anything. It should be frowned upon and parents should be properly educated and instructed on how to raise their children.

To explain, spanking your child /doesn't work/. It doesn't improve their behavior or really incentivize them to alter their future actions. So all a parent spanking a child is achieving are trust issues and resentment.

*** Disclaimer: I don't believe in corporal punishment.

But. It works. It's not all that effective, especially in the long run, and has more negative effects than good. However, growing up in a culture that normalised corporal punishment, I can say that it definitely works - on some people. Specifically, children who are rarely subjected to corporal punishment.

***** Maybe it would be more accurate to say it definitely /can/ work. It doesn't always work, but neither does it never work. In fact, it probably fails more often than it works, but I know that it can work quite successfully sometimes. As for your last sentence, I don't really understand it, but I'll just elaborate on what I was trying to say before.

I believe it's occasionally effective when used on a child not used to corporal punishment. For example, when corporal punishment is used for very serious wrongdoings, e.g., stealing, hitting another child, etc., as someone mentioned earlier in this post. Then the punishment stands out and the child will remember it in the long run. They may not fully understand why what they did was wrong, but they probably won't do it again for a long time. It's a very superficial way of discipline, as the child still has the underlying problems that caused their wrongful behaviour in the first place, but it works well enough to curb the worst of the child's wrongdoings in many cases. Of course, it depends on personality as well. A more timid child might be more susceptible to this harsher discipline, for example.

Sustained corporal punishment over a longer period of time however, generally results in children becoming desensitised to corporal punishment. My primary school teachers used the cane on us quite liberally. Rude in class? A smack. Got below 70% on the test? Two smacks. Talked in class? Another smack. Personally, it just made me loathe school and look for ways to dull the pain (this sounds a bit ominous, but I'm honestly just referring to a school-wide practice of rubbing superglue onto our hands in the belief that it would absorb the impact. Still not sure if it helped at all). There were kids who were taken to the Principal's office and caned every week. Obviously, they didn't stop doing whatever it was they'd done to get themselves into trouble.

** I was born in the early 70s, I was spanked by my parents, and slippered at my prep school (they got rid of caning in my first year there), at a guess something like half a dozen times a year. My personal experience, and my impression of society at large, is that it would stop around about age 12 to 14. Reasons? Who knows, but I suppose some combination of recognising that kids that age are beginning to become miniature rational adults instead of animalistic children and so would not react as intended to a spanking, and also because at that age you begin to be capable of hitting back and it actually mattering.

Spanking young children was completely normal in Britain until the early 90s.

** You don't spank children who had already suffered abuses before. If such thing happens in a fic, it's instant stop for me.

I'm not sure spanking is an American thing though, more like Asian or Southern Europe. When I was in China, my coworkers talked freely about spanking their own, and are generally of the opinion that such acts are necessary. Outside of big (well developed) cities, I've seen people doing that in public.

There's nothing inherently ethnic about corporal punishment. Just take a look at literary works from pretty much everywhere up to a few decades ago and you'll find it an extremely common practice that has mostly died out in the first world. If your friend has scars from punishment it's because his parents were deviants, not italian.

** I went to a catholic school and the usual punishment was to go to the front of the class and stay there still the whole hour, sometimes holding your books in your hands, some older teachers didn't minded using a ruler on us or dragging us by the ear all the way to the equivalent of the headmistress. Honestly, it didn't really bother us at all and we never saw anything wrong with it. We did wrong, so we got punished, that was all.

From my point of view all of this didn't start to be seen as wrong until the media started showing extreme cases of abuse that had nothing to do with just punishment a few decades ago. Nowadays I feel kids feel entitled to much more because of all the anti punishment media, and this makes kids believe they shouldn't be punish no matter what they do. Basically we have gone to the other extreme, we are raising Dudleys all over the world.

That is to say, based on the timeframe of the HP world, some punishment is perfectly appropriate, just don't go to the extreme unless you are making an abused!h story, there is a difference between punishment and abuse.

** Corporal punishment is a very vague subject and how okay I am with it depends entirely on the context. I do not think a kid is unduly harmed from occasionally getting slapped as the highest level of immediate punishment and behaviour control, but systematic and deliberate usage of pain as punishment is only gonna tan the kid's hide (at best) or harm him outright. It's more of a shock tool than educational in any way.
