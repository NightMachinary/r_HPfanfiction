Absolutely loved this story, read it a while back, found it again recently and read it again with the new chapters. Alas, still unfinished and hasn't been updated since 2012 so it's done. Looking for similar stories of a very strong Harry but he suffered for it, so not just he is the descendant of 15 different magical heroes or whatever. Prefer pairings besides H/G and H/Herm just for new ideas - those have been done to death.

**** Statistically speaking, I am most people, I thoroughly enjoyed that fic. Loved the John Wick esque world building of the hit wizards world

***** To add on to that, people know what they are getting with /Deprived/: a schlocky OP Harry fest that has top-tier action scenes. I would love to see more chapters, but there won't ever be. Sucks, but there is more than enough to make up for it.

** Ahhh a man of good taste I see. The closest thing I've found to Deprived was Knowledge is Power by Fettucini, which has been reuploaded on FF.net.

There are a lot of similar storylines to Deprived, but they're all MUCH lower in quality so consume at your own peril.
