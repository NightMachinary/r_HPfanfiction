  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. M for later. Eventual Hinny.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** !linkffn(An Unexpected Malfoy) has this. It /is/ a Dramione fic, which I know a lot of people will find offputting, but it diverges from canon early on (halfway through first year), so a lot of Draco's worst tendencies are nipped in the bud before they show themselves.

*** Oh wow. Yeah, that's a pretty earlier divergence, so it's not thrown into the don't read pile immediately, but there's issues.

Narcissa and Lucius are both unrepentant bigots in canon. Whitewashing them doesn't go over well. Draco also is a bit slow with moral lessons in the later book and loves his family. Contrary to Sirius who was looking to fit in.

  Once upon a time Hermione Granger literally ran into Draco Malfoy in a bookshop. His mother sees a connection between her son and the muggleborn that she can't ignore and determines to get to know the girl. An imagining of how things could have gone if Hermione had been taken under the wing of the Malfoy family.
