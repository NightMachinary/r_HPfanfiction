I read it ages ago, and all I can remember is that Harry and Voldemort would occasionally meet each other but were bound by requirements of civility and conduct during those meetings. I seem to remember that at least one of them was at some posh wizarding restaurant. I think that Harry was Lord Potter, but it might have been Potter/Black, Black, or Gryffindor. Also, Voldemort was Lord Gaunt iirc. Thanks!


** Was it the Promises Unbroken series? It was about Sirius, not Harry, but I remember the fancy restaurant being used frequently by the upper class, and the forced civility of the wizard lords' meetings with both Order members and Voldemort in attendance but still bound by their ancient codes of conduct.
