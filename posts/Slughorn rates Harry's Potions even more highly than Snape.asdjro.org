Taken from Harry Potter 6th Book, these lines.

“Instinctive, you know---like his mother! I've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill---why even Severus---”

“Well, then, it's natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. “You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death---never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don't think even you, Severus---


** Or Snape wrote down his ideas after several attempts so Harry got the perfected recipe.

*** the books emphasize that harry doesn't understand the theory involved, though, and the bulk of his investment was because of the mystique, personalisation and awe of the prince

also...harry doesn't think slughorn is a good teacher, and barely likes him

#+begin_quote
  Harry was going to have to take Slughorn's word for it that Golpalott's Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next either.

  “He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. Weasley. “He was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?”

  His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.

***** i mean, i think the book makes it clear that harry isn't actually instinctive at potions, and slughorn is none the wiser. the only reason he calls him 'intuitive' is because he pulls out the bezoar, and the only reason harry does that is because he was flipping through the book. the only instinct harry displays in slughorn's class is following the book's instructions exactly

nor do i necessarily think his lack of knowledge of theory is obvious to slughorn. he's covering all bases in response to what he thinks is harry's cheeky solution to a problem

if harry's abilities were obvious to slug, he'd know he was relying on the book

harry does show skill at the actual process of potion making, though

*** Counterpoint - Harry is good in Book 6 because he's reading from a book (with Snape's notes) and not being 'taught' by Snape. Snape would be a super effective potions teacher if he quit and started writing textbooks.

  Countercounterpoint: Snape is actually a competent teacher for the rest of the student body, but is unashamedly awful towards Harry. Any skill Harry might have with potions is probably despite Snape's teaching/pedagogy, not because of.
#+end_quote

The rest of the student body?

Let's consider Neville, who was terrorized by Snape. Snape bullied and tormented Neville --- he threatened 12yo Neville's pet, for instance, simply because Neville was underperforming despite Neville's most concerted efforts to succeed --- to the point that Neville's greatest fear is his own teacher. Given that Neville's parents were tortured to insanity by Death Eaters, and his fond memories include being dropped out a window by his uncle, it's rather significant that his teacher is his biggest fear.

How about Hermione? She performs well in potions, but from the beginning Snape is rude and dismissive of her at best, even though she shows nothing but skill and dedication to the subject. At age 11, Hermione (then quite the rule follower) /set her teacher on fire/ because even she thought that Snape might be actively trying to kill her classmate. Is this an indication to you that Snape is invested in student growth --- that the most academically high-achieving student of that year is convinced that her professor is hell bent on killing another student?

From Harry's account of the potions lessons, it is abundantly clear that Snape is particularly apathetic towards the success of literally every Gryffindor in Harry's year.

Snape definitely has the skill set and knowledge to be an incredible teacher. The annotations of his school textbook are proof that even as a teenager he had a great deal of information to bestow on others. As I recall, Snape sometimes wrote the potions instructions on the blackboard rather than directing student to the textbook, which suggests he did at least occasionally rely on his own improved processes. Unfortunately, Snape doesn't seem to give much of a shit about teaching or student outcomes.

  I like to think he has generally improved potion scores for Hogwarts OWLs and NEWTs, compared to Slughorn, and while he's harsh and a dick, he's not as harsh and carelessly acerbic to the rest of the student body as he is towards Harry's year.
#+end_quote

At minimum, Snape probably did improve the percentage of NEWT-seeking Potions students who pass the exam. This would be expected, given that he refused to accept anything less than the highest-scoring OWL students for his NEWT course.

I'm not all that impressed by teachers who cherry pick only a small number of students who are already exceptionally high achievers for a class, and then brag about their test results. Of /course/ a student who achieved the top OWL result is going to almost certainly pass the NEWT.

I have much more respect for Slughorn's willingness to teach NEWT-level potions to students who got an “Exceeds Expectations”, in addition to the highest-scoring “Outstanding” O.W.L. result.

Snape was the only professor who would exclusively accept only Outstanding students, and in doing so he likely deprived a fair number of otherwise above-average Potions students of the opportunity to earn a NEWT in a core subject, which they likely could have otherwise achieved with a different Potions professor. Effectively, Snape directly disqualified these bright students from a range of lucrative career opportunities that require a Potions NEWT, and that's not nothing.

#+begin_quote
  Mostly this comes from the fact that I can't see Albus allowing Snape to just destroy the potion education of a whole generation of students, as some fanon likes to depict him doing - especially when Albus is an alchemist himself.
#+end_quote

That's a pretty shaky basis for your conjecture. Albus Dumbledore was willing to make a lot of allowances to achieve his larger goal of setting Harry up to vanquish Voldemort. Albus needed Snape at Hogwarts, and Snape needed to be close to Dumbledore to fulfill his promise to Albus and maintain his cover for Voldemort; Snape was a highly competent potioneer, and there was a Potions vacancy, so Snape got the job, despite his apathy towards young people generally and teaching specifically.

I doubt Snape's lack of fair-mindedness, mentorship abilities, collegiality with the other professors, or inclination to encourage individual student growth (academically or personally) were disqualifications, given the greater need for Snape's presence at Hogwarts. Albus was willing to pay much higher prices than student outcomes in Potions for his plan to succeed.

After all, Albus also, among other things: hired Quirrell and kept him on staff despite his suspicions; hired Lockhart; employed Trelawney, despite Albus's sincere belief that Divination should be removed from the curriculum and that Trelawney lacked any skill for it regardless; kept Trelawney on even though Firenze was a better instructor; and --- although this one is perhaps less egregious, though still inadvisable --- hired Hagrid over the more-qualified and better-organized Grubbly-Plank for Care of Magical Creatures.

I can see why Albus had Snape in the Potions job, and can understand that he justified it for the greater plan. What I can't support is Snape, a grown-ass adult who agreed to this arrangement as penance for joining a death cult and orphaning his childhood friend's son --- and who is clearly an exceptionally skilled and knowledgeable Potions Master --- selfishly refuses to put his considerable talents to productive use by actually applying himself as a teacher. Snape absolutely had the abilities to be an outstanding professor, but from my reading of the books, he was not only unwilling to bother to reach that potential, but actually took a perverse pleasure in making many of his students as miserable in his classroom as himself.

***** Harry is used to an abusive environment. He did learn because of Snape. Snape being an ass doesn't change that. If, for example, Slughorn had taught Harry he would have been mediocre like everyone else in sixth year.

**** Snape taught Harry for 5 years. Snape's notes are the only difference between Hermione's lacklustre performance in Slughorn's class and Harry's excellent performance. Harry isn't just leaning on the notes though, he has to physically brew the potion using the skills Snape taught him. Was Snape an ass about it? Hell yes. But he still taught them how to brew very well.

** Didn't Harry get an EE OWL in potions even with Snape's bullying and lack of teaching acumen? I would say it is quite possible that Harry is actually quite good at potions even without the HBP.
