So, I had some free time recently (because obviously, there are no stories that I should really be working on. No sirree bob!) and decided to spend it using [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Scryer]] to get a idea for how the fandom evolved over time.

Now, as with all arm-chair statisticians attempts at putting numbers on lines, it comes with a lot of caveats. Like, it only goes back as far as 2002, as that's as far back as [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] goes (and I made absolutely no attempt to look at other sites. No, not even AO3. The amount of duplication I'd expect to see would kinda mess with the numbers).

Despite that, the picture it draws, in very broad strokes, is still far more positive than I think most might expect.

[[https://i.imgur.com/J7JGZSa.png][Lines and Boxes Go Whirr]]

So, yes. The numbers of fanfics being written has declined significantly since the heady days of 2011. Last year saw just below 30% of the fics that 2011 saw, though I'd hasten to add that not only is 15484 new fics an entirely reasonable number (compare to Avengers which saw 4187 new stories last year, or Naruto which saw 9257), it is also a number that we have already exceeded so far this year. 2020 marks the first time since 2011 that the fandom has actually seen a year-on-year increase in the number of fics being written, and it's not even finished yet.

Something else which may be seen as either positive or negative, is that the number of 'longfics' (here I have rather optimistically counted anything with a length greater than 20k words to be a longfic) is a bit more robust. In 2019 the number of new fics which are (as of a couple of weeks ago) longer than 20k words is 42% the number of similar fics originally posted in 2011. This means that the relative proportion of longer stories has grown fairly substantially. In fact, the longfic share of the fandom has increased by around 50% since 2011. We're getting fewer fics, yes, but those we are getting are much more likely to be longer.

Could this be a symptom of what we might call 'fandom entrenchment'? Purely based off anecdotal evidence, I suspect this could be a result of the relative lack of newcomers to the fandom, certainly compared to 2011. On average, the fandom is older and almost certainly more invested in the topic. You kinda have to be, to hang around in a fandom for a half a decade (or more in many cases). I wonder if this also connects to the (again anecdotal) trend in the fandom where it seems to be crystallising around certain tropes. Have we become entrenched in our ways?

So what do you think? Does the future look bright or dark?


** Between the Hogwarts game coming out next year and the three remaining Fantastic Beast movies (Mads Mikkelsen as Grindlewald please), I think there's going to be a fair bit of interest in the fandom for a while still.

Honestly, while there are fewer stories being written I've certainly found that on the whole, the stories seem to be better written these days.

I mean, to me, a large chunk of the most liked stories on FF are rather cringy.

*** Fantastic Beasts doesn't seem to have done much to inspire fics so far, from what I've seen. There's a small coterie of Newt-centric fics which tend towards fluff, but not much else I've seen.

**** Tbh I'm disappointed that more writers haven't taken inspiration from the Fantastic Beasts movies.

Like Grindelwald is shown to have some kind of seer abilities, plus we already know that Dumbledore has him locked up in Numengard in Harry's time and that Dumbledore believes in prophesies. But I haven't seen any fics that have Dumbledore, even a poorly written evil/bashing fic one, using Grindelwald's visions as a secret weapon against Voldemort.

And we have sooo many new creatures introduced by these movies, but I never see them in fics! The kelpie was gorgeous, I'd love to see a fic where Harry encounters one. (in the Black Lake during the TriWizard tournament, maybe??).

So many great characters too! Leta and Newt and Queenie all have cool backstories to them that could be mixed with the original series for a fic. I love Credence as a character and I'd adore a time travel fic with him and Harry jumping back and forth in time and getting into trouble with /two/ dark lords (maybe even pitting them against each other? That would be an /epic/ duel).

Bellatrix is only a Lestrange by marriage, Rodolphus and Rabastan exist!), and that ridiculous inclusion of McGonagall way before her time make them seem like rather careless fan works themselves, and not canon material to work from.

That's just a fanon thing based on the assumption that McGonagall taught consecutively. Consecutiveness also requires us to believe that McGonagall is younger than Hagrid, but if you read the books McGonagall is explicitly presented as being old whereas neither Hagrid nor Voldemort are. Given Rowling's well known issues with timelines, this latter point should be highly persuasive.

******* Hagrid is half-giant and Voldemort gets a brand new body in GoF... why would he create one that looked old? Neither is fully human so it makes sense they would not have aged as such. Between the detailed Pottermore background given on her and info from the books it seems pretty well established that [[https://time.com/5463360/mcgonagall-fantastic-beasts/][McGonagall was born in 1935]] and they just wanted to include another familiar face in Fantastic Beasts. Really, they should have had a younger Slughorn make an appearance.

That said, I think it would be easier to solve the other two holes-- namely if it turns out the Credence is NOT a Dumbledore but someone else entirely, and that the Lestrange line has merely ended its storied branch in France but exists elsewhere in the world. I'm so afraid that they're going to try to claim that Bellatrix is a "flower" on the family tree that Leta had, suggesting she was born Bellatrix Lestrange and not Black.

** I think the only thing these types of statistics consistently point to imo is that fanfiction.net is incredibly user unfriendly and that a lot of readers and writers alike have probably long abandoned it for other websites. When the purge happened, I left and the only reason for it was that my favourite writers (who wrote long, well-written and varied fic) and a lot of writers in general left. I feel like this created a vacuum that was filled with self-insert, oc-heavy, bashing fics written by authors who probably write mostly for practice and are far more likely to abandon a fic after 10 chapters. Not my cup of tea. I don't post my own fics on fanfiction.net precisely for that reason, I feel that the community and audience there is very much so used to a particular style of fanfic. A style I don't enjoy. I know some of my writer-friends feel the same way.

**** idk a bit of a weak argument cause ao3 has plenty of "serious, well writen long" fics, which you can also filter through, tho they might lean towards slash.

Both ao3 and ffn have nasty amounts of slog but i guess ao3 does lend to easier organization of events (like big bangs or like __week (ex ship week) so there might be more short form content, but it's filtering and tagging system is pretty nifty for looking for fics. like word count.

well there you go, a large number of people just want world expanding longfics and aren't in it for the slash. FFN is not user unfriendly for the most part, the irritating thing is that the owners don't do anything to keep it going properly (see the glitches about updates and the like). I find it far easier to find good fics on ffn, not least because of the numbers. As a gen fanfiction writer, I don't really see any advantage AO3 has. In fact its userbase is smaller. Same goes for crossovers.

#+end_quote

im curious to see where you got ur data point cause stats fun or at least how it's measured

i concede that the market for slash is smaller so therefore the assumed demand is smaller and less likely to spread your story.

my preferences don't lean towards sprawling world expansion and are more character based so I wouldn't really know and that's what this sub's also more biased towards so discovery fics that fit my tastes are less frequent on ao3.

I think another upside to ao3 is that it really lends toward community building since it's link friendly and lends easily to sharing on other sites, so things like discords are easier tho again depends on the author and if there's a pre-existing community.

Take Snipers solve 99% of all problems by silentwalrus ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20644262/chapters/490237]]) - gen fic

- a(n) (ongoing) ,fma-hp crossover that explores a the application of fma alchemy/sciences to hp (w/hilarity ensuing) - which is currently not in story that is now clocking in at 74 ch and 226k. While not world expanding, it's more exploratory in how it works with the some of the constraints of canon. there are some trope conventions and some caricaturing of the hp'verse (like there only being one newspaper in wizarding eng) but it fits for the way it is.

It has high engagement and a very active community that was further boosted by it's discord server could be shared. High engagement in large fics on ao3 also tend to mean having the fic translated and spread.

** Part of it is that people did move over to Ao3, so without data from there (even if only for reference) we can't conclusively say if the fandom is declining or not.

I would say though that quantity isn't quality - We could be getting like 10 new fics a year, but if they were all 300k+words of top-notch writing we'd be in much better spot than if we were getting 1000 smut oneshots of dubious quality.

Overall i think it will be going just fine, though ffnet is going to be a bit less popular as years go on.

*** FFN has been going stale pretty much since it released I think. It's really fairly impressive that a platform with as little support as it enjoys has seen such success.

It will always be hard to really replace FFN, as so many authors are long gone, and their fics will forever stay part of FFN's library and no other.

I'm not sure how easy it would be to identify how many unique stories each platform has. I suspect it would require I scrape the entire catalogue of both sites and do a more direct comparison. That would be quite a lot of work, however!

** I think the fandom is just getting older. I know I wright much better than I did at thirteen when I started in this fandom. And as the fandom gets older most of us have a more thorough understanding about how the world works and how people are, which leads to more thoughtful and engaging plots and character dynamics.

That said we are older and far more opinionated, we see the series without the lens of childhood wonder, which leads to more general conflict of ideas in the fandom itself. As long as we don't become too self-riotous and click-ish, or condescending to new fans, the fandom will endure.

** I think it's a mix between at least three main factors.

1. Readers and authors are older on average. Sure there are loads of teens and kids still getting into HP but most of us are adults who write more adult story (y'know we actually describe environments and emotions and don't resolve a major conflict, or sex in three sentences like a teen-author would)
2. As there is no new content being added ( fantastic beasts is its own fandom imo) there are less 'missing scenes' or shorts that just pick on one minor detail being written and the lack of regular 'forced' engagement in the fandom (through new books or movies) also comes with less chances to spark any small ideas.
3. A lot of things have been written already, yes maybe you have this brilliant idea but chances are this story already exists and many people write things they want to read, so they don't write it if it already exists in a well done manner.

Which I think leads us down three path, some people just continue writing 'normal' not overly tropy stories (like Romoine fluff one-shots), some write the heavy tropes (The classic Dumbledore bashing with smart Harry seems popular lately) and some write rather bizarre things that only borrow the characters (and the fandom/ audience) but tell a completely different story (I have read very good HP sci-fi).

I don't think this is a story of decline but rather a testament to the impact of this orphans story that we still write millions of words about him and the world he exists in, even almost a decade after the story was fist told in full.

I have seen a tendency in the fandom to split certain ships between the sites so I would guess that the 'damage' done to FFN by AO3 is probably at least somewhat dependant on the 'sub-fandom' (i.e., pairing based). It would be interesting to try and explore that difference.

**** same, i'd think that ao3 demographics would definitely differ than ffn. Like look at this subreddit--> predominantly male and less inclined to slash

- it's demos have changed over the yrs but slightly. the subreddit is also more inclined to ffn appose to ao3 or other alts.

then you look at [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] and most, if not all fics are from ao3. the two existing options have allowed for these distinct categories to appear and develop their own niches.

** There's something to take into account this year, is what I will call the pandomic effect.

Many of us were stuck home on lockdown for a long time. Here in France it was 6 weeks. With many people not even working from home (and still getting payed at least minimum wage), and of course not getting out. That leave a lot of time to write, and write longer story.

All in all, I believe the future will be brighter. We may have fewer story (if 15k new stories a year can be consider few), but I believe that they'll be better. (At least to my taste).

As the fandom age, there's some maturity that will come with it. With maybe less bashing, less badly self-insert mary-sue, or everything we read with some indulgence because it was quite obvious it came from a 13 years old.

That 13 years old is now 22. They might still writing, but we all know it is far better.

*** Yep, I think the pandemic effect is a big driver on the number of fics we've seen this year. I also think that Fantastic Crimes of Grindelwald Beasts served to take the wind out of the fandom a little last year, potentially explaining the dip in 2019.

I can't really forget the pandemic effect because while I started getting back into the writing groove before it really hit, I've still achieved two whole novel length stories this year alone. I doubt I would have done that had I not been stuck at home so much.

**** i don't really regard the fantastic beasts to be separate to the fandom cuz it definitely breathed something into hp in the form of new content, the diverted attention on ffn could be measured differently on ao3 where fanfastic beasts is part of hp's subtags

** Eh, I'm not worried. Writers will always be free to write what they want, and as a reader - well, the number of stories has long since surpassed what I could read in a lifetime. If no new stories were ever published again (and that's obviously not happening) we'd still never run out of new things to read.

** I would say fanfic slows down when the source material dries up. Generations ago, writers now old enough to be the grandmoms of many here were typing Star Trek smutfic onto mimeograph stencils and circulating the stories in handmade illustrated zines by snail mail. Sometime after that, technically elaborate and seemingly humongous internet ftp sites full of X-Files fic went up. Those XF sites are still around (see www dot gossamer dot org) but nobody writes XF fic any more, and the once unimaginable number of stories there is tiny compared to the amount of Potter stuff on ff.net. After XF there was this and that and the other thing.

I had given up TV by then and most of the fic was about shows I hadn't seen, so I stopped reading (I did like Babylon 5 and some of its fic). I fell into Potter recently and pretty much by accident, but with the book/movie series long since over with and Rowling now something of a political relic, it's no surprise if the Potter world is on the wane. Everything comes and goes.

So what is coming? I have no idea. Potter was already an anachronism when I started reading this fic, but I haven't stayed on top of any newer fiction. Of course I'm always up for recs.

*** Scryer just periodically scrapes FFN for fic updates, and matches them against stories in the DLP library to provide a rating system. I used it because it allows for much finer-grain filtering than is possible through [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] filters.

** We had this discussion on here a couple months ago. I don't think it's necessarily as much a function of the fandom dying as that it's changing. There is especially more demand these days for epic-scale AU's, particularly on FFN and on this sub. Communities which are more slash- and drabble-centric - essentially, the core of first-generation Harry Potter fanfic authors - appear to have moved mostly to AO3, which could explain the relative decline in total fics and short fics on FFN.

I don't necessarily think the fandom is older; in fact, I get the impression the contrary is true; there are lots of people like me who read the books as kids and discovered fanfiction in their teens or twenties. It's been mentioned before that the fandom has probably also skewed more male, but I think it's still fairly gender-balanced. We don't really get a comprehensive picture of the fandom on this one community.

** I think it's really, really bad. It seems like there barely any new, innovative fics. Many of the great authors of yesteryear have moved on, which in turn means that all the generic drivel is more readily apparent. And a lot of the people who are still around are still just writing the same repackaged stories over and over. And new readers are being caught up in this endless loop of unoriginality, but unable to break free of it.

On FFN, it's pretty bad. I can maybe discover two new stories per year that are actually good. On AO3, that is actual zero. FNN is caught up in this loop of tropes, but somehow AO3 has collected all the dregs of the fandom, the authors and stories that never really fit in anywhere else, and on top of hat, they've gotten a lot of new readers who haven't discovered that the story they love is about the 500th iteration of the same thing except there's not 15 years of backlog to show that, so they love the site. But to me, its not just more of the same, it's the bad versions of the more of the same.

*** -whether or not you prefer the content on ao3 to call 'actually good,' that'd be an inefficient way to label shifting interests and the aging and death of a fandom.

maybe just like take a step back and take a break from hp ff before coming back and also try exploring sides of the fandom you might not interact with for fresher perspectives.

-in regards to death of a fandom, I'd really like to factor in Rowling's terf comments and like that impact of the fandom, like circa before explicit TERFiness and after, since that has definitely impact how people are choosing to participate in fandom. And that's were ao3 definetly needs to examined in some way or another.

-double data's definiety sound sluggish but the differences between the two markets of ao3 and ffn would be interesting to see in comparing the extent to which the fandom is dying
