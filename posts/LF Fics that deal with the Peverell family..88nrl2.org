I'm looking for any fix that has the Peverell family/Deathly Hallows/Master of Death as it's central focus. Hopefully I'm looking for fics where Harry's Peverell lineage has a big impact on the plot, or fics that have Ignotus Peverell in his contemporary setting. I.e ignotus is the main character.


** I think Maurauder's Plan linkffn(8045114) might fit your description. It's one where Sirius takes in Harry Potter after 3rd year. It's a heartwarming fanfic where Harry learns to rely on family.

** You might want to check out linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild) The peverells are a small part of this story, but it gives a Forrest gump-y scenario where he's always there at important events and also how the history changed and morphs into what it is today as opposed to what actually happened (in the fictional universe)
