** Sometimes, it feels like Fanfics in general are ruined by harem. It's more visible on AO3 than on FF, but I'm often amazed by the sheer number of Harems fics, and how popular they are, with the exceptions of some rare gems, it's almost as if the most popular fics are only harems sometimes (though it may depends of the fandoms I guess).

In the case of "Smut" fics I have nothing to say (since harems seem to be pretty much the point of these fics), but I'm a little tired of all these fics where the "fixed MC" (who somehow became perfect by having a epiphany and training for 2 paragraphs during the prologue) seems to spend all his time sleeping with every named female character of the fandoms (plus some genderbended male ones) rather than . . . saving the world.

I blame it on the fact that most of them are basically written as some kind of power fantasy by those who've never had sex.

**** That, and the fact that most of the time, only one or two of the harem members actually have any real character. The rest end up being a single character trait attached to a sexy body that's completely identical to everyone else in the harem.

I'm pretty sure that even the worst harem anime know to give everyone different body types and personalities, even if they are very generic. But most harem fics can't even get that right.

***** Anime, I think, is one of the reasons why we see such shitty harem tropes in fanfic. A lot of people are fans of anime, and most of them inevitably feature such crap. People think, "Oh how cool!" and try to write that shit into situations where... well, you know.

*** I couldn't agree more. Especially as Marvel, which gets far more crossovers than DC, is so expansive in its most popular canon. Trying to stick to the canon pretty much means you're stuck with an endless story which doesn't actually /do/ anything.

How many times has Harry rescued Tony from his cave... but only /after/ Tony has the chance to build the suit, and poor old Yinsen has his chance to die? Is it more times than he has somehow, inexplicably, became trapped in that same cave, I wonder?

Because we wouldn't want to drop an Ironman sized spanner in the works. That would be far too interesting.

** Exactly. Personally, I really think Harry and Scarlet Witch would be fun to read. Two people who rather shitty childhoods that have trauma they faced, but also arguably blessed with powers. Added to that, she always seems to be underutilized. Anyone who has fics like this they know of, comment them please. Even if it is a harem, I'd still read it just for their interactions.

** This is something which has long been a source of frustration for me. I feel like a crossover has enough work to do in merely making the crossover aspect work, and giving the disparate characters and settings their due. Adding harems and multi-pairings just seems like a bad idea in the circumstances, really. I'm not a fan of harems at the best of times, but in crossovers I feel like they are more common (relatively) despite being even harder to pull off than in non-crossover stories.

I've been trying to improve matters (well, in my view, anyway. I'm sure there are plenty of people who do not or would not like my stories) with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13521865/1/Kicking-Gotham][Kicking Gotham]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13694861/1/Toppling-Heroes][Toppling Heroes]], but I'm only one person. I'd love to see other people try out their own takes on Marvel & DC crossovers, without feeling like they need to stay in the well-worn footsteps of Megamatt or the Blood Brandy Challenge.

*** Keep up the good work, I love all your fics. Honestly I never set foot in DC fics because I just don't know any DC lore, just bare bones what you get from existing. But I was bored over Christmas, ended up reading both Kicking Gotham and Toppling Heroes in 2 days.

I know you're good at providing needed background info to people who don't know lore from your Shadow of Angmar, but it really showed in these stories because I knew basically nothing while I already had most of the needed background knowledge for LotR. Also how you mix in the HP magic world into the world of bot DC and LotR feels so clean.

I love your stuff.

Anyway, I'm glad you enjoyed it, and didn't feel too lost in the DC stuff. I try to add references that will be understood by people 'in the know', without ever making the story hinge on that knowledge.

*** I agree with you on the need for putting care into crossovers. Too often writers take the easy route of having one side solve all the problems of the other, which in a way defeats the purpose.

Uncharitably, harems in crossover fic seem like a way for author avatars to live out their superhero fantasies.

To contribute, here's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27622472/chapters/67580753][my take]] on a DC crossover. The premise is an amicable/ambiguous WBWL situation (it's not clear if there even is a true BWL at first), where Kal-El lands in Godric's Hollow where Lily, James, and Harry are hiding. A theme through DC is that different worlds/reboots all sort of end up taking a similar shape, but it's all kicked off by the arrival of Kal-El. My goal with this crossover is as a full AU of both -- a synthesis of character and setting, so instead of Batman existing as Bruce Wayne all the way over in Gotham, circumstances contrive themselves so an existing character in the Harry Potter setting becomes essentially Batman.

**** It is very important that your fic have the words "some Granger girl"... for absolutely no reason. I swear that half of the rules of that challenge are there specifically to make the story as awful as possible.

But at least that challenge has actually resulted in stories being created, even if almost all of them are awful. I'm pretty sure that every Vegas challenge story I've seen has been abandoned shortly after the "figuring out what happened last night" scenes, because there's basically no plot left after that point and the author has no idea what to do.

** I do believe it to be possible to write a decent harem/multi fic. Obviously, reading a fic like that requires suspension of disbelief, because this isn't something that would happen in real life.

I'm writing a multi fic, and I make certain to give every woman her time in the sun, explore their characters, and give them a distinct role in the story.

As for body types... I don't go into too much detail, and only vaguely describe their bodies, allowing the reader to do it themselves.

*** The only way a "multi" fic would work?

1. Love triangles. Even then it wouldn't really be a "multi" but drama and conflict, be it from one person moving on to another partner and the former paramour trying to win them back, or the character being torn between two competing love interests
2. Character dates X for XX amount of chapters. They eventually break up or move on with their lives. Character then dates Y for XX amount of chapters. X comes back into the picture XX chapters later. Drama happens.
3. Character cheats on their paramour, with the side piece either being complicit or unknowing.

Poly and open relationships are bullshit that in 99% of the cases do not work -- the only reason they've gained traction is because people publicize the one out of a hundred-thousand relationship that did end up working than the ninety-nine thousand marriages and relationships that crashed and burned.

Reptila's challenge is one of those that wants to make you gouge out your own eyes -- it's a goddamn plague. And Megamatt09 dominates DC and Marvel crossovers with his pre-teen views on relationships and sexual harem bullshit.

I'd read a story where Harry was torn between a competing Stargirl and Supergirl -- that's drama, and it happens in real-life. I wouldn't read some wank fantasy that has him with both at the same time and their being perfectly fine with it.

...Actually, that'd be pretty hilarious to read, but still.

Why can't I have a fic where Harry interacts with the Marvel or DC universe without him also boinking every female in it? Which makes his interactions a) predictable and b) all the same. And also, since many of these women have canon love interests in-universe, destroying a lot of their characterizations.
