  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** That's incredibly vague. You might as well ask for 'well-written' stories (as people do all the time), and then you'll likely not feel that all the recs you get are much good anyway.

**** Well you can I suppose, but why would you trust the judgement of a random person on the internet? You only have to read through posts on this sub to see that opinions on what is 'good' vary wildly. You are the only person who knows what you like; no one else can know that. If I were you, I'd be looking at the favourites lists of authors I like.

***** Sorry to jump in here, but isn't that the point of all the request posts on this site? To get the opinion of a random person on the internet?

It's probably safe to say that the OP tried at least to some extent to search for stories on his/her own. So, the logical next step would be to ask a HPfanfiction community for their recommendations.

I just don't see why that's a problem all of a sudden...? But alas, this is none of my business.
