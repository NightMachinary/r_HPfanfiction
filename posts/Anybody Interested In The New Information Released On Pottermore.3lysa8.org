In short, Charlus is confirmed not to be Harry's grandfather and there is clarification on the familial history of Harry.


** I'm interested.\\
This suggests:

- the Potter family had/has a sizable fortune.

- Harry was named after an ancestor, Henry.

*** I would presume during Harry's life the Potter fortune was actually at its peak.

- Previous generations of Potter's were successful, contributing to a number of notable potions.

- Harry's grandfather multiplied the existing fortune by several times.

- James likely didn't make a significant dent. He left Hogwarts, got married, and went into hiding shortly after.

I really hope to see some fics that include this information properly compared to previous fics that just assumed Harry had x amount of titles and x amount of Galleons. My headcanon has always been that Harry was wealthy but otherwise had the same status as your average Muggleborn.

***** No way, I think it would work especially well on Potter hair, but James wanted to look different from his father and thought wild hair made him look like a cool quidditch star, and Harry's just clueless. He doesn't use wizarding grooming products except as the school provides them (like the soap in the prefects' bathroom), he never even heard of Sleekeazy until Hermione mentioned it 4th year at the Yule Ball, and it doesn't occur to him to spend money on that kind of stuff.

Now if someone had told him his grandpa invented it the poor little tyke would probably use that shit every day worse than Malfoy and think it was great. But clearly no one ever did.

No one can tell JKR what to do. It is her story. It is perfectly fine for readers to express dissatisfaction though. They can *ask* her to do or not do certain things and she has the freedom to respond as she likes.

Thinking "outside the box" isn't inherently positive. It depends on what is done outside of the box.

It's different from something like a house because it can change hands much easier. You could not, for example, steal a house from someone, but you could feasibly steal the Cloak, in which case you would now own the artifact.

It is worthy to note that I know I am nitpicking. I'm just a believer that authors should be conscious of their word choice, since it is their chosen medium, so they should say exactly what they mean, especially in documents such as this that are more factual than literal.

Owning it makes you 1/3 of the way to being the "Master of Death", but ownership wouldn't officially change unless it was formally given to someone else, death of the owner, or maybe in case of someone stealing it like you said. It didn't change to Dumbledore's even though he had the use of it for years.

******** Yes. I guess the real question is when did James begin to consider it his, and not his father's Cloak? This is also assuming that the Cloak acts in the same way as the Elder Wand, which again is feasible because they are both highly powerful magical artifacts, and more importantly both Hallows. However I was always under the impression that the Elder Wand followed the rules of ownership of wands in general. I didn't interpret the change in ownership as that of a Hallow but instead that of a wand.

#+begin_quote
  The Potter family is a very old one, but it was never (until the birth of Harry James Potter) at the very forefront of wizarding history, contenting itself with a solid and comfortable existence in the backwaters.

  Potter is a not uncommon Muggle surname, and the family did not make the so-called ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight' for this reason; the anonymous compiler of that supposedly definitive list of pure-bloods suspected that they had sprung from what he considered to be tainted blood. The wizarding Potter family had illustrious beginnings, however, some of which was hinted at in Deathly Hallows.

  In the Muggle world ‘Potter' is an occupational surname, meaning a man who creates pottery. The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer', became corrupted in time to ‘Potter'. Linfred was a vague and absent-minded fellow whose Muggle neighbours often called upon his medicinal services. None of them realised that Linfred's wonderful cures for pox and ague were magical; they all thought him a harmless and lovable old chap, pottering about in his garden with all his funny plants. His reputation as a well-meaning eccentric served Linfred well, for behind closed doors he was able to continue the series of experiments that laid the foundation of the Potter family's fortune. Historians credit Linfred as the originator of a number of remedies that evolved into potions still used to this day, including Skele-gro and Pepperup Potion. His sales of such cures to fellow witches and wizards enabled him to leave a significant pile of gold to each of his seven children upon his death.

  Linfred's eldest son, Hardwin, married a beautiful young witch by the name of Iolanthe Peverell, who came from the village of Godric's Hollow. She was the granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell. In the absence of male heirs, she, the eldest of her generation, had inherited her grandfather's invisibility cloak. It was, Iolanthe explained to Hardwin, a tradition in her family that the possession of this cloak remained a secret, and her new husband respected her wishes. From this time on, the cloak was handed down to the eldest in each new generation.

  The Potters continued to marry their neighbours, occasionally Muggles, and to live in the West of England, for several generations, each one adding to the family coffers by their hard work and, it must be said, by the quiet brand of ingenuity that had characterised their forebear, Linfred.

  Occasionally, a Potter made it all the way to London, and a member of the family has twice sat on the Wizengamot: Ralston Potter, who was a member from 1612-1652, and who was a great supporter of the Statute of Secrecy (as opposed to declaring war on the Muggles, as more militant members wished to do) and Henry Potter (Harry to his intimates), who was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe, and served on the Wizengamot from 1913 - 1921. Henry caused a minor stir when he publicly condemned then Minister for Magic, Archer Evermonde, who had forbidden the magical community to help Muggles waging the First World War. His outspokenness on the behalf of the Muggle community was also a strong contributing factor in the family's exclusion from the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight'.

  Henry's son was called Fleamont Potter. Fleamont was so called because it was the dying wish of Henry's mother that he perpetuate her maiden name, which would otherwise die out. He bore the burden remarkably well; indeed, he always attributed his dexterity at duelling to the number of times he had to fight people at Hogwarts after they had made fun of his name. It was Fleamont who took the family gold and quadrupled it, by creating magical Sleekeazy's Hair Potion ( ‘two drops tames even the most bothersome barnet' ). He sold the company at a vast profit when he retired, but no amount of riches could compensate him or his wife Euphemia for their childlessness. They had quite given up hope of a son or daughter when, to their shock and surprise, Euphemia found that she was pregnant and their beloved boy, James, was born.

  Fleamont and Euphemia lived long enough to see James marry a Muggle-born girl called Lily Evans, but not to meet their grandson, Harry. Dragon pox carried them off within days of each other, due to their advanced age, and James Potter then inherited Ignotus Peverell's Invisibility Cloak.

  1. What change would 18% of wizards like to see to the requirements for membership of the Wizengamot? (source: Ministry of Magic poll)

     a. Average age lowered from 87

     b. Proof of pure-blood status

     c. Maximum of three years in post

     d. Goblin representation
#+end_quote

Obviously Goblin representation isn't even a thing, and I doubt that Dumbledore at least only served for three years.

Pure-blood status - given that the resurgence in obsession with blood status is actually fairly recent according to Pottermore - seems less likely than being a certain age, so as far as canon goes, I'd hazard a guess at just being an exceptional witch/wizard of sufficient age.

Charlus and Dorea were far too young to be Harry's grandparents, anyway. I'm still giggling over the name "Fleamont", but other than that I didn't find this very earth-shattering.

  JK Rowling has announced previously unknown details regarding her beloved character Hermione in a new piece of writing for her website Pottermore.
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  Published to mark the 9th redesign and relaunch of the Harry Potter website, Rowling's expose on Hermione's early life begins with her parents, Dan and Emma Granger. She described them as “two locally well-beloved dentists whose love of Shakespeare and mutual dislike for their plebian first names lead them to name their daughter Hermione." In a display of humbleness that emphasizes her connection to loyal readers JKR said this: "I would like to thank /U/cavelioness, who provided the inspiration behind Dan and Emma's names." Reddit user Cavelioness had this to say "F U JKR!".
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  The illustrious author went on to clarify that "Hermione had loads of friends before Hogwarts, I don't know where people ever got that idea". She goes on to detail how Hermione's love of My Little Ponies^{TM} as a child leads to her 2nd animagus form being a pretty, pretty pony."

** Hopefully this provides new fic material.

That said, I didn't find the information particularly interesting. I think I'll keep my (fanfic) version of Harry's lineage in mind, where the Potters are deeply rooted in the Peverells and their idea of conquering death.

Since the Potters and Voldemort are both descended from the Peverells, I found it sensible that both might focus extensively on defeating Death.

**** You make a good point. The fic I'm writing is going to be rather AU, anyways.

I always felt that Harry might, too, pursue immortality and cheating death. After all, death took away his /parents/. I find the idea of a Harry as focused on conquering death as Voldemort intriguing, but I understand it might not be everyone's cup of tea.

***** Oh, I don't have issues with AU, I have plot bunnies where Hermione is a Fay changeling, Harry has an older sister being raised by Snape (who isn't her biological father), and many other things that don't quite fit in with the books. I specifically like changing one big thing and trying to be canon-compliant beyond that, as far as it's possible. Just seeing that one change cascade through the story.

I was just pointing out that using the Peverell connection was a tad questionable. The idea of Harry pursuing immortality is certainly interesting.

Have you ever wondered if horcruxes require an emotional attachment to the object to be created? It would explain Voldemort's sentimental choices even though he is very intelligent. A grain of sand tossed into the Atlantic would be impossible to find and as such much better for the goal of immortality.

****** I haven't made many changes to canon (not yet, at least), but I do plan on having a few (seemingly) small things cascade down and make the story /very/ AU.

Harry will pursue immortality not only for himself, but out of hope...

I think Horcruxes totally require some level of emotional/sentimental attachment. Emotion is a potent source of magic. Perhaps creating a horcrux requires some sort of sentimental/emotional threshold, like a Patronus charm.

Immortality should be interesting to write about. In a society of magic, there must have been countless who understood that perhaps they might have the power to seek it. This allows for a great deal of AU/historical worldbuilding, I think.

**** Not really. The third brother was not the master of death any more than the other two. He still sought to evade death, and spent all his life using the cloak to do so.

Harry is not the third brother reborn, he's the culmination of the legend - a "4th brother" who is morally superior to the other three.

****** The story of the Hallows is not about immortality. None of the three brothers sought to live forever. Accepting your own mortality is not sufficient to become the "master of death" -- if it were, then /all three/ brothers were the master of death, because all of them accepted their mortality. The master of death is someone who has no fear of death, who doesn't seek it but embraces it when it comes.

Living your entire life under an invisibility cloak so as to avoid death is not the act of someone who does not fear death. Eventually taking the cloak off doesn't change that.

I do maintain that in the tale of the three brothers, he was presented as cautious but accepting of death, or at the least more accepting than seeking immortality as the comment I replied to mentioned. Any uniqueness regarding that is merely among those three brothers.

** So Harry's grandmother had pink hair?

It's about time we get the names of Harry's paternal grandparents. While Euphemia is lovely (I can't help but think of Euphie from Code Geass), Fleamont was wholly unexpected. Not only that, but that Sleek Eaze was created by him, bet that shocked all when they found out. Though it seems the creative potion skills jumped ship with James, as that he was more transfiguration orientated. This just makes me want more information on the "Marauder" years.
