** Finally, the three Deathly Hallows together for the first time!

A grey mist gathered up from the floor, and when it dispersed, a cloaked figure floated ominously in its place. It reached towards the inside of the cloak with bony fingers, producing a rolled paper.

"Here's your degree."

"My...what?"

"Your Master's Degree. In Death. You're now Master of Death."

"I...what? I thought that meant I would get to /control/ Death or something."

"No," it said, "being the Master of Death is like being a Master of any other subject. It doesn't mean that you control it, it just means you've gotten very good at /doing/ it."

"But I barely killed anyone. How can I be good at it if I know so little??"

"Death is such a vast field, of course you're not expected to know /everything/. A Mastery is about researching a specific subject in a broader area of study. Killing is just one of those, but I'm here to award you with a degree in..." it unrolled the paper. "...Dying. Congratulations!"

"...you know I only did that, like, once, right?"

"Which is one time more than anyone else in recorded history. Truly, a pioneer in the field. If you keep this up, you could get a Ph.D., become a Doctor of Death. Cool, isn't it?"

AS FAR AS IMMORTAL BEINGS GO, YOU'RE THREE FOR THREE Death somehow looks smug despite the lack of skin or musculature to display such emotion as he holds up three fingers.

FIRST THERE WAS THE FLAMELS, I'M COUNTING BOTH AS ONE, AS THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT. Death folds down a finger, silencing harry's attempt at interjecting with a look that a skull should not be capable of.

THEN THERE WAS THE BASILISK, IMPRESSIVE BIT OF SWORDMANSHIP. I PREFER THE SCYTHE, OF COURSE, BUT I DO KEEP ONE FOR ROYALTY. another finger down, another glare to ensure silence, the blue light within the skull narrowing to a pinprick.

FINALLY THERE WAS THOMAS RIDDLE. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO COLLECT HIM FOR A WHILE. this time even Death's impressive visage couldn't enforce silence.

‚ÄúBut i haven't killed him. He's waiting for me in the woods.‚Äù Harry's only response from the skull is a grin.

NOT YET, BUT YOU'RE ALMOST THERE! From within the folds of the imposing sleleton's cloak, an hour glass is extracted, seven extra bulbs sit around the upper bulb, all angled to fill their sand into the upper bulb. Only two still contain any grains however. NO, NOT LONG LEFT AT ALL.

Before harry could say anything more, the figure climbs upon a white horse that a moment ago harry would have sworn up, down and sideways didn't exist, but would now swear equally vehemently had been there as long as the skeleton had.

OH, AND GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR POSTGRAD. Death calls over his shoulder as he rids off into the trees.

----

Well, i started out with the thought that harry was doing quite well if you limited his count of kills to only immortals. And because there's only one way I can imagine Death...

I wanted to get something about The-Lady-We-Shan't-Mention-Lest-she-Leaves due to the nature of her eyes and how harry's eyes are often described, but i'll save that for another crossover.

** 2020 version:

Harry had gotten a letter for him a week after the battle of hogwarts. It was a short letter.

/Harry Potter,/

/We are pleased to inform you that your efforts in the field of dying has earned you enough credits for a graduation with a Mastery of Death. Please be at the Millennium Conference Centre, room 4B at 5:00 PM on June 2nd. The dress attire required is a black graduation gown and cap./

/Light refreshments will be provided./

/Sincerely,/

/Timothy A. Smith/

/Titles: The Grim Reaper/

So, simply because he had nothing else to do that day -- what, with the dark lord being vanquished and all -- Harry Potter purchased a cheap set of graduation wear and flooed to London. He found the convention center, then the room -- which was rather empty despite a good 200 places being set -- and snacked on the cheap fruit and overly sugary lemonade.

When 5:00 PM rolled around the lights dimmed and a creature reaking of the souls of the undead appeared on stage in a cloud of blackened vapor. They floated their way to the podium, procured a peice of paper from their pockets -- apparently death incarnate had pockets -- and tapped on the mic in front of them.

With an awkward cough they said, "Testing... One, two, three. Can you hear me?"

From the back of the huge and empty room Harry piped up, "Yes."

"Good... Well then. Greetings everyone. I'm so happy to see so many bright faces in the crowd..."

And on the ceremony went. There was a welcoming speech, words of encouragement from a local undertaker, an overly peppy video about success, and a speech from the valedictorian. For that one, Harry had to go up to the podium to read some prewritten drivel to an empty room. The Grim Reaper clapped politely.

And then /finally/ after a good 45 minutes had been wasted The Grim Reaper finally called Harry up to revieve his degree.

"Well done, Mr. Potter and congratulations." Death held out his certificate.

Harry reached to grab it and at the same time went to shake the being's hand.

Death shook his head, "I won't shake your hand."

"Why not? Will I die if I touch you?"

"No, don't you know? The CDC recommends as little physical contact between people as possible to slow the spread of corona."

"You're Death, for crying out loud!"

"And?"

"You're not a physical being. You're not flesh and blood."

"Your point is?"

"You don't get sick!"

"Ah yes. I don't. Better safe than sorry though."

Harry just sighs, "Fair point."

He takes his diploma and starts walking off the stage. Then he stops and looks at Death, "What exactly does this do anyways?"

"Oh, you could probably get a good job in the department of mysteries studying the veil of death. Or work at a morgue. Oh! And you also now owe the underworld 23k in debt."

Harry could've dropped dead just then, "For what!?"

Death shoots him an umipressed look, "Earning a Mastery in Death isn't cheap. The dying part is free, the temporary stay is 5k, and the resurrection bit is 18k. Good thing morgue work is open now."

"This feels like a scam."

"It is."

** Interestingly, Harry does have experience with Death from many different perspectives - enough to qualify as an expert in the broader field.

- He's killed Quirrell, a Basilisk, and Voldemort. The Flamels might also count indirectly, and I'm sure a few Death Eaters died because of his actions.
- He's been near-dead on many occasions, one of which was close enough that he saw glimpses of the afterlife.
- He's seen /plenty/ of people and creatures die - his parents, Quirrell technically, Basilisk, Cedric, Sirius, Albus Dumbledore, Dobby, a few during the Battle of Hogwarts...
- He's done research on ways to delay death (the Philosopher's Stone, Horcruxes) - if only to protect those ways from being used by a madman, or to destroy them.
- He's essentially witnessed each type of death from the Tale of the Three Brothers - he's seen /plenty/ of "killed by an enemy to gain power", Dumbledore who was wasting away and eventually committed suicide-by-Snape, and then he readied himself to die and greeted Death as an old friend.

I think that if anyone deserves a Master's Degree in Death, it's Harry.

Nope. Not accepting that. Unless you believe /only/ those checkpoints are sufficient. Which, by the way, were not something you stated as requirement in the post I responded to. And even if you did, I'd reject that requirement.

So, once again - plenty of soldiers died, killed, almost died, died almost completely but came back, saw their comrades die in various ways and learned ways of keeping themselves and their friends alive to qualify as experts in death.

Good points all. If there can only be *one* "The Master of Death", then the three Hallows have to be considered a requirement for graduation. If it's a small-t "the Master of Death" then there are probably folks with doctorates running around.

Soldiers can have mostly the same expertise (mostly - they "study" ways to survive short-term, but not to outright cheat death on a supernatural level) but never claim a Master's degree because they didn't enroll.
