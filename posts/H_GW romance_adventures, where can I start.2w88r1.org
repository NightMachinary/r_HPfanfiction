Hi everyone,

I know that there are a lot of H/GW romance stories around but I'm looking for a good written, novel length story. I'm kinda looking for a story in which Harry and Ginny have or are on their way to have a relationship with eachother and also that there is a plot. Not only fluff but also some action preferabbly. Does someone know something good? There's so much out there that I don't really know where to start looking.

Thanks

*** I second this one, it is the most profound fanfic I have read without the usual cliches. It is /literally/ perfect IMO... and has three parts! :D

** I'm on mobile so I can't link, but "Need" by iluvfanfics is my all time favourite H/G. Has amazing characterization and is basically a retelling of the series post CoS with Harry and Ginny forming a badass friendship and eventually falling in love.
