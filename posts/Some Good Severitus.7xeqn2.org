Just happen to be in the mood for some good Severitus fanfictions. I've already read some of the more popular ones, e.g. In Blood Only, Blood Magic, and Digging For Bones. No slash, please, and BioDad is preferable. Thanks in advance. Cheers!


** linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) is one of my all -time favorites

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Hindsight is 20/20, but when Harry's last steps into the forest set him back further than he'd ever thought, he never realised how grateful he'd be to have Snape there to help too. Mentor/guardian fic, time travel, but not cliched.

  Harry never could have predicted how much his life would change after making a surprising discovery at the Dursley household the summer before Second Year. The young wizard returns to school looking for answers, and ends up finding a whole lot more. Snape/Harry mentor fic. No slash.

  Voldemort is dead but Harry Potter's problems are far from over. Indeed, the very day after the battle, Harry Potter looks into a mirror and finds himself staring at a stranger and an old secret is brought to light. And what does this have to do with Severus Snape, still alive (unfortunately, as far as Snape is concerned) after being dragged out of the Shrieking Shack?

  It is only days later -- four, to be exact -- that Severus feels a twinge of something in his gut. He's carefully bottling potions when it hits, the desire for mist against his skin, dark ryegrass beneath his feet. A small boy with green eyes standing at his toes. [Sequel to What it Is.]

** "By Baker Street station, I Sat Down and Wept": It's a great story, and I like very much that even after the particularities of their biological relationship are revealed, Harry and Snape aren't fond of each other and forget about their troubled history.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
