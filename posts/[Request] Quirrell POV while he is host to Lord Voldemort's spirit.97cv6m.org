Do you know of any stories that attack this event? Or give feedback on the story below -- would you read it?

I had a plan for a story around a year ago. Of course we know that Quirrell met up with the impotent and powerless Voldemort while on his travels, but how did this occur? My general outline went like this.

--------------

*Quirrell POV*

Quirrell is on his requested sabbatical to study European magical creatures. Quirrell found evidence of broken animals that had been possessed and discarded by Voldemort as the powerless mage moved from host to host to survive.

In any case. Quirrell thought it unusual enough to warrant investigation and thus eventually uncovers an unusually sentient serpent.

My take on it was, Voldemort possessed a magical variety of serpent, bit Quirrell, then while Quirrell is on the floor incapacitated, the serpent looks in his eyes, and Quirrell in his disoriented state feels something slinking inside his mind. Voldemort is possessing him -- slowly.

Quirrell's last thought as he slips fully unconscious is an awareness of an echoing euphoria in the back of his mind.

*Lord Voldemort POV*

Voldemort stays silent for the time being, recuperating his strength as Quirrell picks himself from the floor, heals the snake bite, and finds the dead snake that Voldemort had previously possessed. Quirrell doesn't know what to think.

--------------

It gets a little murky after this bit, but the general scheme of things is -- Voldemort is privy to all of Quirrells' thoughts, but keeps his own hidden from the man. He witnesses Quirrell perform things poorly (spells etc.) and gives small mental pointers. Eventually Quirrell catches on that there is something taking a ride inside his mind. Of course Quirrell knows little of sentient wraiths etc. so he studies a lot. Voldemort can force his body to be sleepy, his mind sluggish, so he makes little progress.

Eventually it boils down to Voldemort saying that this arrangement is only temporary. And that while he has been silent he has not been idle. He knows Quirrell teaches at Hogwarts, and that the Philosopher's Stone is being secured there next year (for what reason, I don't know. Not to lure Voldemort, that's for sure). Quirrell tells the "voice in his head" to get out of his head. Voldemort says "I can't do that ... yet. If I did now, you would die. But if you can work with me to get the Stone, we can use it to separate us."

I don't know how Quirrell immediately responds to this, but the individual motivation is there for Quirrell to throw his all into retrieving the Stone. Perhaps he suggests to the other teachers that instead of advanced spell-work, which can be undone in unusual ways, that they use a more nuanced approach.

  You see, I don't think the protections on the Stone were poor, I just think that when Harry and co. went to save the Stone, that Quirrell had undone some tracking component. For the most part, Quirrell was able to skip through most challenges, but his greatest problem was Dumbledore's protection, and he hadn't the time to investigate it before the Charms went up. THEREFORE, he needs to get Dumbledore out of the castle, the protections undone, through the obstacles, then review Dumbledore's safeguard. If Harry hadn't come along, the Stone would be secure, with Harry being there, the Stone was revealed and at risk.

What makes the story unusual is that Quirrell doesn't immediately know that this voice in his head is Lord Voldemort. He firmly believes Voldemort is dead. And I believe through some neat writing, that a good story can be unraveled where Quirrell slowly understands that the voice is Voldemort, and that he CANNOT allow himself to get the Stone. Therefore he fights against it, Voldemort makes him stupid and pliable (thus the dithering, stuttering professor appearance), and slowly breaks the professor down. With good writing and scene creation from different POVs this could be really neat.

I would retcon a few things. When Quirrell dies at the end. He's screaming, but laughing at Voldemort's rage in his head. He has won, Voldemort has lost. It's a phyrric victory.

I think a few things could be rewritten to turn Quirrell into a hero of sorts.


** I like your take on Quirrell's perspective. You paint a story of psychological horror and quiet heroism. I would definitely enjoy reading that.

I've only seen a few stories that explore Quirrell's POV during the possession, and none of them go as in-depth as your outline does. Here are some links in case you want to see how different authors have portrayed it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] - A few sections of this story are told from Quirrell's POV. Quirrell couldn't afford to even think about defiance because Voldemort would pick up on any sub-vocalized thoughts. Therefore he had to internally be the perfect picture of submission until the last second when his resistance would make a difference.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12365453/16/The-Memento][The Memento]] - Ch 16 of this fic is entirely from Quirrell's perspective. Interestingly, it explores the idea that possession might have given Quirrell or Voldemort other mental issues, such as borderline OCD (lack of control over his body makes him obsessive about wanting to control his environment.) It also contains a brief flashback to the moment of first encountering Voldemort.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3577793/16/You-Know-Who][You Know Who?]] - The paragraphs in italics near the beginning of Chapter 16 show Voldemort's perspective right before he possessed Quirrell. In particular, this fic explores the idea that posessing serpents for a decade might have damaged Voldemort's mind until he started to think like a snake and forget what it meant to be a wizard. Rifling through Quirrell's memories restored part of his sanity, but not all.
