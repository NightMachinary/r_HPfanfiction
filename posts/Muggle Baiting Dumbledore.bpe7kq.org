I remember a (probably grey or dark Harry) story where Dumbledore goes to pick up Harry and while Albus is waiting he conjures some teacups and is aggressively smacking them against the Dursley's (who are trying to pretend nothing odd is going on) Dumbledore defends himself by saying “I thought you didn't get along” and Harry is just like - and thank you for proving them right.

So I was wondering if anyone knew which story that was and alternately if there are other (preferably complete) stories that show that for all he talks a good game, Dumbledore really doesn't like/think that much about muggles. TIA!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10300874/1/Weary-Wizard][Weary Wizard]], linkffn(10300874) -- "I never would have guessed that you enjoyed Muggle-baiting," Harry said.

But yes, canon, Dumbledore was baiting them a bit: "[Dumbledore] drew his wand ... the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys..."; "The Dursleys ... tried to ignore their glasses completely ... they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself." (HBP, ch. 3)

*** I believe that's not technically /Muggle-baiting/, because as the name implies, there is an element of trickery to Muggle-baiting; not only are you playing mean pranks on Muggles, but you do so with the unfair advantage that they don't know the existence of the magic you're using to do it. This is why Muggle-baiting is Wrong whereas Fred-and-George-style pranks between wizards are let off the hook with a wistful "boys will be boys" sort of smile and a slap on the wrist. Within this purview, it's impossible for Dumbledore to Muggle-bait the Dursleys as such, as they know full well he's a wizard and that he's the one responsible.

**** Fair enough - I was using the term more as “doing things to muggles they have absolutely no defense against and enjoying their displeasure with the knowledge that there is nothing they can do to stop you”

****** But that's a different department of the Ministry. That the one has heard about you doesn't mean the other did. That's a /completely/ different set of paperwork, which you can use the time you're not being prosecuted for Muggle-baiting by sending gold to the person supposed to file it.

** That awkward moment where you've read so much fanfic you can't remember what's canon - thanks for the replies, looks like it might be time to dig out the books for a reread!
