Not exactly what you're asking for but it has the best adult!Trio characterization I've ever read.

** *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]*: absolutely brilliant story. My only regret is that it's a little bit too short.

*** It seems like an origin story to me. Like, it sets up a really cool Dark Lord Britain that would be fun to explore in a sequel. Maybe put Harry against an outside force or pit some OCs in a rebellion against the Golden Trio.

**** That would be great to read. I felt the epilogue was mostly, "I'm done writing now, the end."

***** Well, I feel like the story fulfilled it's purpose. It promised to show us /why/ Harry became a Dark Lord and how he went about it. It was concise and had a common theme. If it had delved into action scenes and political moves and bribery, it wouldn't fit the "origins" theme of the rest of the fic. I was pleased that the whole thing stayed true to the goal of the story.

But I also /really/ want a sequel.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3955920/HalfASlug][HalfaSlug]] has a lot of little one shots. No actual long stories, mostly just the trio or just Ron and Hermione in casual situations. I'm mostly a fan of Twosome Tinsel and I'm Going to Kill You
