:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember that much, harry as young (don't remember how old, but I think he was pretty young) got sent back in time like before founders time, he learns alot, I think he becomes friends with the founders and kinda gets them or helps them to make the school. There is also 2 merlin that has gotten mixed to one in history, one of them is a young boy that goes to hogwarts and the second is and older guy.

This fic was pretty long don't remember much other than that it was really good.

**** It's actually the 2 Merlins that made me sure it was that fic. They simply lived at different times and the one who went to Hogwarts was named after the original Merlin. With time people started thinking that they were one person.
