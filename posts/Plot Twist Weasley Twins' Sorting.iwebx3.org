The Weasley kids always go to Gryffindor. Fred and George know this, of course, so what difference did it make if they swapped turns when called? It wouldn't matter, really.

Unless, of course, Fred happened to value loyalty just a bit more than bravery. Unless, of course, Fred walked up after hearing "Weasley, George" and sat under a cackling hat that exclaimed "HUFFLEPUFF" with the chaotic glee only a hat could have.

On file, a George Weasley was listed as Hufflepuff. On file, a Fred Weasley was listed as Gryffindor.

On a stool, however, it was a Fred Weasley whose stomach dropped as he was ushered towards Hufflepuff, a similar look of panic on the face of his twin.


** Well, except the Sorting Hat wouldn't be confused and would know who was who. Gred and Forge wouldn't be the first set of twins to attend in all the history of Hogwarts, and I'm pretty sure he'd be wise to all their tricks.

*** Yes but chaotic sorting hat just sorts whoever it's on, it doesn't care what Mcgonagall's list says and wouldn't bother to correct her. So long as it says the right house for the person it knows it's sorting

** I so love this idea, but I'm so used to fanon F/G, with Fred being the more outgoing, in charge twin. I hope someone can write it believably. It would definitely be an interesting read.
