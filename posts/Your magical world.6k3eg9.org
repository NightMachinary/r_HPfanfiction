** The wizarding world ought to be /different/ from the muggle world, not simply backwards.

Too many authors seem to take the stance: they have no electricity but they do have a train, clearly they must be trapped in the Victorian era!

LOL, no. The Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was codified in the late 1600's, making the point of divergence from the muggle world over a century and a half prior to the Victorian era. This is on top of having their own subculture for centuries before even that.

And they haven't stayed frozen in time or some such nonsense. They've been developing /in paralell/ to the muggles.

In short, visiting the wizarding world should be more like visiting a foreign culture than a trip to the past.

Any writer that wants to delve into parts of the wizarding world that aren't explicitly covered in canon needs to do some history homework combined with a good long planning session augmented by actual critical thinking before they make fools of themselves by jumping to ridiculous conclusions.

** - Population of around 10,000 (human wizards, in Britain).

- Everyone doesn't know everyone else, but everyone knows /of/ everyone else. Although geographically distributed, it has the feel of a small town.

- Appropriate political structures and economic institutions for such a small population (e.g. no elaborate constitutional processes, lack of separation of powers, decisions made largely through informal consensus, no stock market or sophisticated financial services).

- Mostly independent retailers who develop their own unique products. No sophisticated supply chains.

- A highly internationalist culture with much higher levels of international cultural and political integration than in the Muggle world (instigated by the statute of secrecy).

- Although the wizarding world is institutionally entirely separate from the Muggle world, familial and geographic connections act as a significant cultural influence on the wizarding world.

- As wizards are significantly less dependant than Muggles on infrastructure/organised society for their basic needs, a rather more frontier/anarchic culture.

- Nonetheless, a large % of public sector employment due to the statute of secrecy.

- Lack of delineation of public sector roles. Someone like Arthur Weasley writes and passes laws (legislator), implements them (civil servant) and enforces them (police). Division of labour in magical government appears to be by subject matter rather than type of activity. So Arthur has complete authority to write, implement and enforce laws relating to Muggle artifacts, while Aurors have the same with respect to Dark wizards, etc.

- Largely similar sensibilities to the modern Muggle world in terms of dating culture, marriage, etc.

- Blood purism having roughly equivalent status and perception as racism in modern Muggle Britain.

- Pureblood is not synonymous with nobility, the rich, or any kind of political class with a grip on political power.

- An approach to nudity which is more north Germanic than Anglo-Saxon (based on the Quidditch changing rooms, plus the fact than runes were in use for hundreds of years longer in wizarding England than Muggle England).

- Gender equality not just at law but also in practice and cultural expectations.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

Not really outside of the Seventh Book when the blood supremacists got control of the Ministry. Muggleborns were treated extremely well even before that, as the Minister For Magic in the 1960s was a Muggleborn himself.

********** Yes but what is the point you are trying to make with the quote? It's completely unclear what position you're trying to put forward.

My position is that my ideal magical world has true gender equality.

To illustrate this point I drew the comparison with legal gender equality, which is what exists in Western Muggle nations and is also what many people consider sufficient gender equality.

What exactly is your objection?

If it's that there is no mention in canon of gender equality laws then you have misunderstood the "not just as a law" wording, which was not a proposal that the magical world does have such laws, but rather as stated above an illustrative comparison to explain the nature of gender equality I am proposing exists in the magical world.

If it is that gender equality already exists in canon then you are making the false assumption that one's ideal magical world has to be AU. Canon /is/ my ideal magical world because I enjoy fics with a canon tone. But of course there are many interpretations of canon so I made mine explicit in my top level reply. I don't really understand how one could miss this since my entire post was clearly based on canon (given that I often referred to specific elements of canon to support the position).

If it's some other objection then I honestly have no idea what you're trying to say. I really don't understand this apparent inability to just say what you mean instead of making vaguely snide comments.

**** I much prefer a small wizarding population (e.g. under 15,000 in Britain). This is ultimately about a) maintaining the importance of individual powerful wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort and b) avoiding large scale magical battles. I think it is hard to maintain the fact that individual wizards are capable of turning the tide in a war, and the subterfuge/guerrilla/small skirmish style of wizarding combat, in the face of a large population. I also prefer the idea that wizarding society is less state-focused than the Muggle world, with international borders and nation-state governments meaning less. I prefer to think of the dynamic of the wizarding world as like a global conspiracy, Illuminati style, in which all wizards are complicit. The "other" are the Muggles, not wizards of different nationalities.

Accordingly I tend to think of Quidditch teams, for example, as far less commercial than Muggle professional sports teams. I picture many players having regular jobs in addition to being on Quidditch teams, and the general tone of the domestic Quidditch league as being similar to an amateur league in the Muggle world.

Similarly I prefer characterisations of the wizarding economy as much less sophisticated than the Muggle one. For example, no stock markets or developed financial services. Very little mass production, with most shops selling what Muggles would call "artisan" goods - each one slightly different, with one-of-a-kind items being commonplace.

Ultimately I don't feel like a small size belittles the wizarding world at all. I feel like it's a very Muggle way of thinking to equate scale with significance or power. But when a single wizard could probably take over the entire Muggle world (unless other wizards restrained them), the wizarding community does not need scale to be significant.

As for the maths behind it...

I generally go with a relatively small number of students at Hogwarts. The maths is something like this:

Average wizarding life expectancy (estimate): 150 years

Size of average Hogwarts year: ~60 students

(This is a compromise number. I completely ignore the interview number of 1000 as my metacanon places book canon far far above interview canon, so I take the books as priority. From what we see in the books, there appears to be around 40 students per year. But in PoA there's stated to be 200 Slytherins in the crowd at a Quidditch match, making an annual year group be around 114 students. I feel like ~60 is the closest you can get to the 114 figure without being too unreasonable in terms of compatibility with the tone of Hogwarts as seen in the books. Certainly it seems reasonable to me to posit that there were students with whom Harry never interacted or even noticed. Just think about how Cormac comes out of nowhere in HBP, but has apparently been there the whole time. But on the other hand, if you go much beyond 60 you begin to run into problems such as the small number of teachers relative to the number of students.)

On that basis:

Total Hogwarts student + alumni population: ~ 9000

That brings us pretty close to the figure of 10,000-15,000 I prefer. I feel like you can make up the difference with those who fall through the gaps of the wizarding world like non-Hogwarts British students, migrants, plus non-wizard magical "humans" like werewolves, vampires, hags, etc.

** - To begin with wizards don't dwel in hidden alleys and a couple of hidden schools. They have whole towns, countries, kingdoms and empires hidden from mundane eyes. Islands and stretches of land that normal people can't see, detect or even interact with. Seemingly unimportant and almost non-existant areas of space magicaly enlargened to be the size of a country or even continent.

- Wizarding history on our own little, blue planet is connected with wizarding history from other realms. Other dimensions and pocket-realms. How that happened? Magic. Some ancient pureblood families can still claim direct discendance from families hailling from those other worlds. Hell, MOST pureblood families share some relation to them. That's why international wizarding history includes all known parts of the history of those other worlds, dimensions and realms. In fact the most recent pocket-realms have a direct conection with the current magical world of our planet. They co-exist and live in a shared community. Thus our planet's magical world is merely a small branch of the larger magical history. Even though it has become the centre of attention for the past many hundred thousand years.

- The school system goes beyond high school. I mean sure, masteries DO exist in canon. But I am talking about whole magical academies. Universities and institutions that teach advanced magical stuff. Like: "Due to the tendacy of an object to completely repeat itself after a certain distance from it has been covered, all kinds of space dealing magic executed on a large scale need to be at least slighlty removed from our level of reality."

- Magic includes far more fields than what canon shows. Potions aren't a field by their own. Rather potions are used in different ways in various fields of magic. You have pure potionieering, potion based alchemy and in the art of receptariers (rare and hard form of potion and pill making magic). In a similar fashion the Charms course doesn't go over a single branch of magic called charms. It rather covers the basics of a lot of magical fields of knoweledge.

- To make it more diverse schools are larger, with a broader variety of subject to teach children. Each school has some similar and some different offered courses. That's to give a taste of variety and specialisation to each school. For example, Hogwarts teaches kinetomancy and wand making on advanced years. On the other hand Beuxbatons offers courses on elemntal magic and Archylet Academy (magic school I made up for my fic) has great courses in international magical history and law.

- The magical population varies depending on each country.

- So does the notion of what constitutes a pureblood. Magical Britain has other thoughts on this subject, Magical France others, The Magical Kingdom of Britanny also has its own views and so do the various autonomus communities that make up the magical side of Greece and its islands.

- Due to a longer history the magical side of the world developed parallel to the mundane one. It might seem they are un-developed and stuck to the middle ages, but that's because mundane people compare their standards to those of a 9999% different culture.

- There is an advanced, international economy system. Though it may seem more primptive and useless compare to the mundane one that's just a by-product of different needs and thus taking different routes.

- Politics is a strong part in the magical world. If you want your family to be something then at some point you must get involved in it.

*Centering on Magical Britain from now on:*

- Diagon Alley is just that, an alley. It's conected to Knockturn Alley but also to Straight and Narrow Alleys. It leads to a square known as Lukeward Square, a name attributed to the architect, Luke Ward. The square further connects Diagon to other streets and places, creating the largest city of Magical Britain.

- Other such cities exists. Hogsmead is a village but is still dozen times larger than what canon makes it.

- The population of Magical Britain closes on a good 200 millions or so people. But not everyone attends Hogwarts. Some opt for schools abroad or are home schooled.

- Thus more rooms and spaces of Hogwarts are used.

I could go on and on with this, but there is a reason I am writing my own fic at the moment.

** The magical world split off from the muggle world in 1692, and charted their own course. There is no United Magical America. There is no Magical Germany. There is Magical Prussia, Magical Bavaria, and an assortment of smaller magical German countries. Magical France didn't have a revolution. Magical Poland wasn't divided several times. The Magical Ottoman Empire still rules a big chunk of the Mediterranean. Magical Australia is not British, but ruled by Aborigines - and non-native muggleborns are sent to New Zealand. Wizards have their own culture, unlike in canon, far less sexist, but far less democratic as well, in general at least.

Perfect world for me is not too far away from canon I guess. There is a good amount of crazy interesting magic, social and political conflict, but most importantly a great amount of everyday magical stuff, that Rowling came up with. I love it in fanfiction when writers expand on the canon world, when the Daily Prophet is not the only "serious" newspaper, when there are actually not only 40 people in each year in Hogwarts, when there are other magical places other than Diagon and Hogsmead. In other words, when magical world seems more boundless and expanded. Also, I like it when authors try to come up with more traditions and customs that are unique to magical world(and I don't mean like in Lord Potter stories, more like small mundane things), and don't try to make magical world be like normal world.

** I hate it when I read that the wizarding world is "stuck in the Victorian era": the wizarding world enacted the status of secrecy more than a century before; additionally, it is quite possible that the Status was the end of a process (you do not hide a whole society just by taking the decision) centuries-long. It is a society who evolved in parallel, never totally separated, but different for a long time.\\
I hate it each time I read that horcruxes are frequent in Egypt: we know a greek invented them, but most importantly it denotes that the author has litterally no idea of the ancient egyptian society and beliefs (it's probably just a lazy way to bash Dumbledore because every egyptian curse breaker must know everything about horcruxes).\\
I dislike (hear, not totally hate, cause it's sometimes well done) when runes and arithmancy are the magical equivalent of informatics and physics/chemistry. Magic musn't be a science, magic cannot be a science (or it's just X-men with wands); I want magic to be magical, Potions are an art the like of painting (less brushes, as much colors, with additional fumes), charms is the application of will upon the world, transfiguration the expression of imagination, runes the poetry of magic, arithmancy and divination 2 facets of the same coin when it comes to interpret present and future.\\
I hate the black and white view of the sides of the war: the DE follow a monster, and most of them are ready to act monstruously - but it should not be impossible for them to have reasons other than Bellatrixian madness and cruelty (reactionaries who went to the deep end following the policies of the 60s are probably a thing).\\
I dislike when I see the argument that muggleborns are shunted by a pureblood society: reactionaries attacking a reactionary government (in which they already own all the power) does not make a good story; a pureblood government, for the pureblood, by the pureblood, would have seen a Riddle either minister by its 30th birthday (under the name Gaunt) or leading a muggle-born uprising.

Now a little imagination: wizarding England (and Scotland, Wales and Ireland) is an absolute monarchy, but without a monarch; the ministry (with the minister at his head) hold basically all the powers in absentia (the minister basically decrees anything he wants), and evolution in the ministry is done though bureaucracy (the heads of departments choose a new minister between themselves); the Wizengamot is a high court, elected, who does not vote laws but can take them down. France, the Kalmar Union and Hispania have similar forms of government. Most of Germany was more or less unified by Grindelwald in a republican form (they just elected not to have a high minister anymore since). Italy, the Balkans and Greece form the Empire of Ravenna, where the patricians form a "all-powerfull" senate (a patrician is someone rich enough to have clients/employees) and try to create themselves fiefdoms (no real luck since the 6th century, too easy for a wizard to just say "f**k it, I'm gone"). There is an academy in Delphi, which specialize in divination (funily enough, Delphi is the only city in magical europe where no substance is forbidden). The Khanates (again, absolute monarchies. In name.) reign over most of Asia and are constantly warring one against another, and frequently against the Han Dominion (full bureaucracy. With exams. Every year. think Azad in the Culture) and the Tibetans (a theocracy. kind of.).
