*** I don't get the appeal of Saving Connor. The writing quality is higher than average, sure---for a fanfiction. It subverts a few ‘wrong Boy Who Lived' tropes that make no sense, yes. But it leans into a whole bunch of others. The hat takes the kid's choice into account, always. There has canonically never been someone who was unsatisfied with their Sorting, and yet the hat in this story disregards all input and decides on Slytherin. Lily somehow thinks it's a good idea to train one of her children to be a soldier/babysitter for the other instead of doing something sensible, like hiring an Auror to shadow him. The anti-Slytherin sentiment from the other kids is turned way up in this one, too. Canonically, most of the students there are just, you know, people. It's not /actually/ the house of Pure Evil. It also embraces the weird ‘magical cores' things, which is a red flag on its own, and has Harry as some super powerful magical child who everyone can sense, which you'd think would come up earlier than it does. He can't be /that/ deeply in denial.

It actually invented many of those tropes. A lot of stuff in Saving Connor seems dated and cliche now, but it was pretty novel at the time.

*** This is one of my favorite parts as well. Personally I didn't like how meek and timid Harry turned out being, especially in regards to his relationship with Draco, but I understand that he had to turn out that way because of the way he was raised. My favorite part of the whole series was how being Light or Dark was actually separated into different subcultures of the Wizarding World. And having Light and Dark Lords as real magical titles that you earned through your alliance and magical power is something I enjoy seeing in fanfictions.

** One of my favourites, Harry Potter and the Problem About Potions!!

Harry isn't exceptionally smart, but definitely uses his head more and he is obsessed with potions. Very well written and doesn't lean too hard into any tropes. Every still feels pretty canon and in character, especially Snape and Voldemort.

***** When people call a fanfic an "Abused Harry" story they usually mean the abuse has been ramped up to 11 for no apparent reason.

Canon Harry: The Dursleys want to be seen as "normal" - so they can't hospitalize Harry or do anything that will have obvious signs to the public, because a visit from Child Protection would have ruined the illusion of normalcy for them.

Fanon Abused!Harry: Almost daily beatings, commonly broken bones. In the worst of the worst, rape is involved. Sensible readers shut off after Chapter 1 when they realize there's no way the Dursleys would get away with that much.

** Alright, time to once again bring up the controversial linkffn(Harry potter and the methods of rationality).

So Harry in this story is basically what you're describing, if a bit of a jerk. Some of the best parts of the story involve Harry being trained by an extremely intelligent professor Quirrel.

Most people either really love or really hate this one. Personally, I can't get enough of some parts and just can't stand others, so I'd recommend trying it for yo ur self to see what you think.

*** It's worth saying that it's a deeply flawed fic that I personally abandoned, but some people really like it if they can look past its flaws. I keep trying to like it, as I love the premise (which is the exact premise the OP wants), but there's some really hackneyed elements that are hard to ignore.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

Also, if you can't stand this version of Harry, there's a non-HP story by [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] with a similar rationalist theme, but much less self-righteous arrogant precocious child, linkffn(Pokemon: The Origin of Species).
