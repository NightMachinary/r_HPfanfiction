** I heard often that it was edgy af. Maybe I'll read it once.

And to be annoying, you should change your flair to "Recommendation" as you're recommending a fic and not "searching" for a specific one

*** It is edgy, but not in a way. It isn't edgy in the way that Harry is having a teenage crisis and hates everyone so he goes over to the dark side. Nu-uh, this fic is much better than that!

It is the best WBWL and dark Harry fanfiction I have ever read. It is so well written, the reasoning is amazing and the way Harry develops through the series is so right.

********* Similar to Antithesis? There's a few WBWL stories out there, but I personally tried to put a bit of a spin on it so there isn't really anything identical to Antithesis. I was heavily influenced by a time travel story called Fates Favourite- most of the Author's works (The Fictionist) are really good! I also have Diablerie in progress, but it's only 50K right now and is updating slowly.

** I saw this on AO3 the other day, but the tags made it seem really depressing. Are there some positives or is it just Harry having a horrible life for 7 years?

*** From what I can remember, yes, the story is depressing throughout. However, it's quite different from other stories I've read and you might find the relationships between the characters were very touching as I had.

** I got about half way through but I had to stop as it was just too dark and depressing for me.

Really great writing but not a pleasant read by any means.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
