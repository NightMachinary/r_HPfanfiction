I was wondering if there are any stories or fics where the dead come back to life or mysteriously return to life after the Fourth Wizarding war?

Mainly, the plot involves beloved characters like James, Lily or Sirius returning to life to a time of peace where Harry and others are grown and now have a familes of their own.

Thank you :)
