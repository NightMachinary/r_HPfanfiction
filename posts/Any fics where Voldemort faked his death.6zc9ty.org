** Uh I mean... didn't he kind of fake his death with the Horcruxes? Most people think hes dead. But he made sure he was set up so he would not actually be dead and could come back. Isn't that kind of "faking" your death?

Do you mean... fake his death so that he could live his life in peace in retirement on some island somewhere?

*** I mean faked it on purpose. Like maybe he was slowly losing and decided to have his men infiltrate the ministry or something. I've only seen a couple like that and they've both been entertaining reads.

***** One of them was where Dumbledore created Voldemort and Grimdewald to increase his influence and retired them to a beach side villa in France or something with their wives when it was time for them to be defeated. Can't find it though. I think it was on archiveofourown if that helps.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10129276/1/][The Dangerous and Deadly Voldemort]] was the other. Tom Riddle never actually exists in it.
