If Harry Potter had been sorted into Slytherin what would be the most plausible reaction of Severus Snape? How would he behave? And the others? How would Harry react after hearing all those things about Slytherin? How would he behave?


** He would be disappointed to have been sorted into the same house as Voldemort. But would probably get over it after having someone speak with him about Slytherins image. From Pottermore we know that the welcoming message even addresses the reputation of Slytherin. Its also possible that Harry allows the soulpiece to advise him so fits better in. We know it tried to get him resorted into Slytherin and may have talked more to him if he was one.

Snape would be pissed. And would still be mean to Harry, but more as a head of house rather then a potion teacher. And he would most likely give detentions rather than take points.

The students in Slytherin would be extremely happy to get a celebrity, but also because one of the more popular theorys why Harry survived was that Harry will become a more powerful dark wizard than Voldemort and death eaters believed Harry to be a second chance.

This is also the reason why basically everyone else would be a little wary of Harry. I think except Dumbledore nobody would treat him fair and more like Harry was treated in second year.

**** During a dream.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.

***** Ah, thanks, interesting. Personally, I wouldn't interpret the scene the way you do, as an attempt of the soul piece to get him resorted. More like a normal dream/nightmare where he processes what's occupying his thoughts. That the sorting hat wanted to place him in Slytherin comes up again at the end of CoS, so it is something that seems to linger in his mind uncomfortably. His dreams are described a few times during the books. But intersting theory.

****** Rowling confirmed that it was the soul piece that caused the sorting hat to consider Slytherin. And that the soul piece knew about Quirrel and wanted to join him.

Without the soul piece influence Harry would have no reason to connect Quirrels turban and Slytherin. The turban also causes him pain like the sould piece would.

I mean Quirrels turban talking to him and telling him to become a slytherin is obviously the the soul piece talking to him.

******* If the soul piece recognised Quirrel, then (to me) it seems more likely that this is Harry subconsciously picking up on it. But the soul piece actually talking to him, and potentially (as you mentioned above) advising him how to fit in better is fanon, in my opinion. I don't think the soul piece was actually capable talking to him or influencing him. Otherwise, it could also have tried with Gryffindor Harry to steer him towards a certain path, but it never even tried.

******** It couldnt influence him without Harry having a certain mindset. But it did influence him in Order of Phoenix because of his emotional state during the books. Rowling mentions how it feeds of his emotions and he feels it inside of him. Him being put in Slytherin could cause them to interact in a much more symbiotic manner.

but you should read the interview yourself

#+begin_quote
  MA: After we got back from Carnegie Hall, we brought back your message of how Harry is kind of not really a Horcrux. And I won't dwell too long on Horcruxes, but, I'd love to hear you talking about how he is or isn't, or wasn't.

  JKR: Well, I tell you-- You know what, this will not end the discussion. I know that, and you know that. But here is the thing. For convenience, I had Dumbledore say to Harry, "You were the Horcrux he never meant to make." But I think, by definition, a Horcrux has to be made intentionally. So, because Voldemort never went through the grotesque process that I imagined creates a Horcrux, with Harry, it was just that he had destabilized his soul so much that it split when he was hit by the back-firing curse. And so this part of it flies off and attaches to the only living thing in the room. A part of it flees in the very close-to-death limbo state that Voldemort then goes on and exists in. I suppose it's very close to being a Horcrux. But Harry was not-- did not become an evil object. He wasn't-- he didn't have curses upon him that the other Horcruxes had. He himself was not contaminated by carrying this bit of parasitic soul. The only time he ever felt it stirring and moving was in "Order of the Phoenix", when he himself goes through a very dark time. And there's a moment where he's looking at Dumbledore and he feels something rear like a snake inside him. And of course at those times, it's because the piece of soul inside him is feeding off his emotions. He's going through a dark time and that piece of soul is enjoying it and making its presence felt. But he doesn't know what he's feeling, of course. Also I always imagined the Sorting Hat detected the presence of that piece of soul when Harry first tried it on. Because it was strongly tempted to put him in Slytherin. So that's how I see it. Now, I know that won't end the debate, but I do think that the strict definition of Horcrux, once I write The Scottish Book, will have to be given and that the definition will be: the receptacle is prepared by dark magic to become the receptacle of a fragmented piece of soul and that that piece of soul deliberately detached from the Master Soul to act as a future safeguard or anchor to life and to safeguard against death. So that doesn't clear anything up but it elucidates what I believe. But I don't think it's necessarily going to convince people who have a strong feeling, one way or the other, on the matter. You know what, that's been the case with most of "Harry Potter". I gave my explanation and it just fuels more debate.

  JN: I was thinking, as you were talking about that, just a second ago. I've just been reading "Philosopher's Stone". There was a chapter when Harry goes to sleep for the first time, and he's in his dormitory, and he has this dream that he doesn't remember again, that he was being tempted to go to Slytherin. I thought maybe at that point, that might have also been that little piece of Voldemort in there, wreaking havoc on his dreams really early on.

  JKR: Well, of course, the pain he feels whenever Voldemort is particularly active, is this piece of soul seeking to rejoin the Master Soul. When his scar is hurting him so much, that's not scar tissue hurting him. That's this piece of soul really wanting to get back out the way it entered. It really wants to-- It entered this boy's body through a wound and it wants to rejoin the Master Soul when Voldemort's near him, when he's particularly active, this connection-- it was always there. That's what I always imagined this pain was. Yes. So. There you go. There's a moment when Dumbledore casts a charm and you see a two-headed snake split--

********* Thanks for copying this here, I actually am aware of this interview. I still don't think that the soul could have interacted with him in an advising way, that it could have spoken to him. When he went through a dark time it fed on his negative emotions and made its presence known in a rather crude way, and when it did Harry's scar burned fiercely, but subtle manipulation, conversations even, is in my opinion beyond it. (Edit: And I think if it was capable of that, then we would have seen it try to influence Harry at some point during this dark time, e.g. by exploiting his anger against Dumbledore)

While it's cool that JKR has done a lot of interviews and made post-book statements about stuff, if it's not in the prime canon itself, I tend to ignore it. It's a lot less interesting too, in this case, than Harry /naturally/ being suited for either house, but his choice being the thing that mattered in the end.

*** I'd think Hermione would treat him fairly - she was never one to follow the herd, see: House-elves, and she wouldn't have been indoctrinated against Slytherin (although she'd get hit with their bigotry quickly, Harry might step in there or at least, not join, seeing as he was bullied by Dudley at home).

**** Hermione has read about Harry and surely knows about the theory's for Harrys survival, him being sorted into the house known to produce dark wizards would mean a lot to her( and she knew about the reputation of houses). Hermione is smart but she is still a little girl and would avoid the person who everyone assumes is going to be a powerful dark wizard and pure-blood champion. Its not like they had any positive interaction before that makes everyone seem wrong. And the house-elves were a cultural thing, Harry is a perceived danger.

Honestly I would assume that Hermione would try even more to outshine Harry in class to impress the Gryffindors and make friends with them by making a `dark wizard´ look bad. Causing Harry to dislike her even more than he did at the begining in canon.

And the moment it gets known that Harry is a parselmouth she would have fully made up her mind about him.

Also I doubt that Harry would get involved in Hermiones confrontations with Slytherin simply because most of them are fights between girls and even canon Harry barely cared for those.

***** I disagree there. It wouldn't take much for Hermione's sense of justice to be riled - nor for Harry's "saving people" trait to come to the fore. Snape being unfair towards both or Draco trying to torment them could easily form a bond as well.

It's author's choice - you can justify either outcome.

I think we remember early book Hermione differently.

When Draco was making fun of Neville and attempted to take his Remembrall only Parvati and Harry spoke up. Hermione only got involved when they started to disregard the teachers instructions and started to fly, because she thought she would also get in trouble.

********* Yes early book Hermione was a very not nice person to be around! :( I would not have been her friend if she was real, and also Harry and Ron spent a lot of time telling her to shut up and leave them alone when she kept harassing them and stalking them everywhere in first year. Harry was even angry and done with her about it.
