*** Heya, just read this off the comment here and I'm up to the current chap. Such a well executed idea! I love how snobbish the riddles are - totally fits with cannon - and how well the family has integrated into wizarding society.

The only point of criticism that I can offer is that things seems a bit rushed/ time in the story seems too streamlined. Its hard to tell but it feels like only a week or two has passed in the story since she arrived, but they've DONE so much in the story that it feels jam packed with the wizarding culture, like she's been there months already.

Are you sold on the Hermione/Tom Riddle senior pairing? The more I explore Tom's character the more I dislike the pairing, honestly. I'd rather Hermione be a bamf and... I dunno, make waves as an inventionist, or teaching duelling, or duelling itself. You've set her up to go so far with her skills that pairing her to Riddle, to me, feels like locking her down. He's so derogatory to her, especially to her looks, and while its certainly probably a truth within the story, it doesn't make me look forward to the pairing. Perhaps just my past experiences of being needled at in a emotionally toxic way, but I just don't see the two of them being together particularly healthy.

Looking forward to when Hermione explains the future travelling, the lies are grating after a certain time lol. And no doubt the riddles will take every advantage they can from the future items (bag) and information that she has... Really want to see that capitalization, if it happens that way.

Really respect what you're doing here! You may want to check out the fantastic beasts movies for additional ideas of how to use magic in the everyday world. There are some really cool spells in those movies and while the movies themselves weren't that great, the glimpse into the life of a regular old wizard is invaluable to the imagination. They also play around with including muggles into the wizarding world and it's in the total opposite way that you do it - they don't blend in at all lol.

Thanks for writing!

**** I know it feels rushed, but I have SO much plot to get through, it's hard to fit it all in.

I realize that after chapter 8, my readers must all want to rescue Hermione from those scheming Riddles, and possibly kill Tom. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but rest assured that after many convolutions of the plot, and some serious personal growth, this actually works out. I've written some dark stories, but this isn't one of them.

I should probably see the Fantastic Beasts movies, but I haven't even seen most of the Harry Potter movies. I'm more of a book person. From what I've seen from the trailers, the FB movies contradict some book canon, so I figured that trying to base my story on contradictory source material would be confusing.

*** In one sentence, why doesn't a war-weary Hermione simply kill Voldemort and focus on the more important things, namely that small business called Second World War?

Leaving Voldemort alive is nothing but gambling with the lives of his future victims, including but not limited to her best friend's parents. And why would Hermione choose a few hundred/a thousand magicals over 50 Million people? Her own grandparents were almost certainly involved in the war effort, so she has a personal interest besides preventing one of the greatest tragediin human history.

Some babies are just born evil, you seem to be saying, so the best thing to do is kill them. That happens to be the same argument actual Nazis used to kill actual babies in WWII. They thought they were improving the future by doing that. (Of course, they didn't have any actual knowledge of the future, unlike Hermione, but the logic was the same.)

******* The difference is that Voldemort isn't just possibly dangerous, he is proven to do so. And leaving him alive is dangerous. One mistake, one second of inattentiveness might be enough for Voldemort to escape, to disappear. And then blood will be spilled. Unnecessarily, I might add, if a certain time traveller would have just killed the madman when she had the chance. Comparing that to crimes against humanity is just bad taste.

Voldemort had no qualms about killing Myrtle. He killed his father for being raped. He killed that Smith woman over a bloody cup.

Obviously, the orphanage wasn't an ideal place to grow up, yet the other children there didn't became genocidal fascists bent on racial extermination. That was pure Voldemort on his own.

I originally asked the author for a one-sentence explanation for why Hermione does not murder a magical fascist leader when he is most vulnerable, especially considering the fact that Hermione came from after the war. Depending on the answer, I might or might not be interested in the story. Instead of the one sentence, I got an argument about the ethics of intertemporal executions but still no answer why Hermione wouldn't kill Voldemort.

******** Well, to be fair, you do have quite the talent for getting yourself into these sorts of arguments. Possibly because /you/ keep bringing up Hitler all the time. Given the time period of OP's story, your question was certainly valid but at the same time... not everyone wants to read fanfiction dealing with real world Muggle issues. It's perfectly okay for someone to tell a story that doesn't deal with that.

OP clearly said that there would be future chapters dealing with this topic and that Hermione is taking Muggle issues seriously, sounds to me like anything more could be a spoiler. If this wasn't sufficient for what you would want out of a story you could have just washed your hands at this point and moved away from the argument.

Bringing back medical advances, ensuring that ancient knowledge is preserved, whatever. So why the point about the Internet? How would she even do something like that?

No, I joked that she might as well deal with Hitler (and Stalin) because the internet was not yet invented so she might as well get going with that (since dicking around on FB isn't possible yet).

As for the Hitler question, what else would a time traveller in the 30s do? The main question was always about killing Voldemort, not what she does afterwards.

The ethical argument /is/ the reason why. You asked why Hermione would choose not to kill a baby who has not committed any 'evil' actions, and the ethical argument (nature vs. nurture, etc.) explains why it is rational for her to choose not to. Your question was answered; whether or not you can agree with the logic of the answer is a different matter.

********* That is an entirely unsatisfactory answer for someone in Hermione's situation for two reasons. It would have been valid if you dropped a random person in front of baby Voldemort who did not know Voldemort, but:

1) Hermione just lived through a war against Voldemort where she lost people she held dear. Voldemort, through Umbridge, was purging her entire people. Voldemort killed her best friend's parents, he and his supporters are behind pretty much everything wrong with the magical world. She would have been exposed to countless atrocities, taken many lives, lost friends and so on. Is that a good base for being merciful?

2) Hermione is the best example of "the ends justify the means" we get in the books. Just look at Umbridge, Marietta, Snape (in PS) or the Polyjuice plot. Hermione didn't even bat an eye at the illegality of that one. Dumbledore with his second chances might give Voldemort a second chance, but do you really think that the girl who underhandly cursed the DA list would have a moral issue with killing Voldemort, time travel or not?

********** My traumatized Hermione just lived through a war in which innocent children were killed, just because of the way they were born. It really isn't a stretch for me to say that she would be extra opposed to baby-killing after that.

In canon, she put a curse on the DA list that people willingly signed. Baby Voldie didn't sign anything. He didn't ask to be born, or raised in an orphanage in which he never knew love. The situations are completely different. If you can't see that, I'm concerned about you.

**** Exactly, even if Tom Riddle only had a 1% of chance of becoming Voldemort, the risk was already too high. Of course, the odds were magnitudes higher in canon.

A traumatized, time traveling Hermione would absolutely kill the young Tom Riddle. Anything less would be gambling with the lives of thousands.

I might advocate letting some other bad guys, such as Barry Jr and Bellatrix, off the hook for now and put them under observation first. But I will be totally merciless and paranoid when it comes to Tom Riddle, that person is simply too dangerous to be kept alive.

However, this does not make for a good story, so I'd like to go one step further. As the butterfly effect would have it, killing young Tom had the unpleasant consequence of Grindelwald winning. With Dumbledore dead and Nazis secure in power, Hermione must fix the mess she had unintentionally caused.

** Almost all of my suggestions will be Harmony or no pairing. There is exactly one Dramony I enjoyed, and it was one where canon Hermione got sent to a reverse universe where good guys are bad and bad guys are good.

*Main character*

A little Child shall lead them is gold. Baby Hermione fixes everything. WARNING: you will cry at chapter 5 linkffn(10871795)

Escape is great fun where Hermione sees a marriage law and nopes all the way to America. linkffn(11916243)

Patron was already mentioned.

*As a shared main/secondary character*

One of four dimension lost characters in Stages of Hope. linkffn(6892925). Great war weary Hermione.

One of three main characters in Sum of their parts. Very true to canon characterization: linkffn(11858167)

*As a secondary character*

Nice supportive Hermione (with unrequited love) in Sand in the hourglass. Sequel is set up for her to be a main character. linkffn(12188150)

Not Hermione centric, but Red Knight has a very interesting broken Hermione linkffn(12141684)

The grammar and spelling mistakes are pretty bad but worse for me are the massive inaccuracies. At some point Hermione uses Evanesco */on herself/* what the hell? And too many plot points which are under-developed and rely on characters just being stupid, e.g. Harry and Ginny not carrying wands on them. Anyway, just needed to rant a bit cause that story could have actually been really good with some betaing, as it is I definitely think it's by far the weakest suggestion on this list.

  After the war, Draco Malfoy flees to France, expecting to find refuge from the Ministry.

  "Are you familiar with Time-Turners Miss Granger?" The question was the catalyst that sent Hermione back on a secret mission to stop Voldemort before October 31st, 1981. Her work with the original order was important, but clearly nobody relayed this to her partner. Young and not yet tainted by the pain of loss and Azkaban, Sirius Black was a lot harder to manage than Ron or Harry.

** I've written a few short stories with Hermione in them, playing various roles from lead to wingman/best friend. Nothing with a deep-running plot, instead the focus is on the characters and their interactions.

In /Under Guard/, Hermione has a run-in with Tonks and develops a crush (femslash, obviously).

/Bad at this/ is my take on the whole "friends with benefits" idea after I got fed up with too much angst within that subgenre. Not explicit.

And /Drool/ has Hermione as friends with both Harry and Fleur, so she sets them up for the Yule Ball. Mostly comedy.

This fic follows canon from the perspective of Hermione writing in a diary that interacts with her. I don't know how to describe it more appealingly but it was a really thorough and interesting way to look into canon events from another perspective and I didn't find it dull or repetitive at all.

Unfortunately it was abandoned at the 5th book which was a real shame but it's a fantastic fic all the same.

Again not pointing out problems with people's taste, just pointing out why a relationship could not work between Hermione, Riddle, and/or Snape unless you change their stories drastically, and their core character. If you have basically canon Hermione from say fifth year all of a sudden develop a crush on canon Snape, it's not in any way believable. The actual problems are that if you don't massively overhaul the story, and/or the characters, it's not going to be in any way believable, which will make a very poor story(quality wise). I do hope you can understand the mechanics of creating a story, otherwise this discussion is pointless.

********* You seem to believe that relationships are believable only if the partners are perfectly matched, close in age, have lots in common, and believe the same things. A young muggleborn would never have a relationship with an older blood-purist. Similarly, in real life, a young immigrant woman would ever marry a much older, extremely anti-immigrant politician, for example. Relationships like that just don't exist even in fiction, certainly not in real life. Even if they did, there would be no point reading about them. Stories are interesting only if they contain no conflict, and the characters agree on everything.

Don't just go the passive-agressove route, and downvote me. That solves nothing. I mean you do all know that canon Hermione as a character would never even think of Snape, and Riddle in that way. You do also know that they are both killers minimum, and you also know that unless she's left Hogwarts at the time, she'd be underage. I don't get what's so hard to understand about that.

**** I'm gonna just point out a technicality here. Hermione in canon was at least 17 years old in 6th year, which, in the Potterverse is the wizarding age of majority. If you have issues with this, she could quite plausibly be 18 during sixth year, which voids your underage argument entirely.

As for why so many people like the pairing, I, for one, have daddy issues and my relationship with authority figures (males particularly) is difficult. I have never slept with a man who is not my type, but, and this may be TMI, I have been whipped and tied by men 20-30 years+ my senior, and I have played with them in a sexual capacity without any intercourse. It's a lot to do with what the person can provide you and what you can give them. In my case, if you're holding a whip, I'll wait until I've assessed your skill with it, then I'll probably approach regardless of age or appearance.

***** That's all good, and well, but the argument i'm trying to make is that canon Hermione wouldn't do that in any way. It's fine if your into that, and writing a story based around that is fine too, but if someone's going to make a Snape/Hermione story(or Riddle), you've got to change the characters in a major way. Either by changing the story, or the core character itself, butt it has to be donein a believable way otherwise it'll be a poor quality story.

****** I understand what you're saying, but the point I'm trying to make is, essentially, this: some of the men that I've been with, either short-term or long-term, are men that ‘canon' me wouldn't be with in any way. I know Hermione's personality is made quite clear in canon, but it also leaves a lot to be explored. I can't believe that a woman of her type would be satisfied with Ron. Whilst opposites attract, there do need to be some common interests and they have little beyond Harry and the war. Hermione and Snape have more interests in common and, in my opinion, more compatible personalities; such as a love of books and an ability to read, sitting in silence, for long periods of time without the need for constant conversation.

******* Yes, but they are still not compatible. Snape will never truly get over Lily, nor can I see him looking at Hermione that way. Period. Also Hermione is someone who'd probably go for Draco before someone like Snape. You can't just point out a few things they have in common, and expect for a relationship to spring up. They're are way to many people out in the workd for both Snape, and Hermione. What your doing is thinking of it in a way as if there is no-one else, but the problem is that Snape would probably never get into a relationship, and Hermione without(forced in my opinion) Ron is more likely to go out into the world, and explore it. Snape, and Hermione are just too different, and at two wildly different stages in their life that forcing them together is incredibly unlikely, and too unbelievable unless you change their characters a lot.

Their age is also something that'd be difficult to overcome, because even if she's 18, Snape is still much older than her, and Hermione(unlike you) has in no way shown even the tiniest flicker of interest in older man. So again, unless you make changes to their core characteristics, and the story to explain it, it'll not be in any way believable.

******** I disagree with you on many of those points. And I'd like to bring up the theory of Snape having Aspergers, but it's 2019 here and I would like to go to sleep. I obviously didn't list all of the reasons that they would be compatible because that would be a fairly long list and it was already late at night when I joined this conversation. Let's agree to disagree.

In future, maybe make a separate post in the sub for questions like the original one, which I didn't get to see, but would assume is similar to the comment I responded to, rather than making the comment on an existing post where you are likely to receive nothing but downvotes because you may come across as attacking people's personal preference.

Edit: Your question/opinion would have been appropriate on a ‘Discussion' thread, but is not suitable for a ‘Fic Search' and recommendation thread.

********* In the end it's only a theory. While you may disagree with me on many points, those points are based on facts of the character, while your points are centred on a fantasy of the character. Good night.

Simply call them war criminals. I think every important Death Eater we see violates Article 23 of the Hague Convention.

Also, OP was just listing things. I doubt you could fit femslash and a Malfoy or Riddle pairing into the same story m

***** Well, a lot of the tropes which make Malfoy an insult to good fanfiction are impossible with a female version of him. So it would most definitely be an improvement.

Or let's put it that way, a fanon Fem!Malfoy would be slutshamed into oblivion and not called sex goddess. A twelve inch cunt would be a really odd description. And abs aren't part of the female beauty ideal (even though they look awesome on women).
