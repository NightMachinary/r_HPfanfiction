:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where they are talking about fashion probably with Hermione and talk about how they really want some.muggle fashions to come in, that wizarding fashion hasn't changed because of some sort of propriety board? But Hermione might be doing something to revolutionize everything.

This isn't a huge plot point but it helps flesh those two out if anyone knows.

Otherwise any other stories that flesh out wizarding society are appreciated

** One of many subplots of [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/7__Honest_Abe/][This Means War by Jeconais]] and they talk directly with Harry who agrees to be their investor (and the story is Hinny and Romione, so there is a way less Hermione there).

You might like *Novocaine*, by /StardustWarrior2991/. linkffn(13022013)

It's a post-war, rebuilding the Wizarding world type fic... in which Harry goes full philanthropy.
