I'm looking for fics where Harry starts its own school.


** The Cupboard Series by Stargon1 has them starting a new school, but that doesn't happen until fourth year.

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.

** Also Proud Parents by RobSt. He states outright that it's a reimagining of Knowledge is Power, so it is nearly identical at the beginning. linkffn(12879819)

There was a one-shot I read, can't remember the name, where McGonagall is sent to check out a new school that seems to be getting all the Muggleborn students and I think now is making inroads into the halfbloods also. Albus has been trying to get information on the school's administrators but has been stymied so he sends McG to try to learn enough to get some leverage against them. The teacher she meets with turns out to be Hermione. Harry is the Headmaster but I don't think she learns that. This is a "systemic pureblood prejudice" story where muggle-born have no place in society (but they don't tell them that when recruiting for Hogwarts).

I'm assuming you want schools that compete with Hogwarts. I also know a couple where Harry starts a primary school.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione

And along with another commentor I swear I read a story where harry and hermione opened a school in direct competition with Hogwarts for the muggleborns which included mundane subjects as well. I also believe that they started them before 11. But for the life of me I can't find it.
