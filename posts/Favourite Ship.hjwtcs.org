Mine is :

Honks/Harry x Tonks

Haphine/Harry x Daphine

Harmione/Harry x Hermione

Harry x Fleur

Harry/Narcissa

Harry/Bellatrix (But only where she was controlled by a marriage contract, basically Bellatrix Black instead of Bellatrix Lestrange)

THIS IS ONLY REFERENCING HETROSEXUAL

HARRY X PAIRINGS

Referring to Canon Characters

I am only referring to monogamous pairings in this post and I don't have them in a specific order I just typed them as I thought of them which is why it isn't numbered.

And I don't mean smut this is supposed to be a SFW post üòê

** I agree with all of your pairings though I would change their "rankings". Of course I also like trios made out of the same pairings (eg harry is head of house Black and house potter). And then you can add multi until you get into full harems.

1.  Harry/Hermione/Luna

2.  Harry/Hermione/Fleur

3.  Harry/Hermione/Tonks

4.  Harry/Fleur/Tonks

5.  Harry/Fleur/Luna

6.  Harry/Hermione/Daphne

7.  Harry/Narcissa/Bellatrix

8.  Harry/Bellatrix/Tonks

9.  Harry/Bellatrix/Narcissa/Tonks

10. Then mix and match the above ladies to get various foursomes and up, adding girls such as the Patils, Bones, Davis, Abbott, Li, etc

**** Well I have to warn you I have a high tolerance for cliches/tropes/and bashing and several authors that many here don't like. My only criteria is does the story keep me entertained none of the rest bothers me. With that said here are some Harry/Hermione/Luna recommendations.

But first since the OP was looking for single pairings.

There's Luna's Hubby by Meteroricshipyards

linkffn(2919503)

Lovegood, Boobs Gooder by nonjon for a double dose of Luna

linkffa(216)

For Hermione fics try

Beauty of a Full Moon by Ares.Granger

linkffn(10057731)

Banking on Her by RobSt

linkffn(7392700)

Now for the trio

Achieving Clarity by PerfesserN

linkffn(4960786)

A nice little short Harry Potter and the Bro Code by erbkaiser

linkao3(14771979)

Faery Heroes by Silently Watches

linkffn(8233288)

Fates Gambit by RobSt

linkffn(5210983)

If you want any other trio recs start another post for the trios you want from my list as I don't want to clutter up the OP's post more than I already did.

****** Thanks for the recommendation!!

I also love how Hermione could have helped Draco to get rid of his bias and prejudice.. That's why so far my favorite Dramione fanfic has always been Isolation by Bex-Chan..
