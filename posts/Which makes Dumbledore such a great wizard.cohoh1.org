** He invented the deluminator. He created that method of patronous messages. He did alchemy work with Nicolas Flamel. Received an award for outstanding spell work and alchemy before he left Hogwarts. He was also published in Charms, Transfiguration, and Potions academic journals before he left school.

As you mentioned, he's a hell of a duelist. The majority of the magic he performs outside of dueling is subtle, but I don't think many can nonverbally conjure hundreds of sleeping bags at once. According to himself he could make himself damn near invisible with the Disillusionment Charm. Contrast /that/ with Moody's and you see how impressive that is.

He also planned a war like 5 years in advance.

** He worked with NICHOLAS FLAMEL, a guy that's like 400 years old, I don't think Flamel would have worked with any wizard he found on the street, and I think the book mentions that he has the highest score ever in his OWLs

** His duel against Grindelwald was probably even more impressive than the one he had against Voldemort in the ministry and if a lot of people saw that he would be considered a massively powerful wizard. And after that he was the headmaster of Hogwart which means that every student that isn't told otherwise by their parents( probably only pureblood slytherins) respects him immensely. It is also said that his academic achievements were reported in the daily prophet since he was a fifth year. Additionally he also has a major position in the british wizarding court and he has a position in the ICW(I think that's canon, tough I'm not sure could just be some fanon that everyone uses.)

** The beard. Can't be a great wizard without a magnificent beard.
