:END:
I remember that Harry was a prisoner and Hermione was brought in and had to work out what Harry was writing. Harry escaped with Hermione and he wants her to do a ritual? with him because he only has half a soul. It also had a very powerful Harry and he had been trained by Dumbledore. I think it had runes in it? Also Dumbledore died and Harry used half his soul to revive Dumbledore. I think he blew out his soul using his wand or something idk?
