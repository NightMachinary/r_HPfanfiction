It's a bit dead though. Who wants to revive it?


** Could be interesting. As a test run;

Q) How would you go about tying your shoelaces in the most paranoid way possible?

**** Velcro is too easy for your enemies to undo, allowing them to steal your shoes right off your feet.

*** Glue my feet into the shoes and tie them with steel laces that I then weld together so that the only way to get them off is to remove my feet. Cover the steel wire with a velcro or cloth strip and regular laces to lure the enemy into a false sense of security.

*** Option 1:

1. Build a doomsday shelter
2. Start a doomsday cult
3. Make the cult reach a global size
4. Find a way to start WW3 with your cult
5. Hinde in your shelter and wait until the world ends
6. Hinde in the wardrobe and tie your shoelace

Option 2:

1. Make a ginger person who's wearing shower robes and has a massive crush on you stand in front of you
2. Get your shoelace tied

*** I suspect it involves acquiring all of the materials and crafting shoes and laces personally. Probably using some rare materials, personal enchantments, and home brewed potion treatments.
