  [[https://youtu.be/FtNzgvoussk?t=33][power crawl - the speed and force in which a character's strength increases thoughout an action serial]]
#+end_quote

Good power crawl is where a character, as they develop, become progressively stronger and stronger so the payoff when they defeat the final villain is most fulfilling. For example, when Harry is already OP, then him defeating Voldemort really doesn't mean anything. But when we see Harry rising from someone barely introduced to magic to a respectable force while developing a plot, character, emotionally, etc. the fulfillment is much greater.

Anyone know any fics with well handled power crawl?

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

**** Just power through the first chapter, after that one I was hooked. It's an Ender's Game crossover (basically it's just HP with EG undertones so you don't need to know anything about EG to understand the story) and I'm a big EG fan so it was easy for me to get into.

There are a few very violent scenes toward the end of third year. Be aware of a potential trigger related to suicide.

**** Once you find out how she is able to do what she does it stops being a wank fest. This Hermione is quite different from Canon, her only friend has been Neville and with the schools push for rankings it just made her that much more competitive. Some of her bad qualities from Canon are magnified here as a result of the changes but I think it makes sense.

I was hooked on the story from the beginning but I would encourage you to read a few chapters to get a better feel of the story.

** I second linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin).

Harry begins learning Occlumency in Year 1. 2 years later and he's barely competent. I don't know of many other fics that have this super slow growth.

The fic does a lot to try and make the wizarding world a lot more internally consistent. One major way is to actually make certain talents rare and hard, which you may like.
