I forgot the name but here´s what I remember, It's a Harry/Hermione, it´s a trilogy, in the first one Harry and Hermione think Ron is dead, but he isn´t, he was actually kidnapped and they find him because he plays online chess and he´s amazing good. I also remember Harry had an older girlfriend whose name was something like Allondra o Arabella, he´s an auror. When Harry and Hermione are getting married he recieves a gift from his aunt an uncle who turns out not to be from them and was a bomb. Also Harry and Hermione are excellent swing dancers. PLEASE HELP! thankyou :D


** Lori's Paradigm of Uncertainty trilogy. Ron comes back in the third part. [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/]]
