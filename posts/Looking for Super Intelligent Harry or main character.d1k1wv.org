By super intelligent, I mean well beyond human genius level.

So I just read Linkffn(De-Aged) and another one where Harry became part Time Lord. In both stories, the main character had magic and super intelligence. I'm looking for more!

I don't just mean intelligent Harry or Cunning Harry, I mean true super intelligence. Like Reed Richards, The Doctor left intelligence.

I looked through all the Doctor Who and Harry Potter crossover stories in the FFN website but none were the same.

Preferably 100-200k words or more! I saw plenty -100k but I don't care for shorter stories.

No slash and little bash please!


** Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Math prodigy Hermione doing Arithmancy, which describes how magic and numbers interact, so it's basically magic physics. Tons of new spells invented and developed.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  The Doctor and Jack have found themselves to be 11. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix, so the Doctor decides they should attend Hogwarts until they can find a way to return to their proper ages. Here, they make friends, confuse professors, and desperately try to avoid disturbing fixed points in time. Updates on a monthly basis.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

********* I've actually never seen that in a fic. Probably because we don't really know what such a character should be able to do.

A bit unrelated, but could you point me to that half time lord fic? I read De-aged and loved it (my love for the doctor is starting to re-ignite too, I'm sad only one season, the tenth doctor, aired here in Greece).

********** For the life of me I can't find it. It's fairly short, where harry is flying away on Buckbeak during the 3rd book, and he falls and crashes with the time turner around his neck, so the magical sands of time go into him and I think he partially becomes a time lord? The doctor senses it and comes to Hogwarts and Harry reads a bunch of books really fast because he has the intelligence of a Time lord, but it didn't go further than that since it was either dropped or incomplete. If you do ever find it, please let me know!

  In third year, Harry Potter has a near fatal accident with a time turner while trying to save his godfather. Now Harry's not quite human and is beginning to have memories that aren't his own. The Doctor is now searching for the young Time Lord that he mentally sensed with a far-fetched hope that he is not alone. TimeLord!Harry
