  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear.

Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

Disregards DH.Most content T-rated. Pertinent warnings appear in individual chapter notes.

** It's hard to choose just one; different fics have different strengths. And of course, different people like different things.

But if I judge by the metric of "seeing a new chapter released would make me drop everything to immediately read it," though there are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369512/1/The-Peace-Not-Promised][several]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][strong]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][contenders]], the winner would have to be Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. It's an older one, with a bunch of tropes that weren't cliched yet, but what I really love about it is how Harry builds up his friendships; making sure that he supports Hermione in her studies, letting Ron know his own importance and how great it is to have a family like his, expressing confidence in Neville, including Ginny and Luna in everything from the get-go.

Unfortunately the author had a health crisis that he's still recovering from, greatly slowing his writing, and then fanfiction.net took it down for bogus reasons and wouldn't respond to follow-up questions. There's still a [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][PDF/eBook version]] available, though, and he's looking at posting it on RoyalRoad.

** I like Harry Potter's The Legacy linkffn(9774121). Apart from some useless explanations about an annoying wizarding custom I like it.

It's a real shame that it is incomplete. I wish the author finished it.

Harry is not OP, but he gets a chance in becoming one. It's not an immediate solution, it requires him to study and apply himself to learning/practicing. It's dropped and it ends abruptly in a huge cliff hanger.

  In which Remus and Tonks fight battles, arrest criminals, befriend werewolves, overcome inner demons and, despite it all, find themselves a happy ending. A love story, and a story of the Order years. (At long last, my Remus/Tonks epic, which has been years in the making!)

** I don't think I have one. I like a lot of the stuff I read from different authors. For instance, I like all three of the RobSt stories that another commenter mentioned (though I realize that a lot of folks here don't like the author). I like a lot of stuff written by Rorschach's Blot (his Mr Black series starting with Make A Wish is a fun read). Then add authors like Broomstick flyer and her husband merlin's apprentice, Bobmin, canoncansodoff, jeconais etc.

I like Raolin's The Fires of Magic for Harry being raised/taught a different form of magic. Several stories by JacobApples, Kathryn518, Rotaryfile, Catsarecool, etc.

Basically the story I'm currently reading is my Favorite (until I move on to the next). And if nothing new catches my fancy I just go back and start reading all of the others again. And my selection process for a reread is more along the line of a stories length and "what am I in the mood for now" versus a "favorite".

******* I mean I don't like Ron because imo he is a bad friend. And I guess I'm not the only one who is of that opinion.

Some tropes will always be more of special thing that only a few like.

  The Marriage Law, once enacted, has the power to destroy Hermione's perfectly normal life. Luckily, she and Ron are already planning to obey the horrific law together as a team... Until a Malfoy-shaped wrench gets thrown into the works. Dramione.

** I'd say mines a tie between three stories by the same writer. Harry Crow ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow]]) Knowledge is Power ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4612714/1/Knowledge-is-Power]]) In This World and The Next ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5627314/1/In-this-World-and-the-Next]]) All written by RobSt ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/]]) He has so many good stories and I'm a collector of sorts for good HP fics.

*** I like him too, but a lot of people really seem to hate him in this community, both for helpful goblins, and overwhelming bashing.

I mean, I don't mind bashing too much, but /In This World and the Next/ goes way too far IMO. I get not allowing people who hurt them hurt them again, but striking preemptively at an eleven-year-old strikes me as all kinds of wrong.
