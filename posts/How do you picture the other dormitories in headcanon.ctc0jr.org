Hi all,

One of my favorite parts of harry potter fanfic is the ability to add lots of new world building. One of the things we don't get a vivid picture of in the books is the other dormitories... so how do you imagine them?

I've always imagined that each house loosely also represented an element- griffendor= fire, Ravenclaw- air, Hufflepuff- earth, Slytherin- water, and that each element would probably be emphasized (or the feeling the element would create) in the architecture of the dormitory.

**Additionally- I'm in the process of writing a Slytherin fic with OC's and enjoy doodling the floorplans of my sets. Does anyone else do doodles like these??


** I've always pictured the Hufflepuff Common Room as looking very much like a Hobbit's home; full of interesting clutter, and very much with a warm, homey feel to it. Structurally I see it as a large circle, with curved walls and a low ceiling (picture the inside of a barrel, but significantly lacking in height), with some large circular windows to let in the light during the day.

*** Exactly how I imagined the common room. Reminds me of this : [[https://www.deviantart.com/whisperwings/art/Hufflepuff-House-277914217]]

** Slytherin is lovecraft architecture, hufflepuff is soft wood, ravenclaw has tiny exceptions on every stone(wether they be just a generally tip for some thing to a protective rune), and gryffindor has so many layers of wall that there is practically no need for warming charms

** Slytherin: ceiling is lower, but there's much more room. Two or three to a bedroom. The decorations vary by room, but all carry the color scheme of black, emerald green, and/or silver and the lighting is green. Windows show everything in the lake.

Ravenclaw: rectangular. The walls are like the ceiling in the great hall (headcanom was that Ravenclaw was the main architect), but they show some part of the grounds. So like one room has the forest and when it snows or rains they see it. The carpets are blue.

Never thought about Hufflepuff cuz I've never tried to write a puff Harry, but I imagine there's a bunch of flowers. That could be something from pottermore, though. Polished, brown wood floor and pale yellow walls.

In Hogwarts mystery, which admittedly doesn't rank very high in my own canon focus, the hufflepuff common room is certainly full of flowers, with several references to them any time you're in there

** I imagine slytherin looks more upper class, due to alot of the old rich purebloods belonging to it

** Just like Gryffindor's but in different colors. (Colours?)

I am not a very imaginative guy. (And also, a school that uses uniforms (not movie uniforms, but standard-issued robes and hats are pretty much a uniform) won't make a huge effort to make different living spaces for the students, I believe)

***** At this point we'd be arguing semantics. Let's just say that there's a difference between uniform and /uniform/.

*** I always thought that the founders created the dormitories in there own image. / future heads of houses might of added things. So like- if Rowana Ravenclaw wanted a ceiling that replicated the night sky... she'd have just done that.

Or like, if Salazar wanted to be a creepy snake boi- he'd add that into the magical architecture. (Or future parseltounges would / people in future generations who wanted to define what it meant to be a Slytherin )
