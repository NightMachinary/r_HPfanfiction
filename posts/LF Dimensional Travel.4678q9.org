Hey guys,

this time I am looking for fanfiction involving dimensional travel, particularly stories where Harry is summoned (like say "0800-Rent-a-Hero" by brainthief on fanfiction.net) and where he has either already won his war (and gets to the alternate version of himself who is either a looser (so that he or she can't or won't fight - maybe the alternate self is dead, that would work, too!) or someone other people want to save the trouble (like in the above mentioned story where the order wants to spare Harry's alternate female self from fighting, though they totally botch the summoning ritual!) or even someone who's doing better than he is/was doing (maybe Sirius survived because his counterpart isn't as stupidly impulsive and crazily brave when there's no need to be) or his alternate self doesn't want to fight (either sees no reason to or maybe he's a Voldemort supporter/a dark wizard!) or is prevented from finishing his own war (so the Voldemort in his dimension still exists)!

Constraints - as always: Not Harry/Ginny (unless the story is extremely well done otherwise!), no main-character slash (background is fine!) and no background Draco/Hermione or Hermione/Snape (or something equally squicky)

Ok, stage is yours! Go for it :)


** linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land by serpant-sorcerer) is probably the best of the Alternate Dimension fics. It's long, complete, and even has a sequel. Unfortunately, the sequel isn't as good as the original, and the author disappeared from the fandom completely without a trace years ago.

*** Eh, the writing was better in the sequel, in particular the dialogue stopped feeling so stiff.

**** Mm, it's been a while since I've read either, so you may be right about that.

[[/spoiler][The problem, however, was not with the writing of the sequel, but rather the direction the author decided to take the second story in. The first story was inspired by Jason Bourne -- canon, average Harry finds himself suddenly in this new universe with instincts and a skillset that far exceed anything he's ever learned. He learns to use this skillset to survive in this harsh new universe, where he is being hunted by Death Eater and Order Member alike. Gradually he comes to accept that sometimes you need to be ruthless to win wars and becomes somewhat hardened, especially compared to how he was in canon. The author spends the entire 500 thousand word story slowly transforming Harry into a soldier. He finally manages to defeat Voldemort using his newfound world view and grasp of magic. He goes to a new universe in the sequel where Katie Bell (I'm pretty sure it was her, but can't exactly remember) is the Girl-Who-Lived and has the same perspective on the world as canon Harry, perhaps even more naive. The author starts to systematically destroy everything he's done in regards to character development for Harry, and Harry starts to regress back to the average wizard he was back in the beginning of the original story. Katie is aghast at how ruthless her counterpart is, and Harry strives to do anything to get into her good graces. The other thing to consider about the story is that it was only updated once a year, maybe twice, if we were lucky. The chapters were massive though, around 20-30k. The problem with this was that it increased the backlash the author got when he introduced this jarring new plot development (Katie changing Harry back into how he was before, because she didn't like his soldier persona). People on his yahoo group, myself included, started commenting on how this was a terrible way to take the story. He's basically nullifying everything he did so well in regards to Harry's development in the first story. I don't believe the story ever recovered from this, as the author just disappeared soon after, never to be seen again.]]

***** I agree and it sounds like he's a damned whipped "toy-boy" -.- (You didn't say if he was interested in her that way, but it sure sounds like it) - what makes it worse is that exactly this type of stupidity (his personality) made Harry make so damned many mistakes (he got my favorite character - SIRIUS! - killed after all, sure the blame isn't entirely his, but he isn't blameless either!) and it's also what led the Harry being lead around by those by Dumbledore (and him accepting all sorts of abuse - Snape, Umbridge, the bullying in second, fourth and fifth year ("demented attention seeker") - and trying to fight his fame (instead of using it for his own ends!))

ps: No, I haven't read that sequel (but maybe that's a good thing?)

** Surprised that these three haven't been mentioned, but you have most likely read them all, but here goes.

linkffn(C'est la Vie) sadly it's abandoned.

linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn) It's on Hiatus, but the two people who wrote it says they /will/ return. But still a good alternative, heavily inspired by C'est la Vie, but still has some really unique and interesting premises.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) is Ginny/Harry and I didn't really like it. And you have no doubt seen it on the front page of ffn.

And as i wrote these I remembered all these lesser fics, so here goes, and if you've read them all, call me impressed.

linkffn(Harry Potter & The Girl Who Lived by SilverAegis) isn't really that impressive or long, also abandoned. But it sparked a following of fanfictions to /his/ fanfiction, severeal that will be on this list.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived by Agnostics Puppet) Is the complete spinoff of the previously mentioned original fanfiction. I think it's the only finished on this entire list...

linkffn(Harry Potter & The New Life by smaster28) is another SilverAegis spinoff. Though the original it was based off was erased from SilverAegis's account. (I think he erased it willingly)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the New Lives by Steve2) Is a worse ripoff of SilverAegis's erased story, though the first several chapers is 90% copy paste of the orginal, so if you want the original that Silver abandoned, just read this for a few chapters.

linkffn(New Life and New Battles by krytos) is yet another SilverAegis spinoff, I can't really remember so much about it, they all tend to mix with each other at this point.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wand of Uru by alienyouthct) was listed as a SilverAegis spinoff by [[/u/inimically]] but i haven't personally read it. But I'm assuming that it fits your criteria.

And this is why SilverAegis is the father of Dimension travel fics where Harry meet his sister. Now onto non SilverAegis fics in the edit:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Quantum Leap by Seel'vor) I read most of it, but honestly it spends most of the time picking apart canon and bashing the usual. (Dursleys, Dum... ect)

linkffn(Again and Again by Athey) is one you'll either hate or tolorate, reverse SilverAegis. I found it somewhat acceptable.

linkffn(On a Pale Horse by Hyliian) is a fic that I've seen recommended multiple times, but I didn't really care for it.

WARNING!!! linkffn(In this World and the Next by robst) WARNING!!! It's a robst fic. Please don't kill me haters.

linkffn(Lets do the Time Warp Again by Rorschach's Blot) is a classic crack fic. If you like it I'd advice reading everything on his channel. linkffn(Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood! by Rorschach's Blot) also somewhat fits your request, but it's Weird!

linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel by Private Jenkins) is really short and abandoned, but is was still worth the read in my opinion.

linkffn(Backwards Compatible by Ruskbyte) I never quite finished this one, it was alright I guess.

linkffn(Behind the Veil by StycianLeo) What the hell is this doing this far down? Anyways, it's weird, or rather. It's really arbitrary about where it spends it's time and its pacing. Also Grindalwald is the main badguy I think, sorta sure.

linkffn(Harry Potter and Future's Past by DriftWood1965) isn't really about Harry or the dimension travel, mostly uses those as an excuse to write Harry/Hermione.

And this isn't even including crossovers, ask if you want them.

EditEdit: And this is only the ones I've read (except that SilerAegis one) and when finding the exact names i found many more I haven't read.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

#+end_quote

Just curious. Background slash means that there's a barely noticeable gay relationship between the main characters or that there's always something gay happening in the background.

Like Dean and Seamus randomly getting it on in the background while the remaining cast is trying to study for exams or the Patil twins getting intimate during a lazy Sunday snowball fight. If it is the latter I am intrigued. But seeing as it most likely is the former I think I'll pass.
