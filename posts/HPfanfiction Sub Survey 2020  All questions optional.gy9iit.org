===[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gzatlz/the_survey_has_been_closed_prematurely_after_60/][SURVEY CLOSED DUE TO BRIGADING BY SHIP-SPECIFIC SUBS]]===

Update: I hope to be able to strip out the fake entries at some point this weekend, following which I will circulate the corrected results page.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c6p4xj/hp_fanfiction_subreddit_survey_2019/][Link to the 2019 thread.]]

Has it been a year already? Time flies fast. Changes this year:

1. I've restructured the survey into four sections: demographics, canon opinions, pairing opinions, and trope preferences.

2. I have reduced the demographic information to what you might call the "core" details, removing those questions which rarely provoked much interest.

3. Lots more questions about controversial canon discussions.

4. In the pairing polls, I have looked at the entries which received few votes in previous years and removed them. This should make the results page less cluttered and easy to read.

5. I've added a pairing poll for Hermione, since she is heavily shipped. I considered adding one for Ron but I don't think he is nearly as popular a character to write/read about.

6. The trope section has the same tropes as last year, but they've been reordered so that tropes of a similar nature are grouped together (e.g. all the tropes about political themes are together).

ALL QUESTIONS ARE NOW OPTIONAL. Pretty much every year up to now, there have always been comments that X question or Y question should be optional, or people thinking questions were compulsory when they were not. So I have now made all questions optional in the hope of heading off that confusion.

I feel like so much of the fic I see is Dumbledore/Weasley bashing, or Dark!Super!Harry, or pairing Harry with... the Giant Squid. And then I read this and Ron bashing is the most unpopular response of the lot, and dark Harry isn't even popular, and H/G is the most popular ship. Geez, why do I have so much trouble finding fic that reflects that.

Anyway thanks loads for doing these, they're very informative and worthwhile.

*** Oh yes, that shield question had me thinking, too. I decided that a very good shield can probably stop bullets, but only if you cast the shield before you get shot at, you're not fast enough otherwise. Shields may protect against a bomb, definitely against debris etc., but possibly the shock wave would sweep you and your shield away. I'm unsure whether you could anchor your shield somewhere and whether it would survive a bomb in that case.

Nothing survives nuclear bombs. And I don't think wizards know enough about radiation to shield from that effectively.

And I guess you could argue that the laws of physics do not apply to magic whatsoever, so they can shield against nukes, energy-wise... then I'd still say you have to have the shield up before the explosion, so you have to either know that there's about to be one, or put some version of a permanent shield on your house, and I think that may be a different kind of magic?

Yes. For this reason, I imagine some wizards died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Same reason you could shoot wizards with guns. They may have faster reflexes based on some stuff from canon (wizards pulling wands out faster than the eye can catch), but a bullet to the back of an unprotected wizard would kill them.

Well, many people survive bullets to the head but you know what I mean.

British wizards are wilfully ignorant about things like electricity, Muggle clothing and Muggle currency. I don't believe many of them would know about radiation. Even half-blood and Muggleborn wizards may not know very much, since their Muggle education typically stops after primary school. British wizards who were alive at the time would have heard about the bombs... but are they part of the curriculum in History of Magic now?

If anyone developed a spell against these things, it's probably Japanese wizards. They'd also teach their children about it. And maybe the wizarding communities in some other countries are not quite as detached from the Muggle world as the British seem to be, so they share more of their history and knowledge, but we don't know that.

#+end_quote

They don't need to know the complexities of anatomy, but the barebones "legs, shell, claws, etc" to do it. Hermione partially changed her match, which got her points. So there is a methodology to it.

And magic is all about knowledge and practice too. A Nuclear weapon is estimated around 50% blast energy, 35% thermal energy, and 15% Nuclear radiation.

I can see the first one getting blocked. MAYBE the second one, if they had wards or something heavy duty targeting heat specifically. Fire, yes. But Heat energy? I don't see too many people directly shielding against that unless they were in war time footing. Or if the enemy has a death ray or something. Or some sort of magical blacksmith.

Radiation? I can see other parts of the world knowing (and willing) to ward against it. But magical britain? The most ass backwards swamp I've seen? No, they still think guns are muskets. Hell, they probably think all of the explosions in the war was Grindelwald's doing, and any halfblood or muggleborn trying to say otherwise was being mugglelovers and trying to "uplift" them by giving them credit where they didn't "deserve" it.

***** Interesting, I've always thought of a shield as a sort of physical and magical barrier, that stops objects or spells from passing through. Sort of like a wall. But if a shield protects from harm as a main point, that would mean it's more focused on the intent of an incoming spell, or on the effect of a physical object. It would mean that it might let a healing spell through, or a friend, all the while blocking harmful spells. That would be quite powerful actually. Neat idea.

Ron and Hermione not believing Harry that Draco was a Death Eater just doesn't make sense when both were present and fought Voldemort's Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries and saw Lucius there. This is a guy that was chatting shit about Mudbloods dying and Cedric's death being the first of many to come.

The DA not continuing is another thing. They know Voldemort is back and the DA barely survived against the Death Eaters. Why would they not attempt to further learn how to defend themselves? Neville was tortured by Bellatrix, Susan Bones lost members of her extended family, Hermione almost died because of Dolohov's spell, they should all be continuing the DA instead of Hermione being jealous of Ron/Lavender or Neville being ashamed of not being able to continue with Transfiguration.

Voldemort doesn't make an appearance, which is kinda disappointing given that he's the antagonist. The worldbuilding in OOTP with the Aurors, the Order, and the Ministry isn't seen as well. The Order being a paramilitary force does nothing, the Aurors just capture Stan Shunpike and the Ministry is still concerned with optics instead of having contingency plans for Voldemort.

You're telling me the two most likely people to understand Harry's concerns about the horrible little shitbag are suddenly super peachy with giving that ferret the benefit of the doubt just because they haven't actually seen anything yet? I have so many issues with year six that I'm STILL having massive "white girl can't even" moments over it. The whole Malfoy thing is just the tip of the "Andi's bitching about Harry Potter again" iceberg that I'm pretty sure my husband is tired of slamming into.

** One minor issue that I have with this survey that I also had with the previous one is a lack of 3rd option for whether you consider Severus and Draco as ultimately good people, and in what way, etc. I would have preferred the options "irredeemable", "redeemable but not redeemed" and "redeemed". As it is, the survey implies a much stronger dislike for Severus than Draco, which I don't think is actually true, due to this answer limitation (the question is basically "do you consider Snape redeemed? yes or no" and "do you consider Draco redeemable but not neccessarily redeemed? yes or not".

This is somewhat reflected in the "favorite" and "most hated" characters. Both of them have roughly twice as many haters, with Draco having overall less people considering him their most liked and most hated character overall.

The crossover question is so balanced! Didn't think there was such balanced diversity to it. Seems like a lot of people also really like complete AUs. Personally, that questions also reflects my interest in 30k+ magical populations, different magical borders, and grittier magical warfare. All features of some of my favourite stories. I noticed however that there's no question about alternate or greatly expanded magical systems, nor are there questions about what are commonly accepted pieces of headcanons, such as wards, runes not just as a language but as actual magic, etc. All of those would be interesting insights.

** Going through the responses as they are right now.

- Interesting that there seems to be fewer people who identify as homosexual than there are people who identify as bisexual, asexual, and other.

- Seems to be more people who identify as male than people who identify as female, though it seems to be less male-skewed than the general reddit population. So far, it's more even split than last year.

- Lotta students on this sub, which is not surprising, really.

- Seems like over half the respondents have written HP fanfiction but as of typing this, 50% have written it and 30% have published. Therefore 60% of people that have written it have published it).

- I am *shocked* to see that 58% (as of this comment) of people will read stories where the protagonist is a gay man. Considering the amount of 'no slash' requests and general downvoting of slash-oriented fics that transpires in this sub. The mods do great work but the general users' attitude towards M/M slash fics on this sub is definitely negative.

- It's funny that gay Harry is less popular than male slashfics in general, with less than 50% of people saying they read gay Harry stories. I guess there are plenty of people that like Wolfstar but not gay Harry.

- The reaction towards gay women is far more positive. I won't get into my suspicions as to why this is, but this is very unsurprising.

- Fem!Harry isn't too popular. I have to admit, most of the fem!Harry fics I've read haven't been very good, but there are a few damn good ones. I hope fem!Harry includes trans!Harry, because there are some really good fics out there that have trans!Harry.

- Harry-centric fics are, as expected, the clear preference.

- I'm surprised that 36% of people consider Pottermore to be canon. That seems high to me. Personally I consider only the original seven novels to be truly canon, with the rest falling under lesser stages of canonicity. Movies and Pottermore and side books are mostly canon except where they contradict the books, Fantastic Beasts movies are kind of canon except where they contradict the books, other movies, and Pottermore, and so on. Cursed Child, in my opinion, contains no amount of canon and any similarities between it and canon are purely coincidental.

- Dolores Umbridge is the most hated character, no surprise. Surprised Snape is number two. I voted for Peter Pettigrew, who is in third at present. Funny how the big bad of the series, Lord Voldemort, is only hated the most by 1.9% at present. I'd rank Voldemore number three, after Pettigrew and Umbridge.

- I personally find it interesting how the Half-Blood Prince is in the lead for 'least favourite book'. I remember most people not liking Chamber of Secrets, which is currently in the middle. My least favourite was Deathly Hallows, but I didn't expect to share that opinion with 16% of people. Finally some people are seeing the light*! (*for some definitions of light)

- Shame only 77% of people think Ron was a good friend to Harry. I'd kill to have more friends like Ron in my life. I only have two friends as good as Ron, and I treasure them greatly.

- Wow, 89% of people agree that Remus was right to tell Harry to use lethal spells against Death Eaters. I hope most of them said yes for the same reason I did: Remus was right to advise Harry in that way because Remus thought it best and Remus cared about Harry. Harry was also right to ignore that advice.

- Lotta people think Draco wasn't punished enough in canon (54%). I'm on the fence here, as I feel like overall he got pretty damn well punished. Perhaps not in school, and that's on the teachers for not cracking down on his bullying, but I think he was set up to have a real shit time after Hogwarts, plus his last two years at school were pretty rough. I say he got punished about the right amount overall.

- I don't like the idea that a well-cast Shield Charm being able to protect you from a conventional bomb. I feel like a lot of people are underestimating just how destructive bombs are. I mean, I hope no one has to find out first-hand, but bombs are /powerful./ Go look at photos of the aftermath of bombs. It's awful.

- Smut is popular, no surprises there. I personally find it /hard/ to write good smut. Haven't managed it yet. Kudos to the mods here for keeping this subreddit largely smut-free by way of rule 8. I say this not because I don't like smut, but because I'd like this community to stay outta sight of the Reddit admins, whose decisions are mercurial at best.

- Someday I will convince this subreddit that Harry/Katie is the best pairing. Someday. Still working on that Harry/Katie fic that's been in development for two years. I want to complete it before publishing it.

- Ugh, Harry/Draco's popularity is a thorn in my side. I love M/M Harry fics, but not with Draco, Snape, or Voldemort!

- I wish Fleur was an option for Hermione pairings because she's my favorite partner for Hermione.

- Interesting that people like democratic magical Britain when it's certainly not that way in the books. I'm indifferent. I've seen it done well both ways.

- Heartened by the strong dislike of marriage contracts. I have yet to read a fic that has marriage contracts that I like, and I've read most of the most often recommended marriage contract fics.

- Also heartened by very strong dislike of Mugglewank.

- Strong feelings in both directions about romantic soul bonds. I'm not opposed to the idea, but as with marriage contract fics, I haven't yet found a fic featuring the trope that I like.

- Ugh, Occlumency improving memory and learning? And most people like it! Please no, no, no! It always turns into a fic where one character is incredibly overpowered! Occlumency helps you defend your mind against mental attacks. That's it, in my opinion.

- Looks like most people also like magical genius Harry, too. Make the fic less fun and interesting in my opinion.

- Good, Ron bashing is finally becoming less popular. And Hermione bashing is very unpopular, thank goodness.

- I'm very mixed on crossovers. I've read some really great ones and a lot of very, very bad ones. It's annoying that a lot of the more popular crossovers are with anime or western animated TV shows, neither of which I have much experience with.

tl;dr: The subreddit's views are mostly unsurprising, I disagree on a handful of topics, and it's great that we've already had a great number of responses than last year.

*** i didnt get a chance to take the survey so im not sure what the options where but while i would general say no to m/m slash fics im willing to read them. they just too often get into weird very ooc territory for me. its like obnoxious soul bond harry/hermione ooc just with 2 male characters. I see it most often with harry/draco or harry/snape so those are usually solid passes for me.

also harry/katie is so undershipped its crazy.

personally i like a bunch of fem harry fics, though if harry gets all weird and bitch and demanding its a drop for me, though male harry screaming at people is usually a drop as well.

one of the things i disagree with you heavily on is ron. i think ron can be written very well written but in terms of canon ron, he can sod right off. differences of opinion or getting in fights is normal between people friends, family, wives whatever. its how you can maybe forgive a tri-wizard asshat situation, but abandoning your buddies in a life and death struggle? hell no.

the other thing i differ with you on is draco's punishment. i think the teachers didnt punish people much at all at school but i think draco should have been jailed and or had massive amounts of long term counseling. he was a little shit for years which should be punished in school but when he graduated from slurs and school fights to attempted murder and leading terrorists into a school with the intent of more murder he became a much more serious issue than regret or a shitty home/school life or helping the harry at the end can atone for.

I imagine both my ron and my draco opinions are influenced by how and when i was raised though.

**** ^ This was the essence of the argument I was going to make. I think that if the question were framed in a way to clarify that there would be proper, gradual, systemic changes made towards eventually freeing the elves while helping them adjust, probably everybody would be in favor.

Given that the predominant house-elf response to freedom that we see in the books is disgust, it's not totally surprising that the gut reaction is just to do what the elves want and not assume the wizards know best like always - this was my own gut reaction, before I thought about it for a little longer and reminded myself that systemic change is a thing that exists. After all, even Dobby, who was free and wanted wages, felt the need to bargain Dumbledore /down/ to a galleon a week before starting work at Hogwarts.

I think the question itself is a really tough one to write in order to capture this nuance, though! I don't really know how I'd make it feel less like a leading question - perhaps something along the lines of "House-elves should be freed even if freedom makes them uncomfortable"? Still seems leading, but this time in the other direction. Point is, polls are hard, man - I wouldn't take a simple agree/disagree as an indictment of people's opinions.

***** House elves are ashamed of freedom. It's been ingrained into them that they are to be loyal to their families, and that setting them free is the ultimate punishment, probably worse than death. Shame is hard to change. Hermione is going to be in for a long-term project with the house elves.

There are probably also people who think that, since house elves are a magical species, maybe they really don't want to be free (with few exceptions), that's their true nature, and we're projecting our human viewpoint onto them. But that's too short-sighted, because they aren't actually a different species, it's literature, and literature doesn't exist in a vacuum, it's always connected to us, our culture and history.

I think that more than two possible answers would have given a more differentiated picture. Something like "Yes, free the elves immediately", "Yes, free them as part of long-term cultural change", "Free only the elves who want to be free", "No, they like being servants".

The Harry/Ginny dynamic is not even properly defined in the canon. To me it seems like a forced pairing. Hermione is much more of a dominant person and Harry is too. But the pairing is still better. I feel Harry/Luna pairing is the best with the canon in mind as they have better dynamics and they seem to a perfect fit of misfits.

I think ya Voldemort would sure win. The reason he doesn't win with Dumbledore is I think the fact that he saw Dumbledore as the most powerful wizard in his childhood and maybe that has become some kind of barrier for defeating him.

Dumbledore didn't have the power to close the school during Tom's years as he wasn't headmaster. Dippet was. Tom feared Dumbledore because Tom played his hand the first time they met. As such, he could never play Dumbledore like he could everyone else and this pretty much continues in the 90s. Voldemort lost because Dumbledore and Harry understand Voldemort more than Voldemort understood them.

*** Because there's no way to do it without offending someone.

The problem starts with the fact that there are a great many races/ethnicities in the world, and the closer you look, the more differentiation there is. Races that might seem homogeneous to outsiders are often made up of many sub-groups who no not appreciate being conflated with each other.

So you have a choice:

1. List all races comprehensively. The resulting list would be so long that it would break the Google Forms results page, so you wouldn't even be able to read the results.

2. Be selective about what races you list. The decision about what to exclude is almost certainly going to offend someone.

On top of that, you have the additional issue of the existence of some races being highly contentious. The obvious example being "Hispanic". Many people in the US consider "Hispanic" a race. Meanwhile, many people in South America who Americans would call Hispanic consider themselves white and are offended by being called Hispanic - they consider it an act of European imperialism and arrogance to restrict whiteness to rich economies.

Now, the way individual nations manage to get around these problems when performing a national census is to talk about race according to the dominant consensus within their own borders. E.g. American census has Hispanic as an option, but Mexico's does not. And the way they get around needing a long list of every ethnicity in the world is to focus specifically on the most common groups within their borders. But this sub is an international community, and it does not make sense to design a survey from the perspective of a specific country - in particular, I am keen to avoid producing a survey which is either American-centric or Euro-centric.

****** I really fail to see how it would be so controversial since a major theme of Harry Potter is blood purity which is a thinly veiled metaphor for race.

You can recognize that there are differences in race without being a racist. And I personally as a non white person would be genuinely interested in seeing that question.

if white is over represented, i would wonder why when historically fanfiction has always been female dominated because it's only been until recently that more women have been able to give their perspective in TV and Movies.

Are there differences in the fics that POC write/enjoy reading? Maybe certain types of fics appeal more to POC because of lived experiences that many share

I don't see how the question is any more controversial than gender identity, sexuality or age.

Y'know, it's funny that JK rowling has been getting a ton of shit for not being inclusive. And i've only ever seen maybe two fics that have main character OC's that are non white.

*********** I'm giving this one more try. I don't want to use myself as an example, so I'll use a celebrity, like Trevor Noah. Go google him if you don't know who I'm talking about. What race is he?

In the US, almost everyone would look at him and say he's black. Cops would say he's black and treat him like they treat black people. If someone called the police to report him as a suspicious person in the park, they'd say he's black.

If people actually listened to him talk about his parents, or read his book, they might reclassify him as biracial.

In his native South Africa, he is definitely not black. Literally no one there would call him black. He was born in the race they called “mixed” which was illegal at the time, so he tried to pass for the different race they called “colored” which was believed to be a different race than “mixed.” Growing up, people in his neighborhood called him “white” because he was the lightest-skinned person there, and most people in that neighborhood had never seen a mixed or colored person, much less someone I'd call a white person.

Do you see the problem now? What race Trevor Noah is depends completely on where he is and who's doing the classifying, and what system of classification they're using. If he's in this group (Hi Trevor, if you're here!) and filling out this survey, what race should be put down? I think he's in NYC now, so should be put “black” according to local standards? Everyone in his native country would say that's wrong, he's definitely not black.

OK, “blue-eyed blonds” was an exaggeration, but you really do have to look like all your ancestors were from north Western Europe to count as white in parts of the Midwest. If you haven't been to those places, count yourself lucky.

I'm not talking about a couple of hicks being mean to me.

I also got a lot of compliments on how well I speak English, and questions about how long I've been in this country, and when I'll be going back home.

And I really hope you'd understand that just because a lot of people say something on a survey, that doesn't mean that thing is true. If most Americans say on some survey that the sun goes around the earth, that doesn't mean the sun goes around the earth. If most Americans confidently check some box for “race” on a survey, that doesn't mean that confidence has any basis in reality. Most Americans who check the box for “black,” for instance, would not be called black in South Africa. America defines blackness by the “one drop rule” where any sub-Saharan African ancestry at all makes someone black, even if most of someone's ancestry is ethnically northern European. Many Americans classified as black have coloring significantly lighter than mine.

I'm sure that most people, when filling out a survey, check the racial box that fits the local definition, which is fine for purposes like measuring local racism. You really need to understand how useless this local measure is in an international survey.

And wow, here comes the racism. There are major differences in health outcomes between different races in America, because of the RACISM in America, not because of biological racial differences. Except for a very few traits, like pale skin being linked to skin cancer and dark skin being linked to vitamin D deficiencies, there's no biological difference between races. There's no biological test to determine what race someone is. Racial categories have [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/][no biological basis.]]

For instance, there's no biological reason for black women in the US to have a [[https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/u-s-finally-has-better-maternal-mortality-data-black-mothers-n1125896][maternal mortality rate]] that's two and a half times as high as the white maternal mortality rate.

Just because black women dying at higher rates isn't attributable to biological differences in race doesn't negate the fact that there are some issues that are attributable to genetic differences in race that aren't solely coming from socioeconomic factors.

idgaf if on a small amount of biracial people in south africa would check black or biracial. the fact of the matter is that only an extremely small amount of people taking this survey on the subreddit would actually be from south africa. therefore your point is moot.

obviously there's going to be outliers and you account for them if you know what you're doing.

Again, I have done actual research in the healthcare field regarding race differences so I know that it's an important question

How about you educate yourself on your privilege because I genuinely am interested to see the racial make up of the sub. I'm guessing it's overwhelmingly white but I can only guess because no one asked the question.

It's funny that the world of HP explores the theme of pureblood and muggleborn as a metaphor for race differences and yet a survey can't ask that question.

As a white person you don't have to think about race at all because you have systematic white privilege but when you're not white it does matter and so it's completely valid for me to be interested in it.

Stop quoting south africa as this extremely rare instance of someone not sure if they're biracial or black seeing as almost no one who did the survey actually comes from africa.
