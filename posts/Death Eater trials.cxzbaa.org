Looking for fics that deal with Death Eater trials and sentencing, either during/after the First or Second War with Voldemort.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] by seventymilestobabylon) doesn't deal with the trials themselves, but it's all about the investigation into all atrocities committed during the war. So it has a lot of stuff on the crimes of the death eaters, but it also goes into regular people looking the other way, turning in muggleborns, and also looking into cases of people on the light side going to far. If you're looking for the themes of justice post war it's a really interesting read.

*** I LOVED THIS. I was planning on reading the first chapter last night before bed but ended up staying awake until 3am to finish it.

Thank you so much for recommending!

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

** linkffn(The Malfoy case). Deals with Draco Malfoy's trial after the war. I don't know much about courts and trials, but the author seemed very knowledgeable about the subject and described everything really well.

#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.
