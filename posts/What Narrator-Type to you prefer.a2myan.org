Longtime lurker here. I have been thinking about writing a story that has been on my mind since forever. English is not my first language but I'd like to write using it, as it would allow me to reach more readers. (Sharing is caring!)

I am quite unsure what narrator I should choose. The MC will have internal struggles - so either First Person or Omniscient Third Person would lend itself to it. - [...]

What are your thoughts? What narrator do you prefer and for what reason?


** I usually click off stories written in first person. There are a few good ones, but generally they fall flat with me.

Given the internal struggles you want to narrate, you might try third person limited. Granted, you have to stick with one main perspective, but these can end up being pretty engaging if done well. Third person omniscient might be the best bet, especially if this your first story. It's definitely the format that I /think/ the greatest majority of readers don't find objectionable.

I'd suggest considering putting this question to [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]]. They tend to give very good advice there.

** Third person is a must; since that's what the original books were. I'm fine with limited, omniscient or lemony; it all depends on the story you're trying to tell.

** Third person who is omniscient (First person is kind of strange, because you seldom read novels or fanfiction in first person!)
