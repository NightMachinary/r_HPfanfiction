My preferred ships are Sirius/Hermione, Remus/Hermione and Remus/Sirius. I think I've read pretty much everything decent out there for these. So, what I'm hoping for is some story recs of different ships, or just ideas for new ships and why you enjoy them. Thanks very much.


** Try out the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/48782][Sirius Is a Totally Helpful Advice Columnist 'verse]] for a great Sirius/James story. (AU; Lily/James never happens.) The first two are only short one-shots, but the third one is a 200k+ fic that's hilarious and wonderful.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW01.html][Beautiful World]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BY01.html][Beneath You]] are Harry/Draco fics I recommend to anyone new to the pairing. They're both pre-OOTP and fair warning: Beautiful World is a heartbreaking. Also for this pairing try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581954/1/][Mental]], which I only finished reading myself just yesterday which is set in the year after DH, and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4842696/1/][Reparations]] which is several years after the Battle of Hogwarts. Neither are epilogue-compliant, obviously, and they don't villainize Ginny (which is something I hate in post-DH H/D fics).

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/OP.html][Ordinary People]] is a great Snape/Hermione, written pre-HBP. Rest assured he isn't suddenly an irresistible sex god, nor is Hermione a sudden beauty; both are wonderfully in character.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6104506/1/Anna-Jones-s-Diary][The Diary of Anna Jones]] is my personal favourite Sirius fic.

** I'm a big Hermione/Draco fan. There are some god-awful fics and some amazing ones, so it can be a bit hard to go through them. I don't remember any faves off of the top of my head, but I always search for longer, completed ones that are tagged romance and comedy (or drama or adventure depending on my mood). I usually use fanfiction (dot) net as my preferred site. Adultfanfiction has some fantastic ones, but you have to find them amongst all of the smut.

There are some good Hermione/Bill and Hermione/Charlie fics too. I read a nice T-rated Hermione/Cedric fic, the title had "Eclairs" in it. Short but nice.

But Hermione/Draco are my favourite. There are some really amazing ones out there. There are also a few good community/shipper sites that provide links to fanfiction. So it can help when you're in a bind.
