It's a bit of a prompt as well as a serious question Bonus if there are any stories that deal with it.


** Canon, there is no such thing as an "owl redirect ward" or somesuch, but [[http://web.archive.org/web/20110721034717/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=18][you can make yourself untraceable to owls]]. If someone placed such a charm on Harry then the owls would simply have returned to their senders with letters/packages undelivered. Word would then have got around that you can't send stuff to him.

*** Rowlings actually wrote a Pottermore article about this, where she elaborated more about methods to avoid owls. [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/owls]]

  Should a witch or wizard not wish to be sent letters (or tracked in any other way), he or she will have to resort to Repelling, Disguising or Masking Spells, of which there are a great range. It is possible to protect yourself from all correspondence, or all but that carried by a specific owl. If a witch or wizard is determined not to be contactable by a persistent creditor or ex-boy or girlfriend, they might try a masking spell specific to that person, but this ploy is easily circumnavigated by asking somebody else to send the owl. In general, it takes strong protective magic, and a willingness to forego a lot of birthday cards, to avoid the attentions of Owl Post.

** Did you ever see that movie adaptation of Going Postal? That's what the room that 'studies love' looks like - it's devoted fanperson love as represented by Harry's letter-mountains of obsessive fanmail. :D

** A lot of fics have Dumbledore redirecting the mail. Most often seen in Manipulative Dumbledore fics which probably have him stealing all the money and gifts and what have you.

â€‹

linkffn(The Best Revenge) has a well meaning Manipulative Dumbledore redirect the mail to a room in Hogwarts by the Owlery, though over the years he completely forgot about everything and didn't mention it until someone else brought up the question about what had been done with all the mail. They do sort through it and find a lot of gifts as well as a number of curses and poisons as expected.

I can't remember what they were but I have also seen well meaning Dumbledore's that handle the mail, take care of the curses, donate the gifts, and put the money in Harry's vault. Or ones that sell everything and use the money to support the Order, or his lavish robe purchasing habits, or his lemon drop habit or whatever.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** Everyone addresses the letters to Harry Potter, forgetting that his name is Harry James Potter, resulting in no Owls being able to find him.
