I don't remember much of it, but in one scene Harry (Salazar Slytherin) and Draco (Godric Gryffindor) are on a broom and are heading into the lake. After that, the crash into a window and are greeted by Dumbledore. Another scene that could be part of the same fic, or it could be a different one, but there's a Halloween party and The founders dress as themselves. There is later a Death water attack in which Harry(?) saves Snape.

If anyone could tell me these 2 (or 1) fic that would be great

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
