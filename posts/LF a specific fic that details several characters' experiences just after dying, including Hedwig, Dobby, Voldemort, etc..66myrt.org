It's a beautifully written one and it's killing me that I can't find it. It's basically a series of vignettes from a bunch of characters' afterlives (Snape, Pettigrew, Harry, Fred, Hedwig, Dobby, Voldemort, Sirius, Dumbledore and others). It starts with Snape "waking up" in Hogwarts after his death; he goes to the Great Hall and speaks with Lupin, and then Lily arrives offscreen before it switches to a different character.


** It sounds like this one.
