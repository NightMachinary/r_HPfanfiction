I recently read ‚ÄúStrangers at Drakeshaugh‚Äù, an incomplete fic from a muggle woman's point of view who met Harry and his family when they move in their village. It's interesting to see her notice so many things about the ‚Äúpotter family‚Äù and try to rationalize it in some plausible way. Unfortunately the fanfiction is incomplete at the moment and I don't even know if the author has the intention to make the muggle family find out of the magic world.

Did someone has a complete fanfiction or at least one that already came to a revelation part I can read?

Something from a muggle' point of view who met Harry and his family/friends and slowly started to learn about the magical world and its story? Even better if more then one Muggle, so they can talk between them about the discovery and how much surprising and different thing are and similar discussions. It would be too much to read for me if it was just one Muggle who find out and his infinite internal monologue about it. I want drama, humor, surprise, something fun and exciting to read, like rediscover this whole world again throughout a muggle's eyes.

I have only three important conditions:

1- The story have to be after the books, no matter when but it needs to be after the war, so we can see how Harry and co. Change and innovate the Ministry and the Wizarding world, ect. Sincerely I have no interested whatsoever to revisit the book series, I already memorized and like I said I want something fun and exciting, that means new.

2- PLOT. I have read so many useless stories with no sense of direction. I want a story who goes somewhere. Maybe a Muggle man is in danger for some reason and the new recruit Auror Harry, fresh out of training incredibly short, find himself to to protect him by disguise himself as a new kind neighbor. The Muggle mistakes Harry's attentions as romantic and he try politely to refuse because he has a girlfriend but ‚ÄúI don't have any problem with it, cause you know my best friend is bi, you know!‚Äù All of this while Harry complain to a hysterically laughing Ginny (‚Äúcan you please pass by to the apartment and let him see you get out of my door in the middle of the night, please ???? It's not funny, stop laughing, not you too Ron!!!‚Äù) who's training for her professional quidditch team and fighting with her mother over it, and they tried to revel the family they kinda want to live together in a home now and not in the dorm and Grimmuold place respectively and they started to search a place but they can't tell because ‚Äúthey will never leave us any private time alone, Harry!‚Äù, and Bill and Fleur are trying unsuccessfully their hand to babysit Teddy to see how they would go with future children (and Harry and Ginny are surprisingly much better as babysitters). And Ron Hermione still fights night and day and ‚Äúhow dare her mother take his side! And did you see how that horrible article describe our relationship?! Seriously Ron, are you listening???‚Äù And Hermione parents are still upset for what she did but still love but from now on they want to be more included, here we are with the be-weekly lunch at the Borrow where the Grangers and Arthur starts their famous meetings ‚ÄúWorlds Collide‚Äù and ‚ÄúHarry dear, can you take Teddy upstairs, he is a little fussy. Ronald Weasley, put that sausage down, the Grangers didn't arrive yet, for merlin's sakes!‚Äù And on top of all this chaos Harry still didn't found out why the hell someone wants to kill that stupid Muggle! And then the stupid muggle woke up in The middle of Diagonal Ally with no memory because Harry was distracted by Luna's new theory that the article that spoke about Ron and Hermione's relationship was a strange conspiracy to somehow get to him and his Gringott Vault because they believed there is some precious secret buried among the gold.

There, I don't have a great imagination and even less talent for writing. But something like this. Of course that was to make clear what I mean with PLOT. Of course my request is for a fic with a Muggle' POV, it would be interesting to see the muggle involuntary being involved in the craziness of Weasley family and put the entirely wrong pieces of the story together until Harry gets found out in the most stupid way ‚Äúwhich is entirely not my fault, I swear Hermione!‚Äù

3- CANON. That should be obvious. Find something inventive, creative, never seen before in the Harry Potter fan fiction's History. But stay in the canon of the books series. ESPECIALLY WITH THE SHIPPS, the jobs, and the next generations (they can have all the kids they want but they canon children needs to be there. For exemplar: I always imagined Harry and Ginny had three children more - the twins Christopher and Clementine or Kriss and Clem as they started to insist at the premature age of 2 and half- and the little Tina. All children are toddlers much more young to even Lily and at the moment of Al's departure t Hogwarts they were ill and under the care of Nana Weasley. There is no reason that wouldn't be possible. No where in the epilogue it says that Al, James and Lily were the only Potter children).

Of course I hope I don't need to clarify why a certain book is not to be considered since it is not Canon of course.


** Hmm...just how canon does it have to be? Because there's a really great story where a Muggle woman gradually encounters the magical world, lots of funny scenes, but also lots of heart-wrenching ones, and excellent relationship building. But it isn't fully epilogue-compliant, because the premise is that a few years before that, Ginny died in a Quidditch accident, leaving Harry emotionally torn apart but trying to hold things together for his three kids. And the woman is a quirky waitress whom he meets at the cafe he visits during his workday, who decides on a whim to get to know this quiet broody stranger (since he's a regular) and pull him into a conversation. And eventually she gets to know a bit more about him, and meet his children, and start wondering how they're able to make so many visits to their grandparents who live several hours away, and why Harry has what appear to be genuine /cauldrons/ in his cupboards...

I won't use the bot, because honestly, the story summary is waaay misleading. If you want to know whether you'll like it, the best way is to read chapter 1 and decide whether you like Abby.

*** Thanks, I'll try to read it just to see how it is written from a Muggles's POV, but I can't promise to keep going because one of the things I absolutely wanted is NOT to change the canon ships- especially if, like I can only assume, Harry will fall in love with this woman ( I don't know if that's the story but if it is, that is what I wanted to avoided to all cost: a muggle who needs to have any sort of relationship with one of the magical characters outside of friendship, just to use that ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù to get the muggle to find out the magic world and being a part of it.... just no. I'm sorry, but really why people think that in a situation like this you need to tragically kill Ginny just to make room for this woman to fall in love and found out that magic is real and here we are, a complete divergence from canon with Harry married/in love with a muggle and all that will entails, ect ect. - I think people can be more creative then that). Sorry for the little rant but I have seen enough stories that goes that way and I got sick of it, sincerely. I'm tired to see all the fanfictions on ff.net and AO3 being AUs or anything but CANON, seriously. I swear, I don't have anything against you, I'm just a little stressed, sorry üòê.

**** Harry hasn't stopped loving Ginny. Abby is helping him heal. (Yes, he does fall for her. Gradually.)

***** I guess I can try, it would be interesting to read. But like I said the moment I see Harry start to fall in love with the muggle woman and I understand that it was the aim since from the start, I'm out. I hope you don't see me like rude or too demanding but I already explain why I try to avoid certain themes and headcanons in HP fanfics. There are certain fanon ideas about Harry Potter world in general that are become so popular, even more then the books, that are so accepted that some people may actually start to believe those facts are canon ( I'm sure it's already like this). It's ridiculous. And for me those same old tropes I see everywhere limits the creativity - I didn't see a innovative and completely new idea (that doesn't need to change the canon so badly to make it so) in years.

I hope I didn't offend you with my opinions on HP fan fictions, it was NOT my intention. I am actually grateful you replied to my post. You are the only one who did it so far, so thank you.

****** Well, honestly, since you've already come across Northumbrian, I don't really have any better recs for your request. Northumbrian is great. Do check out some of his other work, like the Muggle Interface Team, if you're interested in Muggles having close encounters with magic, but bear in mind that there are laws in place so the wizards aren't usually allowed to /let/ people work it out. Memory charms are a thing, after all...

******* I'll try to read their stories (in the hope in some of them there is some surprise revelations who doesn't end in memory charm - i'll read for the MIT stories, but I won't be very hopeful)

Anyways if you remember some authors who created a whole universe to follow up the books like Northumbrian, let me know

**** linkao3(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian), but the finale is kind of ... nothing. The true end of the story would be completed linkao3(James and Me by Northumbrian), but it has never been (and probably it will never be) completed.
