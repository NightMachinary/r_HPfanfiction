More of them? Less of them? None of them? Are they easy to find or are they a real challenge? And have you been inventive in dealing with them?

In my current fic, I've got all the standard horcruxes, except:

- The one in Harry's scar never took hold, and re-joined the original. Voldy has fewer anchors, but he's slightly more sane and powerful in exchange.

- The lack of Parseltongue meant that Harry couldn't save Ginny. Dumbledore set Diary!Tom and the Basilisk on fire with Fiendfyre.

- Slytherin's Locket, Harry stumbled upon after practicing a variant of legilimency on Kreacher, after going to Grimmauld place early.

- The Diadem, found and identified by dumb luck.

- The Ring, Dumbledore gets this one as well.

- Nagini, who /doesn't/ get made into a horcrux. (The failed Harry Horcrux made Voldy aware of how bad off his soul actually was. Again, this results in a stronger, "saner" Voldemort.)

- The Cup, /HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!/ Harry's never going to find it. (No Gryffindor sword means that Bella doesn't get prompted to worry about the contents of her vault, so she never runs her mouth.)


** In various ways, since I aim not to repeat my plots:

Canon locations - gathered and dealt with similar to canon, though more quickly since Harry's protection was still active against all curses cast by Voldemort before his resurrection in the graveyard.

In a crossover with Buffy, a ritual was used to mend Voldemort's soul which destroyed the Horcruxes (and greatly enhanced Voldemort's power as an unintended result) without having to track them.

Use of a ritual to shred Voldemort's soul using one of his (non-canon) Horcruxes as a link since it was impossible to find and destroy all of them.

Tracking his (non-canon) Horcruxes through Harry's scar and destroying them with Fiendfyre.

Bypassing the (non-canon and spread across the world) Horcruxes by destroying Voldemort's consciousness in a mental battle.

Emprisoning his soul in a crystal until his last non-canon Horcrux (literally) resurfaced, then destroy said Horcrux and release the soul.

** If they were anywhere semi competent in fighting Death Eaters, confiscating Lestrange vault to pay compensation to the Longbottoms would be a very reasonable action.

Real world authorities are very quick in freezing and seizing accounts associated with terrorists. Fighting terrorist finances is often just important as fighting them in the field.

Finally, you don't need Gryffindor Sword to destroy Horcruxes. A Goblin made weapon dipped in Basilisk venom was good enough.

*** The Gryffindor sword was key in getting Bella to spill the beans on the cup's location because she thought it was in her vault, and that if it was out, then other things (like the cup) might have been stolen as well. No sword, nobody knows where to look for the cup.

And in my particular mild AU, the slightly different mix of mental disorders in Voldy's head made his death eaters slightly more tolerable by the masses and slightly better at infiltrating the ministry and Gringotts and implementing their laws/policies. Getting Nevil compensation would be even more unlikely than in canon.

** I'm nowhere near the Horcrux hunt in my main story, but I'll be changing everything but what the Horcruxes are (cup, locket, etc.).

I'll be moving them though. Well, not the diary since my story starts in fourth year. I also can't figure out any real reason to change the ring's location, so that's probably staying.

The cup will be taken out of the vault and moved.

The locket will not go to Umbridge, but will be sold to someone in Knockturn Alley, where it gets sold again, and so on. My fem!Harry will have a hell of a time tracking it down.

The diadem will be taken out of the RoR and go fuck knows where.

Nagini will get thrown into the sun. No, not really. Maybe. It's classified.

I'll probably have Voldemort make another out of desperation.

I'm also making them more similar to the movie version rather than the book version in terms of how sinister and evil they can appear and work. I like the idea of them being so dark that the Dark Magic begins physically manifesting itself. For example:

#+begin_quote
  She stared into the darkness of the Chamber of Secrets, silently trying to fool herself into believing she wasn't frightened. Even with her wand lit, she could hardly see a few feet in front of her. It was as though the Chamber liked the dark, didn't want anyone to disturb it even, and was waiting until she was just far enough into the Chamber to shut the door and shut out all light, even from her wand, leaving her in total darkness.

  She imagined a shadowy hand reaching out from the darkness and using its long, withered, rotting fingers to extinguish the tip of her wand. The thought of it sent a strong coldness up her spine. She knew there was a basilisk here, and for some odd reason, despite knowing it could kill her in less than a second, it wasn't as scary --- or perhaps scary wasn't the correct word.

  Unsettling, and unnatural. The thought of the basilisk wasn't causing her to feel unnerved, as though something unsettling, unnatural, and depraved was lurking in the dark. She could almost feel the evil in the air, and as she took step after step, ignoring the eyes of the stone snakes she was sure were following her every move, the oppressive feeling of something sinister grew.

  The light on the tip of her wand did not waver, however, nor did it vanish. It remained steady, and though it seemed as though the light was reluctant in spreading, Iris pushed forward, determined to find Ginny.
#+end_quote

The diary Horcrux is corrupting the Chamber of Secrets with its influence. I plan on having the other Horcruxes work similarly. They're such twisted and evil works of magic --- utter abominations --- that they have the power to turn something innocent into the most vile. Like Dol Guldur in LotR. The place should be a beautiful forest, if my memory is correct, but the corruption of Sauron causes it to turn into the evil that it eventually becomes before Galadriel obliterates it.

*** I did the same with the Locket in linkffn(A World Unseen: Vol II) The Locket fed on the dark magic of ever other cursed object in the drawing room, allowing it to take a semi-physical form. When it is encountered, The adults all hit it with their Patroni, which weakens it, before Harry goes all Gimli on the Horcrux with a sword he retrieved from the Chamber of Secrets.

As for the other Horcruxes:

Dumbledore bled the Diary for information until he knew everything the Diary had known before using Greek Fire to destroy it.

The Ring will be dealt with before the Quidditch World Cup, as it is instrumental that Harry have the Hallows by then. (Master of Death is a misnomer, but the Hallows are very important in context.)

The Cup... well, Gringotts will have another break in by a dark wizard.

The Diadem will be lost to sheer, dumb luck (or horrible luck depending on how you look at it.)

Nagini will fall victim to an Inigo Montoya.

And Harry's Scarcrux has the metaphysical consistency of spent charcoal at the moment, and there is only enough room in his head for two souls, so somebody has to go.

** I only have five in my outline at the moment. The locket, cup, diadem, diary, and ring.

The ring is the only one that I have a clear idea for. As it was made when Voldemort was at school, it would be like him during that time: enchanting and charming. And instead of a curse activating when the ring is worn, it is a enchantment that activates when the box is opened.\

That's all I got for now.

** I prefer to ignore the ones in Harry and Nagini since they are 1/64th or less of a soul. You can't anchor an aircraft carrier with a shoelace and I doubt that such a small part of the soul would work. After halloween Riddle still had most of his soul around. Only the destruction of the ring, diary, diadem and the cup made him mortal, he still had to be killed though.

Alternatively Harry has the scar surgically removed, taking the Horcrux out without ever knowing what it was.

Amusing though the idea may be, canon never said Riddle actually split his soul in /half/ every time, or that you can even "run out" of soul.

** I had it to where the horcruxes were tied to Voldemort's sanity, and once he killed the one in Harry, with the diary and ring gone, he veered back onto his original path of preserving the Wizarding World instead of slaughtering everyone because his soul wasn't as torn up.

** My story has a single point of departure, so the Horcruxes at the beginning are the same ones that existed in 1991 (although Nagini isn't one yet and probably won't ever be with how badly I've twisted around the canon timeline at this point). However, Harry, Hermione, Ron and Co. aren't trying to destroy the Horcruxes, just to round them up, since they have already subdued Voldemort. As of now they've got a Petrified Voldemort and the Diary safely locked away. Dumbledore is aware that Voldemort has been captured but not that any of his Horcruxes have been found. Only time will tell what happens for the other ones.

** Okay so some general thoughts on the horcruxes. First they should probably you treated like the one ring from Lord of the Rings so the longer someone is in contact with an active horcrux the more corrosive effect on them it has. Second these horcruxes should have plenty of very lethal defenses Voldemort is not stupid and in Canon leaves plenty of nasty tricks and traps to protect them. Three for me the coolest horcruxes in Canon to me were slytherins locket and Tom Riddle's Diary that is because the gang had to actively confront an aspect of Voldemort this could be especially useful if you want to have a dark Harry plot line where Harry starts embracing more and more dark magic you can then extrapolate that it's a result of him being exposed to Voldemort more and more often combined with his own horcrux in his scar.
