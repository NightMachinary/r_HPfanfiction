** I believe your 2nd fic is Knowledge is Power by RobSt. "Can you please show your left arm?" The question that was really a demand came from the shop doorway in front of Peter where a man who was missing his left sleeve now appeared, he also had a wand in his hand that was pointed directly at the death eater

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

*** Yeah, it's a tough one.. What struck me about that scene was that Harry was very callous about the whole stabbing incident.

**** I don't think this is the fic you are talking about but Hogwarts Dawn by Jeconais has Harry stabbing Snape and killing him. It's an abandoned WIP (last update 2014) that is over 186K words.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hogwarts_Dawn/index/]]

Do you remember anything else about the fic? (Oh and I'm assuming that Harry Kills Snape in this fic.

** Your 1st fic is tough as there are a couple of fics that discuss treating non magical cancer patients. The kicker is the reveal of wizard world. For instance,

The story A Slytherin Way of Being by catchingafallingstar has Harry revealing the wizarding world to the entire world.

linkffn(12915365)

But I really think the story you are looking for is Lord of Darkness by AngelSlayer135. Where Dumbledore teams up with Voldemort and grindleward to stop Harry fro revealing the Wizarding world. In the story a group of Wizards go in and cure everyone in a cancer ward.

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.
