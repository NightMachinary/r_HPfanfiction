** The premise seems so...contrived.

Excerpt: “If I don't kill him, then I'll die and someone else will kill him anyway.

I can't stop him from dying.

It might as well be me to do it. To say goodbye.

To say sorry.” End

Like....what? Hermione would know about the Nuremberg trials at the very least and how that logic doesn't hold up. Why would this even occur to her? It's much easier to believe that she would pretend to accept the task, intending to tell Dumbledore about it immediately, but have no intentions on following through. She went from 0-100 here.

*** I 100% get where you are coming from! I am not sure if you have read all the way through, but she does actually try to tell the Weasleys, but realizes that she can't actually say anyone or else bad things will ensue. Hermione reacted that way in the first chapter because she kind of lost hope. Everything had gone horribly wrong within just hours. She had felt like she had lost control of everything. She was scared. I understand that Hermione usually wouldn't really give up that easily, so that's why I made her try to go against what she was told to do. I intend to make her do it more. I want Hermione to be determined to try to find a way to warn people.

*** Why would hermione have to know about Nuremberg.

This is one of those thing I dislike about hermione in fanfic, because she reads she knows everything. In reality you read about stuff your interested in. There is a good chance she never got around to reading about Nuremberg trials (or millions other things) given that she had so much wizarding stuff to read as well.

Spending the majority of your teenage years in the wizarding world would mean that by the time your 17 you would have an enormously different base of knowledge that your would know.

I for example only understood about the trials when I was 15 or so in a history class. We wernt studying it specifically it just came up in discussion.

There would also not be books on the topic in the wizarding library, we know that she didn't bring that many books to hogwarts from cos so we can assume that they are all textbooks. So she is completely isolated from the muggle world except for a few months of the summer, where there are significantly more interesting things to read about than the after effects of world war two, or maths textbooks.

This is a trope that I know will never go away because of how easy it makes life for the writer but I wish there were just more scenes around where hermione didn't know something that we know naturally because of our very different childhoods.

**** YES! I agree! I even add in the chapter after the first one that she scolds herself for just studying up for her apparition license almost all summer.

** So your pacing works for the first chapter. I'll even allow it in the second day chapter. That sort of 'shakey cam' jump thought jump can work. But I think you carry it too far. I dipped out at chapter three when you were still clearly following it. If it's your writing style and a choice, nbd, just not for me. But if you plan into normal prose I'd keep it in mind for the future.

Note: never leave an Authors note as the whole chapter. Just wait and attach it to whatever you're next posting. It's frequently an immediate unfollow for a lot of people.

Also: I really hope that's a burner email and not your real one for doxxing purposes.
