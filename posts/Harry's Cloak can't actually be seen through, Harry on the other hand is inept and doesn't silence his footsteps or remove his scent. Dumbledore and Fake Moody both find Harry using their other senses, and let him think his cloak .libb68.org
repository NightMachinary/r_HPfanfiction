That way the Cloak actually lives up to its legend of being the Cloak that can hide you from even Death, and Harry, if he finds out about how Dumbledore and Fake Moody could see him, learns to silence his footsteps, walk silently, and remove his scent, so he really IS invisible.

As Harry put down the letter, his face was red, as suddenly a lot of things made sense.

He immediately made a note to ask Hermione about silencing and scent masking spells, he would test to see if Moody could still find him then, or Professor Dumbledore.

****** Well, it's not like it is. The trope, I mean. I don't really like Albus Dumbledore. He's done some pretty messed up things. But even if I disregard that, he's pretty messed up as a person as well. A lot of actions before and during the series could very well be classified as abuse, negligence, and so many other things /[Eemembers him setting fire to a child's wardrobe]/. He's definitely not perfect. Even if I can see where his plan to defeat Voldemort came from. So I can definitely see him attempting to put a tracking spell on the cloak. And if that doesn't work, then he'd do it on Harry's glasses or something.

******* Oh yeah, Dumbledore is an asshole. The whole Voldemort problem could've been a lot shorter if he just behaved for once.

But my point here is that him putting a tracking spell on the cloak, when the fic gives no other reason to dislike Dumbledore, isn't anywhere near a bad thing. It's the responsible thing to do.

Even putting one on Harry himself could probably be justified by the end of PoA, imo, if Dumbledore would actually /use them/. The kid gets in the middle of every possible problem. Having a way for Dumbledore to swoop in and deal with it would be ideal. Sadly, fics don't ever go that route.

********* This brings up two interesting points of discussion.

One, is Dumbledore personally responsible for Harry? On one hand if he is, then he's fucked up massively with the Dursleys, but him tracking Harry is completely legit, IRL parents do that to young children via phone apps. On the other hand, if he's not responsible for Harry, then he shouldn't do that, but in that case, the majority of the flak usually listed against Dumbledore doesn't hold up - he's not responsible for Harry any more then any other professor, and he had no say about dropping him off at the Dursleys.

And the other one is a question that I've never actually seen asked - did four students actually create a map that can track everyone in a school, or is the Marauders' map just tapping into some existing tracking system which a boarding school /absolutely/ needs, and somewhat canonically has? (Professors /always/ showing up when something happens without any sort of tracker would be a bit weird, imo.) Because if it's the later case, then putting a tracker on the item that would let Harry bypass the system is very much fair game.

** Well, I have noticed that all those times fake Moody has seen him with is eye, have been times when Harry has waved in his general direction while under the cloak, basically intending to be seen by Moody The first time was unintentional (he forgot he was invisible when he waved at Hagrid, and Moody - who literally can see out of the back of his head noticed) The second time was fully intentional because he wanted Moody to know that the map and egg was his so he could prevent Snape from seeing the map

One could postulate that the cloak interpreted his intention and made him visible to the person he wanted to be visible to...

As for Dumbledore knowing ... all of those times have been basically him using common sense and observation. Umbridge did the same too when she showed up at Hagrid's place. She had observed the three sets of footprints in the snow and deduced that Hagrid had guests. Only she, unlike Dumbledore, did not know that Harry owns an invisibility cloak and therefore let it go when she didn't see anyone else in the small house It's not just silencing your footsteps and masking your scent... being truly invisible takes serious thought, especially when your foe is observant!

** My problem with the need to use silencing spells on your feet and no scent smells etc., is it ignores the fact that a powerful diety like Death can hear and smell so his cloak wouldn't be much good to hide from him if you had to remember to silence yourself (don't forget the noise that breathing hard, or your heart racing makes) and make sure no smell, heat, etc., escapes. Plus if I can recall canon correctly Crouch jr as Mad eye can see through the cloak when using the goblin eye (Dumbledore knowing they are outside Hagrid's hut etc).

For those reasons I lean towards the elder wand being used to place some sort of tracking and revealing spell on the cloak. Thinking that no other wand is powerful enough to tamper with Death's gift. And that's why mad eye and Dumbledore seem to be aware when Harry is around under the cloak.

Now I object to Dumbledore doing this as he has no right to mess with Harry's property nor did he have a right to withhold the cloak irregardless of how young Harry is as it is a Potter Heirloom not a Dumbledore one (I can see him holding it back until Harry rejoins the magical world). I especially thought giving it to Harry as a Christmas gift was a bit tacky. "Gee, so my gift from you is your returning my property to me? Wow how generous". /sarc

** The best explanations I've read are:

Dumbles added some thread from a Demiguise to the cloak. His glasses can see invisible objects, so when he sees the thread, he knows it's Harry. He also informed Moody/Crouch about this.

The Marauders Map recognizes people by where they walk, and there are no invisible shoes of Ignotus Peverell to solve that.

The map can't identify who is under the cloak by can determine that there is some kind of void moving around the school. Because it is unique and doesn't show up as a ghost, the Marauders just label the void as 'Potter.'

Plus sound, smell, muddy footprints.
