Partly in response to the many, many threads and comments that mention feelings that Harry is a flat character or /not/ a character they identify with, yet Harry is by most polls, the majority of the community's favorite character to read about. I'm sure there must then be many shy Harry fans, so here's the place to come out!

Also personally I've always liked /and/ identified with Harry and was surprised that so many people didn't when I first discovered this sub +/ the fanfic community.


** I like that he can actually be quite a difficult person to be around when he is unhappy. He's often criticised for his behaviour in ootp, but when it came out I was suffering from the aftermath of a traumatic incident and I related so strongly.

*** Combine PTSD with puberty, and you have the recipe for Harry in Book 5.

** He is an underdog, and also brave and fundamentally decent. Those are things that most people like. He was mistreated as a child, which also tends to earn people's sympathy.

On a more personal note, he did not have friends before coming to Hogwarts, and when he makes them he is very appreciative. I identify with that, because I am shy and have never found it easy to make friends.

** His righteous anger. When Harry decides that he is morally obligated to do something (go after Sirius, stalk Malfoy) there is no dissuading him. And he'll shit all over anyone who tries. It's not a good look on either of us.

** The only part I really identify with is that he's about as observant as a brick-bloody-wall unless he's actively trying to achieve something.

** A physical trait that catches peoples eyes (his scar, my height).

** The 'bullied' and 'everyone thinks he's crazy/misguided'.

His sportsing and lack of.... nerdiness deeply disappoints me, though.
