:END:
Hey,

I'm new to this sub but I've been trying to find this fic for a while and even though (I think) I remember a lot of stuff there's been no trace of it on fanfiction.net or ao3. It's unfinished last I read it, and I'm nearly certain it was on ff.net

Harry (i think his name is Hadrian in this story) is actually born around the same time as Tom riddle and is also found abandoned outside of the same orphanage soon after Tom is. They grow up together as close friends and although Harry/Hadrian is more kind, he's still not good.

They both end up in slytherin and Tom is much more popular and charismatic than Hadrian, Hadrian mostly likes to read. Tom and Hadrian end up in a relationship around their 5-7th year. Tom becomes Voldemort, possibly with horcruxes though I'm not sure. I know Hadrian has discovered he has some sort of astral projection soul powers (which lets him talk to dead people possibly?) and so despised the idea of horcruxes.

He is killed in some battle and Voldemort is devastated, Hadrian is reborn as Harry Potter, and same as canon, killing curse rebounds on Voldemort when Harry is a baby. He has his old memories because of astral powers and seeks out Voldemort.

I think it ended around Harry's first year or so? Not complete though. I know this seems like a lot of detail to remember yet not find the story but I've tried all key word variations I can think of and nothing. Please help. Thank you

  Two boys grow up together in an orphanage, grow powerful at school, are torn apart by death and brought back together by rebirth. Horcruxes aren't the only way to live forever. Necromancy, reincarnation, HP/TR Slash dark!Harry.
