:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
-The first I've only seen in passing never actually read myself, probably a time travel story.

Boy tom riddle enters the chamber of secrets only to find harry with a bloodstained sword of gryffindor, a dead rooster, a cackling g sorting g hat, and in roller skates. Only with harry to say 'no one will ever believe you' and roller skates away.

-The second is an incomplete fic that I've read before but want the title for reference purposes.

Basically Salazar kills godric and obtains immortality and it severely changes the wizarding world. Mughleborns are taken from there honest the first sign of magic. Hermione is taken and put into some muggleborn school run by umbridhe until she tests into going into hogwarts.

Grindenwald is alive and is across some kind of border kinda like the wall from game of thrones, with an army of dark creatures.

The order is basically a group of vigilantes who try to get to muggleborns before the ministry, dumbledore, mcgonagall, hagrid, remus, tonks. Etc. Are all known members and fugitives.

Hogwarts is run by Tom riddle and his death eaters, they all used to work on the dark border under him, and are still fanatically loyal to him, but tom secretly detests the ministry, and is obsessed with finding out salazars secret to immortality.

I'm also looking for anything similar and completed, but I might dedicate that to a post of its own.

-The third the only things I remember about it was that hermione and her parents were attacked and she portrayed them to hogwarts.

I think one of them died because I remember a conversation between her and harry where she's sobbing/laughing because she did research on grief and had good notes.

I also remember they used a chainsaw against a magic resistant door.

It might have started [[/r/hr][r/hr]], but I think it ended h/hr.


** Second might be "Reign of the Serpent"

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
