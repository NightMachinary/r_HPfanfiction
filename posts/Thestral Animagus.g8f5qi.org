:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a fic that has Harry as a Thestral Animagus and is sometimes disguised as a girl, I think it is in fanfiction.net. Does this ring any bells for anyone?


** The only story that i'm aware of/read that has Harry able to turn into a thestral is Marauders Think Titles are Lame by GrimTuesday. Though i don't remember if he turns into a girl (though he does have metamorphmagus capabilities). It's a WIP though it looks like it's moved into abandoned territory as the last update was in Jan 2018.

  PoA AU in which -- Harry isn't so clumsy, Dobby's worth is realized, Sirius has priorities other than vengeance, and Luna is Luna. This is the result of my internet being down and not being able to feed my World of Warcraft addiction. Exactly zero plot mapping has gone on with this and it will likely continue until I am bored to tears with it. It will likely be borderline crack and I will likely make Harry ridiculously powerful. There will be attempts made at humor sprinkled in throughout the fic. I've yet to decide on any pairings in the fic but if there are any all types of pairings will be considered, you have been warned. I'll try to post warnings for Graphic Content but I'll likely forget. This isn't smut nor is it going to be too gory, it is after all only 3rd year. I'll make no promises about the rate that this will come out but in three days of writing it has around 16k words to give you an idea of how quickly I write. This at the moment is pure catharsis, if it gets to the point where there are people wanting more I'll certainly do my best to deliver.

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.
