** You're a little short on structure and guidance. For instance, what age is Harry at the start? I have much different suggestions if he's eighteen than if he's eleven. Are we assuming canon up to the point of departure? What's the story up to the point where we're choosing this role? Is it a life goal / career type of role?

*** The story starts with an eleven-year-old. I'm not actually using a name, referring to the character as "you".

The roles will be strategically placed in different places around the story, for example, if he wanted to be a programmer you might have the option one day in the library to read a coding book, or maybe get access to a computer.

The last one is hard to explain. For example, if he was an alchemist, alchemy would be the main thing he did, but it wouldn't be a career or any life goal.

** The form is restricted. I'd been happy to offer suggestions but I can't.

**** Could you define role a bit for me? I'm finding it a bit vague, what do you want?

***** Sure!

Basically, I mean different paths Harry can take. He could become Master of Death, Sorcerer Supreme, become a god, whatever you want.

Another way of going here is to make a quest on spacebattles or sufficientvelocity. A rather different end result, though it might be handy for bouncing ideas off people.
