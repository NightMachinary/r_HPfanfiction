Dumbledore doesn't take kindly to this upstart with delusions of grandeur.


** Dumbledore suddenly smiled, though his eyes did not twinkle.

Lord Greengrass smirked. "Finally ready to address me by my proper title? If you don't, I'll be forced to advise Daphne to avoid you. And with how besotted Harry is with my daughter, that does not bode well for your relationship with your surrogate son."

Dumbledore said nothing.

Cyrus Greengrass stood and raised his fist to slam it down on Dumbledore's desk. He stopped. Something wet was below his nose. He touched it with a finger. He raised his finger. It was blood.

Dumbledore finally spoke, "It seems that you are not feeling too well, Cyrus. Perhaps we could continue this another time?"

Cyrus Greengrass turned, something felt off to him. Why was he lightheaded? And his legs felt so weak... He collapsed to the floor. A jolt of energy shot through him, enough to get him crawling, as he realized what was happening. Dumbledore must have cursed him. He needed to get to the floo. He was so close. He reached for the floo powder in his p-

-Cyrus jolted awake.

"Alright there, /Cyrus/? It seems you dozed off for a bit there."

*** I thoroughly enjoyed that. I especially loved how you switched from Lord Greengrass to Cyrus Greengrass in the post.

** "Harry? What's that rumor about you being Lord Potter?"

"That's my actual name now. And it's not even made up. Sirius thought it'd be absolutely hilarious to make me a more legitimate Lord than Voldemort, and mail ordered it for fifty pounds from Sealand."

*** Not quite what I asked, but great nonetheless.

Should have had it be Lord Slytherin for the lulz.

** I can picture it now, Dumbledore gets the whole Greengrass family executed because they pissed him off.

Would probably make it a better fic, too. Those characters are ridiculously cliched despite not even existing in the books.

**** I now want to see a fic where Harry starts out as he does in independant!Harry fics, but at the point where he meets Daphne (because let's face it, that happens in every single one), he's turned off because she's always a massive bitch at first, and, after considering his options, works something out with Dumbledore so they can get along and work together. Where he sees how his usual independant!cliche allies act from an outside point of view and condemns them.

Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort teaming up against the gray, anyone?

***** I'm not sure if a team up fic would work, but how about Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Harry having the same reaction to each member of the family.

****** I was trying to write a team-up fic at one point, although it didn't get past being a bunch of notes. I feel like all it would take would be a big enough threat. I've read a couple fics where both sides united when being hunted by muggles, but they all sadly had the crutch of HP/LV slash.

Imo, teaming up would be an interesting way of ending the war. Working together, with the forces being as small as they are, would eventually create some sort of civility between the Light and the Dark, leading to potential compromise.

As for the similar reactions, I can definitely see that happening. Dumbledore doesn't like them because they don't care about the muggleborn issues. Harry doesn't like them because they're arrogant assholes that don't contribute anything to the society. Voldemort doesn't like them because they don't care about the muggleborn issues, in a different way.

** My first throught was: 'When Dumbledore and Tom Riddle were allies?!'

/Moody teenager Tom/: since now, call me Lord Voldemort!

/Dumbledore, bemused/: Tom, my boy...

/Tom/: It's Lord Voldemort to you!

/Dumbledore, eye twitching/: You little-!
