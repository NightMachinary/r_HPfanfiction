** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3655940/1/Harry-Potter-Dark-Memories][Harry Potter: Dark Memories]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1201799/Blueowl][Blueowl]] sounds like exactly what you're looking for. I rather like this story, but its summary completely ignores several of the key plot elements, like the secret society (there's no hint this is coming until it is founded in chapter 11).

** There's the nonjon series of one-shots, "The DA Missions." They're pretty much all humor fics though, if that's not what you're looking for. linkffn(The DA Missions: Agent Toots) linkffn(The DA Missions: Agent Furry Fury) linkffn(The DA Missions: Agent Miss Print)

  62/? When Harry Potter starts coming into his full wizarding powers too early, what better way to stabilize his magic than a full marriage bond? Certain Weasley brothers can't stand to see Harry manipulated any longer, and suddenly plans change. Eventual Harry/Charlie, Fred/George, Sirius/? Begins after Harry's fourth year, but only VERY loosely follows plot after that point. Abuse
