The Founders Relics - Each had a power to them, some known, some unknown. *Helga's Cup was supposedly either in the enhancement of potions or some kind of food-related power. *Rowena's Diadem endowed the wearer with greater wisdom. *Godric's Sword was unrivaled as blade and became stronger based off what it could absorb. *Slytherin's Locket - ????

Was it a magical device? If so, what were it's powers?

Personally I always wondered if it was a early type of pensive; you placed your eye to the pictures in the locket and you could see and feel the memories that were stored there. I also wondered if it was a concealed watch, say the right word in Parseltongue and it transformed into a proto-type Time Turner that Salazar pioneered. I'm looking for ideas and suggestions, Thanks


** I'd have it act as a key to bypass the protections on the original Hogwarts preventing apparition. I'd have this be a defunct ability, however, as the protections would have been changed over the years.

I'd also have the locket allow for easier and more compulsion of snakes. Magical snakes would go from being able to refuse a parselmouth's request to being forced to at least consider it.

I'd also have the locket grant a slighter compulsion over other people to respect and follow the bearer of the locket. If the diadem granted wisdom, and the sword only appeared to those with courage, I think it'd be thematically fitting for the locket to aid in matters of ambition and cunning, namely convincing other people to do what you want.

I do think the abilities would be largely useless with the presence of the Horcrux and the additional protections placed upon the horcrux by Voldemort. Even if the Horcrux could be removed without damaging the artifact, the remaining enchantments would still interfere.

** This is interesting to me, as I was thinking about it the other day myself!

It makes sense for the fic I was writing, but I decided that the locket would let its wearer see the 'purity' of ones blood. It was a tool for Slytherin to sniff out the people he didn't like.
