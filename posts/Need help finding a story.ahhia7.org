So I've searched for the past 3 hours for a fic I read a long time ago and I can't find it at all.

It's a story where I'm pretty sure Harry is visited by death every once in a while and when he eventually goes to Hogwarts, they don't like Professor Binns so Death forces him to move on. Then Death brings back ghosts to teach about different time periods and everyone is super excited for it. Dumbledore isnt too happy about it because they teach something about him and Grindlewald.

That's all I have on it though, I think death was portrayed as some little girl though. I loved seeing all the reactions to the different ghosts though. I don't remember if it was finished or not. Any help is appreciated!


** This sound sort of familiar, will try to look for it when I get back home.
