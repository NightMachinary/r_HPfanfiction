I don't know if I'll actually end up enjoying them bc I typically hate genderswap fics, but I'be decides to try and further my palette bc I am running out of fics to read. Here are some other requirements: -At least 100k words -No PWP/mainly smut fics (preferably no smut at all but I'll deal with it if I have to, so long as it's in 6th year at the earliest) -Starts first year -must actually be fem /Harry/, not like the Alexandra quick series -no age gap ships (2 years max) -het, slash, femslash, gen, idc all are good

** Certain Dark Things: it's ongoing and actively updated - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16940712]])\\
Currently finished second year, tags warn about some romance deep into the future as a minor element, so I wouldn't fret on it.

I've been following it for a few months now, and got totally attached to it - love the characterizations, the vastly different worldbuilding that only slowly reveals itself and surprises you. And, of course, no bashing - always a plus!

** I feel like I'm always rec-ing this series, but try Pureblood Pretense. It's an AU based on the Song of the Lioness series by Tamora Pierce, but it's still fully in the HP world. It's pretty excellent, and the writer gets infinitely better as she progresses. We're about 2/3 of the way through book 4 now! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/][Pureblood Pretense]]

** Linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black; Season of Change) both have Harry finding out he was actually a girl and having to go through the transition back and dealing with it. Both are incomplete but worth a read.

Linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) has Harry go back in time and end up in an alternate version of himself that's female. It's complete and well-written.

Edit: Just checked Jamie Evans and it's only at 77k words. Still worth a read though.

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
