Looking for high quality fics where Harry does badass stuff.

*** Why is this story so lauded? I thought it was of rather poor quality.

**** In waht way? I like it mostly because it's completely different from the usual stuff, not to mention that there's pretty much non stop badass action scenes.

I understand it can be exhausting to read especially with Harry's rather unhinged personality but i'd never consider it poorly written.

***** Personally I had to put it down and pick it up like a week later. Exhausting was a good word to describe it.

***** Poor grammar, an overabundance of exposition, and a strange premise that makes little sense.

******* If the strange, nonsensical premise was my only problem with it, that might make a difference to my opinion.

****** There are some minor issues with grammar (as with all fanfictions due to lack of a dedicated editor). Having said this, the issues here are rather minor and did not prevent me from enjoying the story.

Additionally, I really enjoyed the exposition. It is not slow moving in any way. Yes, there are lots of flashbacks and nonsensical sentences, but these are used to create an atmosphere. And it does create an atmosphere rather well...

Edit: thanks for the downvote [[/u/The_Lonely_Rogue_117]] . I was just trying to ensure people would be able to see multiple viewpoints. No need to be rude.

  Sequel to Wastelands! Time has all but run out for Harry Potter. There are no more second chances. No more desperate bids for salvaged redemption. The game has changed, and in the end Harry will learn that the cost of his defiance has never run so high.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
