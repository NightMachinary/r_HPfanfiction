Has anyone written a Harry like this? Where he's hella cocky, magically talented, and his grades in school back that up. Kinda like how the twin in wbwl are portrayed. But when he faces Voldemort for the first time (maybe 2nd year in the chamber, or 4th year in the graveyard) he gets overwhelmed by the power and skill of Voldemort. Finally he's humbled by the task set ahead of him. Maybe he even gets depressed as he realizes it's up to him to defeat Voldemort.


** Prince of Slytherin basically has this happen to the wbwl in the story with him slowly spiraling into an almost psychotic break with his biggest fear being that he's not good enough.

It's not the exact request, but the graveyard teaches him that.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
