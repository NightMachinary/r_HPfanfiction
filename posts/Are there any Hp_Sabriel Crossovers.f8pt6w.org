Does anyone know if there are either crossovers with Garth Nix's Old Kingdom series (Sabriel, Lireal, etc)? Or where the author adopts the magic used in the books for the HP universe. Thanks!


** Ooooh! That would be so good!

** linkffn(Circular Reasoning by swimdraconian) has (a tiny amount of) Old Kingdom-inspired magic, iirc. Crossovers are rare enough that it's worth just looking through them on ffn and ao3---I think there's only a dozen or two total. I can't remember any that stood out as being particularly good.
