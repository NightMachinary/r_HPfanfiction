"Hoax" is the only way I can think of describing it. Something like the Mr Black thing in "Make A Wish", generally leading people to think they're more powerful than they really are. Either that or a plot to prank someone in a surreal way (not Transfiguring spoons into spiders, more like something that makes a person question their sanity or reality but in a funnyish way).

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer? I think it meets some criteria.
