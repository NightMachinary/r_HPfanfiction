I just wanted to share this piece I discovered on a03. I liked because it was written well and the characterizations stood out to me as quite believable. I usually don't go for Dramione fics because I can't stand most of the overused tropes, but this one just made sense to me.

Anyway, here it is! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6062190]]


** Bless your heart. This is right up my alley! If you have more recs for well-written ministry fic (or believable characterizations of the characters as adults, in general), I would love to see them.

*** It was such a diamond in the rough that I had to share. I unfortunately haven't come across any more like this so far, but I'll let you know if I do!
