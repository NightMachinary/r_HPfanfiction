Harry Potter attends a less prestigious magic school in, say, the Netherlands. The reason he is in that country is due to him being put up for adoption the day after the Dursleys discover him on their doorstep. Some people in Britain aren't too pleased with the turn of events and makes some questionable attempts to 'retrieve' him. Attempts include, but is not limited to, kidnappings, lawsuits, sanctions, enticement, and espionage.


** Naturally, once Voldemort gets the Philosopher's Stone at the end of the 1991 school year, the public's concerns about what school Harry Potter is attending pale in comparison.

*** If you're not writing crack, Voldemort doesn't get the stone. Technically, Harry is the one who put it in danger. The diary stays in Myrtle's stall. Sirius is probably the 1st person who suffers from Harry's absence. Krum is 2nd as he'll probably be murdered during the TWT.

**** If Harry Potter never shows up to Hogwarts, I'm sure Voldemort would change his plans, and that might end up with him say, kidnapping a random student, and using them to get the stone

***** Randomly kidnapping a student would alert Dumbledore, which, besides death, was the 1 thing Voldemort did his best to avoid. We know Dumbledore guessed what Quirrell was up to, but I'm almost certain they thought they'd bested Dumbledore and, in a way, they did.

But, also, Dumbledore returned to Hogwarts without prompting from anyone else. So he finds Quirrell standing in front of the mirror and Voldemort flees like he did before.

****** I think the timeline is tight enough, that right after dumbledore leaves, Voldemort could kidnap a student and secure the stone, especially if he isn't delayed by any students for a few minutes. Even if he can't though, I doubt he would have stuck around if he hadn't be delayed by Harry

******* I don't think Quirellemort knew about Dumbledore trick before being in front of the mirror (and even there I'm not sur he really understood how to get the stone). He would clearly not have the time to do a round trip just to capture a student.

The mirror also need to find someone that /want/ the stone without wanting to /use/ it. Something that would probably be a bit hard to find in the school (though this point is probably up to the author).

******* Kidnapping a student doesn't guarantee him getting the stone. You have to want to find the stone, but not use it. Voldemort doesn't know that and a student isn't going to want to find the stone for a person that kidnapped them. If we're going with logic, Dumbledore would have safeguarded against the Imperius, too.

Harry is immediately tied up and disarmed. Quirrell continued to stand in front of the mirror inspecting it.

But I simply said Voldemort doesn't get the stone. It was your idea that he would stick around to kidnap a student.

Edit: Quirrell also had at least a 30 minute headstart and was still inspecting the mirror when Harry got there

***** It had to be someone who knew about the Stone /and/ didn't want it to be used; and Voldemort has no way to learn about that without a lot of trial and error. Someone like, say, Hermione might immediately think about all the good she could do with that gold, how her grandma could use an Elixir of Life, etc., and get locked out. Neville might wonder if his parents could be cured.

** This is my version of events:

Let's see what could happen if Harry is completely MIA:

Year 1

- Nobody got into that duel with Draco, so no alienation with Hermione, no finding out about Fluffy
- Nobody got into that fight with the Troll, so Hermione was either killed or she didn't cry in that loo because of the above point. Anyway, no Trio.
- No hint about Fluffy, no Hermione doing research, no Hermione pushing them on studying, no hint from Hagrid about Flamel
- Finally, Quirrellmort got stuck in front of the Mirror and was neutralized by Dumbledore. Voldemort ceased to be a threat for a very very long time.

Year 2

- Lucius still planted the Diary on Ginny, but she broke free sometime in November and dumped it in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
- Since there was no Harry chatting up Moaning Myrtle, it was not found again for years, or even decades.
- The CoS plot came to an abrupt halt, and nobody had a clue about what had happened.

Year 3

- Weasleys still went to Egypt, took that picture, and Sirius broke out.
- Sirius successfully killed Wormtail at Hogwarts and went on the run.

Year 4

- Since both Voldemort and Wormtail had been neutralized, Bertha Jorkins was fine, and there was no sabotage attempt at TWT.
- Barty Jr broke free from his father's Imperius Curse during the Quidditch World Cup and went on the run.

After all that, two characters should drive the plot forward:

- Sirius who wanted to exonerate himself and find Harry
- Barty Jr who wanted to find his Lord and free his comrades from Azkaban

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

** I really want to see/write a story where Harry Potter goes to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-2ZxldMO-M][Clortho Wizarding High School]]. The premise would be that Vernon Dursley really wanted to spite the wizards and paint Harry Potter in the negative light (Saint Brutus School for the Criminally Insane).

Vernon saw the strict policeman and the principle in an advertisement (see the video) and thought that it would teach Harry Potter some manners!
