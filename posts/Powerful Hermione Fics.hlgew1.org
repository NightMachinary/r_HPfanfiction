Does anyone have any recommendations for fics focusing on the wizarding world and its politics, as well as how Hermione deals with them? Like talking good old ruthless, revolutionary Hermione Jean Granger here. Q Not opposed to ones with Dark!Hermione or Ravenclaw/Slytherin!Hermione, just want some with her being a general, unmitigated badass. Can be gen or romance, I'll give plenty of examples below in a reply so it doesn't crowd up the request.

Then [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Starfox5/pseuds/Starfox5/works?fandom_id=136512][Starfox5]] is really your goto author.

His [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6273811/chapters/14375362][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkao3(6273811), can be considered the ultimate Revolutionary Hermione fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15793902/chapters/36753675][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkao3(15793902), is more humorous and has a reformed Grindelwald leading them.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11645676/chapters/26197056][Divided and Entwined]], linkao3(11645676), goes more into the details of military operations, magical guerrilla warfare, and Wizengamot politics.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this..

#+begin_quote
  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Have you read The Arithmancer and its sequel? It's a fairly decent super!Hermione with an interesting premise, but ultimately a little too self-indulgent for my taste. I don't see it on your list, though, and from what you've provided I can't tell whether you've tried it and don't like it or whether you haven't read it yet.

Also, this should be tagged "Request".
