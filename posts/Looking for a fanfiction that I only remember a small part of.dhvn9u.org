As the title states I'm trying to find a fanfiction I read a long time ago. I remember at the time it was one of my favorites. However I've read so much I only remember a small scene of this fanfiction and hoping someone can help me find it

The scene I remember is that I believe its harry under gringotts where some goblins set up an ambush to assassinate him. They have these enchanted knives and during the fight one of the slams into a lantern and explodes.

I know it's not much to go on but any help will be appreciated!


** Sounds ripped off straight from the third book of Eragon lol. Small humanoid with enchanted daggers cause a lantern to explode? Straight out of Farthen Dur in /Brisingr/

**** Yeah when I read it it was strikingly similar to that scene. There were a couple other spots where it seemed the author had just read eragon and pulled ideas from it

** It eerily resembles a scene from third book of Inheritance cycle, where Eragon is ambushed in the tunnels by some rogue dwarves.

** i only know of 2 goblin assassin fics, one is a humor fic (inspected by no 13) and the other is more serious (dragon child) but neither of those attempts take place under gringotts afaik, and only the second directly uses knives, but no lantern that i remember

*** What is the second one called? I might be mixing stories up but at the same time I'm pretty sure the story is around 10 to 12 years old by now
