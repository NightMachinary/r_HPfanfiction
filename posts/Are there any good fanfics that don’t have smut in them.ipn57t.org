My mom wants to read the fanfiction with me but I don't want to accidentally read smut with her, haha. And I mean like, an AU(different than how the originals go, but not necessarily a muggle version) , not an OC x hp character, you know? Maybe something with Draco being good from the beginning? Thank you!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), for AU. It's the most popular fic on this sub and very fun

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], for canon compliance. It depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, from their Muggle neighbor's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), for time travel. Draco's 'redemption' is a fun side plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802), for a major AU in which Harry grew up under her loving and BAMF aunt, Dr Petunia Evans.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), for what it could have been if canon adults were just slightly more competent and less negligent.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** These are both only PG max. And there are some really heart-warming parental/mentor moments so I think that'll be great to read with your mom.

By the way, when you say AU (Alternate Universe) that usually means a non-Harry Potter universe, like Muggle AU, which I assume is not what you mean right?

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

*** Yeah, your right. I mean AU as in it's not just a copy of the original HP but he goes back in time, or something different happens than from what happens in the original.

** There is not all that much HP smut, and the ratings on the fic sites alert you to its presence or absence. So just pick stuff rated T or below. [[https://archiveofourown.org/faq/tutorial-posting-a-work-on-ao3?language_id=en#pwtrating][AO3 explanation of ratings.]] I think FF's are similar.

X-files fic, now that was almost all smut. Heh.
