Harry can only time travel a few seconds into the past, 10 seconds at the maximum. And he can only do it once a day.


** That would've probably helped him save Cedric.

** Interesting idea, but I'm having a hard time thinking of many times in the books where it would actually be useful. At most, he might be able to dodge or block one extra spell per day, and only if the spell wasn't immediately debilitating, but that's about it. Here's the best I could come up with.

Times he probably would have used it to make changes:

- Stopping Lockhart from taking Ron's wand or causing the cave in.
- Hitting Draco with Sectumsempra. Though I'm not sure how much this would actually end up changing.
- Saving Hedwig.
- He might have been able to get the locket off before it started choking him.

Times he would have liked to use it, but probably wouldn't be able to, because he probably would have used it earlier:

- Saving Cedric, since there's a very good chance he would have used it at some point in the maze instead. And his scar was incapacitating him at the time, so he wouldn't have been able to do much anyway.
- Saving Sirius, though with all the fighting that had already happened that day, he could easily have already used the ability.
- The entire final battle, probably. He might have been able to save someone, but it's hard to say who, and if they wouldn't end up dying in a different way anyway.

Times he probably would have used it, but nothing would really change:

- Stopping Lockhart from vanishing his bones. Except he probably would have used it to avoid the bludger instead, and it would still be trying to hit him, so there's a chance nothing would change. But even if he did avoid the situation entirely, it wouldn't affect the plot at all.
- Stopped Pettigrew's escape. He was rather distracted by the werewolf at the time, and I'm not sure he knew any spells that would have helped anyway.
- He'd definitely try using it when Dumbledore died (if he didn't use it in the cave), but since Dumbledore kept him incapacitated, it wouldn't accomplish anything.
- He might use it when Nagini disguised as Bagshot attacked him, but even in the best case, all that could do is eliminate Nagini earlier. And he would count that as a win, but all it would really end up changing is taking away Neville's moment of glory.

I think that the best use for this ability (other than saving Hedwig), would probably be letting Harry curse, punch, or otherwise assault Malfoy, Snape, Umbridge, Dudley, Vernon, or anyone else who was annoying him without consequences. And honestly, that would probably be worth it.

*** Very good points, so what if we change it up a bit ....

Harry can use this ability to go a variable amount of time, but the process of integrating his future self memories into his past self is disorienting and imperfect. After the process completes, the story continues from the perspective of the past-self harry .. who is left with trying to piece togethor what the "future" memories are trying to tell him ... before time runs out.

The further back in time he sends the memories, the worse the disorientation on arrival, and the more memories are lost in the transition

Harry can train the ability to have better accuracy in terms of sending memories to his past self, but the limit of his ability is to send a single ... thought ... 10 years into the past (at full training)
