Kinda like "HP and the GWL" or " Equal and Opposite" or something like that ?


** Fem!Harry fics pop up like weeds nowadays, but an actual Harry/fem!Harry doesn't surface but once a year, maybe.

That said, HP and the Energumen of the Elchee by the_oddest_exclamation over on Ao3 started a bit over a year ago and updated in the last month. About as AU an AU as a U gets. Entirely inappropriate and esoteric juvenile sexual politics abound.

*** I don't understand what you mean by "inappropriate and esoteric juvenile sexual politics." like, are they arguing about whether fingering is second base? Are they calling each other "fag?" Are they trying to decide whether magically stealing panties counts as scoring?

  I got sick of seeing the same old shit, done the same old way, in Harry Potter Fan-fiction.So I decided to take as many new ideas as i could think of, while mixing in things that I have seen before in ways I haven't seen before.That means that while there will be graphic sex, among other things in this story, it won't be for a few chapters. Also there is an excessive number of content tags, but I want to be through, and rest assured anything tagged will be in the story at some point.
