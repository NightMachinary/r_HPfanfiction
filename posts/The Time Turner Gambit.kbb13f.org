Time Turners are one of the most heavily regulated magical artefacts in the country, yet every year one third year Hogwarts student is offered a Time Turner should their Head of House convince the Headmaster they are capable of handling the strain and responsibility.

The vast majority, even Hermione Granger herself, send it back by the end of their third year and drop out of their extra electives.

But those who don't (those who AT LEAST manage to get through their OWL's using the time manipulating device) are offered a provisional offer of employment at the Department of Mysteries. As they passed the first test.

The use of Time Turners for Unspeakables to work on multiple projects at once is standard protocol...

*** Harry would, accidentally, realise the true point of the test: prioritising time and creative thinking.

Where Hermione floundered in her classes due to stress and lack of sleep, Harry would work out ways to do his classes AND use time travel to get extra rest. Hermione would still fail, but only because she would object to using such a powerful magical artifact for something so frivolous.

Also, the DoM would be more than willing to send a second Time Turner ONLY because it was going to Harry, and they wanted to test the child of prophecy.

**** Hard to say.

Firstly, Hermione didn't just have her classes. She also spent much of the year trying to master a completely foreign (and, given the way wizards seem to tick, rather archaic) legal system from reading library books alone. Hermione's "failure", if any, was prioritising justice over scholarship or power---but that's why she is a Gryffindor rather than a Ravenclaw or a Slytherin. She also dropped Divination eliminating one clash, and it's not like she was getting much out of Muggle Studies---and at that point, what was the point of having the time-turner?^{1}

Secondly, the more you tangle up the timeline to make more time, the more you risk messing up: students at Hogwarts don't actually get that much privacy so the risk of being observed in two places at once is not trivial; and there are always factors, such as Peeves, that you can't plan around. The consequence of messing up are, if you are lucky, revealing the Time Turner's existence to others and getting it confiscated. If you are less lucky, it might be stolen, or you might create a temporal paradox that will erase you from time.

I mean, if you want your "Harry" to succeed by author fiat, that's up to you, but don't blame canon characters for actually being responsible for once.

--------------

^{1} On further thought, that could be a plot point in a fic that features institutional blood-purism. If the Unspeakables recruit from Muggle Studies, they would conveniently exclude Muggleborns and Halfbloods who don't bother to take it since it's useless to them, but Purebloods who take it are the curious ones.

***** I remember reading in a fic once, that Harry got the idea to turn the entire day back after classes, to make time to eat, sleep and rest in between, rather than doing things in tiny chunks.

Then he just found a room, to spend the rest of the day in out of sight.

I thought that was quite a clever solution.

****** Again, if the fic author says it works, then it works. Several reasons it might not work:

1. Time-turners probably can't go back in time that far. According to Pottermore, the absolute limit is 5 hours.

2. Longer jumps make things exponentially more risky, because consequences of any slip-ups propagate exponentially with the length of the jump, and there is only so much a character can plan for.

   These include things like the Weasley Twins decided to use that room to brew a potion one day, or if Peeves follows the character just as they are about to go back in time, or Filch decides that it's this room's turn to be cleaned?

   Maybe if one has access to some space that no one else does, such as the Chamber of Secrets or the Room of Requirement, but otherwise? Too risky.

3. In order to keep the time-turner, the character has to actually attend the double-booked classes. This means that either they have to leave the room, or they have to have three of themselves running around on occasion. It's not clear what the consequences of /that/ are.

One could write an interesting fic around a character having complex interactions with time. I'd probably make Hermione the protagonist---because to make Harry smart and methodical enough to pull it off requires a complete personality rewrite, whereas Hermione is already there and just needs to be forced by circumstances to do something complex and risky.

******* Number 2 can be solved by the staff. "Hey, I need a room I can stay in for time travelling downtime. Is there any way to secure it or something?"

And then bring up the often-used password portraited private rooms for married students/visitors. Hell, there's probably quite a few unused staff rooms that are similar.

**** I think it's a bit of a dumb test then. It's not "creative thinking". It's just abusing the Time Turner. That could lead to disastrous consequences, like messing up the timeline or having other people find out about the Time Turner. The test would measure irresponsibility, not competence.

***** You pass if you can successfully cope with OWL study whilst not breaking the space time continuum.

Giving a time machine to a 13 y/o is dumb PERIOD, even if they are all like Hermione. But one that can navigate seamlessly through their day-to-day, remaining on top of their studies and extracurricular, whilst finding ways to be well rested and adjusted in the process (without being told how) would be impressive.

Particularly because, in this AU of mine, that's basically how Unspeakables work. They have that much work that Time Turner use is essential, thus they like to offer jobs to kids who demonstrate how to use one correctly and remain productive and stable.

But it's not using it correctly. McGonagall told Hermione that bad things would happen to her if she messed with the Time Turner too much, and she followed those orders because she was a responsible person who thought about the consequences of her actions. In this AU, the people who are becoming Unspeakables would just be extremely irresponsible and rebellious. Putting yourself in extreme danger just to get a few more hours of sleep isn't a good thing, and indicates a severe lack of forethought, which Unspeakables would probably need. If they wanted to test who can use the Time Turner productively, they should just tell the kids that they can use the Time Turner outside of class if they're too stressed, but not to overdo it. It's weird to have a "secret test" that can endanger kids' /lives/ (being erased from existence is canonically possible), especially since this AU has them handing out Time Turners willy-nilly.

** Further head-canon: The test the Unspeakables are conducting has nothing to do with talent or ambition: those are handled by them choosing all the electives in the first place.

The test evaluates how good the candidate is at dealing with isolation and secret-keeping under pressure, not at how good they are at following a potions recipe. Hermione is a perfect example of someone who would end up joining the Unspeakables regardless of how she gets there thanks to her intelligence, drive and ambition.

What the time Turner test determines is what work stream they enter under- unsuccessful test subjects would enter under normal circumstances, such as through research grants or direct application, while the successful ones are uniformly offered a starting position in the field office, where they are tasked with investigating strange magics and determining what approach an Unspeakable team would need to take if they intend to investigate it, essentially acting as a scout for any future Unspeakable teams that may wish to take a look.

Of course, this is not the extent of their duties: monitoring and apprehending dark Wizards and magical creatures for either study or recruitment as well as keeping track of developments in the muggle world on behalf of the Ministry would also fall under their purview since all of those require long term deployments in areas where the use of magic would be ill advised indeed.

Once their initial test is passed after OWLs, they receive an offer from the Ministry to help check out a list of things at Hogwarts over the next two years. What's on the list is immaterial as long as they're difficult to access and perilous to keep a close eye on over any given period of time. Heavily guarded locations, ghost haunts, suspected creature lairs, secret passageways, hidden chambers, defence Professors...

It doesn't matter if they do a good job of it. It doesn't matter if they get even one item on the list. What matters is that they are willing to try and achieve the goals listed out for them and remain undetected whilst doing so. If they manage this until the NEWTs, they are recruited into Unspeakable Field Ops and placed under the mentorship of a senior UFO for a number of years.

That could be the purpose of the whole ordeal: to sight potential UFOs in the making.

Furthering the idea: Hermione never actually gave up her time Turner. She just said she did. In reality, she was briefed on the true purpose of the test by an Unspeakable who wanted someone close to Potter in case another Black Incident happened again. In exchange for her briefing and some supplementary study material, her list of things to do came early and HAD to be completed.

** I don't see how this prompt would work without making Hermione significantly less talented, ambitious, and curious. In canon, Hermione was the first and last student in Hogwarts history to ever have gotten a Time Turner. In this prompt, at least one person a year is given a Time Turner, and there are enough people who get through their OWLs with it that they can fill a whole government department.

****** Don't worry about it. It's just Rowling being Rowling.

Why? The evidence is as follows:

-It is stated that there simply isn't enought time to take all the electives without it, partially because some classes run in parallel, partially because it's that much work.

-percy Weasley and Barty Crouch Jr. somehow got 12 OWL's each anyway.

-another interview provides the following tidbit: you can't self-study to pass an OWL in subject you didn't take at school

​

Thus, J. K. Rowling provided two, contradictory statements. As such, I tend to dismiss anything that is not part of books 1-7 as an unfortunate side effect of hop appreciation.
