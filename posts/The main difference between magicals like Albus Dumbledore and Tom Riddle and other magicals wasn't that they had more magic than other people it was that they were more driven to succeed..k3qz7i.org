Dumbeldore started Hogwarts just after his Father was thrown in Azkaban for attacking the muggles that assaulted his sister and was probably very motivated to get out of the shadow of that incident.

What we see of Tom Riddle kind of speaks for it self. From before he even entered the magical world his magic was what he used to define himself.

Harry had a short lived burst of drive to learn the Patronus, which he learns in third year and is pretty much the most impressive piece of magic we ever see him do.

Are there any example you can think of to disprove the idea that their early drive was the thing that caused them to grow into two of the best magicals in the World?


** I dont think it's ever implied in canon that they have more magic, rather that they are some of the most powerful wizards of the time. So yeah it probably is because of how driven they were, I imagine any wizard dedicated enough to studying and learning all they about a given subject could rival both Dumbledore and Voldemort.

Bearing in mind that Dumbledore held the elder wand at the time so that may have had something to do with his ability to duel Voldemort at such an old age like in the Ministry of Magic.

** I mean, it definetly has it part in how they developed, both Albus and Tom from a young age wanted to either change or rule the world, both pushed magic at a young age, Riddle with his whole immortal plan, and Albus when he hung around the dude that got expelled from Durmstrang.

There is a cap though, because all pepole arent born with the same intelligence, some pepole are born more gifted than others, Tom and Albus were prodigies, added insane work ethic on top of that and studied magic for a long while after graduating.

James and Sirius walked through school with minimal effort, or as Remus said, magic came easy to them.

Now if certain pepole like Harry had the same amount of drive through his school years as he did when either learning the patronus or training for the triwizard tournament, and continued to study and dive deeper into the magical world, he most likely would of either gotten to their level or become better than them as he has access to Dumbledores own teaching aswell as the general progress of the magical world

*** Great points, but I can't help but giggle at the description of Grindelwald as "that dude that got expelled from Durmstrang." That'd be a sick burn to use against him in a fic, might bother him more than almost anything else you could call him.

*** Yeah ego/confidence/how sure they are of themselves does play a part of it.

I think the fact that Dumbledore and Tom were Driven from day one played a part in it.its a bit like rolling a snowball down a hill most people are content to let its grow at its own pace for the first few years or mabye forever, were as Dumbledore and Tom were actively growing there magical abilities from day one and never stopped.

** I think Magical "strength" as it were comes down to few aspects of ones personality:

- Strength of Will to succeed, to fight against odds, this mindless determination. This is one aspect Harry actually stands out in. He is very single minded if he wants to be. Both Patronus and managing to beat Voldie in battle of wills shows this.
- Natural talent. This is where Voldemort, Dumbledore but also Snape shine. I don't think they are born with larger "sacks" of magic as such. More like in real life some people have natural aptitude towards say chess, music, physics, philosophy or creative arts.
- Intellect. I'd separate this from natural talent. Sheer brain power and capacity to learn and connect the dots and have unique ideas & insights. I think this is where Dumbledore and Hermione shine. I know might sound strange, but while Voldemort is very clever, I think this is one aspect where he lags slightly behind.
- Study & practice. All three others feed into this, but they all are for nothing, if one is not willing to learn & practice the magical arts. I think from what we see in canon - Harry is very good at learning when he wants to. All great wizards are highly learned & practiced.

All in all I think it comes down to witch or wizards character. Their magical prowess is the sum of their character traits. Intelligent, driven wizard has chance to scale great heights. While naturally talented, but lazy (I think both Harry & Ron fit) don't really amount to much.

*** Yep I can agree with a lot of that, I think that you are either magical or you are not. Its about growing what you can do with magic, not growing the amount of magic you have like a Dbz,Naruto,ect character. There is no mana pool just knowledge/skill.(no magical exhaustion, just plain old mental exhaustion).

** While it is not explicitly stated, I feel it is strongly implied that not all wizards (or witches) are created equal. Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort would not have had the reputations they did if it was just practice and skill that separated them from the norm. Remember that even a decade and a half after his 'death' people were terrified to say the world Voldemort. It takes more than just drive and skill to manage that. On the flip side Neville is taunted as being nearly a squib, and Filch reads the Kwickspell pamphlet in hope that he could still cast some magic, despite not being deemed a wizard. This all points to a gradient of magical ability (which will change as you develop, e.g. Neville) rather than a binary magical or not.

I feel Dumbledore is a showcase to why it isn't just drive that matters. All of the characterisation shows him to be an academic at heart. He spends his entire life teaching at or running Hogwarts. One of his greatest achievements is his work as an alchemist. Yet he is still a match for two 'Dark Lords' who focus their energies on fighting and conflict. Yes he had the elder wand when fighting Voldemort (although we have no idea what that means), but he was fighting against it when held by Grindelwald. Even if you use that fact that Dumbledore taught DADA in FBawtFT, (which feels like retconning being Tom Riddle's Transfiguration teacher), you are suggesting that a self-defence teacher beat up a one-man-army special forces agent because he was dedicated, and that doesn't seem right. I think instead that Dumbledore has the raw power to compensate for the fact that combat magic isn't his passion.

Finally, for Harry's Patronus, even if you assume that most people's trouble with it is finding a good memory and how it is taught, given most of the DA managed it, I feel being able to scatter a hundred or more with one Patronus is not normal or Voldemort would not bother using them, and I refuse to believe that was because Harry had abnormally happy memories.

I think you're forgetting that magic is an academic activity. Understanding the mechanics of it will lead to a more powerful person. There is a reason /Harry Potter/ magic is taught in a school, and not through more mystical means like other magical worlds do. I don't think it's a coincidence that all the powerful people we see in canon are geniuses.

Harry's superpower is his emotions. He's not particularly great at magic. Also, he cast it under extenuating circumstances since he said he could cast it since he knew he already cast it. Ron levitated a troll's club (with an unmatched, somewhat damaged wand) while his classmates were levitating feathers, but no one says he's a magical powerhouse.

I feel the problem with this is that not all magic is the same. There is a reason why there are different classes which are graded separately. It is implied that Dumbledore's strength is in transfiguration/alchemy, not duelling. You can have all of the theoretical understanding of the spells that you want, and that may make them slightly more powerful, but a lot of combat will also be accuracy and timing and physical capability and general practice. There is a reason why being able to hold down a trigger doesn't make you a soldier. While we can't say Dumbledore doesn't practice this, I find it implausible that he is objectively better at fighting than the entire Auror department who do this as a day job. Think of it as the difference between the Grandmaster and Battle Mage archetypes.

#+end_quote

That is objectively untrue. Even with 'Moody's' sabotage, I think he was focussing more on the competitors, he still made it through the 3rd task which was designed for the top students 2-3 years above him. He also routinely matches top Death Eaters in duels (e.g. Dept. of Mysteries) despite them often fighting the Aurors and staying free. He is also the best in year at DADA, compared to Hermione, who should wipe the floor with him according to your logic.

When Dumbledore duelled Voldemort, he mostly used transfiguration and charms. Since he had published papers on both subjects as a student, he is probably extremely skilled at both.

At Dumbledore and Voldemort's level, stuff like that doesn't matter. In their duel, they were barely moving, and Dumbledore mostly just cast spells that didn't need any aiming. He did things like animating statues and surrounding Voldemort with water, not aiming jinxes at Voldemort.

There's a difference between thinking on your feet and magical ability. Harry is great at thinking clearly in stressful situations, while almost all go the other characters aren't nearly as good. He mainly cast the same spells over and over again and dodged quickly to win his duels. In the first task, he performed a fourth year spell the class had already learned, and in the second task, I'm pretty sure he didn't do any magic. The third task was the one he used the most magic, but even then he only used the Reductor Curse (which both Ginny and Luna knew as 4th years) and the Stunning Spell (which is taught at most by third year). I'm genuinely confused how any of that is a testament to his magical ability.

There is a difference between magicals at their level and magicals at Dumbledore's level. At their level, reflexes and ability to perform well under stress are the most important elements of dueling. No matter how better at magic Hermione is, if she's freaking out in the middle of her duel. When Hermione gets over her anxiety in DH, she is the one who ends almost all of their fights and even knocks out multiple Death Eaters at once.

This is my point. Dumbledore and Voldemort are wielding magic at a qualitatively different level to everyone else. Even the elite death eaters like Bellatrix and veteran Aurors like Kingsley are seen throwing curses at each other, so there must be a reason why they don't use Dumbledore's tactics, even with an entire career to perfect their style, suggesting that they are working under different magical rules. Remember Dumbledore is said to be the only one Voldemort feared, and only a month or two after his death Voldemort walked into the Ministry and the entire Auror department either surrendered or fled.

I feel this gulf in ability needs more to justify it than just "nobody else tried hard enough in school". Whether it is some sort of "magical core" or super wand or the bond with Fawkes or the blessing of Merlin or an instinctive understanding of his own magic doesn't matter, there is this extra something that puts him ahead of what anyone else can achieve.

That's like saying there needs to be an explanation for the difference in ability between a computer science supergenius who works tirelessly to understand more and a smart software engineer who has been working for a very long time.

Also, I think you're forgetting how small magical Britain is. There are around 13,500 wizards, so it's basically the size of a town. Having Dumbledore, who's supposedly the most powerful wizard in the world, and Voldemort, who is his equal, was unprecedented. It was a pure fluke that there are two supergeniuses in the same place.
