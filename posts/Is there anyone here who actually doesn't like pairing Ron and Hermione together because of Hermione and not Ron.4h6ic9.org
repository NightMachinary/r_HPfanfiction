I probably won't agree with you, but I'm in need of an opinion that's different from the same crap that I've heard a million times. It's always the bloody same "Ron was constantly abusive to Hermione and probably would give her a new scar every day, did I mention that I don't like Ron very much?"


** The problem is that a lot of the people who become passionate shippers have a lot more in common with Hermione than Ron - I'm going to make a mass generalization and say that HP shippers (and not just Hhr shippers) are more likely to be female, to read a lot, and to be academic rather than sporty. Therefore, they're more likely to identify with Hermione than Ron, and more likely to see her as being correct in any conflict, and a better person to hang around.

***** Oh, yes. Despite being female, and a bookworm, I see a lot of myself in Ron, 'cause I am laaaaazzzy, and in school was all about putting in the minimum effort required. "Doesn't work to her potential" was a frequent comment. But, that's the kind of characteristic that most of us are ashamed of, and aren't going to admire in a fictional character.

I'd take this a step further by saying this is the biggest reason on why the character gets bashed. It's a reminder of the writer who he is, rather than who he wants to be which is portrayed by either Harry or Hermione.

Even in fics where she logically SHOULDN'T be involved, like where Harry is raised by Voldemort, the author still shoehorns her in to be Harry's best friend.

Same deal I have with Hinata from Naruto, actually. Canon Hinata I'm fine with; I just hate how everyone tries to make her some god tier badass who has a soul mate in Naruto in fanfiction.

I couldn't even get through Harry Potter and The Girl Who Lived just because they mention that Ron killed Hermione and Harry's kids just because Hermione didn't love him. Like, jesus fuck. Don't go all Ron the Death Eater on me, y'know?

** I honestly can't see Ron as abusive in anyway to someone he cares about. Yeah He's going to say some insensitive stuff about the random teacher's pet when he thinks they won't hear but he wouldn't abuse his loved ones.

That being said I can't see Him and Hermione working in a romantic sense. I like them as friends, and while I can't think of a better pairing for either, I don't think they would work long term. I think that they would need space from each other on a fairly regular basis, as their personalities clash.

It isn't the fault of either, they just wouldn't work IMHO. Of course I have been wrong before

Harry is the one full of absolutely retarded ideas and I truly believe that. Just in CoS alone I can make two excellent examples.

1. Follow the spiders. Advice taken from a man with a penchant towards dangerous animals, believing them cute. /Cough pet dragon cough./

2. What does he do upon learning the creature is a Basilisk, a creature with incredibly potent venom and a gaze that petrifies at best? Recruits a fellow second year and a teacher he believes to be useless, effectively going on a suicide mission.

*** Yeah, in the romantic sense I feel like Hermione would expect and want more for and from Ron. Ron would be happy just being an auror, getting shit done, whereas Hermione, full of ambition and trying to prove that she does belong, would want to go all the way to the top, making enemies everywhere because she just doesn't have the people skills. Ron knows how to pick his battles, Hermione goes on crusades for the littlest things. Ron, growing up with a pushy mother, would not do well with a pushy girlfriend. I love both characters, but they just don't work.

*** Canon Hermione is more interesting than the common fanfiction variety, that is to say, Suemione.

Canon Hermione is brilliant, true, but she's a workaholic who is also brash, brittle, combative, quick to judge, assertive, authoritative, and unconcerned with her looks (which are never anything to write home about). She's contradictory as well -- although she believes in rules and rightness, she has a flair for lies and cunning and vindictive ruthlessness when it suits, for example, lying about the troll, tricking Umbridge, or giving Marietta Edgecombe zits to remember. She's an unapologetic know-it-all who wears her heart on her sleeve and is willing to become an emotional wreck. She's also afflicted with a bit of "I'm Not Like Those Other Girls" when it comes to her dismissal of who she considers "silly" like Lavender and Parvati.

Canon Hermione is flawed and interesting and fallible.

Suemione is whatever the writer wants her to be, which is very often someone sweet and shy and sultry (lol) all at once. She'll also put up with a massive amount of bullshit from the dude she's been paired with.

... I /may/ have read too many OOC fics.

** Ron and Hermione were severely underdeveloped in canon. Hermione especially. Ron is literally defined by his 'I want to be a special snowflake despite being from a big family', but Hermione is worse for development: her character is literally 'the clever one who has a bit of a temper later'.

We never even hear her parents names, or really see her interact with many people other than Harry, Draco, Ron, and McGonagall until Dumbledore's Army shenanigans.

Shipping them is hard, because we barely know them.

Ron is pretty much always in a huff with Harry narratively so Harry is on his own for plot things to ensue, so half the time we don't get to learn what he's like.

Shit, back in undergrad, me and a friend had a falling out that lasted about a year and a half, so a couple months is nothing. Oh, and not all apologies are "I'm oh so sorry for transgressing against you!" Harry knew exactly what Ron was fucking saying.

2. Neither Harry and Hermione were injured, and trying to recover from said injury. If you take injury, add trying to recover from said injury, lack of resources to properly aid in recovery from injury (in this case, a proper diet is pretty damn important for that) and a fucking piece of a soul belonging to the most evil wizard of all times, a flare of temper and an argument leading to walking out is a majorly fucking probable outcome. So yeah, him leaving in this case was minor. If it weren't for abso-fucking-lutely terrible luck, he would have been back within 5 minutes, top.

*** Harry and Hermione do not balance each other out... when Hermione nags and bosses him around (and let's face it, this is ingrained in her personality), Harry lies, ignores, avoids, deflects her, and his last resort is to blow up at her. This is due to Harry's anti-authoritarian streak which he developed during his time at the Dursleys.

This is partly why H/Hr would not work, and why Ginny is a far better fit for Harry (there are of course other reasons).

In canon, Hermione does not "match with him". It's perfectly fine if you want to pair Harry and Hermione in fanfiction, but don't project your favourite H/Hr fanfiction onto the canon.

Untrue. Ginny does not "change", it is just that Harry notices her much more in the later books (starting in the fifth). If anything, you see hints of her true personality in the earlier books, even when she was acting weirdly around him. It wasn't a change in personality, it was a change in perception.

*** While I don't agree with the heavy downvoting, it's a bit far to say Hermione /only/ works with Harry, even moreso to say Ron could only work with Luna, which is way out of left-field.

People aren't going to like it if you give forceful opinions without explaining why you think that way.

  I love how every time I post my opinions on this matter, I get downvoted terribly, yet no one ever takes the time to explain why. Do people just hate the idea of other matches, or the matches I mention, or....

You didn't even remotely answer the question topic.
