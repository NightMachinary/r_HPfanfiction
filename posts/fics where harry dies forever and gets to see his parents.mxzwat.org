I've been wanting a fic where harry dies and meets his parents finally in the afterlife, but all I can find is him meeting them but coming back to life and having to leave them again. I want a fic where he is dead forever and they get to be together forever please. I don't care if its an agnsty fic where he dies young or if he died of old age, please I just need something
