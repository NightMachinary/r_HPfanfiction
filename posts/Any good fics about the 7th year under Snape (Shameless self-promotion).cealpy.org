Hi [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]], I'm writing a fic of my own about Snape and I am about to venture into the 7th year. I don't want to write something that has been done to death and I am also looking for inspiration, so if I do end up using elements from other fics I promise to give credit where it is due. Also welcome are your own thoughts and theories about that year :)

I recommend the story entitles "Snape's dreams" or "Snape's memories", don't remember which one, but they are both part of an amazing series by an author who goes by paganaidd which everyone should read (it's triggering so considered yourselves warned).

And here is my story (work in progress, also deals with dark themes I guess): [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18874543/chapters/44800099]]

Thank you! Please dump your recommendations on me and let me know what you think!


** Linkffn(the changeling by annerb) is a Ginny fic where Snape helps the DA by teaching her occlumency and legillimency during detentions. This plot point is very versatile obviously, he could teach one of the DA members anything during detentions.

** You might enjoy mine linkffn(Not From Others)

I tried to think very carefully about how Snape wpuld have balanced his role as Headmaster. With requests like this I also usually also link Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince, which is an excellent fic but I don't agree with the authors interpretation of Snape there - he's too soft.

I do not recommend Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.

**** Hi, dug up this thread to let you know I read your story and it was great. The scene with Ginny and George especially.... The first time George said something wasn't funny was at Fred's death, it was so perfect! Was that intentional?

Also you really made me feel Tonks's love and courage and loss. Thank you.

May I ask you to reas mine? I don't think I am going to use your ideas for inspiration but I think I have pretty good ones cooking :)

** Linkffn(the darkness alters)

This is an ongoing fic post-war that had lots of discussion and flashbacks to the castle during that year. Also, freaking fantastic if you can appreciate the non linear style and multiple pov

*** I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm milking you for compliments (because I am), but by "freaking fantastic" are you referring to my fic or to the one you link to (which I will definitely read ASAP)?\\
If you're referring to mine - thanks, all of it is intentional :D Because I know the nature of trauma is such that someone time is warped and everything seems either disconnected or to be repeating itself, I wanted the story to feel this way to. Aaand I enjoy thinking of everybody's motivations and how everyone is the hero of their own story.\\
I'm really enjoying writing it :)
