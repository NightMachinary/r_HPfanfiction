More looking for the Good guys copying the idea of them and making a non-corrupt/good version of them, rather then Bad guys trying to do it and just creating a corrupt/evil/tainted Sauron style version all over again. Like Dumbledore making him self a ring with the powers of Narya&Nenya.(To me Phoenix Song seems to have similar effect to what Narya was said to do, so Dumbledore would have something to go off when it comes to making a ring with similar powers).
