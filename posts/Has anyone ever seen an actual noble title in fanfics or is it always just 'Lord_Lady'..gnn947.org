Real talk, here. Is there any story where a witch or a wizard still living in the 1990's has a concrete noble title like Earl, Duke or Baron or does everyone pull a J.R.R. Martin and name every wizarding noble as Lord and Lady? I mean, I understand why you wouldn't want to do that but I still think it's funny in some sort of strange way.


** I've seen a few, but the upper titles are generally from the muggle side. Justin Fitch-Fetchley seems to wind up being the heir to a noble title pretty frequently.

hpffa(The Harem War) Harry is a duke.

hpffn(Harry Potter and the Daft Morons) Justin Fitch-Fetchley is an earl iirc. His Grandpa is a duke, and part of the royal family.

*** Both of those fics are objectively awful.

That being said, Finch-Fletchley does end being the recipient of these nonmagical titles quite a bit.

Although, other than the political meetings dragging on, I rather enjoyed Daft Morons. Especially watching the new Headmaster's actions.

** There's a couple that do. Though most are fictitious peerages. In Reboot by Kallanit Hermione's last name is actually Graynge not granger and her father is the Earl of Wolsingham. (Dumbledore had her change to granger to "fit in").

linkffn(9552519)

In 30 Minutes that Changed Everything by Radaslab has the potters being the Earl of Godricston, and has Helga hufflepuff married to the Earl of Westmarch.

linkffn(5178251)

A Step to the Right by CatsAreCool(Rachel500) has pretty much all the founders being Earls, Barons, etc

linkao3(14949759)

In The Last Casualties by muggledad Sirius is the Earl of Richmond

linkffn(6780275)

Other stories I've seen sirius referred to as The Earl of Blackmoor.

In the story Harry Potter and the Daft Morons by Sinyk they have the family of Justin Finch-Fletchly being the Earls, Barons Dukes etc of Kendal (which is a real peerage - I believe created for folks close to the royal family).

** After searching for references for you, I find myself glad that most fanfic authors stick with earls and dukes, because searching for Baron nets far too many hits for the Bloody Baron.

In the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle series]], the Queen bestows/recognizes several magical-only titles in the proper format. One of the things I like about this particular one is that not everybody is an earl or duke; there's a range of ranks. The Blacks are the magical descendents of The Black Prince, Edward Duke of Cornwall; Sirius would be 67th in line to the throne except magicians are barred. Sirius is named Magical Duke of London County. Harry (now named Nizar through a binding adoption) is named Magical Earl of Old Castleview over Hogwarts and its associated villages. Salazar deSlizarse (you'll have to read it to find out how he's still alive), who already held a Castillian title, is named Magical Marquess of the Highlands, excluding Nizar's lands. Several students whose families once held Muggle titles (lost when the Statute of Secrecy went into effect because titles have to be acknowledged by the Crown) have them reinstated.

#+begin_quote
  The Queen's words are swift and precise, as if she does this every day: Adele Greenwood regains her family's title and becomes the Lady Adele, Magical Baroness of Greenwood in the Yorkshire Dales; Blaise Zabini becomes the Viscount of Magical Worcester, which held no title for magical nobility in the past; Draco Malfoy regains the Wiltshire title of Baron, becoming Lord Draco of Magical Wiltshire; Daphne Greengrass is named Vidame Daphne of Magical Northumberland, accompanied by a restoration of some of the family's original land that had been swept up by the creation of the national park. Astoria automatically earns the title of Lady Astoria as Daphne's younger sister, which causes Daphne's eyes to widen in surprise. The title of Remus Lupin's mother's line is granted back to him, naming him Baronet over Magical Powys in Wales.

  Sequel to The Price is Right. It's not all fun and games being a wealthy orphan. I mean, yeah, Harry didn't have to deal with the Dursleys any longer, and lots of pocket money was great, but if someone could hold his hand while a monster was apparently on the loose? That'd be even better.

  To keep Sirius from dying, Harry will do anything, even if she doesn't know she's doing it. NON-OoC Girl!Harry/SS, cannon thru GoF, with a dash of sarcasm, spring cleaning, and mature themes.

  What would have happened to Sirius and Harry if the crown was involved? No SLASH. A plot bunny slapped me awake at 2am and screamed "Write me!" Proofed by the incomparable Filodea! all chapters are proofed and ch.6 is up!

#+begin_quote
  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.
