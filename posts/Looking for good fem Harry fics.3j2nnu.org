  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** Unbecoming was weird. Good grief was Harry....Heather, sheltered. The whole thing with the bath, has she never heard of a bath house? Heather truly knows nothing of magical society, yet has the audacity to say how backward they are. (Sure in some ways they are). Then the bit of no war, I would have called her an idiot. I can't read it anymore, Heather isn't very likable. She hasn't study magic, yet she can cast runes like no one's business, it doesn't make sense.

*** So, the saga of Alexandra Potter's numerous incarnations is roughly this:

Version 1: The version in DLP WBA and Ao3.

Version 2: Minor phrasing editing. Hosted nowhere.

Version 3: Moderately significant edits for phrasing and content. This is the version on FF.Net. It's the best version of the fic that's complete.

Version 4: Significant rewrite to make the fic less AU, lighten the tone considerably, make the kids more likeable, and generally make it more like a proper story and less like a sandbox fic (especially with respect to magical theory stuff). In WBA, but abandoned after the Sorting.

Version 5: complete rewrite that massively changes the content to being almost a completely different story. Similar motivations to the version 4 rewrite but not taking half-measures. Currently planning stage only.

  To keep Sirius from dying, Harry will do anything, even if she doesn't know she's doing it. NON-OoC Girl!Harry/SS, cannon thru GoF, with a dash of sarcasm, spring cleaning, and mature themes.
