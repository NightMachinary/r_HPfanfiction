it has been YEARS since i actually read the HP books. sure I've read a metric ton of fanfictions since then and i pretty much have the major plot points memorized. is this just me or is anyone else like this? so i bout all the audiobooks and have been listening them over the past few days.


** Jepp. It's been years, but I still remember every little detailðŸ˜‚

** Yep, we just re-watched the movies and I had so many wait, what? moments because there's a lot of things where my brain doesn't differentiate between movie canon, book canon and fanon. Haven't re-read the books in ages though, I should do that.

** I don't think I've done a full read through since DH came out, actually. I still remember most of the plot, I think, but I'm working on an alternate canon and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to reread to see how it will all work out in my story.
