:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Someone recommended it on here a few days ago where Harry Ron and Hermione start the DA in like their first year instead, I lost my tab for it and I can't find it looking back through the posts on here so I think it's been deleted:( TIA:)


** There are a few fics where that happens, but for most it's not part of the primary description, such as linkffn(Harry Crow), It also happens in a fair few "back to the start" type fics too, and isn't even always mentioned in descriptions, so I would expect it not to be one of these.\\
What else can you remember about it?

linkffn(Anicus Protectio Fortis) comes to mind as one of the more well known ones with a first-year DA\\
linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) Has a similar group form in first year, that develops into the DA through the story

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I'm not sure which one you are referring to... Nightmares of Futures Past has the DA starting in second year, and is not available from FFN.

*** If this is the one requested, it can be read here:

[[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past/index/]]

FFN removed for a false copyright claim, and then refused to respond to the dispute, so I don't see it being put back up there.
