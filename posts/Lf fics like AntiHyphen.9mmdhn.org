** Finally a Slytherin Harry who isn't some mini-Voldemort or budding politician. He's vicious and cunning when provoked, but also likes to have fun, has amusing quirks (Hagrid-like affinity for dangerous creatures), and a bold ambition that's not necessarily evil (replacing Dumbledore as headmaster).

I wish this was completed

*** Me too. This is the kind of Slytherin Harry I really enjoy, especially because people don't automatically think he's evil (despite the fact he is, according to his sister).

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16
