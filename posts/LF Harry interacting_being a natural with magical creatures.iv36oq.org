Hi all.

As the title says, I'm looking for fics that have Harry interact with magical creatures. He could have a natural affinity for creatures ro he goes around just spending time with any (within reason) creature.

Hope you all can help.

Cheers.


** Well, this is somehow what you want but this is more of a comedic one, just for fun basically. If you're looking for something serious and completed, this ain't it.

The story is about the harry having a darker aura (due to the horcrux) that attracts nearly every dark magical creature. It also showcases his interactions with them, and it's all very adorable and funny.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

**** Cool. Well, recently I've been reading the 'Ever Upward' series by Stranglerfig. Harry ends up moving in with the basilisk and getting to know the magical creatures around Hogwarts.

Parsel is similar, but it has him mainly interacting with snakes throughout. Some of those snakes are magical - ashwinders and the like - but a majority aren't.

The Veela are particularly avian in this fic, so I think it works to be included - When a Veela Cries. The intro is really dark and extreme, but it's basically just to sever Harry from his old life so he can move on to the continent and is rarely referred to after he gets to the continent.

I haven't read most of the fics in this list and the actual posts seem to have been deleted, but if you click to open the deleted posts, the comments and bot-links are still there. It's all about Acromantula and spiders.

Same remarks, but this thread is about basilisks and snakes.

A few of these are good, but more 'fae' in nature.

Either Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay or Enter The Dragon (by Dunkelzahn on Questionable Questing) have Harry protecting the centaur herd. Can't for the life of me remember which one, though.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay]]

LINK - Apparently Questionable Questing is a possible violation of the reddit rules, so I don't think I can link directly. If you google 'Enter the Dragon by Dunkelzahn, Questionable Questing', it should come up. The story itself is completely smut-free, but it does contain some discussion of adolescent puberty.

Growing up Kneazle has Harry being and getting along well with cats and kneazles. There's a magical Big Cat at some point in the story too, I think, but it's been awhile so I may be getting it confused with something else.

Stand Against The Moon is a Harry/Voldemort fic where Harry is big into non-human beings and other magical creatures. It leans a bit more to the former than the latter, but the magical creatures do pop up in interesting ways.

** Trigger warning about Harry's abuse in this one, spoiler about it here: Basically because of his abuse, he kind of... reverts to an obedient, PTSD-like subservience to Lucious Malfoy. I'm fine with angst and dark fics, but this one was intense in a way I haven't read before and it really threw me off, but otherwise linkffn(8413047) literally has the exact premise you want.

Basic facts with little spoiling is that Dumbledore introduces him to his family mansion, and it's on land with a lot of creatures (magical and not) and because of his upbringing (and kinda in his family history), he's a "good master" who has an unnatural way with animals and creatures. Just to mention other tropes (in case these are make or break for you), he also apprentices to Madame Malkin and later Nicholas Flamel, and it isn't too hard to figure out, but because of the set up of the story, it feels somewhat of a lordship fic (young Harry finding out he's rich, has lots of land, etc.) but if I recall he isn't actually a lord (just feels that way). He also befriends Draco. It's also incomplete (author's profile says on hiatus, not sure how long it will be), and it does kind of end a small cliffhanger during an intense scene.
