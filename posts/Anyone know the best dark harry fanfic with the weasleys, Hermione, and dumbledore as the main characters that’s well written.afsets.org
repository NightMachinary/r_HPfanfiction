** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), seems to fit best:

- Dark Harry, as he really likes to use the killing curse
- Hermione, Ron, and Ginny are all main characters
- Dumbledore appears often enough
- Most popular and recommended fic on this sub
- It's super hilarious too

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
