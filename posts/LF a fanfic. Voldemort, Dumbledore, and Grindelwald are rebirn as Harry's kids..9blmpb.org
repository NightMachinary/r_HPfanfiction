#+begin_quote
  Tired of human stupidity, Death decides to teach those who sought to be Masters of Death a lesson. Thinly veiled as a favor, Death offers Tom Riddle a second chance, the opportunity to be born again and live a new life. Some things are just too good to be true, and Tom soon learns there's a catch. There always is. Rated T for swearing.

** Shit Albus is gonna have his work cut out for him. Who's be Voldemort and who'd be Grindelwald though?

I always wanted to see lily Luna as sort of the next great prodigy at Hogwarts. But then I always wanted Hermione to become Headmaster instead, so take that for what it's worth.

*** So, it's a 4 (edit: uhad mentioned it's 12) chapter fic that I read once, but can't find again. Voldemort is James Sirius, Dumbledore is Albus Severus, and Grindelwald is Lily Luna.
