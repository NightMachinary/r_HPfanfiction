I'm looking for wholesome amazingness here, real fluffy, maximum feel good, ultimate warm and fuzzy. The sort of thing (as the title says) that you could read with Bob Ross playing in the background. Normally I'd have a recommendation of my own to trade you, but my library is mostly filled with drama and plot fics. Any pairing is fine, I do prefer het Harry centric but others are welcome too.

** /Dinner With the Weasleys/ is a delightful fic. This is the fanfic equivalent of the dinners with grandparents after church on Sundays.

*** It's been a month now but I just realized I never thanked you for the recommendation. You were one of only two people that responded, so thank you.
