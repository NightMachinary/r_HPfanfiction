** Not my first language, so apologies in advance for the less-than-optimal grammar:

Diary, ring, locket, cup, diadem, snake, and the scar. That was supposed to be it, Tom Riddle had only ever made seven horcruxes, one of them accidental. Yet when his spell rebound against him, he did not die, he had simply turned into a wraith and fled yet again. Much as he had done in Godric's Hollow, and about a decade later when Quirrel perished.

The death eater force had been routed from Hogwarts, at a high cost. Yet there was no victorious mood in the air, Harry knew it was only a matter of time for the Death Eaters to rally around their Dark Lord once again. After all, he had already proven he was indeed immortal, they would not dally around for long in finding their master and restoring him.

/'What could I have missed?'/ Thought Harry, as he walked by himself on the Hogwarts grounds.

He then froze on his tracks as he heard the sound of unintelligible hissing. It took him a moment to realise this was parseltongue, the language which he had lost the ability to speak upon his return to life.

Harry continued after silencing his footsteps and draping the invisibility cloak around him, and was greeted by the sight of Ginny idly talking to a snake...

** I've read this before. It was AU and one of the main things was that horcruxes could ONLY be attached to living things. So there are only three, Harry, Nagini and the basilisk in the chamber. When Harry kills the snake in COS the horcrux reattached to Ginny.

I don't remember what it's called, it was one of the more popular soul bond fics.

** There was something resembling this in The Twisted Path, except it's Ginny absorbing Tom at the end of CoS.

#+begin_quote
  When Minerva McGonagall discovers that Harry Potter's relatives intend to keep him from attending Hogwarts, she takes matters into her own hands. But when Harry comes to Diagon Alley one day early, it sets events into motion that end with him and his friend, Hermione Granger, sorted into Slytherin. Now the two of them must somehow tame the House of the Snakes.
