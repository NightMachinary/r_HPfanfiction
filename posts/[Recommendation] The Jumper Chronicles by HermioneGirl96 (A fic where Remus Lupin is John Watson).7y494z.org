[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9665864/1/The-Jumper-Chronicles][The Jumper Chronicles]] by HermioneGirl96 is a crossover to the BBC show Sherlock. When I came across this fic, I jumped at the chance to read a fic where Remus lived in the Muggle world before he taught at Hogwarts because of his grief. What made me most excited was the fact Remus would eventually meet Sherlock as John. I just simply love the concept of this story. The first couple chapters are short, however, the story begins to build on its own as it progresses. It has been awhile since the fic last updated, but I say it is definitely worth the read anyways.

  This is a brilliant story out of two different worlds and made a completely wonderful combination. Basically made Remus (John) the bridge of both the wizarding world and the muggle world, with fantastic characterization and perspective too. I don't know when or if the author will update again, but I have to say that I practically adore their development of Remus's mindset, well, the story in general. This such marvelous story!

  After the first war, Remus realizes his chances of working in the wizarding world are slim, and his wand just reminds him of how James, Lily, and Peter died. To escape this world of pain, Remus attends med school, posing as a Muggle and going by his middle name: John. A story of the missing 12 years of Remus's life . . . in which he became John Watson. Guys, seriously, it all fits.

** This sounds intriguing, but I am unable to tell from your rec- does it ever actually get to the place where Remus meets Sherlock, or is it 100k words of buildup?
