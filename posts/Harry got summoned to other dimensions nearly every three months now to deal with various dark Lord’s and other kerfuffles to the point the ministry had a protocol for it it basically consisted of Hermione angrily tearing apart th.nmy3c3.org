This latest one had been Voldemort the zookeeper edition where he was trying to eradicate elephants from the face of the earth Harry had been in the African savanna beating the man with a tennis racket borrowed off one of the tourists that had been a bit befuddled at the young man with the lightning bolt score and the lovely taffeta picnic dress requesting the use of his sporting equipment to stop a poacher in broad daylight.

When Hermione appeared to collect her best friend they got pictures and Harry was successfully retrieved back to his proper universe Hermione wrote a report and then tour that dimensions Kingsley a new one Kingsley in this dimension had glasses and an overbite it was rather unsettling to consider that one, Hermione when she was done reading them in the riot act pulled her head out of the either that was the strange time portal screaming vortex she had summoned to make eye contact with her predecessor who was smiling slightly checking hairy for any possible space-time contamination and Hermione call me informed him he was the more handsome of the two Kingsley shackles shackles bolt the former or a aURAR Laughed and cast a spell of cleansing over the disgruntled Potter who was demanding a pair of trousers as taffeta picnic dresses were the traditional garb for combat in the other universe and Harry refused to be debriefed still wearing it Hermione summoned him a pair of jeans and an old band T-shirt and well Sheamus Finnegan came in to handle the paperwork


** Not exactly what you're asking, but you might be interested in reading the Lone Traveler series if you haven't already. It's originally by The Professional, but it was vastly extended by dunuelos (I'm linking just one by dunuelos, but they have a lot of them!)

  After spending half his life trying to rid the world of Voldemort, Harry Potter finally succeeds. However, the price has been high. Too high. Unfortunately, when Harry risks his life to go back and ‘do things right', something goes wrong...

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.
