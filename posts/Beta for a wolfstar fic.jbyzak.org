I'm in the process of writing a pretty lengthy wolfstar au. It's at 16k words rn and it's most likely gonna hit 50k. I'm feeling way more self conscious about the quality and the general content I'm writing recently and was wondering if anyone would want to read over what I've got, edit, give suggestions, and provide their general thoughts on what I've got.


** In case you're unaware and don't get a response here, there's a 'HPSlashFic' sub where you might be more likely to get some takers. Beta requests don't really seem to get much traction here, nor slash stuff.

[[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]

There's also the weekly beta-bartering thread on the Fanfiction sub too. I think it's on Thursdays, but the schedule is in their sidebar.
