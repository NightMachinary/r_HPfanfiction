Ok so do we write fanfic on sites and the put the link here? Or can we write the fanfic on here?


** Well occasionally people post stuff here but I think most people prefer if you link to your fic on another site like fanfic.net or a03.

Bear in mind that by posting here you are inviting critique.

** Reddit isn't a very good forum for writing anything other than snippets and oneshots. Some authors (not just fanfic) do write here, and create their own subs to post their stuff.

It's probably easier if you write in ffn or ao3 and link it here.

** The other writing subs share work by linking to (usually) google docs, so presumably you could do that on here if you had a mind to. But there doesn't seem much point in that when there's a much bigger potential audience on ffn or ao3.

** You can do both. Just, as has already been said, do keep in mind that reddit isn't really good for posting longer stuff as the formatting is fairly basic and there is a limit on how long every single post and comment can be. Obviously you could just make a subreddit for yourself and post your story in short chapters there, each as a new post (I do read one original story, called “Purity of the Mind”, that is published this way), but for anything that you know will be longer you probably don't want to do that unless you have masochistic tendencies.

And with the former, do remember to tag the posts with links to your stories with the [Promotion] flair and you should be fine.
