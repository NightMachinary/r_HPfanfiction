Hello! I'm new to the boards, so I hope I'm doing this correctly; many apologies if I'm not. I used to be heavily involved in the HP fandom years ago on Livejournal, and read and wrote a lot of fic, primarily Remus/Tonks, Harry/Ginny and a bit of adult!Hermione/Snape. I'm currently in major need of some comfort reading, and I'd love to read some well-written fics. I had a lot of favourites prior to about 2014, but I'm not familiar with any of the more recent classics. I wondered if anyone could give some recs. (For reference, I apply the same likes to fanfic as I do to my favourite romance fiction, namely happy endings, no infidelity, and at the moment, preferably nothing too dark. AU is fine, as well.) Thanks so much in advance!


** I'm not really a Remus/Tonks or Harry/Ginny reader, and very depressingly, I don't think I've read a truly excellent adult!Hermione/Snape fic since 2010/2011's Post Tenebras, Lux by Loten. linkffn(6578435) So I hope someone will chime in with some recs.

#+begin_quote
  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

** You could try my series, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1221728][The Elder Tales]], which is a post-Hogwarts drama story about Harry and Ginny's relationship as Harry is forced to take possession of the Elder Wand again. I'm just now publishing the final part, which is already completely written and edited!

** I'm new to these boards too and thus not great at links. But I've got some recs:

Not my favorite pair, but this was a Hermione/Snape I enjoyed. Adult Hermione, Time Travel. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17960324/chapters/42418760]]

There have been a few recent pretty good canon-compliant Remus/Tonks: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16345142/chapters/42070721]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14828709/chapters/34317807]]

But non canon-compliant if you haven't read it you might enjoy The Debt of Time. Well known, well written, very long time travel fic that has Hermione/Remus at one point but has Hermione/Sirius and Remus/Tonks as its endgame. I could see this being a great quarantine fic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929]]

For Harry/Ginny, Strangers at Drakeshaugh was started in 2010 but not finished till 2018! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh]]. Much of Northumbrian's stuff has good Harry/Ginny.
