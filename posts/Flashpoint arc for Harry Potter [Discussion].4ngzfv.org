Has anyone done a fic where Harry changes the timeline just like in the Flashpoint; saving his mother or both parents, returning back to the timeline only to find out that he has fucked up things badly and that he is the only one to remember the old timeline. He then resets the timeline, but there are still some changes just like in the new Flash Rebirth issues. I think its a great idea...one that I am willing to work on if there are no fics! :)


** [[/spoiler][There's this one fanfiction which is kind of like that, but it was next-gen. I believe it's called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. It was pretty bad.]]

*** Wait, so the Cursed Child is based on changing the timeline? Does this mean Rowling is going to write seven books AGAIN? :O Now I have to see or read Cursed Child.
