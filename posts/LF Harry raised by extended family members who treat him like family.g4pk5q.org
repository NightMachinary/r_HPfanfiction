I just want Harry to be loved!

Preferably: - Canon characters like Sirius, Regulus, Andromeda, Narcissa & Lucius (could be unnamed grandparents or even cousins too though) (I suppose maybe even a good Petunia would work too) - Growing up in magical world but could be in the Muggle world with the knowledge of magic - Light/Grey Harry, with family on the same side, the family doesn't have to follow Dumbledore but please reject Voldemort - Harry growing up in his own time

Any: - Romance/Pairing - Straight/slash - Or No Romance, doesn't matter

NOT: - Harem - Please no Dark!Harry - Romance with Voldemort - Cross-Generational Romance (ie Harry paired with someone of his parents generation) - None of that “they treat him like a house elf and abuse him stuff”

I don't mean you have to write it, I'm just looking for something with similar themes that's already out there. If you know of something that fits most points but not all, post anyway and I'll take a look!

Had the idea when reading linkff(No Longer Alone by VonPelt) so the way the first couple chapters of that goes is an idea of what I'm looking for.

Also, preferred on FanFiction.Net as that's easiest for me but other platforms welcomed as well.

Thanks in advance!!


** Like Brothers has Harry raised by the Malfoys and Sirius. I haven't read it in a while so my memories are a little blurry but I remember he was treated very well and the title comes from him and Draco being like brothers. I think Draco is even sorted into Gryffindor, such is the turnaround of their personalities affected by the different childhoods.

  Minerva McGonagall steps in on the awful night the Potters are murdered and arranges to have Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black and his somewhat cousins, the Malfoys. Draco and Harry grow up as almost brothers and everything - well, almost everything - is different. Gryffindor!Draco. Dramione. AU.

** linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) Complete Harry/Daphne

linkffn(Stepping Back) (This one is a Timetravle one and in this, he is paired up with Bellatrix, so I guess that is something in your "NOT" list, but I still recommended it because I really enjoyed reading it.)

linkffn(The Green in the Grey) It isn't complete, but recently got three new chapters.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

**** As far as I remember the Author refuses to bash anyone. If so, then it is so minor that it really doesn't stick to mind while reading.

If I remember correctly, Ron and Hermione are both minor characters in all three stories.
