So, I thought up this question earlier and poked around a bit using Reddit's /lovely/ search function and found nothing that was truly along these lines, so I figured I would drop a discussion thread down so that it can be found in the future. Anyways, enough of my waffling on about searching for stuff. To the question!

*What is your headcanon on how Potions work? Why are they so volatile (*really, Neville seems to melt/explode a cauldron every class*), how are they assembled, and why do they work the way they do?*

*+__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________+*

Now that the question is asked, I can wander further down this rabbit hole and explain my own headcanon, which is a strange mix of various things I have come across, from linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) 's symbolic system to ye olde cookbook's system o' in-gree-dee-ents to potions are a ritual, and rituals need to be executed veeeeeeeeery carefully.

+__________________________________________________________________________________________________________+

So, the first thing I will explain away is why potions seem to be so volatile. As mentioned above, I believe that potions have a ritualistic element to them under certain circumstances. When Potions Masters (PM, because I'm a lazy fuck and don't want to type that constantly) collect their own ingredients, those ingredients end up with a connection to the PM that permits them to use those ingredients in a potion with greater ease. The symbolic aspect of the ingredient becomes more important than the recipe for the potion, and changes can be made on the fly much easier.

With bought or pre-prepared ingredients, no such connection to the brewer is present. In such cases, the steps to brew the potion become a sort of ritual (redundancy! redundancy for everybody!) that reinforces the symbolic nature of the ingredients that was lost when they changed hands over a shop counter. With potions ingredients harvested by the PM him/herself, this ritual can still be followed and will in fact improve the properties of the potion, as the reinforcing of the symbolism of the ingredients aids in the effects of the potion.

Anyways, with that note made (and a long one it was) I will mention my headcanon on rituals to explain why a bad potion melts cauldrons and/or explodes violently and wrecks half the classroom. You see, rituals, in order to complete their purpose (and this is in fact true for most kinds of Witchcraft) end up amassing a really quite impressive amount of energy for even the simplest things (like a boil cure potion). An interrupted or incorrect ritual will therefore release all of that energy at once at the point where the error becomes something that cannot be corrected. Most rituals therefore, when interrupted or incorrect, have a tendency to release great amounts of energy extremely violently and with great application of heat and light, since heat and light are two excellent ways to release said energy.

Now then, Potions in particular have a specific connection to the brewer/PM which enables a talented PM using his/her own collected ingredients to skip/modify/change steps of the brewing ritual or just create their own steps instead. In fact, if they are sufficiently talented they may just do that anyways despite not using hand collected ingredients (as Snape did with that potion's book of his in HBP).

It should also be noted that the method of preparing the ingredients also influences the symbolism therein. Preparing an ingredient wrong, therefore, can just as easily blow up your cauldron as performing the steps out of order or using the wrong ingredient.

Of course, not all potions release their energy at once when they're screwed up. Some congeal into a lovely solid/precipitate that ends up stuck to a cauldron. These stuck-in messes have all of that energy stored up, but are often otherwise inert. Interact with one wrong (charge it with magic [le Vanishing spell], perhaps?) and /then/ it explodes like a bomb, thus Snape's deep love for forcing students to scrub cauldrons by hand for detentions. Disposal of this scrubbed-off explosive goo is offscreen and quite dangerous if done improperly. A properly executed potion (or one that is reasonably close and hasn't exploded) can most likely be Vanished without detonation (as Harry experiences in class several times).

+__________________________________________________________________________________________________________+

*TL;DR*

Potions are rituals, of a sort. With hand collected ingredients the steps can suffer and the potion still come out well enough. With bought ingredients you better bloody well follow those steps in your book, unless you're ungodly talented (i.e. Severus Snape). Rituals collect a lot of energy during execution and when interrupted or wrong often release that energy violently, thus a melt-y cauldron or some strange sticky goo. Should you end up with a sticky goo, do try not to use magic on it if you value your existence.

+__________________________________________________________________________________________________________+

*So then, throw me all your overly-complex headcanons and explanations for how potions work. I want them all. All of them, I say!*

Cheers all, Erebus out.


** I always assumed nevilles potions were volatile because he got too nervous to follow directions correctly. if potions is similar to real life chemistry, you can really fuck shit up if you mix stuff that you shouldn't be mixing. i mean even in middle school we had those shower things (though no one used them)

i assume potions work because chemistry and biology are a thing and then with magic you have extra powerful drugs pretty much that can do magical stuff like transfigure yourself. i believe a wit sharpening potion is mentioned in book 4 and that's kinda similar to say aderall or ritalin. and the pepperup potion could be similar to like 5 hour energy or something. A calming draught potion would be like xanax.

*** I have same view too. Potions are just like chemistry except with magical elements added to them. Neville doesn't do well because he is too nervous. Ron doesn't do well because he just tries to blindly follow the instructions without knowing the principles behind them. Hermione does well because...well she's Hermione.

Anyways, it's more of Snape's fault that he is a crappy teacher, even though he is genius at potions. I mean, /"Instructions are on the board, the ingredients are in cupboard, now brew the potion"/ isn't exactly what you call proper teaching.

That doesn't sound like a teaching of a potions master. That sounds like a teaching of an overworked, underpaid, mediocre teaching intern. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

If I were Snape, I would never let them touch any ingredients or brew potions until after three months, when they know sufficient theory and precautions

**** i agree. snape is a terrible teacher. it doesn't sound like he actually does any teaching ever. does he give lectures at all? I feel like i remember slughorn at least giving a few lectures to the newt class.

***** Not just Snape, even McGonagoll and Flitwick are barely adequate. They might be geniuses in their fields, but their way of teaching is so...bland and old fashioned. Wand movement, incantation and monotonous practice. And rote memorisation of them. Nothing so exceptional.

Hagrid would be an awesome teacher, if his sense of danger wasn't addled.

Lupin is clearly the best. Case closed. He might not be experienced as McGonagall or Flitwick, or Genius like Snape, but he actually knows how to teach! His way of teaching, way of conducting obstacle course as exam, they are so ingenious!

And ironically Barty Jr. was one of the best teachers.

** Potions are created from substances that have concepts imbued into them. Magical substances hold more "concept" than non-magical substances.

They are added together and a witch or wizards magic binds them into a finalized form. This is why a muggle cannot brew a potion.

This also means that not only do you need good form to make a potion, you need the correct mindset for your magic to bind it properly. Mechanical perfection can still produce a ruined potion if the brewers magic is binding it incorrectly.

Magic itself is about intent and visualization. Neville fails because he believes he will fail.

** I always liked the idea of potions being chemistry+magic. Just like with chemistry, you can really fuck up in certain concotions. But instead of elements and molecules that have very exact functions, we use toadsfoot and pinecones. Why do pinecones add a naturey component? Because magic. How exactly does putting some soot into this potion give it heat-resistant properties? Because magic.

Something that takes a real master to truly excell at. There isn't a single way to make a wart-removal potion: there are as many ways as you can figure them out. The only limit you have is that of your knowledge and imagination. Snape may teach one way to make a potion, but he could make a few completely unique ways to get the same result.

** So I love this quote; Cooking is an art and Baking a science. That like cooking fresher ingredients are better, depending when you add spice has a different effect depending on when you add them. Also weather you dice or slice also has an effect, things cooking faster or slower depending on its size. Some things cook faster than others like peppers compared to carrots and there flavours change depending on how you cook them, Take Potateos for example, you can fry them, roast them, steam them or boil them and they taste different each time.

So I think potions is like cooking except with magic, there is no foolish wand waving because the stirrer or spoon to stir the potion acts as a weak conduit infusing the potion slowly and consistently with magic. Different stirring techniques are necessary depending like in baking you can beat something in like eggs or fold im slowly to keep in air or whisk to combine and airinate ingredients. I think that the anti clockwise stirring is to reverse or slow down the process because we are working with magic so ingredients may be more of a catalyst than others therefore the need to slow down the reaction time. The baking part comes with the timing and exact ingredients. When making cake or cookies you can be lax with measurements but for meringue, mousse, cheese cake you must be more specific or your cake falls, your meringue is a mess and your cheese cake tastes weird. So I think you have to be very specific with potions, subtle with adding things, Neville is to nervous so he may add things to quickly not adding things gradually, where Harry and Ron lack precision. Hermione does well because she studys but also because she seems like someone who would be exact. Ingredients play a vital role aswell as magic. Fresher the better or depending when they are picked, like wolfsbane ingredients would be picked near a new moon because the werewolf is less active/weak that time of month instead of a full moon. Healing potions would have perhaps honey or ginger for their healing property's added at the end because magic is about intent so aswell as magical ingredients muggle ones can be used depending on their association or superstition surrounding them because magic is weird and doesnt always make sense. Cauldron's would also make a big difference, silver for sleep potions because silver is associated with the moon and night, pepper up in gold for daylight, but can be made in pewter. The difference would be like buying a microwave meal insted of going out to a restaurant or homecooked meal. Like it jist takes practice, a chef takes years to master their skill, and not in every area like a pastry chef of bakers ect. I think potions is like that as well a potioneer could be a specialist in healing potions, another in pastes, bodily enhancements, curing curses, defensive potions ect.

I didnt realise how much I thought about this untill I started writing so I hope this helps.

** I have the view (influenced by multiple stories) that potions are essentially stationary spell matrices created by the potion master and held in place by the ingredients. It would also explain why Neville was so bad at making them, as he was never that great at spell work in the beginning. Also, from HPMOR, the amount of power present in a potion directly corresponds to the amount of energy required to make the ingredients. That would explain why certain potions require inane ingredients, like the toenail of a 100 year old Crumpled Horned Snorkack.

** Since I read Shadow of Angmar that's how I think of potions. It just seems to go into more detail and make more sense in the magical world that Rowling's half baked mess.

** I like what Steelbadger did in /The Shadow of Angmar/, but I think I like HPMOR's view of potions better. Potions use the energy of the magical ingredients that go into the mix - which can make them very powerful and dangerous at the same time. Young students can't cast powerful spells yet because they still need to grow into their magic more, but they /can/ brew powerful potions if they're talented/smart enough to do so (ala Hermione and Polyjuice) because the magic comes from the ingredients.

Thus, when something goes wrong, it can go very wrong.

Potions are powerful and dangerous things.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
