Hiya there, I've been looking for this fanfic everywhere - if I'm not wrong I read it on either fanfiction.net or maybe even LJ either in 2007-2012. I hope all the scenes are from the same fanfic but I've been trying to google this with certain keywords forever.

- The fanfic starts out with Hermione on the roof of a hospital (muggle) contemplating about Harry's death (possibly her lover, also Post war) she's implied to be suicidal but she gets called back in if i'm not wrong because of someone who's been in a car accident (or an accident in general) and it turns out to be Draco Malfoy who's been injured
- Draco covers the same hospital bed he was in with rose petals (I think to ask her out)
- They eat ice cream together, if I'm not entirely wrong it could be strawberry ice cream (just thought this was valid)
- I think their is a snow cabin scene or a lake - Draco also might have something to do with Harry's death\\
- Draco helps her clean her house and ends up having a fever
