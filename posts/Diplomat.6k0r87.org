** The only fic I can think of that somewhat fits that idea is Magnificent by esama (linkao3(1113600)). It's a Sherlock/HP crossover that makes Harry Potter the Wizarding version of Mycroft who is the "British Government". It goes through how Harry became that, his relationship with Mycroft, what being the Minisrty of Magic entails, etc. It's written very well and is honestly one I've read revisited because of how good it is. It is a bit slash with Mycroft/Harry but it's still worth a try being a one-shot.
