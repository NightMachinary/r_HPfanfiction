I find it's really common on Avenger x Harry Potter crossovers. Harry either talks to Death when he's crossing worlds, or he'll call on Death like every other chapter/ scene and have a conversation. I don't know why, but it's grown to bug me when I see it in a story.


** I would enjoy it if death was some kind of incomprehensible alien consciousness (like in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel)]]), but I've never seen that before.

Or if death is like, a small girl. Very polite. No overly cheery stuff, just like "hi harry. youre my dad now. *grabs harry's hand*"

Or if he's Jeff Goldblum.

You seem to have missed my point. Harry's subconscious providing something that he's familiar with to represent Death isn't the weird part. The weird part is that it's Dumbledore.

Why not a Dementor, or Voldemort, or the Grim Reaper, or any number of other things?

  "Sorry sir." Harry interrupted the old headmaster, the manipulative bastard whom he couldn't help but love as a grandfather of sorts. "I need to derail a train."

  [...]

  A wind blew through the station, rattling windows heavily.

  "It appears as if you just missed them." Albus said, eyes still twinkling merrily.

  The wind hissed and twisted voicelessly at his words.

  "Oh yes, they were never very good with rules." Albus agreed with a fond expression.

  The windows rattled, and the building groaned underneath the weight of the wind.

  "Well, most governments work with some form of democracy nowadays." Albus pointed out.

  The wind retreated in a huff of disapproval.

  Albus smiled. "Perhaps so, but perhaps even such things are meant to change in time."

  A rattling sound traveled along the rails, causing both Albus and the wind to pause.

  "I do hope that train was insured." Albus mused.

  The wind pulled at the windows making the concrete groan as it tried to express its voiceless frustration at the chaos that the trio had already managed to cause in its orderly existence.

  Albus most carefully did /not/ laugh at the sound of it.

  The next great adventure, indeed.

Personally, I always saw the master of death thing as in de MoD not being in any more control over death as entity or power, but having power of his own death, falling outside the power of death. It fits the best. Though I don't mind an new connection with soul magics or some such.

** I really like this trope actually, but then again I haven't encountered fics where Death was as cringy as in some examples here xD

** Well Death is a cosmic entity in Marvel so its not like the idea is wacky. The use of Death as a character is usually shitty in most HP stories though. It's an execution thing, not the idea itself. I'm drafting an Avengers crossover where Harry meets death at the end of DH, but it turns out the whole MoD thing is more propaganda than fact. Death should be shown as mysterious, foreboding yet impartial, incomprehensible in some ways and yet be understood as necessary. That's the point of the Hallows story, anyway. It's what I'm trying to do.
