** I tried looking up crossovers with the old school Sabrina the Teenage Witch a while back but couldn't find any decent ones. They all seem to ship Harry with Salem for some inexplicable reason :s

** Harry/Sabrina is my new OTP.

Along with Harry/Molly (Dresden Files) and Harry/Sansa (GoT).

Best pairings are crossover pairings.

** It would be interesting to explore the differences between the two kinds of witches. At first glance potterverse magic users seem to be more immediately powerful, with their near effortless wide range of spells.

However, sabrina style witches have some advantages. They live much longer and they can bring people back from the dead. Mostly because of their pact with Satan I think. They might have all sorts of other powers we just don't see.

*** I actually do have a plot bunny for a Crossover...

It would take place after Voldemort's return in Goblet of Fire. Sabrina's Aunt Zelda discovers there is a magic-user over in England who has been using the title "The Dark Lord", which of course, is the nickname for the Devil, and she does not like it! So, she along with Sabrina, Hilda, and Ambrose go to England to get rid of this "Blasphemer"... Sabrina canon would be a bit different, however, because she would be Harry and Hermione's age.

Also when Zelda discovers the Prophecy "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.." she wonders if the Prophecy is actually about the Devil! Muahahahaha!

It would be a Harry/Hermione/Sabrina ship story...

** I struggle with the new show because it isn't clear what the time period is. And because of that I wouldn't know when the over lap would take place. The smartphone used by Harvey infuriates me.

*** It's set in 2014, the aesthetic is just vague and timeless, like Riverdale. Which means that unless there's timey wimey shenanigans, the timelines doesn't fit well.

** Sabrina kind of reminds me of Harry's worse traits: self-righteous and rash. And yet I still like both characters.

I'd be interested to see a story where Hilda and/or Zelda are related to Lily, maybe Lily is a halfblood in this story, and Harry grows up with them, Sabrina, and Amrbose.
