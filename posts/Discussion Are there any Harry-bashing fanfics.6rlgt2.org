Just curious. Practically every HP character has been bashed - even the least expected. So it stands to reason, that there should be a few Harry-bashing fanfics, at least.


** I think Harry is in fact probably the /most/ bashed character. He just isn't usually bashed in the same way as, say, Hermione or Ginny. Just about every indy!Harry fic, for example, is an indirect bash of Harry's rather passive behaviour in canon. Every grey!Harry fic is an indirect bash at his morality. Every smut!Harry fic is a bash of his utter lack of sex drive/willingness to act on it. Etc.

*** I totally agree. Canon Harry is being held in very low regard in the fanfic world. Almost all popular fics involve a Harry who is significantly more competent, intelligent, powerful, proactive, and ruthless.

JKR wanted to write a story in which a not so great (better than average though) main protagonist beat a Hitler with superpowers. But the hero apparently needed an insane amount of luck, on top of deux ex machina, author fiat, plot armor, and assigning idiot ball to the villain.

**** My favourite wtf moment in the Harry Potter canon as a story writer is when JKR weaves this complex set of circumstances for Harry to solve in Half Blood Prince, and Harry solves them all... by taking a freakin' luck potion. How hard JKR had to work to make Harry as unmanipulative as he is. No, no. Can't have our paragon hero taking initiative and actually having to be cunning. That would send all sorts of wrong messages. Better make it literal Magus Ex Machina.

****** Yeah, but one of those teens was Hermione.

Anyway, I got the impression it wasn't that it was so hard to break into, but that it was near impossible to get out. If it wasn't a war, and they actually cared about anonymity, and weren't so desperate, they'd never escape that way, they'd be caught. Because it was war, and they saved the world, I assume the Ministry just smoothed it over best they could. Normally, you'd be hunted immediately, posters everywhere.

I personally feel Quirrell's heist more unbelievable. He apparently wasn't possessed at the time, so it was all him, and he seems to have gotten away unrecognized. Granted, he was actually a pretty decent wizard, but he was still one person.

Hermione's a very intelligent person, yes. But Gringotts has been around for centuries with the best and the brightest (some I'd wager much brighter than Hermione) behind it. And it's not like they broke in with any new technology, they just turned 1 employee, stole a wand and hair, and used Imperio a bunch of times.

I got that too, but I feel like (1) that wasn't the intended feeling (i.e. JK wanted it to feel hard to break into, which it honestly wasn't) and (2) Imo that's a pretty bad design philosophy.

That's actually a really, really good point (kudos). I can think of ways around that (or situations where it'd fail), but I hadn't considered that possibility.

*** I agree to a point. I think the bigger issue is that canon!Harry is as much of a bland generic shell as possible for the audience to project themselves upon. As such there really isn't much to bash because Harry isn't really a character.

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rainhawke/HPATYOLS01.html][I got just the fic for you]]

Everyone is sane and normal except Dumbledore, who's gone senile, Harry, who's beyond stupid, and Voldemort, who's even stupider.

Highlights include Remus trying to convince Harry to turn over his cloak because no one (good guys or bad guys) trusts him with it.

#+begin_quote
  "Whatever." Harry went back to being a sulky little boy again, much to the relief of a certain very famous white-clad wizard who had been about to come out of retirement and thwap him one on the ear. "Anyway, Dumbledore gave it to me, and I don't see why I should give it to you."

  Lupin regarded Harry a long moment. Sirius watched him closely. He knew that expression. Remus was turning something diabolical over in his head. "The cloak doesn't actually belong to you," Lupin said at last. "It belongs to your father."

  "Yeah, so?" Harry kicked at the floor. "Dad's dead."

  "No." Lupin was more conversant with Muggle culture than most wizards and realized he should have donned a shiny black helmet and done some heavy breathing to make his next statement more appropriately dramatic. Still. . . "I am your father, Harry."

  Harry's mouth fell open. So did Sirius's -- at the sheer audacity of Lupin's scheme. Fortunately, Harry wasn't looking in his godfather's direction. A moment of silence passed. "Dad?" asked Harry weakly, at last. "But. . . that's not possible! Everyone says I look just like you an' I don't!"

  Lupin stifled a sigh. Harry was even stupider than he'd suspected. "The real Remus Lupin and I used a Switching Spell sixteen years ago, back when we knew Voldemort planned to attack us. So I am your father James in Lupin's body."

  "Oh," said Harry.
#+end_quote

...<snip>...

#+begin_quote
  "But. . . why didn't you save Mummy the day Voldemort came to kill me?"

  "It was a full moon that night," said Lupin sadly, "and unfortunately, since I was in a werewolf's body, I changed shape. And of course poor Remus was too clumsy a wizard to fend Voldemort off -- "

  Sirius hastily turned his laugh into a sneeze. But Harry nodded wisely. It only stood to reason that his father would be a much better wizard than some dumb werewolf.

** Bashing fics tend to be bad and I don't generally keep track of them. Several Hernione/Draco fics have this as a staple.

That said, there's no shortage of fics where Harry is not a particularly sympathetic figure. [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council]] portrays him as a slacker who wastes his natural gifts. linkffn(The Golden Age by Arnisoe de Blassenvile) humanizes him in a less than heroic way. linkffn(betrayal by butalearner) turns him into a ruthless killer.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville]] levels a bit of bash at all three of the trio. It's a great post-DH epilogue-compliant bash fic that criticizes a lot of elements of the trio's characterizations and aspects of the magical world, taking just about the most pessimistic assumption of everything JKR left open in canon.

It reminded me a bit of the Discworld book 'Witches Abroad' - the power of stories playing out regardless of who is crushed under the wheel of narrative. Harry's story, his perhaps unconscious desire to live out the life his parents began, crushed a lot of others.
