:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember all the details, but here is what I do remember:

- Harry travels to an alternative dimension where he died. I don't remember from what, but I think he got hit by car when he was... I want to say seven? Might have been ten. Either that or he died from child abuse. All I'm sure of is that he is dead.
- I'm also pretty sure that the general public wasn't stoked about the boy-who-lived dying thanks to muggles, so the anti-muggle/muggleborn sentiment was worse in this world than canon.
- In order to get Sirius out of Azkaban, Harry poses as his long lost son (I don't remember who the mother was except she was a pureblood), goes on a mini-quest and catches Peter Pettigrew.
- Sirius gets out of Azkaban, and I think that he blood adopts Harry.
- During their first year, I'm pretty sure that he gets a very well spoken racist as their professor. The guy really hates muggles and muggleborns.
- Harry (who I think is called Orion in the story) makes friends with Hermione, who isn't about to stand for the professors racist tirades. Harry/Orion doesn't want to rock the boat and that causes a good deal of strain on their relationship.
- I remember they had a paper due for DADA where they had to look for instances where magical children were hurt by muggles. Hermione wasn't happy about it.
- Harry/Orion is something called an appraiser. I don't remember what that does.

Any help is appreciated.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
