I might be confusing more than one story, but I recall Harry being found in the middle of the street by the Black patriarch (Orion maybe?) and raised alongside Sirius and Regulus. Sirius didn't trust him at first but after the potion to fix Harry's vision the brothers became closer. Harry was temporarily blinded by the potion and relied on others to lead him around for a week I think. Harry and Sirius went to Hogwarts at the same time and at the feast they somehow overpowered an aguamenti spell so it flooded the great hall causing mayhem and hilarity. It ended with them clinging to the floating tables as they careened out of the great hall. Harry made some comment about Black brothers or Black twins.

Thank you for any help with finding this. I've been searching for some time but I figured I might ask here before throwing in the towel.
