Absolutely noone:

My brain at 3am: George is the only Weasley child that usually goes by their full name.

First of... why brain. Second of... why JK?

I mean sure. He goes by Gred/Forge but not really. Georgie is technically a possible nickname but noone uses it. I know George doesn't really have a short version (Geo?). Everyone gets one but him. Poor thing.

Please note: this is a rambling musing not an actual critique.


** You forgot Percy.

Also, Fred's name, as far as canon ever tells us, is just Fred, not short for Frederick. Similarly for Charlie.

**** His name isn't Percival. Nowhere in canon is it ever given as Percival, including when his full name, 'Percy Ignatius Weasley, is used. He is the one Weasley sibling we can be fairly certain doesn't have a longer name.

***** Fair enough, probably got muddled with all the FF's I've read. You'd imagine with a middle name like Ignatius it would be Percival.. Lol seems like his first name degrades the rest of him. Hahah

*** I mean Harry doesn't /go by/ Harriekins, they just called him that once or twice, right? Usually people just call him George, contrasting to how William gets called Bill.
