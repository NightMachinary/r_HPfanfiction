Any fic where Riddle is on Harrys side and Dumbledore is main villain. Preferably with their positions swapped too as in Dumbledore is the dark lord Tom Riddle Jr is the headmaster of Hogwarts. But while still retaining their personality. Riddle's not acting like Dumbledore and vice versa.

but could also be without that swap maybe its like a light vs dark sorta thing and Dumbledore still headmaster voldy/riddle still dark lord

Just no hating muggles and muggle borns actually a good thing as a plot point.

No major character/OC ships No major character/self insert No character of harrys gen / Anyone of the Marauders gen or older even if there is time travel

preferably No Draco/Hermione

No genderbender ( trans characters are fine i dont consider genderbenders trope to overlap with that)

Apart from this any other ship is fine slash, fem slash, whatever.

Though no ships are also fine and I actually prefer friendship focused and/or plot focused.

preferably long and complete and if not complete just long and isn't on a cliff hanger is fine too


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12177140/1/Phoenix-Corrupted]]. The only one with a villain Dumbledore that's halfway coherent. I would actually recommend this fic, though it drops off noticeably near the end.

#+begin_quote
  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.
