As most of us know, one of the biggest criticisms Indie!Harry has for the "Order of the Burnt Chicken," or whatever other clever epithet the author has though up, is that Dumbledore and the Order don't kill Death Eaters.

Setting aside the fact that once Voldemort is revealed, the Order is willing to kill and disapproves of Harry's use of nonlethal spells (see Seven Potters chapter of Deathly Hallows), the question I have is on the morality of lethal spells in a world where the imperius curse exists.

Pius Thicknese and Stan Shunpike were both known imperiused individuals that fought in battles against the Order. After the fall of Voldemort "hundreds of people up and down the country" were freed from the imperius curse. One of the reasons the first war was so bad is that you literally couldn't trust anyone, even people whose morals and motives you were sure of, as they could be placed under the imperius at any moment.

Canon loses a bit of this by only showing the effect it can have on people with Harry not cursing Stan with anything that would have killed him. Which is immediately overshadowed by the appearance of Voldemort, Hedwig's death, etc.

With the opposition known to be using the imperius curse to bolster their ranks, is it moral to use lethal curses in self defense? Are the deaths of any poor souls caught in this position acceptable and unavoidable losses?


** If you have no safe alternative, using lethal force against an imperiused enemy would be justified. But with magic, there are a lot more safe and effective alternatives to lethal force than there are in the real world. If you're fighting an imperiused wizard that's blocking stunners and other non-lethal spells, sure, switch to lethal spells, but you should try non-lethal force first.

** If there is no safe alternative, than self defense would be ethical. However, as a small aside, another aspect people always fail to consider is stopping power. People always love to laugh at stunners because of its non-lethality and its countercharm. However, I think stunners are actually one of the better spells in one's repertoire. Take diffindo or sectumsempra. Authors will have their characters use cutting spells instead of stunners. Let's examine the combat capabilities of each spell.

Stunners instantly put down their target. Full stop. They can be added together to become more lethal. One you are hit, you're out of the battle. You're vulnerable to a follow-up spell. It can also be used to halt objects.

Sectumsempra and diffindo are variable. People can easily survive stab and slash wounds and remain conscious from them. Stopping power is lacking compared to the stunning spell though a lucky hit may render a target incapable of fighting.

People can be revived from stunning spells. It's interesting to note that it still takes a while for them to be combat capable once more. However, once stunned, one cannot wake themselves up, leaving one vulnerable to coup de grace). People can be healed from cutting charms with episkey and the counter to sectumsempra. /Because of its lack of stopping power, one can heal oneself of their cut/.

Both spells can be shielded against, blocked, and repelled.

In conclusion, a stunner is better for actually rendering an opponent non-combative. One of the better examples is George Weasley. A sectumsempra that takes off an ear would have killed him had it been a stunner (the fall). Draco Malfoy remains conscious and moving (combat-capable) after being hit with a sectumsempra.

This type of thinking applies to the spells used elsewhere in fics. Blood-boilers, bone breakers, ice spears, etc all lack the stopping power and effectiveness of stunners. The order didn't shy away from killing but neither did they shy away from using more effective curses. The only spells I consider more combat-effective in canon are the killing curse (though this has the drawback of a hefty power requirement - Harry likely can't use it for a majority of his school years) and Dolohov's unnamed curse. And most authors don't even use Dolohov's spell.

I always considered the Killing Curse as the less usefull Unforgivable Spell. Sure it's a sure kill shot, but it's a spell that's can't be used non verbally (as other Unforgivables I think?) with a long formula. I find it hard to use during a fight :

- In a duel situation, your opponent has the time to see the spell coming and can act in consequence (summon a physical shield to block it, go behind a protection or just spam spells the time you finish to prononce the long ass formula). Sure sometimes it work, but I'm pretty sure other spells would also have reached your opponent and finished the duel a little faster.
- In a battle situation, it's a little more usefull because your opponent can't only focus on your, but also your allies. So the spell has more chance to touch an unsuspecting target but there is the risk of friendly fire added to the mix.

The Killing Curse seem to be the most usefull as an execution spell (the enemy is already neutralized and you finish him) and as a symbol to terrify the masses.\\
In comparaison, the Cruciatus Curse seem to be more usefull all around :

- Shorter formula, so faster to use for similar effect (the guy that just felt the worst imaginable pain is on the ground for at least several second, you can use any spell you want to finish him)
- His "failed form" is more effectives than the Killing Curse's (fail a Killing Curse and you can't even "make someone's nose bleed" (according to Barty Jr as Moody) while Harry failed Cruciatus still put Bellatrix on the floor.
- Torturing people to get intels

As for the Imperius, just the best spell either. You fight a 1V3 duel? A little "/Imperio/" and bam it's a 2V2.\\
Don't want to do your homeworks? "/Imperio/" and your "friend" will do it for you.\\
Nice girl won't give your any intention? "/Imperio/" and . . . yeah this is the most dangerous spell of all.

**** Killing curse - Where the hell do you get the killing curse can't be silently cast from? Fanfics? Besides literally no mention of a restriction on silent casting, we see Voldemort cast a killing curse silently in OoTP. Yes, your opponent can see a spell coming. That said, it's the most effective spell in combat. No magical methods of protection can stop it. This means no magical shield or protective enchantment (such as that on clothing) can save you. Yeah, your opponent can conjure (difficult magic by the way and not taught to most people with the exception of bird and snake conjurations) but that stops the spells besides killing curses as well.

By the way, Moody said "I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed". Along with the rest of the passage, the implication isn't that a weak, ineffective spell would be cast like Harry's weak cruciatus but rather that /no/ spell would be cast.

Cruciatus - Not only do you have to muster up a particular emotion to cast it, you have to actively focus on it to maintain the spell and keep your wand pointed at the target. This leaves you vulnerable to, oh say, a killing curse to the chest. It's also interesting that Harry is combat capable immediately after /Voldemort/'s cruciatus curse ends. He feels aches and pain but can dodge curses cast by Voldemort. You can block a cruciatus as well, something impossible with a killing curse. Frankly, I would be unsurprised if an occlumens could remain combat-capable under a cruciatus, especially a weakened one.

Imperius - some people can fight it. Bit of a risk but I'll concede it's a viable combat option. I wouldn't use it myself as a primary as I'd prefer a spell with perfect stopping power and a success rate far beyond the imperius (such as the killing curse). I also find it interesting that your creativity with the spell doesn't extend past rape. I would suspect, given the cruciatus and the unique status of the killing curse, that the imperius can be blocked as well.

Edit: Another point about the imperius. You commit to a spell where resistance builds up over time. When the imperius ends, victims regain their memories. So imperiusing a classmate to do homework means that you've committed. There's no going back. Eventually, their resistance is going to build and you're going to lose control.

**** The killing curse is by far the most effective. Crucio has no use, there's much more effective ways to get information than torture.\\
But the killing curse is instant and unlockable death, the perfect spell to end a fight.

** Self defence is self defence a person has every right to attempt to keep themselves safe and alive when they are attacked doesn't matter if the attacker is coerced Unless your are a cop or in a position of power where it's your job to keep people safe then killing them is fine Especially when you are a civilian in a war and the order the trio were civilians they may have been targets but they were not trained aurors or hit wizards or even members of the ministry

*** What then about cases where it isn't self defense? I've read a couple fics in just the last few days where traps were made using either the vanishing cabinet or the taboo that killed them instantly.

The justification in these cases has generally been that they were "just death eaters" and ignored the possibility of imperious victims

**** In the end, the people being controlled are an imminent threat. It's like if someone is forced to swallow a bomb unwillingly; they don't want to be hostile, but they are absolutely threatening the lives of others.

Not a great example, but all i could come up.

** Harry's outlook on use of non-lethal spells is commendable, but it's an unrealistic mentality to have in a war. Like you said, there were so many cases of people being freed of the imperius curse after the war, because death eaters used them as an expendable army. The imperius isn't easy to break, and victims become cognisant over a long period of time - if the OTP members were unwilling to fight against an imperius victim lethally, death eaters would exploit that fact and weaponise it even further. Someone under the imperius is no longer themselves, they're an extension of the enemy and need to be treated as such or you're risking your life. Morality in war-time is blurred; it's kill or be killed.

** My take on it is this: Ask yourself, "Would I rather die than be used to commit horrible acts against innocent people?". Sure, capturing is generally better than killing even without mind control or other coercion in the mix, but when you can't hold the prisoners you take and most capture-oriented spells can be easily undone by the target's allies, the only truly viable option is aiming to maim or kill.
