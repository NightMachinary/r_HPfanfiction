I really enjoyed them. They were very inventive and creative. I think the first book was better than the second book, though. Heartlands felt vaguer than Wastelands.


** Wastelands of Time was /amazing./ Not just one of the best Harry Potter fanfictions, but one of the most striking /stories/ I've ever read. Joe Ducie has a way with sculpting the English language into the manliest thing possible. However, Heartlands of Time was a meandering disappointment, with a few very interesting worldbuilding threads that went nowhere, further dragged down by Voldemort and Harry's peer-age-group of Hermione, Ron, etc, etc, all being two-dimensional caricatures. By merit of having more screen time, this was far more apparent in book 2 than in book 1.

Anyway, I also tried buying Joe's first published book, but I thought it was disappointing compared to Wastelands; just a /lower quality/ rehash of the same general ideas. Has anyone had a better experience with his published books past book 1?

*** *Just to be clear, I'm on friendly terms with the author, so take that into context with what I'm about to say.*

I loved Wastelands and Heartlands, I wasn't so much a fan of The Reminiscent Exile series, because I too felt they were re-treading the same old ground. On the other hand, his other series, beginning with The Rig is actually a genuinely excellent couple of YA books. They're traditionally published and have all of the refinement that would usually come with that. If you can appreciate YA at all, I'd highly recommend reading them.

*** In a way, that first published book of mine was me proving to myself I could make the leap from fanfic.

Perhaps an argument could be made it wasn't ready, or maybe that folk who don't know my fanfic background enjoy the ideas fresh. It averages fair reviews.

Thanks for your kind words!

**** I'll be honest in saying I didn't finish book 1 of the Exile series. For Harry Potter of Wastelands, being a whiskey-drinking, suit-wearing, gun-and-wand-toting badass worked because he was a critically depressed, thousand-year-old deathless immortal. Exile's main character - nah, just, nah. He wasn't grand enough to fill those boots. That being said, because you're such an imaginative author, I do owe it to that book to try again. But from this thread, it also sounds like your Rig series treads some new and more original ground. I'll check that out soon.

'Fair reviews' inherently means it was flawed. The very way that you wrote Wastelands and Exile, the way that you craft ideas and words, means that you were at the edge of actual greatness. 'Fairly good' fantasy is something like the Ryria Chronicles; respectable, but nothing to write home about in terms of ideas or language or worldbuilding. You have the potential for something far greater. But I distinctly felt like I wasn't getting that in Exile.

** Same as the other two have said, Wastelands is the gold standard for some amazing world building and story telling, this kind of continued in Heartlands but the last 1/4 of the story felt very rushed and predictable. Don't let that stop you reading it though, it's still better than the vast majority of fics that try to accomplish the same thing.

*** I'd be the first to admit that Heartlands dwindled. I lost the thread years ago when I got caught up in original fiction.

Even re-reading Wastelands and Heartlands whole I couldn't find the thread again. I figured an ending, however rushed or predictable, was more important to folk who had been reading these stories for a decade than leaving it unfinished. :)

** I couldn't get through Wastelands of Time. The battle scenes and demons were way too anime for me. I think I didn't get into the Denarian trilogy for similar reasons.

It reminds me of certain type of Fantasy novels that was popular a long time ago, with a young, strong protagonist, who has to discover a secret power and save the world. Modern fiction like this usually just adds a bit of grit and edgyness instead of the idealism (we live in times when the lines between good and bad aren't as clear anymore, particularly on the geopolitical stage), but it's basically the same kind of teenage power-wank wish-fulfillment.

I always feel people who write that way are missing the point how JKR subverted that trope in how she wrote Harry. But to be fair, I'm rarely interested in HP fics that verge into a different genre.

It's interesting to me that you associate /Wastelands/ with teenage power-fantasy. Joe's Harry reminded me a lot more of John Constantine in the /Hellblazer/ comics series: old, jaded, and with recklessness bordering on a death wish. The bleak hopelessness of Harry's quest is also reminiscent of Roland's journey in the /Dark Tower/ series (with a possible hat-tip in chapter 25/26).

***** I wouldn't describe Harry, Roland, or John Constantine as "slightly grumpy and or pissed off about the state of things." I'm also not making any claims about how "deep" any characters might be. That's an entirely subjective and ultimately meaningless term.

My point is that the version of Harry in /Wastelands/ is something like a thousand years old, and Joe wrote him as an /adult/ character who has gone around the bend of crazy and come back out the other side. That's why I consider /Wastelands/ part of a different genre of fantasy, separate from the "teenage power-wank" genre that you described.

** Wastelands is very good, but it has the issue that it goes way over the top in its effort to be epic, often going far enough to the point of it becoming a chore. It also simultaneously has one of my favorite scenes in any fanfic (the wizarding Rome scene with Dumbledore) and one of my least favorites (the bone construct part). Of course, there's also the issue where Joe doesn't really know how to write a Harry that feels anything remotely like his canon counterpart. He just writes the same character in all of his stories, and that's one that is mostly just a projection of himself mixed with James Bond.

** I worked my way through Wastelands largely because of the recommendations on this site. And I have to say I wish I hadn't bothered. I consider it to be /the/ most overrated story in the entire fandom.

The writing was, I can't deny, very good. It was the meandering plot that got me. Things didn't seem to happen according to any particular plan - it was like the author had an idea and pulled the story in a totally different direction.

The other problem is that the characters were way too OOC. I see [[/u/Hellstrike]] has already made this point. Combine that with the plot problems and there was nothing that felt familiar to me. I made it through to the end but there's no way I'm going to read the sequel.

** I find Wastelands just impossible to get into. People adore it. I just get bogged down in the first chapter and then the sections in italics, and then the arrival, and then dislike the older version of Harry that is the MC. The sentences seem overwritten to me, so I get thrown out of the story again and again. It's too much like hard work staying in and I've never managed to read a story people really seem to love.

*** While I agree the Hero trilogy does have that exact deux ex machina type of ending, the first 99% of it is fantastic. I can forgive the ending just because of how fantastical and crazy the story gets by the end; the simplest of conclusions honestly was the only way such a long and convoluted (but amazing) tale could end.
