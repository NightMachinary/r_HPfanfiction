The grumpy badass is quite common in movies (just think Walt Kowalski from Gran Torino), but I don't remember any fanfics where there was one who helped Harry out. /Old Soldiers never die/ and some Moody characterisations went somewhat into that direction, but the badass was never the main focus there.


** It's been a long time since I read it, but I /think/ that Arcturus Black in /Honor Thy Blood/ might fit the bill. I'm not one for Harry/Daphne, which this story has and which annoyed me, but I recall thinking this one was okay. linkffn(12155794)

Edit: (Warning) There was also wizarding nobility/politics stuff in this one as well, but it was handled better, I thought, than many other such stories.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** Moody yes, Snape no since any kind of positive interaction with Harry is simply OOC for him. And I prefer my protagonist not to have unhealthy obsessions with dead women.

** I just thought of a Taken-style story with early twenties Harry going on a rampage to get Teddy back after he was kidnapped. I could totally see canon Harry going that way too, especially if he's now had auror training.

*** I know nothing about Buffy, and the story is a little trope-y, but the first four chapters were a blast.

Thanks for the rec.

That's... wow man. I envy you because you get to experience it all for the first time. JUST DO IT!

Buffy and the spinoff Angel are both sooo good.

***** What exactly is Buffy? A TV series? A books series? Are there elements which are controversial canon (like the HP movies around here)

****** It's aTV series about Vampires and Werewolves with a kickass female protagonist destined to fight them, directed by Joss Whedon ( Avengers, Firefly, Cabin in the Woods).

The first season shows its age a little bit, but it's definitely in my top 5 TV shows of all time.

Not sure. I have no idea about the state of the fandom, but I think there's the usual shipping wars.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.
