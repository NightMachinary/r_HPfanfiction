** Random changes without precedence or build-up. Foreshadowing is a thing, and it can be done subtly if you're worried about spoiling your big twists too early.

It gets particularly more irritating when that change comes off like author bigotry or soapboxing. I still remember the standard indy!Harry fic that suddenly had him turn around and start talking to Hermione about how homosexuality causes squibs. And we've all read those fics where authors suddenly become alt-right radicals and very much Want To Show It. It's just tiresome. We want to read stories, not political treatises.

**** Yeah. That's my cliff notes of the entire rambling pile of nonsense. The full thing had such 'gems' as "homosexual acts remove the magic from people, Hermione" and the rest of the usual "Small Town Baptist Preacher" sentiments with 'loss of magic' in place of 'the fires of hell and damnation'.

I read the whole thing, stopped, stared into the middle distance for a few moments, shuddered, then closed the page and deleted the bookmark and forgot as much as I could about the story.

**** Indeed. Couldn't agree more. I wouldn't mind even the most bigoted nonsense being dealt with through stories if they actually, y'know, dealt with it /through the story/. There's still no way I'm ever going to agree with them, but it's fascinating all the same to try and understand their lives and how they think. Plus to cover the issue itself. All the big issues of 'politics' and social challenges make for such interesting conflicts to look at - most of my favourite Star Trek episodes put a lens up to one kind of an issue or another.

But they all deal with it through the story - like you said, trying to make us reflect on things, rather than telling us directly how to think. A random pause in the story for the character to look Office-style into the camera and spout off views like the Basil Exposition of Bigotry is just such a dull way to approach it in comparison.

The one time in a fic where I genuinely enjoyed reading A/Ns, they were present in every chapter. Usually the fic sometimes subtly referenced real life history (with everything from mundane things like a certain major weather storm, to musical concerts, to major historical events), with A/Ns expanding on it a bit.

**** Sure, but even if it is perfectly understandable and makes sense to the person doing it (as most actions we take do), it's still irritating. I'm not saying it's an invalid or somehow offensive action to take, just one that annoys(/wearies) me. To my preference, actions should still at least be 'in-character'.

To be fair (and perhaps clearer), it's less 'new and unexpected plot elements' and more 'random and sudden changes in assumptions' that are the issue for me. Even if you don't directly foreshadow, there's still a sense of continuity with the former that means new additions make sense within the logic of the story, whereas the latter is jarring and draws you out of the narrative.

For example, if Percy Weasley had, mid-way through the canon series, revealed his secret passion for ballet dancing. He says this whole thing about going to lessons weekly for years, and wanting his family to come to his next recital. It'd be weird and unexpected, but that would at least semi-fit Percy's character. Ballet is all about control, precision, sticking to the script, and provides a less 'overtly physical' but still difficult workout. Fits the ambitious, hard-working, persnickety character that Percy is. That's a sudden change that makes some sense. It'd make more with foreshadowing, but it stands on its own.

Random changes like the one I mentioned before just don't. You think you understand the path this story is on, but then it suddenly takes a sharp left turn with no warning whatsoever.

But a story that actually examines that issue through the narrative - telling the story of someone directly affected by the issue, or telling the story of someone trying to fight against or change it, can be so much more interesting than just "Pause the story, it's Lecture Time!". So much more convincing, too. People follow narratives, not so much lectures.

It's another to have Harry reading and giving out books like /Lord of the Rings/ and whatever to all his friends. /Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay/ is particularly awful about it.

Another thing is in betrayed!harry or indy!harry stories, after dumbledore does the new law thing that forces harry into going back to hogwarts.

** Shoehorning canon into AUs. If you make up a pureblood culture, it doesn't appear only after Harry stumbled over Daphne Greengrass in sixth year - it was always there. The Weasleys grew up in it, Harry was immersed in it since year 1. He wouldn't be surprised about its existence, and Daphne Greengrass wouldn't be the first or the only one to mention it to him. Nor would she be the first or only one to "teach" him (if he were as naive as to trust her). There's Sirius, Remus, all the Weasleys Dumbledore, the teachers, the purebloods in Gryffindor, Hermione after she read up on it etc. etc. Just think about your worldbuilding, and how it would change the canon plot and characters - don't just take your OC and run with it from canon year X.

Fred abd George live in that house, Molly and Arthur will not pay much attention to a rat. Our family dog is 9, it still makes me go "Really, we've had him that long?" every now and then. They didn't tell the Hogwarts staff about the pet rat because it meant saying "We couldn't afford to get our child a good pet", and no one reported Percy because IT'S PERCY, of course he has permission, he's PERCY.

So are four other people. That's the reality of living in dormitories.

Even if we accept that Fred & George would have noticed that Pettigrew was one of Ron's dormmates (which I don't consider to be as inevitable as you apparently do, but let's grant it for the sake of argument) what is the consequence of that? They go "huh, I've never noticed that Ron is friends with any Peter Pettigrew" and never think about it again? Or they go "huh, when we were three a guy called Peter Pettigrew was murdered by Sirius Black. I bet it's the same person and he somehow survived and is now hiding in Hogwarts. We should report this to Dumbledore"?

Or, okay, lets accept that you are right and they see that Ron spends a lot of time with Pettigrew, and they decide to tease him about that. How does that conversation go?

#+begin_quote
  F&G: Hey, Ron, you sure seem to be spending a lot of time with Peter Pettigrew...

  R [confused]: Who the fuck is Peter Pettigrew?
#+end_quote

And then what do they do? Go "Huh, maybe the map is malfunctioning."

Even in the magical world, nobody /who never even met Peter Pettigrew, and was still pre-school age when he died/, sees his name on the map and immediately jumps to "obviously he's the same guy who died over a decade ago, who must have faked his own death and has pretended to be a rat for the last ten years" as the most rational explanation. /Even if they notice/, they go "huh, it's odd that I don't remember ever meeting this Pettigrew kid" and think nothing more of it. And even if they do think to question Harry and Ron and establish that they don't know any Peter Pettigrew after all - what do they do? It's not like they're gonna go to the teachers and be like "hey, this magical map which I stole from Filch and use to sneak around the school after curfew seems to be malfunctioning - can you look into this?"!

It would help if you read the things I said before you argue against them.

In fanfics where the rat vs cat argument is a thing, everyone who says Hermione is blame-free always uses the excuse that "rats aren't on the official list". Ok and? Percy had Scabbers for 4 years and Lee Jordan had a spider in Harry's first year. I didn't hear any adults say anything about sending home "unofficial" pets so clearly the list is more of a guideline than a hard-and-fast rule. I'm damn sure that there's been more rule-breakers than just Percy and Lee over the last decade, but sure, let's flame Ron for being angry at being attacked multiple times by an untamed animal (which can get said animal put to sleep) because Goddess Hermione can't ever be incorrect and even if she is the plot will validate her later. (Let's not forget that Hermione brought Crookshanks into the boy's dorm at least once and Scabbers was supposedly "killed" on Ron's bed.)

Dog average life expectancy is 12. If the dog is healthy and lucky, he may pass that (like some humans manage to pass 70 years). Some very rare cases have dogs surpassing the 20 years old mark.

The first task has no reason to be changed in this AU.The method Harry will use might change, but what he feels about it, not so much. It really isn't interesting from Harry POV. We already had it. However from Sirius POV, that is new, and something we haven't seen in canon.

You don't need to dumb down the adult, really. Just make them busy. Maybe it's because I do work at a school. And there's 900 kids in the school. But I can garantee you that as smart as we are, as observant as we are, there's still about 1 adult for 100 kids, and we can't see everything, hell we don't see most things because kids are sneaky AND watching kids is just one part of our job. What the kids are up to when I'm deep into another task, I have absolutely no idea.

More importantly, in Harry Potter the kids save he day mostly because they were at the right time at the right place, or they possesses informations, knowledge, outside help or powers that the adults do not have, and couldn't have had if the kids did not share.

On the few things you'd need to invent or justify is the Basilics. If Hermione found it throught research, then why no adults had ? But it isn't hard to justify that with that they had to worry about students safety, managing school life, reassuring parents of the petrified and what have you, that they had little time and head space to even try to start researching what the hell was that monster.

**** The 'thing' that makes people tired is the whole section of the story where Tonks has an emotional breakdown because 'nobody ever asked her to look like her actual self' and 'everyone just wanted to fuck someone famous' etc.

It's one way of handling it, sure, and it's a reasonable way of increasing the emotional depth of their relationship. However, it's so common in any sort of Harry & Tonks (friendship) or Harry/Tonks (Pairing) that it's just tiring.

There's something to be said for: She /chose/ to have pink hair. There are probably reasons for that. Maybe she enjoys standing out and not being just /plain old/ black haired medium cute girl. Maybe there are other reasons. There's a whole lot of potential with the character but most people boil it down to 'she acts like that because nobody ever, /ever,/ was interested in seeing the real her so she's actually a depressed girl that just needs a hug.'

** In no particular order.

Passing off a list of plot points perhaps padded out with sections of a world building document as a story. Set the scene. Let it play out. Wrap it up properly. Give things room to breathe and if you can, connect your scenes don't just slam them out one after the other.

Author notes. If the story needs more explanation add more explanation within the story. If you think something needs more justification add more justification. It's neither necessary nor wise to preface each chapter with a rambling commentary or worse break up your actual text for the same.

Irrelevant background info. Leave it in your world building doc. If you desperately want to share every word you wrote as part of world building do that separate to your actual stories. It's very impressive that you have a consistent theory on X or have thought through the ramifications of Y but putting it all down in giant blocks of exposition doesn't help you tell a good story. Keep it in mind as you write and if it becomes relevant to your story your effort will be readily apparent and your world will have an internal consistency people will notice.

Include conflict and setbacks. I get that you like your characters and don't want anything bad to happen to them but that leads to a boring story where nothing happens. And a hero that is tested, suffers hardship and endures and perseveres is stronger than one that was never tested at all. It doesn't have to be life and death, the setbacks can be as minor as high school drama as long as they persist and are important to the characters.

Power for powers sake. Everything you put into your story should come back and serve a purpose later on. If a character learns a spell it should be used to resolve something later on. Heck, if a spell is introduced it should be for some purpose that serves the story. Gathering a collection of kewl powers that never get used to further the plot is boring, don't do it.

** - *Contingency plan? What is that?*

This is pretty specific to Indy!Harry fics, but manipulative!Dumbledore is portrayed as stupid way too often, even if the author doesn't mean to.

I mean, consider this: evil!Dumbledore is, by definition, someone who has tricked most of the magical world into believing that he is the paragon of virtue, while being (depending on the fic) anyone from a cult leader to a dictator. And one simply does not pull it off without being smart as hell, having plans for everything that can go wrong (and plans in case these plans fail, too), and very good instincts.

But in a lot of fics, Dumbledore suddenly becomes an absolute moron the minute he opposes Indy!MC. All it takes for him to lose everything is a couple of Rita Skeeter's articles and/or one DMLE raid.

Speaking of which,

- *Amelia Bones lays down the law*

Now, this isn't that illogical per se, but it's honestly overused. And it's pretty absurd when Dumbledore - who told the Minister to take a hike when he tried to arrest him - would just meekly comply and allow himself to be arrested and lose all power (doubly so for evil!Dumbledore).

- *Everyone you know is evil*

This also ties into Stupid Evil!Dumbledore point above. Paying people to be friends with /the Boy-Who-Lived/ is a pretty strange idea already; paying people who hate Harry to pretend to be his friends is just beyond absurd.

Oh, you need information on Harry? Just ask. You're the Headmaster and the Leader of the Light - who's going to refuse you when you're "just concerned about a poor orphan"? And even if they do - there are portraits and ghosts and legilimency and so many other ways to track someone within Hogwarts walls - but no, Dumbledore's gonna pay Ron Weasley (and sometimes bribe Hermione with books).

Let's not even get into how stupid it is to talk to your agents directly and not have at least one layer in between. That's just asking for trouble.

- *What is the platform number, again?*

Apparently, the only reason Molly Weasley would ever ask her ten-year-old daughter if she remembers the platform number is an enormously complicated manipulation scheme involving fake friendships, love potions, magic limiters, and stealing truly obscene amounts of gold. There can be no other explanation.

- *Get in, Potter, we're going shopping*

I know that people have different tastes, but I honestly cannot imagine anyone finding these prolonged shopping sequences exciting. Nevertheless, it's not rare for a fanfic to dedicate half a chapter (or a full chapter, or even multiple chapters) to Harry just going to the Diagon Alley and buying stuff. Lots of stuff. Every item being lovingly described - and, of course, most of them are expensive as hell, because that's what you do with sudden inheritance: waste in on trinkets, some of which you won't ever use.

Now, PS had what you might call "a shopping sequence" - entire chapter of it, even - but it actually served a purpose. Not only did it give the readers a look into the Magical world, but it also established a lot of important things: at Madam Malkin's, Harry first met Draco (and learned about wizarding prejudices), at Ollivander's, he learned about Voldemort (and his possible connection to him), etc. These scenes are actually interesting to read /and/ they are necessary for the plot. They can't just be thrown out the way most fanfic shopping scenes can (and often ought to be).

I guess Hadrian instead of Henry works as a secret identity, as long as you also change his surname because you're not supposed to know this is him, but not as nickname for his civil registered name. I thought people just didn't like the name Henry and just decided to rename him, of to give him a secret identity like Aurora/Briar Rose.

******* I've always seen it as a bit classist, honestly. Harry is a common name (Petunia notes this in the first chapter of the first book, actually), so /of course/ their extra special Lord Potter-Many-Names needs to have an important-sounding name instead.

Hadrian doesn't actually correlate to Harry at all, like you've already noted, but it starts with the right letter, sounds vaguely similar at a glance if you squint, and is recognizably Roman in origin to match established names like Lucius and Severus, so someone somewhere decided that their edgy indy Harry was actually named Hadrian at birth and it became popular and now here we are.

When Sirius always knew that Petunia was the worst guardian for Harry. In the third book, he says that he would understand if Harry would rather stay with his aunt. This doesn't implies that he knew that Petunia was abusive. Quite the contrary.

Confusing manipulative with maniacally evil. I have yet to find a manipulative Dumbledore where Dumbledore is actually burden by what he thinks he has to do. It's like people think that Dumbledore was happy to manipulate his little world and that it was for his own profit. Except, Dumbledore don't gain anything, really. The wizarding world does. That why he does what he does. It's an attempt (and a successfull one in canon) to save the wizarding world from Voldemort. It's never an attempt to gain more power for himself. What is questionnable is Dumbledore methods, but not his intent, and Manipulative!Dumbledore always seems to miss this.

Ignoring canon without any warning. You don't get to tag "canon-compliant" and change things you didn't like to make it easier to you. You don't have to go full AU. But "slight canon-divergence" is a thing, and should be used. I like canon-compliant, I like complete AU and everything in between.

*** So... still waiting for the ‘unpopular' part, cause I think this was the opinion of roughly half the fandom. In the end it all boils down for the difference the inner dialogs make in telling a story, how far the screen-writers will go to please the public and the limitations of time inherent of movies, in the books for all the plot-holes JKR left open and all my complains about world-budding/magic system she /did/ manage to make a really good story with characters with understandable flaws that grew with time though never becoming perfect (which is a good thing, perfection is boring), Hermione was undoubtedly flawed from start to finish in the books, as was everyone else, and Harry's inner dialogue give us a particularly unflattering front-roll seat to it without being overly harsh (the way it would have been if the narrator was for example Snape), the books though, not only don't give us the actual character's perspective about what is happening (as a limitation of the media-type) but had to cut so much of the other characters good moments and so many of Hermione's douch-moments that they ended writing themselves into a corner where /not/ making Hermione omniscient, smooth and perfect would end being OOC even though it would be a more realistic presentation of her character. This isn't something that affects only those who only watched the movies -which, fair enough, their lives and all that, let's not try to dictate how other people should live their lives, it is never a good idea- but also those who both read and watched but preferred the movies' take on the story and those who also read fanfics more movie-based rather than book-based and liked the way of storytelling and decide to make their own stories along the same lines.

*** How did the whole OG Books (vs Movies) go for you? Because in the books, Hermione is really kind of a dick. But the movie Hermione couldn't pull that off once Emma turned like 13. Creepy but factual. There was just no way to not like her and then when you re-read/listen to the books you end up liking her more because of it. Not really your point, but interesting.

As for fics... get ye some DAPHNE stories. A few of them Daphne becomes friends with Hermione, but the majority of them go just the way you're looking for. Daphne is ALWAYS smart, likeable and a Hermione upgrade and that lends itself to Hermione bashing. And it certainly fixes your Hermione has all the answers trope, because as soon as Daphne shows up she generally puts a stop to that. Worth a shot.

Fair warning though. If a fic is going to bash Hermione they generally are going to take shots at Ron also. And since he's a giant bag of worthless douche in general it also makes sense. If you actually somehow like Ron you may struggle with Daphne stories.

For example: Perfectly casted shield charm unable to stop a bullet or invisible witch or wizard getting caught on camera recording or mobile phones being better than numerous ways of magical communication both shown in canon and one could think up, so on and on list goes.

****** That's less a weakness of magic and just that most people really aren't ready to respond to someone trying to murder them (after all there's even fewer real people who could survive that) at least a wizard who doesn't pass out or die instantly has a pretty solid chance of sealing the wound or apparating to St. Mungo's

I'd actually expect most wizard to fair a bit better than muggles in general, because muggles don't have a core school subject dedicated to fighting, while there's that line about many people not being good at shield charms, there's also the fact that almost everyone we see in canon has no issues passing their DADA owls, which require a number of combat focused spells and the ability to take on multiple dangerous creatures.

Imagine if instead of playing sports you had regular lessons on how to wrestle crocodiles, shoot bears and scare off cobras.

I do understand for a prose purpose to keep it all together and I can handle a giant paragraph if everything else is well spaced but that kills me. Another is also dialogue. If it's too confusing to read then I give up.

I think it may also depend on what kind of fic it is. Sometimes I do want something a little more flowery or fast paced which tells more than shows. That being said, if what the author writes in the summary doesn't really match with the tone or pace of the actual work, then that also gets annoying.

When people ‘feminise' a male character to make him suit some heteronormative idea of homosexuality, it makes me want to spew. 9.99 times out of 10 it will be a heterosexual woman writing it and it's honestly so gross.

Gay people are normal people and gay men come in all types. Sure camp and glitter and not being afraid of the colour pink can be part of it but that doesn't make them women lmao.

But honestly, I don't like Harry with multiple women. Not because I'm opposed to the concept, but because EVERY one I've ever read has Harry being pushed around by the women --- in one Harry/Daphne/Hermione, one of them threatens to kick him out of *his own bed* instead of going back to her own room. Usually the women decide (without his input) who will sleep with him, in which order on what schedule. There's usually at least one punitive shopping trip. ("You've made us angry, Harry, so you must take us shopping. We will dress you up like a doll for hours and make you spend lots of money on your wardrobe, and also buy us clothes and jewelry to appease us. After all, you're rich and that's how to keep women happy.")

If you don't want to disappoint your readers just tell them you can't write for a while and there will be an upload soon, but that's not even necessary.

Another thing I dislike is if the plot isn't thought through and the author shifts focus halfway. Like, give me a proper ending to the mystery you've been building up for 20 insanely long chapters before you decide to focus on the romance solely.

And then there are my personal likes and dislike in shippings. I can handle many of them if I come across them, but Snape + Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny are disgusting, much like Sirius/Remus/Dumbledore/any other adult.

  In addition, I've also found it a bit annoying when authors overdo the adverbs after dialogue tags, i.e. said happily, said angrily, said amusingly, etc. or when 'said bookisms' get used way too often, i.e. using chuckled, chortled, laughed, commiserated, sighed, groaned, growled, etc. all in place of 'said' or 'asked'.
#+end_quote

For a fanfiction reader, it's an unfortunate pet peeve to have because so many authors seem allergic to the good old "said". Here's an excerpt from an overall decent fic I was reading yesterday.

--------------

"Time is up, Miss Granger," he *offered* with a pleasant smile. She filled a vial with her potion and anxiously awaited the verdict. There were a few more items she had wanted to add but unfortunately had run out of time.

He waved his wand over the potion and studied the results. "I see you've been quite busy," he *responded pleasantly*. "It certainly looks like you identified the poison correctly but I think you've gone a bit overboard with the antidote. How many ingredients have you used?"

"Fifty two," she *answered hesitantly*.

"Hmmm..." he *hummed* in consideration, "I'm afraid you've overthought it. While I believe the antidote would work you've added several unnecessary or superfluous ingredients that would dilute or offset the effect you are going for. You've also missed a few basic antidote ingredients that could have helped with the potency."

"Very well done though, Miss Granger," he *stated pleasantly*, "this is by far the best effort so far," he concluded as he peered in disappointment at the rest of the class before brightening once again.

"Let us see what Mr. Potter has to offer!" he *continued*. Harry looked like he wanted to flee the room.

Slughorn hummed in consideration once again as he studied Harry's effort, his expression dimming a bit as the seconds ticked on. "While you've included all the basic antidote items it appears you've missed the more unique items that could have helped with this specific poison. Did you have trouble with the poison revealing spell?"

"I cast Specialis Revelio but wasn't sure what the results meant," Harry *answered dejectedly*, causing Hermione to feel a pang of sympathy. Last term Harry's failure would have been a moment of triumph for her. Now, the very thought of taking pleasure in Harry's humiliation turned her stomach.

"Ahh yes, it happens to the best of us," Slughorn *commiserated*.

"Remember this lesson, class!" he *continued* in a much louder voice, "no matter how skilled you are in potions preparation, if you don't begin the process with the proper facts your effort is doomed to be substandard." Harry winced at the word 'substandard.'

"And as much as a wide breadth of knowledge can be a strength it can just as easily turn into a weakness if you are distracted from remembering the basics. The simplest answers are many times the best and should not be overlooked for more exotic solutions," he *concluded* as he peered her way.

"I daresay if Mr. Potter and Miss Granger had worked on this assignment together they would have arrived at the perfect solution. Now let us see what Mr. Weasley has- Oh my. I'm not sure I've ever seen something that particular shade of gray before. And such an interesting consistency..."

As the class ended and she was gathering her things Harry leaned toward her and began speaking in a hush. "Go on ahead with Ron. I'm going to stay and ask Slughorn about the memory."

"You need to have a plan, Harry," Hermione *muttered* back.

"I figured I'd ask him for help on using Specialis Revelio, Harry *replied*. "Hopefully he takes a bit of pity on me and then I can ask about Horcruxes."

It was a good a plan as any she thought. "Your potion wasn't that bad," Hermione *assured*. "The fact that he made a comment at all showed you were on the right track."

** finding a fic with a fantastic description and then it's a harryxsnape fic. (fun fact, harryxsnape is the third largest harry potter ship on AO3)(kill me)

unnecessary pop culture references. like sometimes they make sense with different characters but a lot of the time it's just people inserting their own music taste. i dont care about twenty one pilots and i dont believe these characters would either

self inserts/OC main characters. they're fine as side characters but like not main characters.

making people OP.

dark harry is always a Slytherin.

explaining stuff you dont understand. this applies to most media but when people start giving reasons for something and they make no sense like, just say that it happened and move on.

multifandom one shot collections. when people put all of their one shots in one fic and i have to scroll for five minutes to get past it.

cross overs that dont make sense. i like crossovers but sometimes i see one and it's like, how would that even work. like harry potter with MLP. or crossovers with like 8 different fandoms that are all too different. like harry potter and PJO? sure. harry potter and fnaf? uh, sure. but all three? it's to much it doesnt make sense.

abrupt changes. idk how to explain this. but those changes where you can tell the author ran out of ideas and they start making stuff up. and then you have to read so much guff to get back, if you do get back. i read this one fic where harry very suddenly had a different personality(brainwashed) like ten chapters in and you had to read all this moping from an oc friend and i just stopped reading.

that's all i got rn

** H/Hr, because the Goddess deserves better. /s

Ron-bashing. I'm amazed that after 20+ years of fanfic, some people aren't sick of it yet.

Muggle/Wizard-wank. Some fic writers are subtle about it, but with others you can tell how much they hate not having magic and wish they were a wizard, or alternatively, how they want to even out the playing field by killing/dominating wizards. Get a grip, everyone.

SPAG errors/Plot inconsistances/OOC moments. Make the story make sense, ffs.

** Bashing of any character. And political 11 year olds.

Veela mates/marriage contracts. Daphne Greengrass as this neutral/powerful/beautiful slytherin ice princess who is flawless. ‘One of the good ones'

Luna as an all knowing seer.

And when Harry gets mad or blames Sirius didn't prioritize him and get him to safety the night his parents were killed. Like dude relax he lost 2 of his best friends and another betrayed them. Let him be a little emotional and reckless due to his grief and hurt.

Goblin Magic as this all powerful/cure all problems thing

And Harry changing his name to something like Anderson or Christopher when he goes back in time to hide his identity. At that point he doesn't even act like Harry anymore and with the name change you might as well make it self insert or OC.

And when Lily and James abandon Harry for his brother or sister who is believed to be the BWL/GWL
