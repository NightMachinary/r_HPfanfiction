What would happen?


** You would have to change what the reasoning behind his survival is. It would make no sense for Voldemort to choose to give Alice or Frank a chance to live, and saying “Nah, some /other/ Death Eater wanted to get into their pants” would be highly contrived and boring.

*** They're supposedly formidable Purebloods, so he could have wanted to spare them, with the intention of making them join him. While less ridiculous than there being a Severus equivalent with the Longbottoms, it's still a somewhat boring setup. What gets really interesting however is the fallout otherwise. Do the Potters take the Longbottoms' place and is tortured into insanity? What about Severus (who, at least at first, only turned to keep Lily safe)? Peter?

** If Neville was chosen then he wouldn't survive after Voldemort kill his parents, what likely occurs is that after Voldemort was done with the Longbottoms he chooses to kill the Potter, which results in Canon occurring, but without Neville.

*** Which means Gryffindor don't win the House Cup in first year.

Oh, and Nagini Nagini doesn't get killed at the opportune moment.

Unless you just have someone else do those things, but I feel like if you have a divergence from the canon then it ought to change things, otherwise what's the point at all..?
