** As stated, canon already employed option 1, and to this day I'm bitter about that. Option 5 is possibly the most satisfying though, it's both hard to do well and may not fit many fics. It obviously requires a certain kind of Harry. Generally, I prefer some combination of option 3 and 4 combined as long as author doesn't drag it on and on.

Option 2 is the shittest option among all of them imho.

*** Lucius should've gotten time in Azkaban even after he apparently gives up intelligence on the Death Eaters post war. He planted the diary and assisted in the Ministry break in in OOTP.

** Interesting. Think that the number should be different for each character.

1. for snape since he died, and since he's not a good man overall, but what's the point of hating on the dead.

5 For Voldemort, since he is a terror in all ways.

** 3, 4, 5 depending on the character. Authors seem to have an issue with getting rid of a character and keeping them away, though. I don't need to see them every other chapter for a smack down though. JKR at least spaced Lucius/Draco appearances out.
