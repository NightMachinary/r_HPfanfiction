A couple of years ago was the last time I read the books, and sometimes I get startled about stuff that I thought are canon just to find out we as fans collectively agreed on it.

Share with me your favourite fanon, and why?


** The muggle studies class is very out of date.

** That Snape is Draco's Gpdfather because it is interesting to read a relationship between the two.

That Sirius wears a leather jacket because I can see him being a bad boy that has the long hair and leather jacket and rides the motorbike.

Alice Longbottom being in the same year as Lily Evans. I love the idea of them being best friends and them having their children together. And I love the idea of Lily being Neville's Godmother and Alice being Harry's Godmother.

Fabian and Gideon Prewett being twins. It is never confirmed that they are twins. It is just assumed that they are. I like them being twins and after they died, Molly and Arthur had the twins and decided to name them after both.

*** And I thought all of these besides the Draco one was canon. Leather jacket Sirius is my fav though

**** Oh yes, leather jacket Sirius is my absolute favorite. And I thought they were all Canon too until I reread the books and realized that they weren't

**** Yeah that's what I meant some fanons are so well inserted on the story that it makes the story well put together.

Okay fun fact about this the likelihood of giving birth to twins increases when the mother's side of the family has twins, so scientifically speaking this one is likely to be true.

**** The chances also increase with age, when you've already had a few children, and people who are on the larger side, three things that already apply to Molly. So really, we don't know which one has Molly having twins and she could have had them without her brothers being twins.

***** You are right all of these are enough reasons without her brothers being twins, but I like this fanon too much to let it go lol.

****** Oh i love it too! I just hate that when I write that they aren't twins, I get hate because people are saying they are twins when it hasn't been confirmed.

******* Sorry you get that :( the thing is it's a fanfic so even if someone changed in the canon no need to get defensive, and pleaaase give the author a chance to connect their story.
