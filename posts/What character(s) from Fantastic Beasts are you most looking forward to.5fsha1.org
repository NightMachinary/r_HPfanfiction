** Definitely Grindewald, especially his relationship with Dumbledore. His particular interest at him hints at a real development between the two. However, I am worried about Depp's ability to do the character justice. It's a shame they didn't keep Colin Farrell, I thought he was really good, especially his casual displays of power.

** Is anyone else curious about Queenie's seemingly natural ability for legilimency? Aside from Dumbledore, Snape, and Voldemort, is there another witch or wizard capable of wandless, nonverbal legilimency? I am looking forward to seeing more about how she learned to use her powers at such an advanced state.

**** I agree that there are probably many high level Ministry witches and wizards capable of this but that makes me question Queenie's low-level position within MACUSA. I'm curious if she too (like Tina) was demoted or if she keeps her powers hidden. The only instance where she uses her powers outside of Kowalski/Newt/Tina is to distract one of the MACUSA workers briefly.

***** I'd think she keeps them hidden since that one obliviator has no idea how she would know about his affair. On the other hand, she revealed them to Newt and Jacob the moment they walked in their apartment

** To echo what's already been said, for the movies I am most looking forward to young(er) Dumbledore.

For fanfic, I am really looking forward to Newt's time at hogwarts. I think him and the lestrange girl (lisa? liesle?) would be super interesting. Also he said he got kicked out of hogwarts so that could make for some very interesting fic.

And I don't think him being kicked was anything that exciting, probably pretty much what happened with Hagrid

Is Newt still alive as of the books? I'd love to read a conversation between him and Hagrid.

  I side with him because Wizards have NO RIGHT to censor the world from us. The world, along with all it's magic and magical creatures, is as much OUR birthright as it is theirs! If they want to hide away in little covens and cower from the world, that's their thing, but WE have a right to live in a world were magical creatures exist!

Us? Our? We? Aren't you taking all this a little too seriously?

** Obviously Dumbledore and the Fantastic Beasts themselves. In my opinion, we still don't know much about Dumbledore at that time, other than the large info dumps that JK likes to do during interviews and Pottermore articles. I would also like to see his prowess in magic, in action, obviously, Grindelwald was holding back while he was playing the part of an Auror. So it would also be interesting to see his full power as well. Since there will be five movies, I believe that we will at least see some of the battle between the two.

The magical creatures are obviously the main attraction, and I can't wait to see them in this more modern take on the HP movies. Especially Fawkes, as the Phoenix itself is my favorite magical creature; just seeing the thunderbird sent chills down my spine.
