I'm looking for anything that features Bellatrix (any of the Black sisters would do, really) as the main character. It doesn't have to be canon-compliant, but I would prefer if it were.


** This is completely cannon compliant, about the, uh...”love story” between Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange. Basically, Rodolphus is completely in love with Bellatrix starting from their school days, but she is troubled and oblivious. It follows their life together as Voldemort rises and Bellatrix becomes increasingly devoted to the cause.

Characterizations are super realistic to canon. This story will likely tear out your heart, run it through a wringer, and hang it out to dry.

If you're okay with something completely non-canon, here is one about Bellatrix traveling back in time, meeting a young Tom Riddle, and the story path their relationship takes. I liked her characterization in this story as well.

It's mostly about Lucius and Narcissa's early marriage, but of course Bellatrix and Rodolphus feature prominently

** Well, it's definitely not canon compliant, but I have to recommend !linkffn(All According to Plan). In it, a thirteen year old Bellatrix from the past in an alternate universe accidentally travels forward in time to the canon universe. She then causes as much havoc as possible.

  Thirteen-year-old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron goddess. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. Title drop. (A collaboration by LeighaGreene and inwardtransience)
