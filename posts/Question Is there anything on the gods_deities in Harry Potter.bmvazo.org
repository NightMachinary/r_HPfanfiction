Is there anything Canon on them? I know the Deathly Hollows were supposedly made by Death but is there anything else?

Edit: I'm not looking for religion just the Gods.


** In canon? No. Dumbles himself supposes that the Hallows were probably just inventions of the Peverell brothers, rather than the objects of legend they're made out to be. In HP, as in life, there seems to be no conclusive proof of any deities or otherworldly entities - but surely some people like to believe in them anyway.

HP likes to dance around the topic of religion in general. I don't recall any character being stated to believe in a specific religion, and there's the whole "suffer not the witch to live" thing. Wizarding history probably outright falsifies various muggle religious lore, or at least goes all "no here's what /really/ happened" about it. British wizards use "God" as an expletive and celebrate holidays like Christmas, but none seem to be practicing members of a religion. But there does /seem/ to be an afterlife, or something like it, and souls, or something like them.

The Doylist interpretation is, of course, that religion wasn't a topic Rowling wanted to deal with in the books - a perfectly valid choice, and I think it probably makes the books more accessible/the characters more relatable for some people.

But there's certainly some interesting worldbuilding that fic authors can do, in various different directions, based on the general mish-mash you get in canon. A cynical take might be "all muggle religions are actually cases of muggle-baiting gone WAY more viral than intended". Some fics come up with a unique pantheon of celestial thingamajigs, like the Alexandra Quick series. Some fics have characters that believe in various real religions, which isn't too jarring if done well. Some fics use deities whenever they need a plot device to send Harry back in time with a power level over 9000 and a veela harem. And of course, there's the best fic ever written, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/Hogwarts-School-of-Prayer-and-Miracles][Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles )]].

[EDIT] My favorite deities in fanfic are the "three figures" from the excellent, abandoned [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]], mainly because they're an Order of the Stick reference.

To be fair, using 'God' as an expletive and celebrating christmas is about as near as much of Britain /gets/ to practising religion.

** Well, the Deathly Hallows being made by Death is a fairy tale, not something that wizards believe to be true. And those wizards who do believe that the Deathly Hallows exist still don't believe that Death made them - they believe that the Peverell brothers created them.

So I wouldn't count Death either.

The only stuff in canon about deities is the characters' occasionally invoking Christian curse words, following the Christian calendar, and observing Christian rites of passage such as burials in a churchyard. It seems likely that wizarding Britain is, like Muggle Britain, a secular Christian nation which pays lip service to Christianity but doesn't let it get in the way of life.

** There's the whole Sirius singing Wizard-style Christmas Carols. (I don't know how it is in English, but in LatAm spanish he sings "To Bethelem goes a hypogriff")

Other than that there's not much, I think.

It makes some amount of sense for gods of old to be exceptionally powerful wizards/witches though.

** There was that thread here linksub(b2b2qj) which resulted in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/religionless-universe-of-harry-potter.html][my blogpost]] on faith in HP universe. Just concerning other Gods than the judeochristian Yahweh: HP universe is firmly located around year 2000 in the real universe of current Europe. That limits the number of possible religions severely. Yes, there are some Hindus, Muslims, etc., you can have some random Wiccan (although [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/J._K._Rowling%27s_Twitter_account#Wicca_in_the_wizarding_world][JKR was against it]]), I can imagine some very very pureblood families who have no contact with the Muggle world may practice some Old Religion (Celtic or whatever), but it has to be really very small numbers, nothing significant. Generally I would consider the British magical religious world mostly correspond to the the British Muggle one: mostly secularized Christians with some few exceptions.

*** Why would they be Christian when back when Catholicism and Christianity were synonymous, Catholics literally burned suspected ‚Äúwitches‚Äù? Even if very few, or no, witches/wizards were actually hurt, the mass hysteria involved is why they went into hiding. The Statue of Secrecy probably wouldn't have ever existed if not for the witch burnings...Having the Wizarding world be mostly Christian makes absolutely zero sense.

**** There could have been a magical Reformation where a different form of Christianity was adopted. Even if pureblood culture had fully rejected it, the regular influx of muggleborn would maintain a Christian presence in the magical world.

***** That's something I could buy. I bet it could also be used to explain even more the hostility that some purebloods have toward Muggleborns. Even so many years later. People are rarely so extreme about a single specific thing (I.e ethnic/blood status) without some kind of ways to ‚Äújustify‚Äù it to themselves. In this case, maybe purebloods see the spread of Christianity as like... idk... a betrayal? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**** a) Because many wizards would be believers themselves, and understand that crazy mob has nothing to do with the true faith. Actually, most true witchhunts were driven by the popular opinion not by the official church hierarchy (not always), it is more complicated, read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_trials_in_the_early_modern_period]] .

b) Even after the Statue of Secrecy there were many Muggles who married wizards or witches, who were Christians and they haven't seen the reason why to stop practice their faith. Remember until roughly the Second World War huge majority of all Europeans/North Americans were practising Christians. How much they truly believed and how much it was just part of their culture, is another question, but it is certain that for most at least Muggles, it was Inconceivable! not to participate in religious life.

c) BTW, I am a Protestant myself, but I have to admit that the large witch-hunts of the modern age (see above) were done equally by Protestants as well as Catholics.

***** That's the thing though... witchcraft is considered a sin. Like... satanic by Christianity. They wouldn't have been believers, unless they actively hated themselves and their magic. Even if only the crazy omg were doing the actual killing, the rest didn't exactly approve of witches either.... I'm not saying that no Christian wizards/witches exist. Because like you said, times changed. But I consider it a long shot to say ‚Äúmost‚Äù would be Christian.

****** Well, even interpretation of Exodus 22:18 is a bit complicated even from the Muggle point of view (see [[https://is.gd/SBfJHl]] and read all those comments to that verse, and keep in account that all those comments were written by Muggles). And if I knew about true wizards (or if I was the one), I would probably be able to distinguish between my native genuine abilities (for Harry doing magic was in my opinion no more sinful than for somebody who has gift of music to play violin) and something unnatural: be it Mr. Filtch and his Kwikspell or our occultism. In both cases those who were not given true magical power try to do it by illicit means. Whether occult behaviour is real and truly supernatural, or whether it is just a fraud is still open question. For example, Saint Augustin (who was really important theologian taken very seriously by all Christians, Catholics as well as Protestants) thought that there was no real magic (and no true astrology), just fraud committed on gullible.

Also, there is really not much about magic in whole Bible. Another clearly bad magic was divination (1. Samuel 28:8 [[https://is.gd/aRkrLL]], see from verse 8 forwards), but again the problem doesn't seem to be magic itself, but Saul's unwillingness to obey the Lord. And that's basically it concerning magic in the Bible. Ah, I forgot, Simon Magus in Acts 8:9 [[https://is.gd/Y4Dzow]] where again the only critical thing about Simon (who seems to be again more fraud than a satanist) is that he tries to bribe apostles.

***** *Witch trials in the early modern period*

Witch-phobia and prosecutions for the crime of witchcraft reached a highpoint from 1580 to 1630 during the Counter-Reformation and the European wars of religion, when an estimated 50,000 persons were burned at the stake, of which roughly 80% were women, and most often over the age of 40.

**** It is very well possible that they took a different interpretation on the witch-question, but valued the rest of the Christian religion and tradition nonetheless. Christianity wasn't defined by witch hunting and completely abandoning the religion that was entwined with practically every aspect of life was a rather large one. Especially since there wasn't a alternative. Paganism was dead and atheism wasn't on anyone's radar. It was Catholicism, Anglicanism or Dissenting.

***** That's fair. I can definitely see that. I guess personally, my headcanon is that- if there's a religious aspect in the Wizarding world- that it would likely be an amalgamation of old religious beliefs/practices. Because remember, the term ‚Äúpaganism‚Äù didn't really become a thing until Christianity did. So... to me, wizards would likely be kind of pagans. Every witch/wizard worshipping/believing/etc. in whatever gods/deities that they felt were relevant and helpful for them, specifically. It wouldn't really be any centralized religious order or anything. Because that's how it used to be waaaay back then before organized religion was a thing.

****** The problem with that is that Christianity had been in full swing before the statue of secrecy was enacted. Whatever was left of old pagan beliefs and practices was incorporated in the Christian way of doing things. There was nothing left to build something new upon and that is reflected in canon where we see nothing that hints toward paganism.
