I have read a few but her dad is a retired soldier before going into dentistry. I am looking for a fic where Hermione's parents Actually do something about the situation. Training, intervening with how the Dursleys treat harry. Just the grangers being more developed characters. Or maybe helping the order of the Phoenix. I just finished a crack fic with Mrs. Granger teaming up with Molly Weasley and the ghost of Lily Potter to hunt dealer eaters And tortures them with a dentist drill. If not the grangers that an OC muggle raising harry or teaching him. I think there is a series about harry being raised by a mob boss OC that is pretty good(. Can't remember the name but if someone can please let me know I would love to re-read it)


** Hermione's parents are pretty badass in Escape. She has kept them abreast of all the happenings in the wizarding world, and she has shared as much of the world (magic, history, potions, etc) with that as she can. Her mum also doesn't take shit from anyone. I really enjoyed their relationship. Full disclosure Escape is an anti-marriage law fic with Harry/Hermione. It also features a great friendship between Snape and McGonagall. Linkffn(11916243).

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

** Can you link that crack fic? It sounds hilarious.

I have this scene in my head for some time:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione: “Mum, here are a couple more Death Eaters to soften up!”

  15 minutes later, Emma Granger smiled at her ‘patients', tightly secured in a dentist chair: “Now, which cavities shall we explore today, Mr Malfoy?”

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff
