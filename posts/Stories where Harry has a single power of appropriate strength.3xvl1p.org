There are many stories where Harry gets overloaded with multiple powers(a huge ass fortune, and maybe several marriage contracts) and it almost makes it boring to read just cause he crushes the opposition with seemingly no effort or maybe the way he attains or trains this power seems effortless.

Are there fics where authors give harry a power and give this new power of his an inherent weakness? Or maybe just a difficulty to control this power.


** Man, you could probably make something out of that 'structural analysis' thing from Fate/Stay Night. Bonus points are that it starts out as a weak-ass power, but when you add transfiguration, conjuration and the ability to gather knowledge on how potions, machines, enchantments, horcruxes and alchemical artifacts really work?

It has the ability to ramp up in conjunction with the plot. Harry could go OP, but it's unlikely.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry and a war hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

** Does extending the blood protection to include immunity to all spells and curses Voldemort cast before his revival in book 4 count? Meaning he is immune to horcruxes and their defenses.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
