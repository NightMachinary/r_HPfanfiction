If wizards used to poop wherever they pleased and just vanished it and Hogwarts didn't have plumbing before the eighteenth century, why are there ancient pipes and toilets that lead to the Chamber of Secrets?


** Rowling covered that on /Pottermore/, actually. The pipes aren't so ancient: whenthe plumbing system was being installed in the 18th century, the then-current Heir of Slytherin, some Gaunt or other, arranged to be put in charge of the building work, knowing that it would unveil the trap-door that led down into the Chamber. He then completely redid the entrance to the Chamber in the process.

** You know, the whole shitting in corners and vanishing it is why I tend to subscribe to "if it's not in the 7 books it's not real".

*** Well since the canon is 1000 years old (if not more ). I can accept it didn't have a plumbig system from the start. I can also accept that an Heir of Slytherin used the installation of the plumbig system to hide the entrance of the chamber. I can even accept that some anarchist wizard choose to ignore all social convention and to just shit were they stood before vanishing it (if they ever vanished it ).

But that ALL the witches and wizards did it, including stick in the mud teacher like McGonnagal, shy girls shitting in front of their crush and children. Please their is a limit to suspended belief.

My Headcanon is that before the installation of modern plumbig system, the loo were just room with a all to shit and they would periodically vanish the shit rather than having someone shoveling it outside like in the muggle world.

***** Except she's the author. If she says it's canon, it's canon. She's the ONLY one with that right. It's her world. You can dislike it all you want, you can say your personal headcanon is that only stuff from the books matter... but that doesn't change the fact that the original author is the one who decides what's canon.

****** Except she can't. At best, she could write book 8 with all her non sense which could make it slightly more viable. Her political stance, opinions, and anything else has nothing to do with the book series. The world of Harry Potter has nothing to do with some woman named JK Rowling. It has to do with the seven main books.

******* Seven books which were written by a woman named JK Rowling. A woman who decided everything that went into the world of Harry Potter. The world of Harry Potter would not exist if not for a woman named JK Rowling.

So yes, she can. You can quote "Death of the Author" all you want, but that is only one way to view a text, a way that several people (including me) do not agree with.

******* *The Death of the Author*

"The Death of the Author" (French: La mort de l'auteur) is a 1967 essay by the French literary critic and theorist Roland Barthes (1915--1980). Barthes' essay argues against traditional literary criticism's practice of incorporating the intentions and biographical context of an author in an interpretation of a text, and instead argues that writing and creator are unrelated. The title is a reference to Le Morte d'Arthur, a 15th-century compilation of smaller Arthurian legend stories, written by Sir Thomas Malory.The essay's first English-language publication was in the American journal Aspen, no. 5--6 in 1967; the French debut was in the magazine Manteia, no.
