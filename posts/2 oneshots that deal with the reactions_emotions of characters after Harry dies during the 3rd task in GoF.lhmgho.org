I've always wanted to read something like this, so when I did find a fic that dealt with the topic, I decided to share it here.

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23992198][Let it Drown]]:

#+begin_quote
  /It has to be dead./ An alternative graveyard scene.
#+end_quote

You don't exactly have to read this to understand the other two oneshots I'm reccing- it just provides a bit of context about how Harry died.>! (Voldemort killed him at the graveyard.)!<

2.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28102941][hope where have you gone?]]:

#+begin_quote
  The hardest part is always, what comes next? When the person you loved /(or didn't)/ is gone, and the next day dawns, what do you do then? What can you do?
#+end_quote

This explores a few character reactions.

3.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26177548][what would i give]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter never leaves the graveyard that fateful night. The tragedy is the grief his death leaves behind.
#+end_quote

This, too, explores character reactions, but reactions of a few other undepicted characters.


** Found these fics a few weeks ago and absolutely love the emotion in them. I honestly kinda want a follow up on the latter two. As a comment put it, Harry's absence being what leads to the defeat of Voldemort by his loved ones is a pretty cool premise.
