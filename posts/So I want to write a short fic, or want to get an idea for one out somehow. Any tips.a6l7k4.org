I'm still mulling the details over but I'm thinking something only a few pages or a dozen or so paragraphs of story. Like Hermione's parents doing oral work on a wizard or one of the older characters telling a funny story from their youth and so on.


** Remember, get to the point. About three years ago I spent three months writing a "short" Marauders Fic. I was 95 pages in and they weren't even friends yet. I had to scrap the entire thing.

*** So 95 pages or awkward stares and leering?

**** Pretty much. Rereading it now, it sucks. What's worse, is that I was super proud of it when I first started writing it.

****** Exactly. Except the only problem is that mine was too long, so it would be like an hour and a half video of the character getting up and standing there.

** Everyone has different ways of writing things. How I used to write was to just start writing it out. I just wrote out what came to mind and reread and fixed it up later. While that could definitely work for one-shots and short fics, it hasn't worked for longer fics in my experience. For all fics a good method is to just write out ideas and outlines while your story is fresh, and whenever you're feeling inspired to get more detailed and start writing the actual story based on your outline. If you're like me and only get inspired to write every once in a while you should definitely write down everything in your head when you get it. It doesn't matter if your first draft or outline is well written, as long as your ideas get onto the paper. You can make it pretty later on once you know what you're doing with the story.
