This is it if anyone is interested.


** I'm pretty positive Redemption is also on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. I swear I've seen this somewhere else before.

*** I don't know. I think the author is just doing this on Wattpad based on how she updates and I read one of her authors notes. Maybe something similar on fan fic? I do really like it though. It also appears that she has two original stories that seem to only be on Wattpad, so that's also why I think that. But I don't know.
