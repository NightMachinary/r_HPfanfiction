  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

#+begin_quote
  1976 and nightmare visions of the future are plaguing Severus Snape. With Lily's help, he will need to figure out what these glimpses are trying to tell him, to change their future to a better one for all of the wizarding world. Although the future is not set in stone, not everything Severus sees can be changed, sometimes the inevitable will reach them sooner than they expected

** I'm unsure of what you mean by second chance but here are a few recs you might like:

Time-travel

linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters) This is really good with a Snape who gets into magical academia but unfortunately abandoned.

linkao3(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds by Lucy_Luna) Snape and Lily travel back in time. One of my favourite recent fics with a consistent update schedule.

Linkffn(To Recollect the Future by oliver.snape) Snape and Harry time-travel.

Snape makes better decisions due to different circumstances:

linkao3(a life of smoke and silvered glass by dirgewithoutmusic)

linkao3(In Another Lifetime by Jaxon)

linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower)

Snape survives the war:

linkao3(Snape: the Homes Fries Nazi by pir8fancier) Amazing, creative Snape survives the war fic. It's Snarry though.

  Hindsight is 20/20, but when Harry's last steps into the forest set him back further than he'd ever thought, he never realised how grateful he'd be to have Snape there to help too. Mentor/guardian fic, time travel, but not cliched.

**** You're welcome. :) I liked it but Snape didn't ring true because to me he isn't Snape unless he makes shitty decisions. :P But I agree, it's a wonderful fic especially considering the author doesn't even like Snape. I loved the scenes towards the end, with [[/spoiler][his death, the parallels between Snape and Harry, Snape and Lily's friendship and when Lily asks him to be Godfather. Oof. It's also quite sad that despite making better choices he still got the same raw deal as canon.]]

  "I'm sorry," he said again."Sorry's not enough, Sev. Be fucking better." Lily shut the door in his face. He spent the summer reading in the library, the park, and then sneaking home when he was hopeful his parents would be asleep. He tried to think about bravery, but sometimes he just thought about Lily's hair, the way it went more golden in summer. He tried to think about nobility, ethics and grace, but the clouds chased each other, fat and white, across the sky and he wasn't sure what any of this had to do with him.His father took him fishing by a dreary brown creek and they sat in silence. Severus could hear every creak, every lap of the water, every inhale and movement his father made. He thought maybe if he just said nothing, nothing ever, he'd never say anything again that made Lily's face go so flat and distant. If he said nothing, maybe nothing would hurt.His father reached for a beer can in a swift movement and Severus froze himself unflinching. He sat in that silence afterward, slowing his heartbeat, picking apart the sudden rigid shell of his shoulders. His father hummed, cracking the can open like a gunshot.(slight AU in which Sev is better at life)
