Do people really think that JK Rowling is gonna come across their fanfic and sue them if they don't use one? Last time I checked, most Fanfiction sites, especially the most popular ones are so lenient of their own rules that you can upload practically anything without fear of getting taken down. Except for porn in the cover image; that's suddenly crossing the line.

I know there have been takedowns of fics in the past, but that was an exceedingly long time ago. When do fics evar get taken down nowadays?

*** Stating that you don't own the setting or characters, and then using them, is basically saying "I admit I /know/ I'm doing something illegal."

Stating no intent of financial gain might help a future claim of fair use. Changing some of the names (e.g., Hadrian Potter) might also push the story into "parody" territory which would also help a claim of fair use.

**** The sites themselves do that though, there's no need for individual authors to do. There /are/ authors who have said they don't want their work made into fanfiction and they could sue, no matter the disclaimer - that's when it becomes illegal. Rowling is not one of them and has long acknowledged the existence of fanfic sites and given permission, although she doesn't like it herself. She's given permission as long as there's no financial gain, and so it's not illegal. If she turned around and changed her mind tomorrow, it would be the hosts of the sites that would have to remove the fics or face legal consequences, not users themselves.

The recent parody laws in the UK do make it far easier to claim fair use now though, you're right on that.

***** I doubt any statements by the hosting site would remove an individual's legal responsibility for their own actions.

A fanfic is illegal as soon as the original work is published -- that's what copyright is, the right to copy (characters, settings, text, etc.). It doesn't require the author to say they don't want fanfics, copyright already does that.

What /exactly/ were JKR's statements about fanfics? Unless it's a legal statement issued by her lawyers giving up future rights to sue others over her works, then her rights are still reserved and we're all violating them. Simply stating (in an interview or something?) that she doesn't intend to pursue legal action over fanfics is like saying you're not going to prosecute shoplifters -- that doesn't make the shoplifters' actions legal (apologies if that comparison doesn't seem fair, I'm just trying to illustrate a point).

Don't get me wrong, I love fanfics and am very happy for their existence. I just try not to fool myself about their legality (and would support some legislation that would help to make them more legal -- like that's ever going to happen).

The potential for a proprietary estoppel argument here is intriguing though.

(Proprietary estoppel: if you encourage someone in a belief that you will not enforce a proprietary right against them, and that person acts in reliance on the belief that they have the right to use the property, and in that reliance they experience some detriment, then you cannot then go back on your promise and enforce your legal right. Typically applies to land but you might be able to argue its extension to other types of property.)

Shoplifting isn't such a great example because it's a criminal offence, not a civil one.

****** It's the hosting sites that have to enforce rules regarding the publishing of fanfic for works where the author has banned it though. Obviously if you published it on your own site or on LiveJournal or something the individual would be responsible, but it's easier for Warner Brothers to threaten sites like Fanfic.net instead, as it's that site enabling the actual publishing of it.

I can't remember her actual words, but they were in an interview with that Emerson guy from Mugglenet. Essentially she said she thought it was weird but said it was nice people were being creative. She has pursued legal action against a fanfic author before, but purely because he was selling merchandise for his fic, I think. I do take your point about shoplifters, but I think it comes down to fnancial gain that makes it illegal, because digital communication hasn't really caught up with copyright laws as far as I'm aware. (Disclaimer, I have a social media marketing background, not law)

I don't think we have to worry about them being banned unless people start trying to get profit from it, which, sadly they are. In the past week I've seen two posts on this very subreddit with people thinly veiling their desire to get some financial compensation. It's important as a community that we emphasise that this is NEVER acceptable.

Financial gain makes it /clear/ that it's illegal. Without it, the fanfic author might have a case for fair use. But using the same names and settings makes that case much harder (because JKR clearly owns /them/ -- well, depending on what deals she's made with publishers, movie production companies, etc.).

On the other hand, a parody /can/ make money and still be legal. For example, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bored_of_the_Rings][Bored of the Rings]] is clearly based on Tolkien's work but changes enough names and settings to be a transformative work.

**** The particular wording you use isn't so important, so long as you clearly communicate your intent. But something like this is good enough:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is the property of JK Rowling. This work has been written for pleasure not financial gain. The author reserves all rights to any original material contained within the work.
#+end_quote

You can get more flowery and start declaring your story transformative or a parody or whatever, but there's not much point to that. Declaring something doesn't make it so. In the event that you did get sued and were insane (or rich) enough to let it go to court, whether or not your fanfic was transformative or a parody would be a matter of fact to be determined by evidence. A disclaimer wouldn't make it so.

** My favourite are the Harry Potter and friends read the books fics that post a disclaimer at the top, and then go on to post the entire text of the original book! Man, fanfic authors have stumbled across the most powerful legal technique in the world! Just post a one-line disclaimer, and you're allowed to do absolutely anything you want! Brilliant.

Edit to clarify my flippant point above: my problem isn't with the fact of the disclaimer itself, it's with the feeling of legal entitlement it seems to give some authors. "What? Of course it's legal. I posted the disclaimer."

***** Nobody will ever go to court with an individual fanfic author. Ever. Perhaps with the host and operator of the aggregate website, but even then this falls under fair use laws.

Why will an author never be sued for a fanfic?

Well, why does any company sue anyone?

Financial gain, or to mitigate financial loss. There is no money lost or to be gained through FanFiction, and no claim on parodies of said work.

Furthermore, everyone online is anonymous. Who are they going to sue, hermioneXdracoLuvr with an IP from Denmark?

The whole idea that authors of FanFiction- and /especially/ Harry Potter FanFiction where Rowling endorsed such works- are at some legal risk is utterly ridiculous. It infuriates me to no end when I see this illogical crap with no precedent or basis in reality spouted across forums everywhere.

And regardless, others are right. The disclaimer has no legal weight behind it, and would serve as no protection against these imaginary fanfiction lawyers.
