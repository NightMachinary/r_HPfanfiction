** It is different, but it reminds me kind of the background of the story I like, linkao3(11676102), but I would love to really read another one.

The unfortunate aspect all Petunia/Snape stories is that they are horribly horribly written (linkao3(17938232) is my current preferred example of how deep can writer of a story fall). I really hoped for The Terms of Matrimony (see [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html]] for my review and URLs where to find it), but it just starts interesting and then it suddenly ends. And yet, I think both are persons with so much potential to be an interesting characters, but alas, nobody did a good job on them.
