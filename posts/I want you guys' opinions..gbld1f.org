It was a strange feeling as Ron looked at the satchel in his hand. The weight of it felt intimately comforting and frighteningly heavy at the same time. 100 Galleons. To a child in a poor household with seven children it was a figure beyond his wildest dream. Yet he held it in his hand, as real as the air he breathed. As if acknowledging his feelings his breath hitched, a single tear rolled down his cheek. Ron felt the urge to do something, whether to sob openly or cackle madly, he didn't know. Here he was a child not even fourteen and he had made more money than his father made in a month by himself. Hell even Bill or Charlie didnt make this much in a month. He was brought out of his musings as he felt a hand grasp his shoulder. He instinctively grasped the satchel tighter, before he relaxed as Harry's amused face came into view. "You alright there mate?" Asked Harry. His tone carrying a hint of teasing. Ron realised with dawning horror that Harry had likely realised what was going on his head, they knew eachother very well for it to be otherwise. He knew Harry was going to tell Hermione about it, thick as thieves those two, and he will never live it down. After all he had never thought he could sell it, much less for this much and it was Hermione's idea to try and see. He felt his cheeks redden as he splutterd an excuse, and the satchel clinked in his hand. And suddenly he didn't care. "Yeah, I am fine. Reaaaly fine." He said with a goofy smile on his face. He didn't care enoghugh to be embarrased. So what if Hermione was right, she was most of the time, other times she was almost right. He pocketed the satchel as he vowed to study the books on enchantment as soon he had free time to cut down on the time needed to enchant a set of magic chess pieces. After all he had sold his first working chess set for 100 Galleons and the future looked to be a bright. He mentally thanked his lucky stars that Harry and Hermione had convinced him to study magic after that incident with the troll. He leaned on Harry's shoulders as the two members of the Golden Trio went towards the book shop to collect their third member. Ron smiled bemusedly as he saw Harry perking up seeing Hermione up ahead waiting for them with her bottomless bag hoisted on her shoulders. No doubt filled to the brim with books. The smug look in her eyes that said "I told you so" without saying a word almost had him sputtering in indignation again. But he refrained his instinctive response as he felt the weight, definitely comforting , of the coins in his pocket and smiled riefully at her. She certainly was right about a lot of things. He felt his anger and embarassment dissappear as she laughed openly at his smile then fell into step beside them. There were no words neccessary between friends like them who had braved life and death together. And as the trio trudged towards Hogwarts, Ron reminisced about how this all started.

** Not a bad premise having Ron earning money making something concerning a hobby he loves. Of course what is missing is the discussion that caused Ron to take his studies more seriously after the Troll.

And I agree Paragraphs make reading easier.

** Wall of text, wrong flair (it should be 'Self-promotion'), spelling/punctuation mistakes and, again, wall of text.
