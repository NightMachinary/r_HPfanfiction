With harry setting his his magic up in a chi spiral learning to filter the corruption from the piece of Voldemort soul and learn to take in magical energy from the world around him.


** I've seen Harry come across his magic pre-hogwarts in many ways similar to that, but I haven't come across one that uses that specific series.

*** I just like the series so used it as my example.

The books have a pretty good explanation of cultivating while still being somethings that Harry could have theoretically read (apart from the fact that the first book wasn't published till 2016).

**** The books are xianxia which is something Harry could have theoretically read only if he were able to read Chinese and have access to books that somehow made their way over from China.

***** I meant that if The divine dungeon series was published in the 80s/90s Harry could have theoretically have found the book series at his local or school library in the fiction section.

And I dislike actually xianxia main characters.

****** Then he could theoretically have found them in the bins behind a local charity shop even. He also could have found a lot of other books there. Yet somehow we have no indication that he is prone to obsessively emulating any book, even the ones he did find in his school library.

******* It's fanfiction other storys have had Harry do a lot more Out of character things.

They could also be part of the many books on the shelves in Dudleys room that he never reads.
