i don't really have any limits to the story it just has to have him using a sword or knife as his main weapon, he can be using it cast magic or he could just be stabbing and cutting. i honestly just love stories where he uses a blade, they didn't use the sword of gryffindor enough in the movies. complete and 60k+ words pls


** Linkffn(Deprived). Very old and abandoned, but still holds up as a decent read today.

*** I had initially dimissed this because the summary alluded to a corny, overused narrative, but the author was extremely capable in manufacturing a tense, dramatic atmosphere throughout the story, framed by a cast of vibrant, dynamic characters. Very well written indeed.

** linkffn(11930448) The Wizard and the Grimm, HP/RWBY cross. Harry wields a sword that can be combined with his modified wand to cast spells. He kills a Dementor when he casts a Patronus through it, and spells cast from his sword tend to have greater area-of-effect, especially elemental spells.

***** RWBY is a really good show in my opinion for what it is. The animation of the first volume can be a bit rough but while watching it, you have to remember that it's basically animated all by one guy. More animators and more budget have been added each volume afterwards and the show has only gotten better in my opinion. I will say it has some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen.

As for my story, I'd actually recommend reading my newer HP/RWBY crossover 'The Return of Magic' linkffn(12292532) instead. I feel like I've done a much better job on it than 'The Wizard and the Grimm' (plus that one is sort of abandoned for now). +I'm on mobile so I can't link it but you should be able to find it on my profile by clicking on the other story.+ If you decide to read it, make sure you watched Volumes 1-3 at minimum and it's probably best if you've watched 4 too.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy watching RWBY!

  After the defeat of Voldemort, life for Harry Potter hadn't gone as expected. The Auror life wasn't for him, and his relationship with Ginny had failed. Now, as an unofficial Curse-Breaker, a more skilled Harry has found himself on Remnant saving the life of a certain Atlas Specialist. With magic returning to the land, will Harry succeed where others have failed in combating Salem?

******* I know... I feel bad about that. I just lost all my inspiration for that story. I tried to get back into writing it several times without success.

I wanted a bit more conflict with Raven in the future and I wanted to set up certain circumstances for when they meet up with Oscar in the future so that's why I had that happen.

  The powers of the immortals combine in the one receiving the Prize. In the film, upon defeating the Kurgan, Connor MacLeod receives the gift of telepathy. What if he were also gifted with magic? HP/Highlander first film crossover. Not slash.
