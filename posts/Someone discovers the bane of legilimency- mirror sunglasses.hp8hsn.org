"Professor, did you know that there's this Muggle millionaire kid who provides mirrored contact lenses that are /just/ right for resisting Legilimency for some reason? I wonder what the deal is with that."

(Now I want a story where all House Elves are LEPrecon advance agents, keeping an eye on the Mud Men's sorcerers.)

**** Then it turns out that Dobby is wanted by the LEPrecon for going AWAL, as he got sick of being an agent and wanted to go off and do his own thing. If someone did a fic like this, Omake's or mini chapters featuring Dobby expertly fending off LEPrecon agents without anyone else noticing ala Perry the Platypus style is mandatory

*** I thought of linkffn(King of Serpents by karatemaster101) just then. Artemis Fowl cross, doesn't really come to its own until the summer between 1st and 2nd years. I'm sure there are others, but that's the one in my head at present.

  He was left for a Squib as a child, too smart for his own good. Now everything comes tumbling back at him, and Artemis Fowl II is thrown into the world of magic, for better or for worse. And what's this about a stone that can turn any metal into gold?... COMPLETED: SEQUEL UP

** "Why are you wearing those, Harry?" Hermione asked, inspecting his new mirrored sunglasses. They were sitting in potions class awaiting Professor Snape and his usual dour lesson.

"You'll see." He answered with a smirk, adjusting the frames. Ron was sitting at a different table, trying to listen in but he sat back when Professor Snape finally entered the classroom.

"Potter, what in Merlin's name are you wearing?" The professor asked, homing in on Harry as soon as he walked by.

"Sunglasses." Harry replied casually, as if this were something he normally did.

"Yes, I ascertained that." Snape said acidly, peering at Harry's face, "My question now is why-- ah fuck!" Everyone in the class jumped at the unexpected swear from the professor.

"Something wrong professor?" Harry asked, tone dripping with fake concern as the professor collected himself.

"... No. Nothing, Potter." Snape answered then took a step back, paused, and decided to start his lesson.

"What on earth was that?" Hermione whisper asked him. Harry smiled slyly.

"Mirrored sunglasses block legilimency." Harry told her, barely keeping his voice down. "I found out when Dumbledore picked me up from the Dursleys. Turns out he's tries to read my mind constantly."

"Oh my god." Hermione said, wide-eyed. She sat with that knowledge for a few minutes of class time before turning back to Harry. "Where can I get a pair?"

**** No, Hermione and Penelope saw the Basilisk in the mirror around the corner, so the basilisk just saw them. Like those safety mirrors at junctions sometimes, or your rearview mirrors. I'd be more worried about it going back in the sink since presumably there's mirrors there? But maybe it can just turn it off and on on command.

** This happened in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Runestone Path) where Harry made reflector sunglasses to combat the Basilisk and when Dumbledore decided to try and read his mind in that classic Albus Manipuladore way the mind probe completely reflected and multiplied the attack leaving him unconscious.

** In The rune stone path he does actually do something like this but the way it's done actually makes sense on how it would block the Legilimency. It's in chapter 9 near the end of the chapter. Let me know if this was similar to what you had envisioned.
