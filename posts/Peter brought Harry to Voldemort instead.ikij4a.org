It's an AU where Voldemort never went to Godric's Hollow cuz peter brought Harry to him instead so Lily and James are alive. Voldemort decides to keep Harry not kill him, and he grew up with the title ‚Äúdark prince‚Äù and called Voldemort father. And then on a mission he gets captured by the order. The potters have a younger son called Damien. It has two sequels, the second one with cross dimensional travel, but I cannot remember it's name at all fir some reason.

***** Is it good, if you read it now? I read the first few chapters recently, thinking it was good, but it was really ridiculous, Harry was so powerful and Voldemort, Bellatrix, Lucius and Draco all love him. He also ninja stars, but by that I stopped reading.

****** Yeah it is, but I liked the third part more. In that this Harry takes the place of original Harry.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][Here]] is the link if you still need it. The bot does not seem to be working.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5957714/1/The-Darkness-Within-The-Rewrite][Here]] is the rewrite in case you were reading that.

**** I did not finish the rewrite but it is about 3 times longer than the original because the author felt that they had rushed it a bit.
