Hey guys,

Are there any good believable harems where each girl is equally represented? or any harems that is good in general? I'm really digging the harem genre for some reasons, especially since I feel like I've read all the dark and independent Harry "type" of stories.

Thanks!


** Well, if you haven't read it yet, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11071872/1/Witches-of-Westfield][Witches of Westfield]] looks pretty decent so far. It's a work in progress, but its definitely setting up a harem and reading it is like watching a slow motion train wreck because Harry has no idea that he's getting harem-ed.

*** I really, really want there to be negative consequences of the girls dumping this on him. He's the textbook example of an abused child, was a soldier in a war at 17, and is facing huge life decisions with no family to back him up. I want him to absolutely cave when he finds out about the impending harem. Something in his mind just goes "they all love me but I can only love one of them therefore most of them will hate me [and/or] I'm not good enough" and that is the absolute most horrific thought he's ever had, and he has a complete meltdown. Of course, I've worked with children with Down Syndrome, one with severe non-autism/abuse related anxiety, abused kids, and many with Autism Spectrum Disorders, and you really can't put those types of meltdowns into words and properly convey the visuals or emotions. Even adult PTSD episodes are hard to describe. Still, 98% of harem stories end with "oh alright, this will do." and happy-ever-afters. Boo, I say, boo.

TBH, I like a happily-ever-after. I just think it's supposed to comeat the end - and most romance fics start in the "perfect relationship" phase.

***** My point was not that I don't want it to ever be a happily-ever-after, I just meant that it generally goes "Oh shit, I guess I have a harem." directly to the happily ever after with the only hiccups being a couple well placed right hooks to Ron, Dumbledore, and Rita Skeeter. Never any signs of regret or jealousy or disagreements. Most of them just write all of that off by involving some sort of bond where those feelings are magically prevented or contract where they're legally forced to give up those feelings. The Stockholm Syndrome is kind of icky. Plus they almost always wind up with all of the girls being perfectly okay having sex with each other or being in bed with the boy while they're having sex with another girl. That's kinda demeaning.

The only one that didn't have those that I can think of off the top of my head isn't even a "harem" as its only two: Heart and Soul by Sillimaure.

** The Firebird Trilogy features a harem. It might not exactly fit your meaning, though, as it is a forced harem due to the unique culture presented in the story and just about no one is happy to be a part of it, including Harry. Great story, though.

** linkffn(The Accidental Bond) has some problems but does have each of the people involved characterized somewhat. Everyone has their own goals. However, it involves Gabrielle Delacoeur as a member of the harem (holy age gap Batman) and it has soul bonds (which are kept vague and pretty much just establish a fast rapport between the members).

**** Ymmv with this story, the set up is extraordinarily weak, with the author literally using divine intervention anytime anyone questions the harem. Hermione and Daphne also completely lose their characters and just become Harry's yes-women very quickly. Harry also is in complete control of his life, including giving massive long speeches to wizards about how terrible they all are. Personally I found the story painfully weak and disappointing, but give it a shot.
