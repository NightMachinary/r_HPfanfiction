Im looking for fics where Harry somehow ends up in our world, possibly finds out that we know of him because to us he is a fictional person?

Or other possible worlds where magic is unknown/harry is only person capable of magic.

Please no crossovers or slash


** Yes, and he gets together with Emma!

*** Alternatively...

The MILF - Helena Bonham Carter.

The carefree blonde - Evanna Lynch

The traumatizer - Maggie Smith

The unknown actresses - Amber and Ruby Evans

I can feel the wheels turning in my head!

**** It would be fucking hilarious if Harry fell for Helena.

Wait, wasn't Helen(a) of Troy the mother of Hermione?

***** The name of Hermione's mother was never given.

But seriously though, I think Harry and Helena are a pretty decent match actually, if my understanding of the real Helena is correct.

I'd try writing a story with the pairing for shits and giggles if I wasn't writing the first chapter of my current one as I type this.
