I have been reading this fic and really enjoying it. Im at around chapter 73 and I decided to finaly search up what the adjective Cadmean means. Turns out it means to win but for it to lead to your ruin. Im assuming this means Harry will lose a lot and I really dont want to see some of the characters die so I havent been able to carry on because I just dont want those characters to ever leave.


** Is your curiosity going to haunt you? Won't you just want to know how it ends? I won't lie, I've left stories before when I've not been happy with the direction the story goes in but do you think you won't be plagued by wondering what happens. I'm not sure you'd enjoy how it ends. I didn't particularly like how it ends, then again I'm not a huge fan of that story at all.

*** Have you read "A taste of ismenian water" by the same author? It is most illuminating and helps explain the ending.

**** Its not that I didn't understand the ending. The whole story was a bit of a mess. A reasonably entertaining mess but I don't think it stands out as much more than a 3/5.

*** oh no, my curiosity will definitely plague me. I also dont dissagree with the direction its taking. I understand and love it, its just hard to go on. No dissapointments so far though.

** There's also the fact that it could be Cadmean as in Cadmus Peverell.

** It is true that he will lose a lot, but it won't be in vain. It is sad but entirely worth it. This fic is unique in that wgen do finally get to the end you have no idea what could happen and then you read it and realize it couldn't have happened any other way. It is incredible and my favourite fic of all time.

Finish it. It is worth the pain.

** I stopped reading 1984 half-way through because I didn't have the heart to read the depressing second act, so honestly..

** As you are someone who has got that far, I have to ask is it worthwhile? The opening with the mention of 'the golden trio', followed by a veritable storm of tropes and assurances that this is going in a new direction have really put me off.

*** I just finished it and I have to say it is definitely worthwhile. The golden trio stuff gets dropped incredibly early and Im a huge fan of the story.

**** Thank you. I will persevere then. I have got up to chapter 18 and I think I'll continue, if only to finish it, though I have to admit I think it might not quite be the sort of fic I am inclined to like.
