** Do you mean slash or do you mean a horrible manipulative relationship where Tom controls Harry?

It can be both if you want.

**** Well Quillbreaker writes REALLY creepy tom/harry that probably is best saved for the most tolerant. Heavy tolerance level required.

I've forgotten the name of another, but it was a pretty cool one where Tom managed to escape from the diary and kidnap Harry, and take him from Hogwarts. In it, all I remember is Harry being extremely defiant, Tom discovering that Harry's a horcrux, and a spell that Tom puts on Harry as a punishment that takes away all senses so you are just in an oblivion like state.

There was another story - Butterfly Heart I think the name was? Where Harry's an auror and Tom's a serial killer, except when he's not killing he's a world known psychologist, and more specifically, Harry's psychologist.

Personally, I have a medium tolerance level.
