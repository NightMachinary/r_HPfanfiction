** I've started planning a Harry/Carrow Twins fic for my first story. I'm still working on characterization and plot points, but I'm torn between more fluff or more exploring character traumas and healing from them.

** I'm currently writing my first Harry/Fleur fanfic named */Flowerpot One: A Harry and Fleur Tale/* which takes place during the Triwizard Tournament. To make a short summary:

/Harry is seventeen and has a fourteen-years-old sister named Emma. Harry is chosen as the Hogwarts Champion. He has dreams of winning the Tournament but those dreams all come crashing down when Emma enter the chamber. Realising that his sister got entered in the Tournament against he will, Harry abandon his dreams of winning the Tournament in favour of helping Emma go through it unscathed. Meanwhile, Fleur witness their exchange. She admire what Harry is doing and decide to offer her help as well. While going through the Tournament as Champions and helping Emma, Harry and Fleur get closer and fall for the other./

That's the basic plot of the story. I've only written about half of it (I expect it to be between 20k and 30k words, maybe 40k). It's a fluffy romance between the two and a humour fanfiction as well. It feature a BigBrother!Harry (with traits of James Potter) and Emma, who I wrote as a Fem!Harry (with traits of Lily Evans) who grew-up with an overprotective big brother. Harry also has his own type of Marauder friends group (who all help Emma as well.) The fic also feature some side romance between Emma and Hermione, her best friend.

I originally started writing this fic for the Emily Collection for the Harry and Fleur discord server but I got sidetracked with two of my other fanfictions which I was writing at the same time (*/Forsaken Friend: Dominion/* and */The Potter Broom Company/*). I would post a link to the fanfiction but it hasn't been released yet (Since it's rather short, I want it to be done before posting it).

My goals are to have the fanfic finished in a week or two. Hopefully I will but since I'm rather lazy (and is the type of person who loose interest quickly in a project and have to switch to another one), it might not be finished by then xD

  Harry Potter had always been interested in learning how vehicles such as cars, trains, ships and planes worked. When Harry discovered the Wizarding World, that passion transferred to flying broomsticks. While looking at the library, Harry discovered a book teaching the readers how to make enchant a flying broomstick. And thus, the Potter Mark I was born. Broommaker!Harry

** I am very new, to this community and also to fanfic writing. My very first WIP will cover the life of Muggle Studies teacher Charity Burbage during her years on Hogwarts. There will be a slow romance with Professor Sinistra, the friendship with Snape explained and, sadly, a tragic ending. But right now I am at the very beginning, published three chapters so far and am glad for every reader and every bit of feedback.

I posted on here earlier talking about potential Head Girl/Boy options and it ended up being a really productive conversation, I ended up adding in a whole other section because of it. Other than that, I've never written from so many POV's before, I don't know how authors manage more than a couple!

**** Haha really? We might write differently then! When I write from one POV it takes me a while to settle into their headspace, like if I can't think like them I can't write like them.

I was writing from Lavender's which was difficult because she doesn't have a ton of character development in canon (same with Ginny). Then Draco (who's much easier), Riddle, then Harry. Always worried I'm just going through the motions with Harry!

How do you think of it when you're writing?

I suppose in some ways it's a bit of a reaction to canon because Harry's POV is so hilariously limited that I'm like, ‘but I want to know what everyone else thinks and observes too!'

** Hello fellow writers!

So, around Halloween last year I wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13739888/1/A-Grim-Tale-of-Brothers-Pumpkins-and-Giants][A Grim Tale of Brothers, Pumpkins and Giants]] linkffn(13739888). It was kind of a one-shot, but I liked the concept of what happened to Sirius/Padfoot and recently got inspired for some of what happens next. By that I mean, I've bashed out 11,000 words, which I think I would split in two. We explore magical Vienna, religion, dealing with loss and grief, the concept of family, forgiveness, redemption and strange magic... and then we leave Vienna too, but more on that below. Unlike the previous chapter, it is not in the least bit action oriented, but contains plenty of horrid and violent moments. If possible, I'd be really grateful if someone or someones could beta and help me to:

- Identify what is good and what is boring/pointless

- Fix grammar, spelling, dialog to appear more natural/vivid perhaps?

- Find gaps or areas which lack description because the story is in my own head, and I may have skipped over important details for it all to make sense to you.

- Help me figure out how best to deal with people speaking a foreign language, and how to show it without it being one of those stupid Jabba the Hutt moments where you are exposed to a stream of nonsense, and some other character has to repeat in English.

- Come up with a title for these two chapters

- Give me their opinion on whether the second setting is appropriate and handled with sufficient respect/dignity. To put it bluntly, they visit Mauthausen, a terrible concentration camp in Austria, and meet some ghosts, and I tell or describe stories of what happened there, /in real life/. As an Austrian, I've never gotten over my visits to the place, knowing that my family - especially if you count more distant relatives - was involved, even if indirectly. It is a disgusting part of our history, but it is THERE. I am not taking this lightly, but perhaps I am miscalculating spectacularly.

I guess I'd share it with anyone who volunteers by email or google doc. Thanks you very much!

** I'm still writing the prequel to my WIP crack fic, here's a snippet.

​

“Rattlesnake, I won't even ask you to surrender because we all know you ain't doin' that.” The older of the two Marshals said.

“Well, come on then.” Rattlesnake said with a cruel smirk.

The two Marshal's hands shot towards their guns; they didn't even get close. As in the space of one picosecond, Rattlesnake drew both his Colt Walkers and pulled their triggers. The two Marshals fell like a marionette with its strings cut, blood running freely from the holes in their heads.

** I'm up to my tenth chapter in my Tom-raises-Harry fic, after only about a month, which feels incredible. I never anticipated how much I would enjoy writing a very domestic Voldemort, nor how much I would be dreading having to introduce complications for his hard-earned family. I think the second story arc will be upon us soon... Anyway, if you want to read about Tom Riddle cleaning a toilet bowl and mowing lawns and pretending like his time as Voldemort will never haunt him, I have over 50k words to that effect. ;)

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1-3

** Still writing year four of my female Harry guardian Snape series. I have one chapter left. I was surprised at how difficult it was to write Snape while he was heartbroken, even though it was only for a short time. I have also written 225k words in the past four months and after I finish this final chapter I am taking a break for about two weeks while I outline year five. I've come to the realization that I'm probably going to be spending the next two years writing this series (it's been ten months so far) and that's a little daunting. One fic at a time, I suppose.

Here's the link to the first fic in the series if anyone is interested. It's also on ffn if you prefer to read there.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  "Maybe this is why Slytherins shouldn't try and be noble. We're just not good at it." Harry and Daphne were meant to be married due to a contract; she let him go and dealt with the consequences on her own. Five years later, he learned what those consequences were and is determined to help her.

  Hugo Weasley, a soldier under the pseudonym Loki, lived, so to speak in a state of war, a quiet life. This changes when he is sent on a mission to Hogwarts. Loki looked impassively at the face of the rebel pressed against the wall. He is not sure why at this point he did not cast a killing curse or stabbed a dagger into the body of the man in front of him. Maybe it was because the boy reminded him of characters from his former life. Perhaps these are the last remnants of thirteen-year-old Hugo Weasley, a Slytherin with great ambition who would do anything for a person important to him.Maybe it wasn't any of those reasons. The fact remained that the young man was still trying to get away.

** I'm working on /The Fragile House of Black/, which will eventually be a Remus/Sirius, Regulus lives, fix-it series. Before I can get to that story, though, I have to write out so much backstory so you can understand what's going on. There's a LOT of Black family drama, and my goal is to make you at least like most of the Blacks, even though they aren't good or nice people.

If you want to read it, I recommend skipping the first story and coming back to it. The series is in chronological order, but it doesn't have to be read in that order.

LinkAO3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2265983]])

Here's an excerpt from an upcoming story in the series:

#+begin_quote
  They warned her that Sirius Black would break her heart.

  Effie's knitting circle thrived on the latest gossip from Godric's Hollow. The adventures of her Jamie and his Hogwarts posse always brought gasps and laughter. Some of the girls thought he was quite good fun (and they had granddaughters, Effie, if he ever took his eye off that Lily Evans), while others thought he was a terribly naughty boy. Effie took it all in stride. Her Jamie had a heart of gold, she knew, and while he was exuberant, he never aimed to /hurt/ anyone.

  Sirius Black, though, now /he/ was the true danger. At least according to her knitting circle.

  Oh, sure, the stitch witches would always lean in whenever Effie announced that Sirius was staying with them for a few days, their needles clicking away as they learned about the latest explosion or mischief to come from her boys, but they always warned her the same thing at the end of their time together.

  /Sirius Black will break your heart./

  He was, after all, a /Black./ It didn't matter how young he was, or how sweet he was. All Blacks were Dark wizards. The darkness ran through their veins. No matter how cherubic they were in their youth, all Blacks were dark wizards. It was only a matter of time before Sirius, like the rest of his family before him, revealed his true, evil nature.

  Effie smiled at her girls, and she thanked them, and she put aside their warnings and went home to her husband and her two sons.

  Of course Sirius would break her heart. He already had.

  He broke her heart the very first time he showed up on her doorstep, his jaw too tight, arms awkward in their hug. He broke her heart when he clutched at her back in the middle of the night, silently begging to never have to go home. He broke her heart when he crept down for breakfast with half his face nearly as dark as his name and a twist of fear in his shattered eyes.

  And he broke her heart when he leaned against her knee like he did now, asking her questions he didn't really mean, edging around the true weight on his mind.

  Effie's book had been set aside long ago, her fingers busy instead with carding through his shaggy hair. She indulged herself with watching him watch the fire, her newest son, her sweetheart. Sirius' arm was curled around her calves and his weight was warm against her leg. He was asking her questions about her youth, about Monty, about how they met and courted and married.

  Sirius wasn't actually asking about Monty. This was how he broached topics he was scared of. Nothing was ever about /him/, until it was. It couldn't hurt if he wasn't asking about himself. If he asked what would happen whenever James got in trouble as a boy (really, it was hardly anything, Effie was far too indulgent, and Monty frequently said a ruined prank was punishment enough), or how Effie's parents behaved (they were strict but loving, making sure she grew up fully capable of providing for herself and helping her find a match that ensured she would never truly need to), he was actually trying to measure up his own experiences to hers, to find the places where the Blacks strayed so far from normality that he was right to be upset.

  Sirius broke her heart every time he touched on the horrific abuse he had endured at the hands of his family. Effie had never imagined herself having an archnemesis until she had learned of just /some/ of the evils of Walburga Black. If /any/ woman deserved to have the title of ‘mother' stripped from her, it was that /harridan/.

  For all his family's reputation, and all that they had raised him his first fifteen years, Sirius Black was a good boy. He was kind, and loyal, and loving, just like her Jamie. But tonight, Effie could already tell, tonight would be a night where he broke her heart.

#+begin_quote
  This fic is dark. It does not need to be read to understand the rest of the series, but it adds more color to the history of the Black Family. It is first in this series because of its chronological placement, but feel free to skip and come back (or never come back at all).

  Sirius Phineas Black was the Head of the Black Family from 1925 to 1952. During those 27 years, he terrorized nearly every member of the Family and drove them to a deeper insanity than they'd had before. Alphard Black had a particular hatred for his great-uncle Sirius. This is just the start of why.

  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead - or worse - until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a certain dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a jokester metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.

** I am currently finishing the 5th chapter of my very first official fanfic called /Carly Potter and The Serpent's Spy/! The time setting will be from PS-GoF. This is the short description:

/❝Trust no one, not even our closest friends❞/

​

/It all started when Carly, twin sister of the famous Harry Potter, received a letter from a gigantic man stating that she and her brother will attend a magic school for witches and wizards called Hogwarts, their parents apparently attended this school. As Carly adjusted in the magical school, she became a magical prodigy. In her very first year, things have gone unusual, even for wizarding standards. An unknown student slipped up and spilled information about 'getting to know the Potters more' and that unknown student called themselves 'The Serpent's Spy'. Carly teams up with her trustworthy new friends, Ophelia and Victoria, to catch this spy to protect Harry, no matter what it takes, like getting killed, or worse, expelled./

​

/But was Harry really the target victim?/

​

I will be posting the very first chapter tomorrow (Fun fact: May 2 is when the battle of Hogwarts ended so 'I open at the close') on my Wattpad account [[https://www.wattpad.com/user/moonyxme][moonyxme]]. This will be a duology and I'm planning to finish both of them by next year (+probably not since I'm lazy as frick+)

Ps: I'm working on my fanfiction.net and fictionpress account cuz I'm new there. I will update things here and in my insta account too. I am a new writer so feel free to give me advice and feedback. Thank you!

** Harry Potter and The Lost Child - Chapter 12 out now!

*Excerpt*

The bell dinged as the door opened and two tall blond figures walked in. Albus recognised his best mate from school immediately -- the tall, balding man next to him must be his father then, Draco Malfoy. Albus' own father never spoke much about him despite them having gone to Hogwarts together. Regardless, it was quite a well-known fact that the two, though cordial these days, did not get along during their time at Hogwarts. Scorpius' dad was a notorious ex-Death Eater and though he, along with his family, did abandon Voldemort's cause before his downfall the Malfoys were now shunned in almost all wizarding circles. They were still quite wealthy enough to subsist off their fortunes and properties for the rest of their lives of course, but they nevertheless lived a very private and secluded life.

*Check it out:*

For the past couple of months, I've been working on a fix of the (in my opinion) less than great Cursed Child. I guess I just wanted to give these characters the sequel they deserve. This is a second/next generation canon-compliant (though not with CC obviously) continuation of the series I love so much.

You can find it here:

[[https://href.li/?https://archiveofourown.org/works/30081021/chapters/74086224][https://archiveofourown.org/works/30081021/chapters/74086224]]

and here:

[[https://href.li/?https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child]]

This story is meant to provide an alternative for people who would like to know ‘what happened after the story' and would rather not bother with the hot mess that is CC (again my opinion).

General summary: no Delphi, VERY canon-compliant (except for CC of course), the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

Reviews/kudos/comments/suggestions/insults are always welcome! 

Doing a new chapter every other week bc I'm SUPER busy but I will probably start writing one per week once I'm done with my studies.

** I'm working on the 10th chapter of my first fiction ever, the pairing is SS/HG, though they are in the process of getting a divorce. It focuses on the family as a whole and them as a couple while going through the breakup. I throw some flashbacks here and there, to show their past and how they came to be, but the main plot happens in their current time and is still under development. Though I've only published 9 chapters so far, most of them are relatively long and thus contains a lot of scenes just so the readers could feel satisfied each time I update. That being said, it does take some time for me to finish one chapter, and a little feedback goes a long way of encouraging me to continue working on it :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13308095/1/Unbroken-Ties]]

** I'm writing WIP (Currently 120K+ & writing chpt 21) Severitus fic called “The Gifted Apprentice.” It's a mentor/adoption fic set in Harry's 2nd year. It's kind of a slow burn on the fluff and is a bit more angsty. Snape flavor isn't overly cruel but definitely super strict & very old-fashioned and definitely neurotic and over-protective but he's super devoted to Harry and he is learning how to give small amounts of praise and affection, but it's a slow burn to fluff (although it's there!).

Also this was my first fic so the first few chapters are a little rough but if you skim through those it picks up quickly. I think.

  With a marrige on the rocks, and a political career that cannot seem to make any progress in the dual causes of freedom and equality, Hermione gets an offer that she cannot refuse. A dramione story like none other.

** Title: Forged in Fire --- The Last Vixen Saga --- A Harry Potter Fan Fiction

Forged in Fire

Summary:

Aisha Sow was born into chaos. With part-time Auror, part-time genius parents, the world expected great things from her. She dedicated her childhood to training and studying, hoping one day to end up in the hall of fame and make her parents proud. But when her name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, her metaphorical battles become a lot more real. As she navigates ancient magic that should put her on top and complicated relationships with a certain redhead, she'll soon find that the type of power that she's after is often forged in fire.

Aisha Sow is an American witch attending Hogwarts. She was fully prepared to spend her Hogwarts years on studying and relationship drama. She was always close with Hermione, Harry, and Ron but her course changes when ancient magic thrusts her into the ring with Harry Potter. She is quickly swept into his world, not the Wizarding World, but rather Harry's world - the world of unlikely heroes. Harry Potter may be the 'Chosen One,' but he is far from in this fight alone.

It has the same title on AO3

** Not writing, so much as I've been trying to cut down some fics I know won't ever be finished in mutichapter form, but reformat some of the darlings into a one shot so they'll see the light of day. Esp because there is never enough Regulus Black content, frankly.

I'm in a bit of a frustrated stall-out with most of my stories, so this has been good to keep my hand in and actually have something to post

  A fic the author wrote when she was feeling particularly awful and wished desperately that there was a magical ritual that would take away her chronic condition and allow her to live Or, Regulus Black has a terrible magical genetic disorder and makes friends with a muggleborn so that he can learn science!
