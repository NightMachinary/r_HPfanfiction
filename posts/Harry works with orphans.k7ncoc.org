Maybe he owns an orphanage, or maybe he works at a Hospital or something that deals with him working with orphans.

Can be a main or minor part of the story.

Anyone can be the main character/can be any site/any length/old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes

No Weasley Bashing. No Ginny giving Harry a love potion, no Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune cliche.

Am fine with self promotions as long as they fit what I'm looking for.

** “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124) was the first fanfiction story, which persuaded me that it could be worthy to read amateur written writings. And among other things, Harry sponsors an orphanage for war orphans.

  Why would Potter send him potions ingredients, much less these ones? And then to refuse to explain himself --- that, Severus would NOT allow.

** Canon Harry is simply not proactive enough to actually put in all of the effort and planning required for such an institution. There are plenty of fics in which Harry adopts a orphan he comes across but none I have seen in which he opens or works in an orphanage.

Linkffn(To Be Slytherin) has Harry's Slytherin twin sister opening and running the Riddle Magical Orphanage in the epilouge-arc in remembrance of the person Tom Riddle could have been.

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC

*** This is fiction though, I don't get why people do this? "Oh this would never happen because of x?" It's fiction, it can happen, for various reasons you give it.

**** It's a bit farfetched? Post-Hogwarts fics that deviate from "Harry gets together with X follows cool profession Y and has a happy family Z" are very uncommon is all. Nevertheless Linkffn(Dudley's Memories) has Harry fostering a orphan and Hermione managing a system of magical orphans.

Linkao3(crawlersout) Harry fosters child Riddle.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
