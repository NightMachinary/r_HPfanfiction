I've been hunting for a fic where someone brings some DnD books to Hogwarts.

The main points I recall are Dumbledore wanting to hunt down "the wizards of the coast" for breaking the statute of secrecy and wondering why he was only a 16 or so on their level scale.

****** The aftermath of unballanced electromagnetic charges affecting the universe is even worse than what he immagined :

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_black_hole]]

To put it into prospective , 200g of PURE positrons (positive charge) would create an electromagnetic field powerfull enought to rip out all the stars in a 500 Light Years radius.

D&D magic is scary.
