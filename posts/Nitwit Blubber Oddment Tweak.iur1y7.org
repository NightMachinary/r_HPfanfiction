What are some good fics that work those words into the story? I know Prince of Slytherin has them as the names of the elves in charge of each house, and I /vaguely/ recall a few years ago reading a fem!Harry fic where they were connected to the Deathly Hallows somehow but I can't remember any of the details beyond that. Any others you can recommend?

The story Umbrage Shade or something like that has the same idea I think.

** There's was a fic which I forgot what that explains the meaning behind the words.

Ravenclaws r known as nitwit.

Gryffindor as Blubber I think.

Oddments was Hufflepuff maybe.

Tweak is slytherin probs.

The meaning of each word represent a word used to describe each house. Ravenclaw is known for their knowledge n thus the word is “nitwit”

** I always saw it as a description of what Hogwarts hoped to accomplish with each student.

You start out an idiot, they remove the fatty waste, and with the leftovers, make something great.

A Nitwit that gets de-Blubbered is left as an Oddment that needs to be Tweaked.

** Linkffn(11191235)

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin

This fic has that trope that these are the names of the head elves for the 4 houses.

Nitwit for the Eagles

Blubber for the Lions

Oddoment for the Badgers

Tweak for the Snakes

Though it is mentioned once or twice and then not again. Great fic, endless detail, regular updates.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Care to guess its significance? There's none. And to further please our whimsy, alas, earwax! :) I like Dumbledore just being an oddball. I bet young Dumbledore was really funny at hogwarts!

** [[https://www.hogwartsprofessor.com/nitwit-blubber-oddment-tweak-four-words-for-other/][Canon.]] It may be somewhat of a stretch, but I think it's a good take.

*** I don't think they quite got it right. My take:

A nitwit is something a Ravenclaw would not want to be seen as.

To blubber (or cry) is something a Gryffindor would not want to do (or to be seen doing). Not crying seems more relevant to being brave than not being fat (but I guess it could be both).

An oddment (or leftover) is something a Hufflepuff would not want to be seen as (despite the Sorting Hat's song that they are literally the leftovers).

To be tweaked (or controlled) is comething a Slytherin would not want to be (they want to be the ones tweaking others).
