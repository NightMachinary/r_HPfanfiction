** "Today we will welcome Harry James Potter to our Hogwarts school of Ghosts and Poltergeists. After heated debate we have decided that getting hit by the Killing Curse qualifies one for our prestigious institution even if one survives. Welcome our school's first alive student with a huge round of applause."

Harry hadn't expected to be invited to a ghost school. He certainly had not expected for a ghost to pop into his cupboard to invite him. He nearly had a heart attack when the ghost had appeared. Uncle Vernon did have a heart attack when he saw the ghost. It did not help that the ghost was covered in blood. He gulped and stepped forward and stood before four ghosts. One was a tall man with broad shoulders whose beard and hair looked faintly like the mane of a Lion and a sword strapped to his waist. The other was a thin and short man who had a long thin beard that almost reached the ground. He wore a locket around his next and was glaring at him.

The other two were women. One was a tall women who held a book in her head and he could help but gulp at her intimidating stare. "She must have been really pretty when she was alive" he thought absently as he turned to the last person of the group. She was a plump women. She would have reminded him of Aunt Marge if not for the warm smile on her face. She looked really kind and was the first one to speak. "Welcome young one. We are here to determine in which house you fit in. We have never had to sort a person who was alive but we are sure we will find a place for you." she said in a pleasant voice. He was sure he heard a scoff filled with derision from the short man.

His suspicions were confirmed when the man opened his mouth and said; "You three can decide if you want to have him. I will not have this.. abomination in my house." He got a feeling that the insult was going to have been worse had the tall man not put his hand on the sword as a warning. "If that is what you wish Salazar then so be it. Leave before you taint this auspicious day with your foul mouth any further." The man looked about to protest but the tall man starting to unsheathe his sword and the tall lady sending a sharp glare his way stilled him and made him leave. The smile on the kind looking women's face never wavered.

"Let's begin, shall we."

** "Tell us a bit about your self,Mr.Potter." said the ghost professor with the large hatchet still embedded in his forehead

"Well.." stuttered Harry. The classroom was cold and the other ghosts-his classmates stared at him expectedly .

"My parents were both killed by You-Who-Who when I was a baby." A few of the teenage ghosts made noises of sadness although one girl could be heard muttering something about the plague wiping out her village

"I had to go live with my awful aunt and uncle. They spoiled my cousin and I didn't get very much of anything." sighed Harry

"Oh. BOO-HOO." jeered a boy wearing pantaloons and an old fashion hat. "You didn't get as big an ice-cream cone as your cousin . It's funny because when I showed MY uncle my magic,he had me burned as a heretic !!!"

Harry blinked in shock at the outburst before continuing "People my own age thought I was a freak because of what I could do."

"I understand completely." said a girl in Puritan clothing "By the way,your NECK is looking lovely today."

Harry shuddered under the icy glares being sent his way. "Eventually a letter came down the chimney that Ron over there delivered ." The chimney sweep ghost blushed as much as a ghost could

"Now I'm here,I guess." stammered Harry as mutters of "privilege" were sent his way.

The professor's eyes narrowed "Mr.Potter.I'll be keeping an eye on your behaviour."

In the back of the class,a ghost girl with no eyes fumed

** A man in his late sixties dressed in a rumpled suit was sitting across from an excited man in his late thirties frowning at the pubs menu. “Explain to me what we are doing in Perth Mr. Harvey . “ The elder man stated seeming a little put out. He held up a hand to stop the younger man who had smiled widely at the question, and turned to a passing waitress ordering a pint and a basket of crisps. After placing his order he turned his attention back to the younger man. Harvey, who wore a grey cardigan and had neatly brushed hair didn't seem at all put off by his companions frown. Smiling widely he adjusted his glasses and began to speak . “ James please, and trust me it's worth your while Dr. Stantz. I'm sure you know there have always been rumors that the old Rannoch school was haunted , and the results were wildly inconsistent. I wasn't sure it would come to anything but few years ago I dropped by to investigate the old loch farming village.

“Yes I saw your paper on that, a prime example of a time capsule apparition town, yes? An old farming village , the whole place wiped out by a swine disease. If I recall it was only notable in that your medium reported the apparitions renamed their town hogsmede before continuing their fixed motion cycles “

“ yes yes charming place , but listen before I left the area I stopped by Rannoch, old Argus Filch lives there you know? Retired from his Oxford position as head of the Medium department and went off grid. It seemed a little odd but he had always been talking about how he missed interacting with the capricious spectres not just studying them. What Is going on there is amazing! Unprecedented ! It could totally change our understanding off how the non corporeal behave outside of fixed looped systems and how these spectres can interact despite time periods of death ”

“So you mentioned in the voicemail. And letter. And email. Though you've been very reticent sharing any evidence”

“ You've got to understand Dr. Stantz this is years worth it research and the findings are unique ! I can't just email that over, what if someone got their hands on it before I publish. Trust me I have evidence. Here, look at these readouts. Do you see anything odd with the data “

“It seems to be high level static readings, not really that different then the readouts others have got from Rannoch and not that inconsistent with such an old place with so many residents who have died . “

Dr. Ray Stantz set down the readouts as the waitress came by with his food, seemingly uninterested.

Harvey's smile only grew. “Yes and so it was Dr. Stantz, for the three weeks I was there. Until one day mid morning the readouts dropped to nearly non existent, look here. “

D. Stantz wiped his fingers absently on his pant leg before flipping between the first and second page of data. He frowned slightly flipping between the two pages. “How “ he mumbled before glancing back at James Harvey. Did you check your calibration ? Did the electrometer die ?

“That's the first thing I thought but the equipment was in perfect working order! “ James Harvey assured , his ever present grin growing. When Dr. Stantz opened his mouth to continue on his train of enquiry Mr. Harvey quickly continued. “ Believe me I checked the equipment , brought out my spare , recalibrated the spectrometer . Nothing. So I got to taking with Filch. You know his corporeal age theory right ? “

Dr. Stantz nodded his head while speaking . “Yes, of course. Those juvenile spectres when fitting in the Capricious designation will spontaneously age and occasionally cross over at unpredictable time frames and intervals. I'm not here to review basic paranormal theorem Mr. Harvey”

“ Yes well Filch first got that theory from Rannoch, but what he didn't mention at the time was that a lot of the spectres in Rannoch didn't die there ! It's a school”

“Of course it was a school”

“No Dr. Stantz I mean it's literally a school for spectre children !

*** 1m\\
Every year readouts drop out at June and reappear in September . I've got 3 years of data, multiple testimonial from the mediums , though they aren't certified, who live in Rannoch. And I can track multiple childhood spectres In England and Scotland vanishing and reappearing from their haunts on that same schedule, all of those are confirmed by various board certified mediums. “

Stantz had stopped eating and was now intently listening. James gesticulated wildly as he spoke and when he finished speaking Ray once again began pouring over the readouts

“I don't understand how it's possible that this could have been missed. You realize Harvey how far fetched this sounds, right? The Paranormal was inducted into the hard sciences nearly two hundred years ago. We began to categorize the difference between fixed loop apparitions and capricious spectres before we had even officially became a science. Now your telling me that no one noticed all of the juvenile capricious spectres disappearing and reappearing at fixed intervals “

“It's not all of them! There are only about 280 or so, all from different areas in and around the English and Scottish areas. And they aren't from any particular time set. There are a lot of the Victorian era spectres but at least a few handfuls of more modern ones as well! I haven't worked out how or why but I've got a few theories and corroborated data . I have even tracked the Longbottom boy there !”

Stantz looked shocked . “Are you sure ?”

“Entirely ! “ Harvey stated with conviction. “ Amelia Bones out of Cambridge wrote her thesis on interspectre relations. She used the Longbottoms as a case study for family relations in the spectre world. You know elder spectre is actually 90 something years removed from the Lonbottom boy ? She died of old age in 1839 and most people put his murder somewhere in the late 1920s or early 1930s, though his uncle never did confess to anything other then accidentally dropping him out that window,. He wasn't caught until they found the body decades later. “

“As fascinating as that is how does this tie in to Rannoch”

“Oh of course! Well Amelia was trying to study them, multiple observations have made it clear that old lady Longbottom believes Neville Longbottom to be her sons only child, and the Longbottom boy allegedly calls her Gradmother. But she's got seven or so years of data showing he only appears during the summer months.”

“I see. Well, it's just the beginning but it is some pretty interesting research” Dr. Stantz began. His mind was racing, trying to recall any other cases that had similar appearance routines .

“That's just where I started Dr. Stantz! Ben Blood ended up in Rannoch with that annoying assistant of his Peeves , you know the youtuber?”

Stantz cringed noticeably at Peeves name but nodded all the same.

“ I got to talking with him as he has got his own research going on, and he pointed me in the direction of the Malfoy Murders. Victorian era ghosts, haunting the Malfoy Mansion. The family keeps trying to Exorcise them because the man has killed a bunch of their race horses. Blood thinks he recognized the juvenile spectre in Rannoch .The data seemed a little confused because of how similar the spectres all look but we can say definitively that the juvenile rarely shows up at the Manor except summers and the occasional Yule. While looking into those I ran into Lovegood, he's been looking for his daughters spectre for years. Nothing worse then a medium with a confirmed spectre loved one. Always bad all around, but he told me of the Weasley clan near his office You know one of the original evidences for the corporeal age theory? All of those infant deaths and then the wife went out in childbirth, the husband died from electrocution when trying to install one of the first telegraph systems. Once the juvenile spectres started taking on older ages they began to appear less and less, yet those with the younger appearances still showed up pretty regularly .

“Well I must say while circumstantial it is pretty compelling, those are all much older ghosts though” Stantz pointed out with a considering frown.

“I haven't even gotten to my best cases. “ Harvey insisted!

**** “I haven't even gotten to my best cases. “ Harvey insisted!

“Ive got one spectre that died not even five years ago! That granger girl, you know the one whose disappearance was all over the news . Went missing walking home from school and her spectre showed up a week later at home and then more regularly the public library. It's well documented she only shows up June- September since a year after her death. Rowena Grey lost her certification because she insists on playing up the spooky medium stereotype. But her daughter Myrtle is homeschooling , got expelled or something but is a confirmed medium though not yet old enough to certify. Well young Myrtle has been living at Rannoch with Grey and is insistent the granger girl is there. Poor girl complained for an hour that anytime she cried or was lonely the granger girl would show up and be a quote “insensitive know it all bookworm “ .

Stantz began looking over the case study write ups Harvey had piled in front of him “ One case doesn't really show a pattern of modern Interaction “

“I've actually got another juvenile and adult spectre in a related case that both show up in Rannoch. It was the Godric hollow murder suicide. Childhood sweethearts , have a baby at 16. At 18 the young man, Snape, had a psychotic break when he became convinced the girl Evans was sleeping with the Debby Pottery heir. He ended up killing Evans and their baby then himself. Filch recognized the spectre Snape from the news says he's been at Rannoch “teaching” for years. The juvenile spectre started haunting the Evan girls sister and her family. Arabella Figg has been trying to exorcise him for years, says it's driving that poor family insane. Well she mentions that a few years ago she thought she had finally succeeded but then he showed back up during the summer months, and it's happened twice since then.

“I've got to tell you Harvey this is all really compelling evidence. I'll be excited to see your full article when it is published , but why is it you've come to me?

“It's very simple Doctor, I've got funding. I've got Filch to agree to allow us to set up research there , he bought the old place. I've got Bones from Cambridge as an interpersonal medium and Riddle from Oxford who specializes in exorcism and how sceptres cross over. Filch will act as our senior medium and I'm bringing in Figg and Lovegood. I'm putting together a team to study their the entire school year. All I need is a credible field researcher to join. Your the best”

There was a long pause as Ray Stanz bit into his now soggy chip and chewed thoughtfully. Swallowing decisively he cracked his first smile since arriving in Perth.

“I'm in”
