Harry and the muggleborn discuss all the cons of celebrity life.


** I think there was a fic I read several years ago where Prince Harry (yeah THAT prince harry) goes to hogwarts since he was about the right hogwarts age in the 90s when the books take place. I can't remember what it was called anymore or any of the deatails though.

****** Did you actually just type out several paragraphs about how someone you don't know is a bad person on a sub for a fictional series completely unrelated to the person? Really?? This makes me lose faith in humanity

******* Given that the comment was about Prince Harry going to Hogwarts, a life-changing event which would have altered his life's course drastically compared to how it turned out in reality, and his current life now?

Yup.

I suppose it's also because I'm a supporter of the Monarchy and have an immense dislike for such a terrible woman that turned a prince into a goddamn emotional abuse victim.

Again, I reiterate: Poor bastard. It would have been better for him to be a muggleborn wizard, if magic were real.
