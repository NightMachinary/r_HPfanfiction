So, a while ago, I was doing a little experiment when it came to Fanfiction, even made a small little post about it in the Fanfiction reddit where I go and sort the stories by the most followed/favorited and read to see if they were actually any good as their massive amount of fans would leave one to believe. It was while doing this I stumbled upon an interesting pairing within the Fandom that had several high ranking stories within it, Harry Potter with a character by the name of Daphne Greengrass.

From what research I've done, the character in question turned out to be a minor Slytherin Character who was mentioned in all of one book of the original series and had mostly been associated with Pansy Parkinson with Daphne's sister going on to marry Draco. And yet, despite having no character to speak of from the original stories and being among the number whom Harry would rather Curse then to even think about romantically, Harry's paired with her fairly often.

Is this just a instance of 'Draco in Leather Pants' again, where people are wanting to take a Slytherin character and pair it with the Boy Who Lived? Or is it something else that I just haven't seen yet? What exactly is up with people and Daphne Greengrass?

**** I mean, sure, there is also the whole inter-house thing, and I have to say I like keeping it out of the Weasleys/Trio. But why specifically Daphne is literally because the name. Sounds nice.

Plus the possibility of Harry and Draco being brothers-in-law and having to spend occasional holidays together is /hilarious/.

**** I was really fixated on Harry/Daphne for several months, and I can tell you exactly why. I just happened to stumble across a very good story with that pairing, which hit the spot for me at that moment in time, and as a consequence I wanted more (to get that initial high back). It's the same compulsion as seeking out fan fiction in general: you get to know a character and you want to read more about them, even though you know it's not /really/ the same character, because another person is writing it. The Daphne that I was smitten with in the first story I read is not the same as the Daphne in other stories by other authors, but honestly neither is Harry or Ron or Hermione.

I don't feel the guilt about it being "less pure" fanfiction just because the one character is basically OC. Most of fanfiction is exploring how things would play out if events or personality traits or even the in-universe rules were fundamentally different than canon.

From a broader perspective, I feel like the whole point of all of us reading and writing this stuff is to suspend our disbelief for a moment to see what happens, and taking an attitude like "Harry would never do that!", or "But it's not canon!" ignores this, or is cherry-picking. It's okay to just not like a story. There are definitely stories which turn me off because the stuff happening doesn't seem plausible, but that breaking point is different for everyone, and it even depends on what you want out of a particular story. For instance, I really liked HPMOR, but I read it not primarily as a Harry Potter fic, but for the interesting thoughts which happened to be set in a familiar environment.

PS: I definitely don't use Daphne to self-insert, given that I'm a heterosexual male.

** From what I can tell, she's basically the ultimate blank slate and because she's a Slytherin, that works out for all the HP fans who cream their pants over interhouse relationships for some reason. It also helps that her name sounds like the name you'd probably give to your first OC.

It genuinely does confuse when people intensely ship Harry and Daphne together, when one of them has absolutely no established personality. To me, it would be like shipping someone with a brick that had facial features drawn on them to make them seem more characterized.

Although, I think that about all Harry/Blank slate pairings, hence why I have yet to read even one of them.

*** Not exactly a blank slate. In the books, Daphne is one among the gang of Slytherin girls, along with Millicent Bulstrode and Pansy Parkinson, who bully Hermione. Rowling also revealed more about the Greengrass family in interviews; namely, she said that Astoria Greengrass, Daphne's younger sister, had been raised by a family [the Greengrasses] that valued blood purity, and believed in such values, until Astoria changed her ways.

Due to her bullying of Hermione, we can also tell that Daphne is likely an arrogant, stuck-up girl who supports, or at least parrots, the concept of blood purity, and Pureblood supremacy.

Astoria changing her views on Muggles and Muggle-borns, along with the Greengrasses being a "lesser-status" [likely less wealthy] Pureblood family, Astoria's marriage to Draco Malfoy was frowned upon by Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. Astoria also helped Draco raise their son, Scorpius, to be "more tolerant of Muggles and Muggle-borns". Rowling also mentions some "tension" at family gatherings between Draco's parents, and Draco's family, due to Astoria's changed views.

#+end_quote

You can try to extrapolate yourself all you want yourself, but the fact remains that most fans consider whatever J.K. Rowling says, even outside of the books, to be "canon". It's also a fact that Rowling herself has pre-set opinions on Daphne's character that she did not write into the books. Opinions that appear, judging by this thread, to clearly differ from Harry/Daphne supporters' views [and headcanons] of Daphne.

Why didn't Rowling write her view(s) of Daphne into the books? The main one is, her editor simply forced her to cut down the length of her manuscripts. Rowling has noted in several interviews, for example, how she tried, on three separate occasions, to include an as-of-yet unreleased scene between Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott at Malfoy Manor, but was forced to cut the scene for length purposes each time.

Should these scenes be regarded as "not canon", simply because Rowling couldn't include /every/ piece of detailed information about /every/ character in the books? Or because, in some cases, she was actively made to cut scenes that would've otherwise been book canon? I don't think so.

  "I suppose that's where we differ. I place JKR's insight higher than the insight of a fellow fan.

  Personally, I feel as though it is JKR's universe and she can give us as much information as she wants. While I understand where John Green is coming from and think it's admirable that he would sort of hand over his work to the readers, these books/characters are first and foremost JKR's and she's perfectly justified in sharing the intricacies of the world she has created with fans. That being said, we are free to ignore it as fans. You can write a fanfic about Harry dating Draco or a different version of Remus Lupin's life. Pottermore is tricky because not everyone has had a chance to read through all of it and it's pretty encyclopedic and harder to remember than book canon. In my own writing, I try to conform to Pottermore info as much as possible. We as fans are at perfect liberty to ignore the canon, but it's canon all the same.

  ...the information from Pottermore is coming directly from JKR, so I accept it as canon. I 100% accept it as fact, like I believe it should be. [...] Things like Harry being in Hufflepuff or there being another Weasley sibling wouldn't work because its specifically stated in the books that these things are not true. Saying things like that would go against what is already written and accepted as fact, where as the information from Pottermore seems to add to what is already written and accepted as fact."

People said the same thing about the Star Wars Expanded Universe after the release of the Star Wars films. "Oh, the Star Wars EU isn't canon, because it's not in movie format." Then, the prequels were released, and those /were/ in movie format. "Oh, the prequels don't count as canon, because I consider them to be terrible movies."

As in both cases, people only count as "canon" what they want to believe as canon, even though both the EU and the prequels were considered to be "canon" by George Lucas and Lucasfilms [up until Disney bought Lucasfilms]. I don't really see any difference here.

It's the same message. "Oh, I don't like X factor of what the author considers 'canon', so I'm going to disregard it completely."

Being a college English major, I get why you have this view. However, the "Death of the Author" view has a crucial point as to why it is implemented in academia: because most classical authors /are already dead/. It also helps to throw out essays and homework submissions based on pure conjecture, "from the long-dead author's perspective", when often times such claims are near-if-not-downright-impossible to verify.

On the other hand, J.K. Rowling is /not/ dead. Professors /have/ allowed and permitted students to submit Rowling's word, as per interviews, in essays and homework. Why? Because it can be easily verified by doing a quick Google search, and the students cite it properly. Rowling also has "official" sources for the information in the forms of her website, Twitter, and Pottermore, the latter of which is now publicly available for citations and sourcing. Therefore, Rowling is already treated in some academic circles as an exception to "Death of the Author".

That's not even counting the vast difference between Harry Potter, which is still largely regarded as "pop culture media", and the classic works taught as standard curriculum by most English Literature professors. Harry Potter, unlike the "classics", has only been around relatively recently, and, as I said above, J.K. Rowling is still alive.

There's also the fact that, legally, J.K. Rowling holds the copyrights and trademarks to the Harry Potter franchise, along with Warner Brothers, who work with her closely on making Rowling's views [specifically] come to fruition. In the view of the law, Harry Potter /does/ "belong" to J.K. Rowling, a fact that she has also demonstrated many times by suing others [including fans seeking to publish books based on Harry Potter] and defending her intellectual property rights to the series in court. Each time, the court has reaffirmed Rowling's legal ownership of the Harry Potter creative rights.

You're free to express and believe in your opinion, and write fanfiction how you choose. However, most fans believe that whatever J.K. Rowling says should be treated as canon. This has been demonstrated countless times on [[/r/harrypotter]] as well.

******** Just like Star Wars, to follow your example, I make a distinction between "primary canon" and "secondary canon" (or the "expanded universe").

So when you ask me if some element from a fanfic is canon then only the 7 published books count. Everything else (that is official of course) could be considered secondary canon and might be used for worldbuilding purposes if you want, but I don't expect my fanfics to abide by them.

For example:

You need a French school in your fic? It has to Beauxbatons since that's primary canon.

You need a Japanese school in your fic? Do whatever you want. You can pick Mahoutokoro if you want or you might invent your own. This is not a breaking point for me.

** In the epilogue Malfoy is married to Astoria Greengrass. Daphne is only mentioned during the OWLs scene, and then only her name. However we can extrapolate she's a Pureblood Slytherin. Other than that she's a blank slate and one that offers good opportunities to see things from a different point of view than the trio. Also as mentioned, Daphne Greengrass is an awesome name.

I love Harry/Daphne post-Hogwarts stuff. It forces interaction between Harry and Malfoy when it otherwise wouldn't exist, and that interaction can be so much fun. Plus the idea of Harry having Malfoy as a brother in law is excellent.

** It's just people wanting to take a Slytherin character and pair her with the Boy-Who-Lived. Your options for this, while staying canonical, are Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, Tracey Davies (or Davis?), Daphne Greengrass and Astoria Greengrass. Pansy is a bitch in canon and unlike Draco or Severus, people don't give her a lot of redemption arcs, Millicent is the female version of Crabbe and Goyle. That leaves Tracey, Astoria and Daphne, all blank-slate characters. Daphne Greengrass is a prettier name than Tracey Davi(e)s, plus Daphne is a pure-blood and her sister canonically marries Draco so some things can be extrapolated about the Greengrasses for fanfiction. It's probably easier to use Daphne over Astoria, since she's in the same year as Harry and they have more reason to interact in a Hogwarts era story.
