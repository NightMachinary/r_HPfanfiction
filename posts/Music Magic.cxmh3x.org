Are here any fics that explore combining magic with music, or using music as a form of magic? I feel like I read one before but I think there could be some potential there


** I think I read one where Harry played the trumpet and was some kind of musical genius. I remember very little about it. I'll see if I can try to find it. I remember reading it was like an intense music theory class tho lmao

  Sirius escapes with Harry after the Potters die. He makes it all the way into the US before Death Eaters catch up to them and he has to abandon Harry. Now Harry is alone. With no name, no history, and no trace. Then, after 13 years, Harry returns to Britain as a very different person. With a completely different view of Magic. A view that breaks everything. H/Hr.

** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Serpents Renaissance) has music as a common recurring element, and as a way of increasing your control. Frankly the music they do in that fic sounds like it would be awesome.

  She walked into his office with a map and a plea for help, out of options to turn to and desperately short on knowledge. How could he say no? A Bill Weasley versus the Mummy challenge fic in progress. AU - canon divergence and fusion, some humor. Rating may change with future updates.

** Newish and not-complete, but there's a next-gen fic that explores Albus Potter & Scorpius Malloy as members of a popular band (all still existing in the magical universe). Not sure if Next-gen is your jam, but it's definitely a fun read, so far. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13160045/1/][Moon River]]

** Harry in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] used this kind of magic. It only showed up on the end of the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9476138][second story]] and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10181825][third story]]. This is also a great Harry-raised-by-someone else fanfiction if you're looking into that.
