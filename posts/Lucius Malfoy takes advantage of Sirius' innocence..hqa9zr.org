Not a full story prompt but something you could include for a plot twist amd show some cunning amd idiocy all at once.

When Sirius stands trial and is proven innocent Lucius uses this to his advantage, he pleads to the court that clearly it is no coincidence that the only man to ever be wrongly accused is capable of escaping. The only logical idea is that he was seen to be innocent by magic itself and was gifted the strength to break free.

A new law is passed that declares the only way to possibly escape azkaban is to be seen as innocent in the eyes of magic and be released by the strength she grants you. From then on all who escape azkaban will be immediately declared innocent.

It may be stupid but its the kind of stupid that Fudge would believe and if you sell it right (lots of bribes and threats) it's something Lucius could pull off and may be benificial to both sides of the war.


** Would that actually count for the DE in OotP though? Technically they didn't escape, they were broken out by an attack.
