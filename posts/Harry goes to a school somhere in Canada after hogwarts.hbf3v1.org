  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** Was this the fic where reaching the school is a test to whether or not they'll accept you as a student? The school was in the mountains, unplottable, anti-portkey or anti-apparition wards and Harry literally had to fight his way to it?
