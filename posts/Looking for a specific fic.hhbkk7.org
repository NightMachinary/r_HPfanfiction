:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm currently looking for a specific fic I'm pretty sure is on Ao3. All I can remember is that during the whole Quidditch World Cup mess Draco adopts Winky as his house elf. In this universe, house elves use the magic of the witch or wizard they are bonded to, and Draco is pretty young to have a house elf. She later becomes pretty protective of him, and they end up getting along great. I'm pretty sure Draco is friends with the golden trio as well. I've been trying to remember more but it's driving me crazy that I can't find this fic. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
