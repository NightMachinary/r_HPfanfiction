So what I'm looking for are fics that have Harry older than in canon (usually the age of Cedric or the Twins). In these the BWL is either thought to be his younger brother (taking his place in the Golden Trio) or Neville. Also most of these fics include Harry/Fleur and Harry as a Quidditch/Magical Prodigy of some sort.

Now I know it'd be hard to find stories with all of these requirements so I'll just settle for Aged-Up Harry. Maybe something similar to /Knowledge is Power by Nkari127/?


** linkffn(What you leave behind by Newcomb) is pretty neat, but I haven't read Knowledge is Power so I have no idea if it's similar.
