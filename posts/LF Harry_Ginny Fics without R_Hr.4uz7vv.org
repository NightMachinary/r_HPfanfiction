Trying to get into this canon pairing, but if there's one canon pairing i simply cannot tolerate is R/Hr. With that said, i'm looking for your best/favorite H/G stories without a R/Hr pairing.

Plot can be canon or AU as long as the romance is taken as a priority. The writing quality should be decent or at the very least average. The less troupes the better so no time-traveling, Lord-potter, wish fulfillment stuff.

Other prefences but aren't must haves(an absence of an R/HR is though) are; smut or sex scenes but not to a large degree as i see the characters, for the most part get together in their late teens/young adult age and intimacy isn't uncommon in that age range. and a kickass/competent/powerful harry because preference.


** Strangers at Drakeshaugh is great, but it has R/Hr in one or two chapters.

The Aurors by FloreatCastellum may have R/Hr too, but I don't really remember.

Both are postHog, so both Ron and Hermione are much more mature. So who knows? You might even like it.

*** Ron and Hermione are only really mentioned in Aurors, I don't really include them beyond a few conversations about the plot and a vague mention (from Ginny to Harry) that Ron might propose. You never actually see any romance between the two. I would say that as OP is looking for romance as a priority, Aurors might not be the best fic though, as it's very much a suspense/thriller with romance as a clear secondary plot.

  The summer after the Chamber of Secrets was hard. Why can't Harry remember what happened? Realizing he's missing memories, Harry and Remus set out to find out what happened. What about that red-head he's been dreaming about? Soul-bond fic. H/G, B/F, R/T

**** Absolutely not. The bonds merely established trusts among them, the romance was progressing slowly over many years.
