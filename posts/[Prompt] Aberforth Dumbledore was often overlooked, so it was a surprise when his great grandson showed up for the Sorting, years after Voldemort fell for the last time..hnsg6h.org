** Is it mean for me to want the grandchild who named the kid to have not known their grandfather well and name him after their grandfather's famous brother, Albus because they don't know much about the rift between the two? Old family drama doesn't carry much weight unless it is directly impacting the next gen. Especially, if one of the people involved is dead and the other won't talk about it.
