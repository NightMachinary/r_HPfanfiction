It's a Castle that CAN NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY BESIEGED.

Closest I remember seeing. McGonagall raises the castle defenses which includes a 50-foot wall with battlements.

  "The Founders lived in very violent times, Mr. Potter," McGonagall answered. "They didn't choose a /castle/ for their school at random, you know. They knew what they were about."

#+begin_quote
  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter.

** I mean that was the reason Salazar left a goddamn basilisk in the chamber. So that Hogwaets would have a one snake army. Or that's what I think anyway
