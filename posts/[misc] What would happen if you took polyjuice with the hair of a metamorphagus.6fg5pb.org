** Depends on how the writer wants to play it. Most likely options include:

- turns into whatever form the metamorph had at the time of sampling

- turns into a metamorphmagus for the duration

- turns into an albino generic humanoid

- collapses into a puddle of meat slurry

- because the recipe to change into a specific form is given a non-specific form sample, it becomes poisonous

- congratulations, you are now a boggart, IQ of 20.

** The same thing that would happen if you took it with the hair of a parseltongue perhaps? Polyjuice does seem appearance only though while metamorhpmagus is a rare inborn magical talent. I would think it would just give the base appearance of the metamorhpmagus

*** But does a metamorph even have a 'base appearance'? This is something that annoys me in a lot of Harry/Tonks fics and I know I'm not the only one but afaik there's absolutely no evidence that something like that even exists.

In fact there's evidence that suggests the opposite:

#+begin_quote
  "Not much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it's turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blonde by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks's hair started changing colour the day that she was born."
#+end_quote

---Remus Lupin on his infant son's Metamorphic abilities

Source: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Metamorphmagus]]

So if hair colour can change from birth there literally can't be a 'base form' because it suggests that a metamorphs body is in a constant state of flux, there's change all the time.

And now to OP's question: I suppose it will either just make the potion useless or it will change to the appearance the metamorph was using while the hair was plucked (which would be incredibly useful and would probably make any metamorph very rich, especially since i imagined there to be some kind of sex business involving polyjuice ever since I read it in a fic i can't quite remember)

****** The question would be answered by knowing one of two facts:

Can fetuses (fetii? What the hell is the plural of fetus?) perform magic in the womb? If a fetus can perform magic, maybe they have no base state, if they can't they seem to.

Can Parselmouths speak Parseltongue immediately? Both Parseltongue (excluding Harry's horcrux cheat into it) and metamorphmagery are inherent magical abilities, so if Parselmouths speak Parseltongue as soon as they can start talking (because I assume baby Parseltongue noises would sound identical to regular baby noises), then it may truly be that metamorphs are truly appearance-fluid.

I in particular never liked the fact that Teddy metamorphagizes as a baby. Other than little Teddy here (as well as the mention of Nymphadora as a wee child) all magic done by children seems to start while still young, but maybe outside of the toddler stage. This throws more than a slight question into when children start using magic. I'd personally find metamorphs more interesting if they started changing once accidental magic started being a thing, but I have accepted the fact that I'm probably more in the minority on this question outside of Tonks-Harry fics.

******* I think an old fanon idea, and at the very least a pervasive one, is that magic in children is unstable, hence children not being taught magic til they are 11yo. The idea that children's magic is unstable does seem to be borne up by examples from canon, so why not simply keep using that idea? Inborn talents like metamorphs and Parseltongues probably have intermittent control over their abilities when they are very young, hence Tonks and Teddy's constant shifting.

******* I don't know of any canon answer to the question of fetus magic lol, but I'd guess that magic is tied to the soul, whatever that might be. So when the baby has a soul they also have magic.

Personally I like the idea that babies always have the magic, but don't begin to directly express it until they're a little older and have more sophisticated emotions and clearer intent that can prompt accidental magic. And magical abilities like Parseltongue and metamorphagizing are more inherent to the individual and are expressed without the same triggers needed for general magic.

**** You're reaching too far. The ability to change your body does not in any way exclude the possibility of having a base form. Just because the form is effectively vestigial does not mean it ceases to exist.

Even if a shapeshifter never once assumed their standard form or even knows they have one does not mean they do not in fact have one.

For all anyone knows drinking a polyjuice potion of Tonks could turn you into a man nobody has seen before.

***** Yeah, prostitutes polyjuicing into famous people would probably be even more illegal but that doesn't mean it won't happen in the backroom of some sleazy pub in knockturn alley.

That's actually where i got the idea from. It was one of those Sherlock Holmes semi crossovers with a fem!Harry as Moriarty. She build up a brothel and customers were requesting to fuck the GWL.

So yes, getting rich of it /legally/ would probably involve a lot more time and a lot of contact with the DMLE but that doesn't mean that a metamorph can't get rich of it.

As a matter of fact you could probably hash out some kind of deal with the aurors, they'll look the other way as long as you keep supplying them for missions.

** It seems that metamorphagism is a form of transfiguration (or at least something similar to it) and metamorphagus' appearance at the moment is their actual biological form for the given moment. So it would follow that the hair would change you into that appearance.

*** Seems a bit broken though, as this would mean that if a metamorphmagus has the skill to emulate the appearance of others, then you wouldn't need the hair of that individual to polyjuice into them. As useful as the metamorphmagus ability is, Tonks would then be infinitely more useful to both sides as polyjuice stock.

Frankly I think the only "balanced" way to handle this in story is to assume metamorphmagi have a base form inherited from their parents, and that their shifting doesn't alter their DNA, just cosmetic appearance, so polyjuice using their heir looks like their base form. If you assume polyjuice doesn't let you copy magical abilities, then polyjuicing into a metamorph wouldn't be worldbreaking.

I could see a very plausible AU pathway where any of the latter three happen in year 2, simply by any of the trio accidentally dropping their respective wand into the potion, especially Ron, considering his wand's core is already sticking out of the wood...

*** Huh. I can just see it - Hermione the cat-girl, and Ron the unicorn man.

Centaur. Ron turns into a Centaur.

But I like the idea of them fucking the potion up without realising it (pretty damn complex potion, and Hermione was just super smart, not a potions prodigy, so believable) and all getting changed in some way. Hermione becomes a werecat of sorts, Ron becomes a...fuck, I wanna say weredragon because he's already been bitten by a dragon, but I prefer it when people leave magical animals out of human transformations. Lets say Myrtles ectoplasm leaks into it, and he can become a ghost.

And Harry becomes Goyle for an hour.

***** Are you a baker though? Cos, you know, there's actually a lot that can make the difference between an ok cake, a good cake, and a great cake. And while cake is delicious, quality is more important when it comes to potions I imagine. There's mud cakes, sponge cakes, dense cakes, light fluffy cakes, moist cakes, dry cakes, and sometimes it can be tricky getting a moist cake, or it can be tricky getting a dryer cake. You gotta have absolutely dry utensils when making chocolate things because water will make melted chocolate split, and then its hard to save it. You gotta have absolutely clean utensils when whipping egg whites, or they won't whip. Meringues are affected by everything from room temperature, humidity, oven quality, how you pipe it, if you even risk it, the quality of the eggs (or egg alternative like aquafaba), how long its been since you showered. (I'm kidding. It's tempermental though.) You can follow the recipe exactly, but sometimes due to variations, you might need a little more sugar, or to whip it a little longer.

Shit, this got away from me, and I didn't even get onto gelatin (or agar agar) or biscuits (cookies), and whether they should be crisp, or soft, or decorating, or sugar.

You can get away with a lot in cooking, but baking, it's more like a science. You watch any cooking competitions, you'll often find the baking challenges are where a lot of the competitors struggle.

Anyway. Point is, I'm sure there are potions that are simple enough to just follow the recipe and get a good result. But once you start on tricky potions, which I suspect Polyjuice is, like the more complex baking goods, I suspect it becomes more complicated.

Plus, no way am I making a Victoria sponge in a haunted bathroom. Oh god. They could have gotten toilet water in their 'juice.

** Polyjuice seems to copy their pretty much everything physical about the person, but it doesn't seem to affect the drinker's magical abilities (Harry being disguised as a muggle at the wedding didn't make him a muggle). The six other Potters got his bad vision, but not the connection to Voldemort as far as we know, and "Bellatrix" in Gringotts would have fooled the Goblins if Hermione didn't muck it up.

In short, I assume it would just copy the metamorph appearance from when the hair was removed, without giving the drinker any special abilities.
