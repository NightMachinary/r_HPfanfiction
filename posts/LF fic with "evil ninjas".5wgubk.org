This is a bit silly, but my husband and I got into a debate about evil ninjas making every crappy movie better or something, and then he started trying to compare that theory to fanfiction. Being that I have never read a fic with "evil ninjas", I couldn't exactly comment... So, evil ninjas.

Thanks in advance.


** So just to be clear, you want a HP fic with antagonistic ninjas in it?

** I think there are ninjas in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Other Path), around book 5 or 6.

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.

  A 7 year old Harry stumbles on a box of old Naruto manga. Inspired, he reaches deep within, using chakra to quickly become a phenomenal ninja. And thus begins a curious tale. Read and see how it ends! Read 1st chapter A/N...story is officially abandoned.

** Someone should write this.

Like have a Harry Potter who goes to Mahoutokoro come to back to fight Voldemort. But have enemies from Japan follow him.

I could totally see other branches of magic; based on martial arts and weapons play with a Dr. Strange sort of feel.
