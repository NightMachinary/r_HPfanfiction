** Three times a day Harry witnessed hell. Every day, morning, noon, and night, he would descend into the Great Hall and witness acts of barbarism. His friends, peers, mentors, all of which who were normally sane would commit heinous acts. Ripping, gnashing, slurping. They would tear into the bodies of those poor innocent souls. No one believed him, claimed they weren't sentient. Harry knew though. The gardens were full of whispers, intelligent conversations, hopes, and dreams. His only friends growing up.

They truth would always strike the poor flora mad, they lived solely to be plucked away at the prime of their lives. To be consumed by those more powerful then them.

"Why?" asked the turnip.

"Why?" asked the carrot.

"W..?" asked the tomato, who couldn't decide if it was a vegetable or a fruit.

So full of life, these small friends of his, until they were snuffed out, and consumed by monsters three times a day.

** Draco had claimed that he could remember a story - Harry hoped to Cthulhu that this one story was just a fairy tale, it had that ring to it, but there was a story - about Salazar Slytherin sending a brave young viper on a mission to gather information from other snakes.

If any snake a Parselmouth had talked to, could make other snakes self-aware by talking to them, then...

Then...

Harry didn't even know why his mind was going all "then... then..." when he knew perfectly well how the exponential progression would work, it was just the sheer moral horror of it that was blowing his mind.

And what if someone had invented a spell like that to talk to cows?

What if there were Poultrymouths?

Or for that matter...

Harry froze in sudden realization just as the forkful of carrots was about to enter his mouth.

That couldn't, couldn't possibly be true, surely no wizard would be stupid enough to do THAT...

And Harry knew, with a dreadful sinking feeling, that of course they would be that stupid. Salazar Slytherin had probably never considered the moral implications of snake intelligence for even one second, just like it hadn't ever occurred to Salazar that Muggleborns were intelligent enough to deserve personhood rights. Most people just didn't see moral issues at all unless someone else was pointing them out...

"Harry?" said Terry from beside him, sounding like he was afraid he would regret asking. "Why are you staring at your fork like that?"

"I'm starting to think magic should be illegal," said Harry. "By the way, have you ever heard any stories about wizards who could speak with plants?"

Harry, after discovering you can talk to snakes, begins freaking out that all sorts of other things might be sapient. At first he thinks about animals, and the prospect of sentient cows makes him feel queasy about his meal, and at the end he even refuses to eat based on the possibility that the vegetables might be sentient.
