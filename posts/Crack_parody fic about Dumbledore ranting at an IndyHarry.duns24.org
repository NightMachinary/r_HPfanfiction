Just the idea of Dumbledore having an “are you shitting me” moment where it turns out that the blood wards have stopped hundreds of attempts on Harry's life on a yearly basis tickles my funny bone.


** Yeah, that's a pet peeve of mine ... we never see those famous [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cyudl8/lf_fic_which_shows_those_blood_wards_in_action/][blood wards in action]] (hell, we don't see even Dumbledore much in action with one exception of the Battle of the Department of Mysteries). The only exception is the chapter of 2 of linkffn(The Warren by DarkKing666). And I write them in my (very very unfinished and raw draft; comments welcome) story about [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][Ginny being somebody else]].

***** The "blood wards" are not on the house, they are on Harry. Voldemort cannot harm him so long as he can call a place where his mother's blood resides home.

****** Yes, but that's exactly my point: we have to believe that it so, because we actually never see anybody being stopped (Voldemort or any other bad guy) from hurting Harry. One of the main principles of any writing is “Show, don't tell!”. Show me how strong those wards are, don't just talk about how Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard in the world, show me (which in the limited version happened at least once in The Battle of The Department of Mysteries), don't let other characters tell us who the main hero is, show me! etc.

**** The language is ambiguous for said "wards" being the cause. It's more implied that the protection was mostly on privet drive in canon because of Dumbledore and that the skin burning was the sacrifice alone.
