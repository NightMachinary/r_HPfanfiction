I'm looking for fics where Draco feels guilt for his past, anything where he's really not in good mental health or doesn't know how to handle himself/things. I'm not super picky just things in that ballpark

Any length, any rating. Anything pairless or Drarry is fine but please no other types of Draco pairs !

Sorry if this is a strange request

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
