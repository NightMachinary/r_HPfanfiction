  Harry Potter died on December 4th,1987. He was buried in a mausoleum the Surrey Graveyard. Now, his ghost and his corpse are two entities. When Harrison the Ghost and Harold the Zombie get a letter to Hogwarts, Harrison hatches a plan. Watch as these two masquerade as one of the living, and will anybody find out? No pairings yet. AU. Undead!Harry. Rated T for mentions of violence.

  Sequel to Lost Hope. If the Wizarding World thought normal would be restored following the death of Harry Potter, the House of Black has news for them. So too did the new ghost...who's kind of green.

  The plan was perfect. The execution was even better...but they all forgot to consult the Sorting Hat who had its own views. After all, what can you expect from the hat which contains all four founders?
