Hi,\\
I was wondering if there are any fics where muggle-borns decide to make it in the muggle world at least until the war is over. I vaguely remember a fic long ago where Justin's family used their connections to help young Muggleborns escape or get jobs. I know of course that they are missing records, but you are telling me a Muggleborn a year or two older than Harry couldn't use some kind of magic to take care of that? Or similar to diplomats getting Jews papers early on, some adult isn't like, "Let me get rid of that trace for you."


** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) is a little like that, it's during sixth year since Voldemort manages to take over large parts of the ministry a lot earlier due to Fudge's appeasement politics, it does involve muggleborns led by Hermione (created the group) and Justin (has lots of muggle money, land and can hire muggle mercenary soldiers), and they protect each other, but their main business is to strike back and blow up ancient pureblood manors whose wards aren't designed to handle nonmagical brute force attacks with lots of geminoed plastic explosives. It's one of my all time favorites.

*** Yes that is on my kindle to read, but I'm looking more for ones where their mostly just surviving, but maybe only fighting at the final battle.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
