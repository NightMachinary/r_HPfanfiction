Maybe something where she wanted to keep a rather low profile in the Wizarding World, so she picked a career where she could stay out of the limelight and wasn't constantly being harassed by the press...

(Because yes, Hermione likes being in charge of things, but I do wonder how good she'd be at directly supervising people and delegating tasks. That's why I'm not sure she'd like being Minister as much as she /thinks/ she might.)

I too am not sure being Minister was the best fit for her in canon, but I don't think it relates to her ability to supervise and delegate effectively. GoF, OoTP and DH showcase her doing such things and effectively taking charge to set Harry up for success.

Anyway, not sure if crossovers count (and sadly this was abandoned) but in this Avengers crossover, she and Harry purchase a bookstore in New York:

The fact that Voldemort installs a puppet minister shows how useless that position is. It's just a glorified figurehead. Hermione's talents would be totally wasted there, any moron can do the job. Almost anything would be better for her: Being a healer (and finding a cure for Lycanthropy), becoming a Potions Master, inventing new spells, joining the Unspeakables or just becoming her own kind of Lucius Malfoy, telling the Minister what he should do, instead of wasting her time with press interviews and all the other types of time wasting that job involves.

**** Indeed. She wants to be in charge, but I fear she'd tire of all the bureaucracy that came with the job. She actually /does/ want to supervise and delegate, but she doesn't want the work to get lost in a maze below her. In other words, she'd be the type of boss who expected everybody else to have the same levels of competence and attention to detail as her.

  Harry knew he had leave the Wizarding world because of the Hallows. He just never expected to have company on his journey. Or to encounter a world stranger than the one he'd left, peopled with armored men, gods, secret agents, and villains. Oh, to be back in England again.

  After taking a stand and leaving Harry and Ron, all Hermione Granger wants is a quiet life away from the Ministry, and so she applies to become the new Hogwarts librarian. The only problem is that Harry applied to work at Hogwarts as well...

  After the final battle Hermione turns away from the wizarding world, why? After years hiding in the muggle world Harry tracks her down and tries to convince her to return, will he succeed? H/Hr pairing, EWE, drama, romance & a little bit of fluff.

  By all appearances, Hermione Granger runs a successful bookshop, lives a happy life, and wants for nothing. However, when a person from her past starts asking uncomfortable questions, Hermione realizes that things are never as they appear.
