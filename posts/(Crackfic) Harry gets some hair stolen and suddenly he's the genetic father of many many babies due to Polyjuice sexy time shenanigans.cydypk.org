Obviously I would like either an adult (17/18+) or at least *near* adult Harry.

He wakes up one day shaved bald and thinks it's a prank or something. Months go by and suddenly he's hit with loads of paternity suits or is notified by Gringotts that he's the father of XXX children (or whatever) and finds out that his hair was stolen so people could use polyjuice to pretend to be Harry and impregnate witches who thought it was actually Harry.

Or something to that effect. You get the idea.

**** Of course it's rape, but I think your view of canon Snape is a little skewed. I personally don't even see his love as romantic, more like that of a family member for the only person who ever thought he was worth anything. Like you might cling to your sister or grandmother if your parents were abusive and didn't give a shit about you.

***** No, Snape in canon is a straight up dick, and a pretty horrible human beingg all things considerd. I won't go into specifics(for which there are many), but will only state this. Snape didn't care if James died(kinda understandable, but still a dick move), or if Harry(a baby, and Lily's child, the person he supposedly loves '/obsessed/'), but only wanted Lily to live. He didn't care that a child was going to suffer, and die, but wanted his obsession to live. Then continued to treat Harry as if he's something you'd scrape off your shoe. He was obsessed with Lily, he didn't love her, he wanted to own her.

****** It's Dumbledore's accusation that you're thinking of, not something Snape says himself. Dumbledore is disgusted that Snape has asked Voldemort to spare only Lily's life without regard for her husband and son. But think about the request here. Voldemort's specifically trying to hunt down the family to kill Harry. Asking Voldemort to spare Harry's life not only wouldn't work, it would backfire spectacularly, Voldemort would not only refuse (thus ensuring Lily would be killed) he would probably hurt or kill Snape for even making such a request (to ask to spare the one who had the power to kill Voldemort looks like you're wanting Voldemort to die). James? I guess he could say spare the parents, but James is an adult who'd already defied Voldemort three times, he can look out for himself, plus many of the death eaters who were in school with them already know that James and Snape hate each other and Snape and Lily used to be friends. That's not a good crowd to do that in front of even if you wanted to, because it wouldn't be easy to explain. Dumbledore would have to be an idiot not to know that.

But by going to Dumbledore, Snape already ensures Harry and James are to be saved. Who in the hell would actually expect DD to just save Lily and leave the other two to die? No, DD is just laying a guilt trip on Snape and making him feel as terrible as possible right before he asks him to risk his life as a spy. The less Snape cares about his own life, the more likely he'll be to accept. Many people say DD did the same thing with Harry and the Dursleys, letting him grow up with people who hated him so he'd value himself less and be more willing to die when it was time.

I'm not arguing that Snape is a horrible human being, but hurting Lily in any way is the last thing he'd want to do. He only did it the once, knowingly, and then regretted it the rest of his life. Gross shit like spelling his sperm into her is not canon Snape, it's bad fanon. I imagine he'd just have love-potioned her like Merope did to Tom Riddle Sr. if he was /that/ type of villain. But his whole shtick was actually caring how Lily felt, soooo...

******* I won't nitpick over everything in your comment, because it's 1am here, but Dumbledore's accusation isn't without proof. Voldemort did try to spare Lily, a muggleborn witch, but killed James without offering to spare him(if i'm remembering things correctly). So while an accusation, unless you can actually give me a reason on why else Voldemort would try to spare a muggleborn's life, the accusation holds weight.

******** The accusation is not that Snape asked Voldemort only to spare Lily. That's just a fact.

The accusation is Snape did that because he didn't care if Harry and James died. He did it because asking for James and Harry's lives /from Voldemort/ would A.) be useless and B.) put Snape in danger.

It simply isn't possible to ask Voldemort to spare them. It wouldn't do any good.

But then look at what else he does. He goes to Dumbledore. And that's because he trusts Dumbledore's innate goodness- you can see this in the scene when Snape is shocked that Dumbledore asks what Snape will give, to save Lily's life. He'd obviously thought that DD would save them simply because that's what good guys do.

Dumbledore accuses Snape of using him as a backup plan because Snape doesn't trust Voldemort's word. But Voldemort is the actual backup plan. /Dumbledore/ - who should want to save everyone - is Plan A. Snape only doesn't visit him first because he's afraid Dumbledore will kill him on sight and then no one will be saved, not even Lily. If he pleads for Lily first to Voldemort, then if Dumbledore kills him instead of listening to him, at least there's a chance for one person to live.

** I know this is in good fun, however, polyjuice does not work in that way. Yes it uses the DNA from the person hair is taken from, BUT it does not alter the DNA of the person who uses the potion. The user is still themselves in every way except the way they look. Look at the Marauders map, when Mad Eye was not actually mad eye, the map knew even with polyjuice position being in use.

Plus, Hermione would have immediately died as a half-cat hybrid, because her immune system would have rejected the new body parts.
