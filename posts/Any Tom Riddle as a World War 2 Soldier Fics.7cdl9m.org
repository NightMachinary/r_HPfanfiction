I have recently have read an amazing crossover with HP and the Avengers (specifically Captain America the First Avenger) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together][Come Together]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3494062/oniforever][oniforever]].

linkffn(Come Together by oniforever)

A very basic summary: Tom is still very much in character in the beginning but ended up captured by HYDRA. Stuff happens and he essentially became a WW2 soldier.

It stays true to Tom's personality but made room for him to grow. At age 16 at least. This took place after the Chamber of Secrets which he is still very much guilty for. The story is very well written from the beginning and continues to become more impressive as I read on. It's to the point that I have no clue how many time I've reread this specific fanfiction.

Anyways, afterwards I started to want to find more of this type of story. I would basically like to read any fics with Tom as a soldier or involved in the muggle side of the WW2 somehow in his youth. I'm not very picky.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.
