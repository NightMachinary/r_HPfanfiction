What are some fics similar in premise or situation or anything to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]]?


** Aside from recommending everything else by Aesop...

There was an interesting Tonks-working-amongst-the-muggles story that was a riff of the Wicker Man. Abandoned before completion, but what was there was immersive, spooky fun.

*** There's an extra chapter of this on [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?psid=268651][HPFF]], by the way. Still incomplete though.

I would also recommend Legend by the same author. Very good story.

  The situation, Tonks surmised, was indeed bleak. She had no wand, no contact with the Ministry and no way off the remote Scottish island that held her prisoner. If things went according to plan, she'd be dead within the hour.

  James Moriarty never existed-but Harry Potter did. With a single, split-second decision, the history and future of the world is irreparably changed beyond anything this fandom has ever imagined.
