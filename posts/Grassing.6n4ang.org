** It's a slang term for informing or snitching on someone. It might not be specific to the UK though as I definitely remember hearing it as a child and I'm Canadian (that said, that's still commonwealth, so it's not far off).

*** No it's not -- not in the UK anyway. What you are describing is 'skiving' or 'bunking off'. 'Grassing' is informing a person in authority (a teacher for example) of another person's misdemeanour.

**** In American slang this would be tattling on or narcing (from police Narcotics officers, called Narcs for short) someone out.
