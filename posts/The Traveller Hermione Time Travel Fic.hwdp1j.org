The Traveller: After a disastrous battle of Hogwarts, Hermione knowingly launches herself into the past to make things right, but instead of going back two years, she goes back twenty. Her plans change and, with the help of an unlikely ally, she vows to dismantle the plans of two great wizards: Lord Voldemort and Professor Dumbledore.

Hope you enjoy! :)


** Bookmarking to read when you've updated more! :) I'm such trash for Hermione Marauder era fics, though I hope you give a new twist to the plot. I've read so many before that they've become a bit repetitive.

*** Aw thanks! Me too....I guess that's why I'm writing one. :) Can you highlight some things that have become repetitive that you'd like to see avoided?

**** Fantastic

Tbh I don't like the idea of Hermione with young Sirius while they're at Hogwarts, which rules out most of the fics in this genre.

Maybe Sirius in 1980 would have matured enough to have things work out with Hermione's personality, but while they're at school? They wouldn't work out at all.

Sirius would think Hermione way too prissy and rule-abiding and no fun in general, and one need only look at the way OotP Hermione talks about Sirius to know she wouldn't approve of his entire personality.

I'm also not a fan having Hermione change her name in any way (it's just awkward), and especially having her as Dumbledore's niece. In fact, I'd really appreciate a story in which she tells no one about the time travel, even Dumbledore.
