As the title says I am looking for Harry/Draco fics. I really enjoyed Must Love Quidditch and the dynamics with Harry and Draco's son, so more fics with Draco having a child would be great too.

I have read Reparations which I also really enjoyed. I would like other fics with a healing element too.

But anything works!


** I read a lot of Harry/Draco and keep all my bookmarks with comments and recs on my Ao3 profile. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks]]

I would second a lot of the recs given here - especially everything by Saras_Girl. My all time favorites are TURN (already reccd), All life is yours to miss, (already reccd), Foundations/Reparations (already reccd) and Helix (linkao3(3114812) ). By other authors I LOVED Twist (linkao3(473335) ), Bond (linkao3(754708) ), and Right Hand Red (linkao3(3178065) ). There are seriously so many good drarry fics though - if you're just getting into the ship there's a lot of good reading in your future.

*** Thanks! I can't wait to read some of these. I have read lots of drarry but I seem to have missed nearly all the ones recommended here. So clearly I have more options yet! Are there any specific ones with the family dynamic also included that you'd recommend? I.e. Draco has a child

**** TURN is epilogue compliant and so he has scorpius. Also, one I didn't list but did really like where Draco has scorpius is A Lonely Moon - Linkffn(4751586). In it, Scorpius is really troubled (ADD, slow reader, acts out etc) and Harry is his professor and one of the only ones who stands up for scorpius. It's a really slow build and is sweet.

Another where Draco is a dad is Secrets by Vorabiza. Personally I didn't love this fic but I am in the minority - most people are crazy about it. It's a 7th year AU and Draco has an illegitimate daughter and Harry helps protect her. It's like 600k words so it's a commitment. [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3386]]

Another I'd recommend is The Printed Press - linkao3(1124273). Soupy George is one of my very favorite authors (he has some non-drarry pairings too) and in this fic I know Draco is married but I can't remember if Scorpius is part of it. Great fic though regardless and his relationship (sham-marriage but friendship) with Astoria is really awesome.
