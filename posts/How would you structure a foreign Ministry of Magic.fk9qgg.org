** Well, generally I'd look into the history of the country that Ministry might be in and find out the general look of things in the 1600s (whenever the Statute got put into place) and then tune the Ministry to that. So, a Chinese Ministry might be very traditional and Imperial Court-esque, maybe a department of the Emperor's Palace or something. The French Ministry might be inspired by the Ancien Regime, or the post-Revolution structures. Germany might be all separated out into the states of the Holy Roman Empire, with each sending a delegate to a central ministry. Some might be lead by a single leader with a nationally-appropriate title, others might be a diarchy, a kritarchy, perhaps a theocracy for some countries where religion and magical society are still entwined. It really depends on the country.

** I had the idea that the Australian ministry is more like the Public Service than a ministry. It wouldn't have been set up until the early 1800's. Staff are hired rather than elected. Its just 30 or so people working in a modern office.
