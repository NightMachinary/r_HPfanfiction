Story: The Lord of Azkaban Linkffn(2267009)

#+begin_quote
  Harry is sent to Azkaban for murder. Years later Dumbledore comes to release him but what he finds is nothing like what he was expecting. Dark and very unforgiving Harry
#+end_quote

Harry murders his family (its about damn time) and ends up in Azkaban! But dun dun dun it turns out Harry didn't do anything and they Siriused Harry while all his friends abandoned him.

Years later Dumbles and the group known as the fried chicken scouts find out some muggle actually killed Harry's family for...reasons...it happens all the time don't worry about it.

With this new tid bit of info they decide to yeet Harry out of Azkaban and say how swwy they are for leaving him their for six years.

jump cut to our hero! We expect him to look like his dog daddy after 6 years in Azkaban but it turns out Sirius was a baby back bitch who didn't drink his milk, because instead of crazed and starved and half dead Harry has become *SWOLE*!

He has somehow taken over Azkaban, mind fucked everyone into submission and is now having sex with Bellatrix (not even sexy time travel teenaged girl Bella either just crazy killed Sirius Bella) and Tonks who he captured at some point...

He orders his super saiyan dementors to hide while he bamboozles Dumbles bird group and then the story ends because i closed the fanfic and had to take a breath.

It's the way the story tries to frame the rape threat as a result of the society that Draco was indoctrinated in from childhood that makes it worse than Draco just threatening rape. Why the hell would /wizards/ use threats of sexual violence to threaten and belittle other people? They're fucking wizards. These are the same people who complain about using the train to get to school because it's too muggle.

I don't think so, considering he says "when I'm old enough", meaning that he's too young to be capable of it right now. I think Draco spouting off on rape was meant to provoke a deliberate reaction, not just from Harry, but the /reader/, to demonstrate what an un-swell guy Draco is.

That's the big issue with many readers take to that line - that rape in particular was chosen as Draco's evil act. It's a very touchy subject, and the effect is amplified by this being in 2019, where sexual assault, harassment, and violence have become a more prominent crime in social consciousness than it was 10 years ago when HPMOR was first published.

Actually there's no sign that Draco ever issued a threat to Luna. Indeed, to do so would undermine the legal defence he described. All indications are that he was simply planning a combination of revenge and recreation, without any need to give her warning. Possibly even erasing her memory afterward.

Yes, that's very messed up, and Harry felt an impulse to line up all the most influential purebloods and guillotine them all when he heard about it. I don't find it at all impossible to believe, though (from a social perspective; obviously the magical memory erasure isn't real).

I found it difficult to believe, because Harry's reflections presented Wizarding Britain to be some sort of medieval feudalist wasteland with rich and important Scions of Noble Houses versus the defenseless peasants. That's some Indy!Harry schlock right there, since magic allows wizards to be self-sufficient, and their society doesn't need a peasant class to farm the land, or knights to defend it.

#+begin_quote
  And in the slowed time of this slowed country, here and now as in the darkness-before-dawn prior to the Age of Reason, the son of a sufficiently powerful noble would simply take for granted that he was above the law, at least when it came to some peasant girl.
#+end_quote

From HBP:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "There are no wizarding princes," said Lupin, now smiling. "Is this a title you're thinking of adopting? I should have thought being the 'Chosen One' would be enough."
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

The Statute of Secrecy was put into place in 1692, well past the age of feudalism, and up until then, wizards lived in and shared the same society as muggles - they weren't some backwards Amish enclave or Polynesian cargo cult tribe, but were fully integrated with the society of the time. Look at Nearly Headless Nick, or Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, a courtier to King Henry VII.

Wizards are also aware of, and many are guided by muggle/Christian humanist morality. Draco in the books mentions "Saint Potter", or says, "God, this place has gone to the dogs". Wizards honor their dead with Bible verses and revere the power of willing sacrifice, Lily for Harry, and Pettigrew's flesh for Voldemort. Murder is abhorred because it creates a crack in the soul, and mutilation of the soul is treated as a violation of nature.

This is why HPMOR's depiction of a backwards society guided by an alien blue-and-orange sense of morality doesn't feel believable to me, in terms of story and worldbuilding. Chapter 7 itself is an example of it being deliberately pushed to shock muggle sensibilities. It could be handwaved by explaining that HPMOR's HP universe is a complete AU, but then it's no longer a "rational take" on Harry Potter, just a strawman device for Rational Harry to conquer with his gigantic megabrains.

************ That's a reasonable take on it; thanks for the thought you've put in.

Of course, Harry doesn't need to be correct about things being mediaeval-esque, in order for the son of a Death Eater to think it's ok to commit horrible crimes against people you oppose or don't like. Whatever the social order actually looks like, it's canon that the Death Eaters had that kind of attitude. And if not for the fact that it's at least partly a children's series, it would be rather unrealistic to have a group of terrorists who consider a segment of the population to be property/exploitable, have access to mind-controlling magic, and /don't/ rape anyone.

So you may be correct that the Wizarding world isn't really mediaeval, and yet it may also be realistic for eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy to intend to commit rape later in life.

******** There were other ways to show Draco was a very bad boy than bringing rape threats into it. The way it's used is more for shock value and edgelording than making actual sense.

Because rape threats don't even make sense for wizard culture, when physical strength between genders is and never was an issue. As a result, wizard society, unlike muggle society, has no extended history of wizards oppressing witches by forcing them to stay in the kitchen. I mean, Rowena and Helga were treated as equals to Salazar and Godric back in 990 AD, and no one ever tries to dispute that 1000 years later.

This doesn't mean that rape doesn't happen, but the way Draco talks about it as means of punishment and a display of power over someone weaker doesn't compute.

Because the way it's used in the fic is a reflection of muggle sensibilities, and meant to shock our muggle sensibilities, than being representational to the culture of the wizarding world.

#+begin_quote
  Sexual violence is an aggressive act. The underlying factors in many sexually violent acts are power and control, not, as is widely perceived, a craving for sex. Rarely is it a crime of passion. It is rather a violent, aggressive and hostile act used as a means to degrade, dominate, humiliate, terrorize and control.

  Although sexuality and aggression are involved in all forms of sexual violence, *sex is merely the medium used to express various types of non-sexual feelings such as anger and hostility* towards women, as well as a need to control, dominate and assert power over them.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/guidelines_chap2.pdf][Source: World Heath Organization.]]

In our world, rape and sexual violence are used as /tools/, a medium, for rapists to express power over their victims.

In the wizarding world, this doesn't necessarily have to be the case, when wizards are afforded plenty of other avenues to gain control and assert dominance over their victims. There are hexes and jinxes, forced Legilimency, forced Transfiguration (remember how Hermione threatened Rita Skeeter by trapping her in a bottle, remember how Fake Moody turned Draco into a bouncing ferret and all the kids laughed at him), Cruciatus, long-term curses like what Voldemort placed on the Gaunt Shack or DADA job, or snapping or stealing someone's wand (remember Lucius's humiliation and emasculation when Voldemort took his wand to prevent the Priori Incantatem effect with Harry).

To jump straight to rape as a tool for humiliation makes more sense for the muggle world than the wizarding world. Where it /would/ be believable was Draco using that scene to demonstrate his rapist tendencies in particular, rather than how it was used, which was presenting Draco as an generic ego-tripping edgelord.

I know the WHO says this, but it feels rather like armchair psychology to me. Or at least "this is the politically correct answer" psychology.

"Men rape because they want to feel power over women, no other reason. Ignore the negative correlations with the availability of porn, or what you'd expect the reason to be. And because there's other ways to demonstrate power once you have magic, that means rape would go away entirely."
