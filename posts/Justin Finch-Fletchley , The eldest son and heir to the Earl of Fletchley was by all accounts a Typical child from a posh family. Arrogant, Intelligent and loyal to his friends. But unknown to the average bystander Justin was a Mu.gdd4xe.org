He was a young Muggleborn aristocrat about to enter a world of Magic and pompous purebloods that wouldn't know a true aristocrat if they walked up and bit them on the ass .

As Viscount Finchmont , Heir to the Earl of Fletchley , Justin makes it his personal mission to troll the hell out of Draco Malfoy and the bigots at Hogwarts.

The purebloods don't know what to make of the posh Muggleborn with a Signet ring ,a family crest, and blood so blue it makes The Queen look like a common blacksmith.

Justin Finch-Fletchley together with Harry Potter , Hermione Granger and the other Muggleborns troll the hell out of the purebloods and drive the bigots up the wall by being more aristocratic then Malfoy could ever hope to be. ( they wear boaters to cross the black lake ).

( Before you downvote me into Oblivion this is Crack with and extra side of Trolling in the extreme , pinky fingers out people, Its time to out Aristocrat the purebloods to the point of the ridiculous)

** 100% would have done this if I was a muggle born. I'd love to read it. It's so realistic. You have a kid down for the posh of posh schools that even us Americans know that it is super special. There is no way that kid doesn't up the entitlement and get the other muggle born/half bloods who live in the muggle world into this. Just imagine, "You still use a quill, how common. My family can afford the best, check out my mont blanc fountain pen. Just don't touch it, it's /gold/."

** "I'll have you know mudblood, that my family has been in England for 900 years!"

Justin just raised an eyebrow and despite being seated, looked /down/ on Malfoy in such a way the Slytherin did not notice the boy's gesture stopping Susan Bones from hexing him bloody for the offense.

"Nine Hundred Years? How quaint. /My/ family has been here since before Hadrian built his wall" he then snorted in such a way that made the gesture refined "You fancy yourself nobility don't you Draco? Walking around like a peacock, boasting of the paltry change you call a fortune and thinking you are better because your family appears on some list curated by some dumb inbred ponce trying to garner favor and gold from the other inbred ponces who managed to be even dumber"

He ignored Draco's reddening face and the sniggers and chuckles around them as if they weren't even there.

"I will tell you in what list you /don't/ appear. The list of recognized peerages in the Commonwealth. I also never had the displeasure of seeing your ugly countenance in any of the Crown's Events, though I guess with the way you are so absurdly incompetent you wouldn't even be worthy of serving the food, much less /attending/"

Now people were outright laughing he saw Hermione trying to hold it in while Ron's eyes were tearing up and his face was as red as his hair.

He decided to give the coup the grace.

"Do you know who actually /is/ on the list?" he gestured to chuckling Harry and to the surprise of many, Hermione.

"Harry here is going to be the Earl of Kent, because his ancestors knew better and instead of inbreeding until producing something like, well, /you/, they made important connections and gathered influence from nobility on both sides, and Hermione's cousin is a Lord Judge and very fond of her"

Draco's red was now turning purple.

"And we have some three or four first-generation wizards or witches here who will be peers of England and have a /real/, recognized title, and they are also richer than you, but, like any good nobles, they don't strut around boasting like a drunk bard in a comfort house.

He sighed.

"So, Draco /Mal/foy, before you think of filling everyone's ears with the drivel of your family's /imagined/ nobility, do some research, don't worry even commons like you can do it in a public library, if you can read of course"

There was open laughter from almost everyone around, even the Slytherins were chuckling, Draco couldn't take it anymore and with a snarl pulled his wand, but Susan Bones was much faster and stunned him before he could even get it out of his robes.

*** The Malfoys aren't imaginary nobles, though. Armand Malfoy was granted land and title by William the Conqueror and one of his descendants was high enough in English society to court Queen Elizabeth I. The Malfoys would also have been disgustingly rich to buy the loyalty of many high-placed Ministry officials. Also, don't ever make nearly every Muggle-borns plus Harry aristocrats, that is cringe on so many levels and very unrealistic.

**** Rich != Noble

Not nearly every Muggleborn, I meant 3 or 4 in the /entire/ school, all the years, which I imagine having close to a thousand students or more. Plus Justin could be just taking the mickey at Draco.

Disgustingly Rich for Wizards may be a pauper compared to Billionaires and old nobility with modern investments.

And Elizabeth I's rule was marked by the large number of marriage proposals she received.

Also, many of the titles granted in those times lost themselves, and the Malfoys stopped attending muggle society after the Statute(as in almost half of their time in England), it's not that far away to say they simply are not considered nobles anymore.

** linkffn(The Perils of Innocence)\\
Not sure if you're familiar with this one, but it centers around Harry and Hermione growing up in a Group home and learning to control their accidental magic there before they know what it is.\\
In a later chapter, the Malfoys and Finch-Fletchy's meet at some event or other, and its Lucius that tries to bully Justins father, but he's having none of that nonsense. "15th century? Psh. The Fletchy part of Finch-Fletchy goes back to at /least/ William the Conquerer. Also when was the last time a Wizard was in the Queens Court or Parliament, or..."\\
Justin trolls a bit here and there when they get to Hogwarts.\\
(the chapter in question, btw is Chapter 22).

#+begin_quote
  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

*** I always see the wizards as very small-townish. Ie, where the mayor of the small town deems himself as extremely important, same with the one dr in town, the police captain etc.

In the greater scheme of things, they are only known and important to a small fraction of the greater population, but in their own minds they are sooo important.

I grew up in a small town, and this seems so familiar.
