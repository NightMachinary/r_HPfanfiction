** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4098039/1/Harry-Potter-The-Fifth-Element][Harry Potter & The Fifth Element]] is good, if you don't mind H/Hr. Honestly, I read about 55 chapters in and stopped, but that was mostly because I lost interest in the story, and not any lack of quality. I would definitely suggest it.

I've also enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]], which is an interesting mix of Harry Potter and Ender's Game. I was actually really hesitant to pick this one up, but after I started reading, I didn't stop until I went through it all.

Vanity is also fantastic. It's basically HBP from Hermione's point of view. I will give you a heads up that For the Potion Master's Amusement is a BDSM heavy fic, but it is very well written. I know not everyone is into that sort of thing. I can also link fics that are in progress that are being updated frequently if anyone is interested.

What better way to do it than with a Theater competition featuring students and staff of Hogwarts acting out Phantom of the Opera starring (who else??) but Severus Snape as the Phantom and Hermione Granger as Christine! Silly, but a fun read. Actually quite well written.

Draco schemes to get his father back on top of the wizarding world. Features Hermione Granger as a striptease artist. Very funny! I love this story and have read it many times.

** I will always recommend Minisinoo as a top-notch writer. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/106720/Minisinoo]]

Finding Himself is Cedric/Hermione, very long and quite wonderful. There's an unfinished sequel as well, really bummed me out she never finished it.

Her Aorist Subjunctive series is Harry/Cedric, and also quite good. First one is a time travel story of how Harry saves Cedric, and all the rest follow that AU.

Min's Cedric is who I think of when I think of Cedric.

Edit: apparently Aorist Subjunctive isn't on ff.net so here's another site with her work, downloadable as multiple eBook formats as well: [[http://amalthia.mediawood.net/ebooks/viewseries.php?seriesid=29]]
